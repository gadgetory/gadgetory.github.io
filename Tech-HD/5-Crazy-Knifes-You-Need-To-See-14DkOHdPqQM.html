cooking should be a joy it's more than
just a means to a meal it's a tangible
experience it's a chance to create to
decompress to connect it doesn't take
special training to find joy in cooking
at home no matter where you're starting
anyone can make a meal they're proud of
ask any chef and they'll tell you the
most important tool in the process is
your chef's knife I'm not a professional
chef but I love to go I love cooking at
home for friends and family and over the
years I've found how much more enjoyable
it is when I have the right tools this
is especially true when it comes to
having a really great chef's knife what
you do in the kitchen mostly involves
your chef's knife all the prepping
cutting slicing and all that stuff it
can feel like a chore if you've got a
crummy knife whereas when you've got a
really good chef's knife
it feels good you look forward to it to
help bring joy back to the kitchen we
spent the last two years creating what
we believe is the best chef's knife in
its class the Concours chef's knife
it all starts with the court we wanted
to make an incredibly sharp knife that
would stay sharp for a long time without
sharpening that's why we chose to use
Austin still produced only in Savanna
Japan known the world over versatility
to hold an edge next we focus on balance
a well balanced knife will feel like an
extension of your hand you'll instantly
notice the way the knife seems to know
what you want it to do in fact Kahn in
Japanese means intuition or six cents
and we named it that because we wanted a
blade that would do exactly what you
wanted and of course we wanted this
knife to be beautiful
the Austin Kors clad between sixty six
layers of Damascus stainless steel and
is paired with your choice of beautiful
dark ebony wood or an extremely durable
g10 composite handle once we had a
design we were happy with we gave the
Concours chef's knife to some
professionals to put it to the test and
get their feedback
I like the tom knife because it's very
meticulously balanced it has a great
rocker action on it razor sharp and very
easy to maintain so I've been used in
the concours chef knife for about a
month now
I haven't had to sharpen it at all I'll
take it to the hone every day on it
every day but State is really sharp
feels great in the hand it's a really
comfortable mat to use weighted
beautifully this knife sharp when it
once holds its edge it doesn't need a
lot of maintenance
it was extremely sharp which is what we
want you could take you take that super
ripe tomato and just slice it paper-thin
slices stand them at the the daily grind
that I have to go through working with
this thing in my hand all the time the
way it fits the way it balances the way
it's sharp it's a pretty cool knife we
really want to get people back into the
kitchen and enjoy the benefits of home
cooking
now maybe you'll eat a little healthier
save some money but it's all about
cooking and sharing a piece of you with
the people that you love there's no
better way to build relationships than
sharing a good meal together
but we really need your help Boston
still is only produced in suvamay Japan
by placing a large enough order we'll be
able to bring down the cost on these
knives a knife like this would normally
cost hundreds of dollars but by cutting
out the middleman and going directly
through Kickstarter we'll be able to get
this knife into as many hands as
possible because we want you to love the
way you cook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
