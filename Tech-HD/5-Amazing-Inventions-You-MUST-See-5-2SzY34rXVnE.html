object a plastic part a little rough
around the edges visible layer lines in
the surface that's the nature of
extrusion based technology and what sets
apart a treaty printed object from a
mass-produced plastic part but little
refinement but what if you could easily
eliminate the layers and smooth the
surface of your printed part achieving a
high gloss finish without a moment of
elbow grease we are proud to introduce
our most innovative filament to date and
our brand new desktop machine to work in
tandem available in a wide variety of
colors this new filament has a vast
range of applications across many
different industries poly smooth is
soluble in isopropyl alcohol when a poly
smooth model is placed into the polisher
an ultrasonic nebulizer creates a fine
mist in the chamber each particle of
mist is typically five to ten microns in
diameter so a very even coat of IPA is
applied to every nook and cranny of your
model the particles then start melting
the surface of the model smoothing the
layers and your model is transformed in
a matter of minute
you can use holy smooth on any desktops
3d printer like all other folly maker
filaments police moves in easy to work
with and prints very well you can get
fine details with good interlayer
adhesion print complex geometries with
poly smooth impressive bridging
capability poly smooth support is also
very easy to remove and once polished
there is no scar left on the surface
throughout the whole process of bringing
our first hardware product to market we
utilize 3d printing focusing firstly on
function over form we fine-tuned our
early prototypes to get the best user
experience at the desktop machine until
finally our designers could bring the
polisher to life with our minimal design
and intuitive interface we designed the
polisher be a simple and intuitive as
possible to operate the polisher just
twist the dial set the time alongside
the main operating dial the polisher
features three buttons for power opening
and closing and the chamber lighting
we've built in some really cool lighting
effects into the polisher there's
dimmable white chamber lights that
illuminate your model there's also a
multicolored never laser light which can
cycle through 15 colors or you can set
it to your preferred illumination the
sleek design of the polisher allows it
to fit harmoniously in any environment
place your polisher next to your printer
for professional own desktop fabrication
or user to achieve those finishing
touches in the university project we
simply provide you with the necessary
tools how you choose to apply the
Punisher is up to you the maker
with our last Kickstarter campaign we
promised we would relentlessly innervate
and we carry the same honor today with
presenting our latest products our goal
is to make 3d printing more functional
and accessible for everyone by
constantly pushing the boundaries of
extrusion based technology we can drive
this industry forward for the first time
you can print without layers creating a
truly finished part that can rival the
surface finish of mass production in
minutes say goodbye to the rough layers
and hello to this new glossy future so
please back out campaign and unlock your
desktop printer to this new realm of 3d
printing
you
everything now moves at thundering speed
and our cities careers and lives aren't
slowing down this pace and power of
technology has given us great mobility
but we've stopped feeling connected we
text tag post an email but most
importantly we call so cutting through
the noise to hear someone has meant
being tethered to your phone tangled in
your earbuds or being distracted by your
surroundings until now meet ripple buds
the smartest wireless earbud with an
in-ear microphone that lets you clearly
capture your voice from inside your
eardrum using state-of-the-art noise
blocking technology ripple buds creates
a two-way path for sound waves that lets
you both here and speak with just a
single but as sound waves travel from
your body to your mouth they also exit
through the eustachian tube in the
eardrum here ripple buds captures and
transmits this sound to your caller
before it can be interfered with why the
sound waves around you this also means
that your smartphone's voice recognition
services such as Siri will have less
interference when trying to present
commands resulting in improved
functionality thanks to the wireless
design you can commute drive exercise
and perform any normal task without
distraction the audiophile quality sound
will make sure your favorite music
podcasts and soundtracks are always
crystal clear during your morning run
and to ensure your ripple buds are
always ready for important calls you can
charge them remotely with the compact
on-the-go recharging capsule that fits
right in your pocket
after years of research and development
a repo busting finally developed this
new generation your BOTS we already have
a working prototype all we need is some
capital to bring this great product help
us cut through the noise by pre-ordering
ripple buds today and sharing the
campaign with your friends and family
because it's time to stop shouting and
start hearing with ripple buds
Oh
you
Oh
you
the need to discover uncharted
territories traveling to unreachable
places it has driven the human race to
start the most important quest in human
history has been a challenging journey
with ups and downs through the harshest
of conditions but out of it okay okay
that's enough Morgan so I'm marking me
and my friends love to travel explore
and get to remote places where relaxing
is ours most of the time that's why they
spent several months experimentally
protecting the design of our you product
until we got it just right you believe
it will completely change the way people
relax worldwide let us introduce the
Kaiser original I like those heavy bulky
fold up chairs the Kaiser is extremely
comfortable a snap set on the news and
folds up in a small lightweight bag so
it's super easy to carry since the
Kaiser is so strong and durable you'll
be able to relax at all sorts of places

long hiking trips hanging out at the
beach in the park to sunbathe in your
backyard and of course at your favorite
outdoor festival also if you enjoy
meeting interesting new people you'll
love Kaiser because it's a magnetic
conversation starter Isaac will truly
make you feel like a king the Kaiser is
made with the strongest super
lightweight parachute fabric it has a
stretch pocket on the side so you don't
have to put your drink on the ground and
on the other side there's a double
pocket so you can conveniently store all
of your books later and phone we've also
included a small loop to securely skate
your riser to the ground and of course
it comes equipped with a bottle opener
for those relaxing barbecues in the
summer time and it even floats on water
so you can even use it to chill in the
pool we need your help to fund our first
production what are you waiting for see

universe as the little kids drift away
the big kids come out to play
being a father of two wonderful kids
I've come to realize that children grow
up fast so I made it my mission for them
