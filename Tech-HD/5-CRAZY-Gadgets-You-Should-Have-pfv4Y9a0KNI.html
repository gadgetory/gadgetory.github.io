get 1440 minutes in a day why is it that
we get to the end of the day and feel
like we wasted it or worse
don't feel accomplished in what we spent
our time on we often think if I only had
more time but the truth is we have more
than enough time it's how we use our
time that makes the difference
introducing tempo tempo is the world's
first adjustable hourglass a traditional
tool redesigned for modern life of
notifications constant demands and
distractions engineered to make you more
productive and focused and I'm Alan and
we are the co-founders of best self CO
we launched the self journal our first
productivity tool on Kickstarter in 2015
since then we've helped hundreds of
thousands of people leverage time and
achieve their goals over the past few
years we've learned to master time we
find things that worked and we find
things that really didn't work but the
thing that made the most difference is
when we just became intentional with
where we were spending our time we love
productivity but we also love
beautifully designed products and armor
back on Kickstarter with a tool that
combines both form and function there's
a link between success fulfillment and
how you spend your time we began
exploring digital options but we
realized nothing compares to the proven
psychological effects of physically
seeing time Pasi by
we designed a custom mechanism to make
tempo adjustable so you can track
multiple lengths of time plus a built-in
reset so no need to wait before starting
over meet with Vic hand-blown
borosilicate glass temple blends form
with function to help you get into deep
focus the adjustable hourglass combines
the elegance of a traditional timer with
the function of a digital timer master
time so you can get more from your
minutes using tempo becomes an everyday
ritual whenever you start a new task or
activity simply choose your duration and
stay focused if you need to end early
hit the quick reset button or turn tempo
over when the sand runs out get more
done with tempo using the Pomodoro
Technique break your day into 25-minute
Sprint's follow each focus sprint with a
5 minute break or use tempo to
disconnect and give yourself space to
think set the timer to read for 25
minutes journal for 15 or meditate for 5
uninterrupted tempo protects your
attention maximizes your time and puts
you in control of your day use tempo to
produce your best work for your workout
or yoga routine or to take quality time
for yourself
tempo isn't just about maximizing your
productivity tempo is for the ones who
want more time for the things that
matter for the ones who want to think
big while enjoying today and for the
ones who work hard play hard and make
each day count
we can't wait to put tempo in your hands
but we're not there yet we've got a
prototype perfected and our
manufacturing partners in place the only
thing that's missing is you so if you
