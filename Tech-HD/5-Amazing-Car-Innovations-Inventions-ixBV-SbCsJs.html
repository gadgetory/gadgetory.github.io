wheels of a stuck car and using anything
around us like kitty litter a piece of
plywood even a shovel just to get out of
it
traction mat is a better solution one
that's small enough to keep in your
trunk just in case and one that you can
use without needing the help of a friend
or a random person on the street the
linked treads give tires the traction
needed to get moving on rocky icy or
even muddy terrain founder Megan edge
found herself in this very common but
less than ideal situation I designed
this mat because a few years ago I was
driving with my children on a snowy road
and I slid on the ice into a ditch I had
a traction mat in the car and it was a
traditional traction mat that opens
three ways it's stiff and I put it under
the car got back in the car started the
car and still couldn't get out the
bigger problem was there was a small
rock and it cracked the traction mat and
then unfortunately the tire the momentum
of the tire actually created a
projectile out of the traction mat and
it flew out from beneath my car
traction mats innovative links make it
flexible so it hugs the ground way
better than those stiff mats or even
that piece of plywood which to be honest
can be a real dangerous solution unroll
the traction mat under your tire
depending on if the car has rear or
front wheel drive and simply drive over
it the thick rugged plastic is designed
so it won't crack or split while it
maintains a secure grip on the ground
you'll be on your way in no time
you

med C case is bulky and inconvenient the
backside of the case has four velcro
pads to keep it inside your car's trunk
and prevent meds from a shaken together
with our team we've examined most major
emergencies that can occur to any of us
moreover I've seen those situations and
truly know how important it is to have
all the necessities and how vitally
valuable is time that's why we've
decided to create the most complete
functional solution and we call it
medicine
this is the automatic ice and snow chain
entertained the system mounts up to the
axle of the truck or the suspension and
when the drivers are driving down the
road and they need traction they just
flip a switch on the dashboard and the
chain oil drops down against the tire
and starts to rotate and spins the
chains under the tire giving instant
traction to the vehicle the key
advantages of this is you save time and
money when you're driving when you're
driving time is money so it's important
that the customers keep moving they also
don't take risks when they're driving
when they get off of the snowpack or the
ice to simply flip the switch again and
then chain is retracted up out of the
way and they can keep continue driving
without stopping it's it's critical when
you're in snow and icy conditions that
you have if you're playing safe you have
instant traction a lot of drivers will
take risks if they don't have an
interchange system on there they think
to themselves well I can make it through
without stopping I hate getting out in
the cold but they're taking risks also
if they hit black eyes they don't have
time to stop you can't stop on black eye
so with it with instituting you simply
flip the switch chain comes down against
the tire and gives you traction in one
and a half seconds and you're on your
way I've had many customers give
testimonials of being able to straighten
out their vehicle on black ice or snow
and save their vehicle
it's a really really neat system and
it's just real simple to use
imagine never having to use your keys to
start your car imagine having the
ability to set schedules to start your
car even before you wake up on those
cold winter mornings you no longer need
to fear walking to your car after work
