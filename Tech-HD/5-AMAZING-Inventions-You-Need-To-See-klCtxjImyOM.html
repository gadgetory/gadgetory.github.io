don't achieve the performance we're
capable of to lack of feedback to
preventable injuries we coach you to get
the best out of your run meet run v your
next-generation running wearable 30 tube
sensors measure your activity where it
happens
driving audio and visual feedback in
real time run D analyzes your running
technique and coaches you towards a
better running performance there's no
visible or bulky clip-ons to compromise
your training or style run V fits into
your regular running shoes so you'll
forget they're even there the live view
gives you more control over your
movement run a baseline and run D will
tailor a training plan to your
individual technique hi mo today we'll
work on reducing your impact let's go
run V builds a complete profile of your
biomechanics bringing the advanced
metrics out of the lab and into your
running shoes your power is too high for
this fee
Ronde features power measurement guiding
you to run further and faster run D
recognizes when you're close to fatigue
or injury warning hard impact detected
and give simple actionable feedback for
immediate improvement take quieter steps
and straighten your back
great let's keep this going in this
laboratory we have very precise methods
to capture the movement of runs at the
same time we can measure the forces that
are acting on their bodies and when we
combine these information we can use
computer models to measure the load and
experience by their muscles their
tendons and their bones from this we can
give very precise information regarding
their running technique the footwear
that they should use or additional work
hours that are needed to keep them
healthy the idea with the sole was to
get a similar product and make that
available to run us during every run
they perform the sole makes the latest
innovations in training signs and
running biomechanics easily accessible
you can science up your run interview
as you progress through your training
plan it continuously optimizes with your
improvements focusing on the goals and
metrics that matter to you
great run today moe your impact has
reduced on your training plan has been
optimized run V is ready to hit the
ground running back us on Kickstarter
today so you can experience the running
performance you're truly capable of
I used to feel very stressed very tired
as well I would wake up and I would hit
this nipple or a million times but I
almost failed a couple of my classes
because I slept in I usually have to set
like 20 different alarms every five
minutes to wait God one thing I want to
do is wait at 7 o'clock
every time I try to do that I'll just
hit the snooze button after helping
thousands of people wake up on time with
the shot clock we're back on IndieGoGo
to help you start your morning right
with the shot clock - no one likes being
rushed stressed and late in the morning
what if there was a better way to start
your day along with us zap vibrate and
beep alarms to wake you up we've
combined brand new and improved
technology including automatic sleep
tracking morning ritual routines new
shutoff modes and an accountability
system so your friends and family can
help you stay on track shot-clock two
features brand new ways to make sure
that you wake up solve math problems to
turn your brain on and your alarm off
with new wakeup math scan a QR code in
another room so you get up out of bed
and get moving automatic sleep tracking
knows when you're awake
and it knows when you go to sleep so we
can automatically begin tracking the
quality of your sleep wake you up in
your lightest stage asleep and not
disrupt any stage of the process
shock clock 2 also comes with a brand
new padlock sleep course which not only
helps you plan your perfect morning but
gives you all the tips tools and
resources that you need to succeed
one of the biggest requests we've
received from shot-clock users is to
incorporate more social pressure and
accountability in the app if you need a
little help your friends and family can
get involved and give you a little shock
if you hit snooze even better you'll
earn our digital currency volts when you
get to bed on time and wake up on time
I'm Manish Satie founder and CEO of
pavlok come join us and support shot
clock - the only wearable and app
combination guaranteed to help you
reclaim your sleep reclaim your mornings
and reclaim your life I now have a lot
more time in the day to be more
productive I have the time to take a
shower
make a nice breakfast spend some time
hearing the news or listening to a
podcast so anyone else that is like
trying to fill this habit and become
more productive wake up in the early in
the morning earlier I would definitely
recommend getting a padlock just
figuring it out you know whatsapp
Strength is right for them what method
is right for them you know how many
times they want it to go off and just
give it a shot because it really worked
out for me from day one
I pretty much get up right when it goes
off and it's awesome so I don't need my
50 million different backups like I had
always had before breaking the bad habit
of oversleeping by instead of hitting
the snooze get fired button I instead
hit path lock which creates a negative
association hitting the snooze button
which equates to more money somewhere
down the line
in the hand of a maker this is a knife a
screwdriver sandpaper a chisel a marker
anything you want there's no project
that doesn't need it we just created the
best way to carry it everyday everywhere
but it doesn't open bottles if your
finger is in the ring it's like there's
no locking mechanism at all but there is
yeah it doesn't open bottles though it's
a hundred percent waterproof you can use
it with any hand in any condition no
limits or even in case of an emergency
nope it doesn't open bottles
it has perpendicular flat faces a maker
knows what that means
it can mark cut sand shape
car almost anything but it can't open a
bottle
not that you need it to consider time
you can speed it up or you can slow it
down but one thing you can't do is
ignore it everyone watches time
introducing the enlightened timepiece a
new take on this traditional social icon
one of the goals we had in designing
this project was to combine essential
utility with flexible elegance to do
this we incorporated many familiar
elements of a classic timepiece while
leveraging the advantages of
web-connected Hardware super-bright LEDs
make this clock brilliant and beautiful
in full daylight and yet still provide
dimmable ambience for the evening hours
being connected to the cloud means your
time is always perfect it automatically
adjusts for daylight savings and you can
change settings and customize with the
familiarity and simplicity of a
beautifully designed webpage with just a
few clicks you can set the LED ring in
motion customize the colors create
beautiful animations and relaxing moods
the clock begins with a solid one-inch
block of spruce and pine and is then CNC
machined to allow for the 220 LEDs the
acrylic elements and the various
electronic components every clock comes
complete with an elegant desktop stand
and the option for three different
finishes to enhance customization from
your home or office for a truly
one-of-a-kind addition we offer a
completely customized Fock package which
includes your choice of any stain or
color plus we can engrave your favorite
sports team company logo or word art
into the clockface a standout timepiece
that is sure to make a stay
time is essential and light is beautiful
so why not communicate this Universal
essential beautiful</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
