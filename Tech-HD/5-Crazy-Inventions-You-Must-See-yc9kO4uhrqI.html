speak and with that change comes a
constant evolution of capturing devices
go for allowed us to be present in this
world recording her beauty of being
there right in the action drones allows
to take beautiful steady aerial images
from the sky we combine best of both
worlds and creative air air lets you
take aerial videos and photos simply by
throwing your dope
this is how it works start recording or
connect your GoPro to the remote or a
smartphone app now simply snap the GoPro
in slide the two links into each other
and screw them on to the head you can
start shooting we have taken air into
the forest upon the mountains out of no
water into the city and this is just the
beginning
whatever you would like to record with
your velcro air will be ready for it
are you more into photos use births mode
and throw air straight up to take
incredible aerial selfies we also made
sure that air supportable take with you
on your adventures simply put air and
your GoPro into the bag and you're good
to go
hi guys my name is mark and I start out
air with a couple of friends almost a
year ago what started out as a fun
experiment to get our GoPros in the air
without the use of a drone turned out to
be an amazing experience on its own and
the results they look more alive and
dynamic than ever before the feeling you
get when you freely throw your GoPro in
the air is one that we want to share
with everyone and that's why we are
bringing it to you fast for the past
year we sketched modeled and prototype
till we had the perfect design and now
we are ready for mass production the
manufacturing it is all done in the
Netherlands and we are ready to go the
minute we reach our goal we are very
curious to see what you're gonna do it
there step up your GoPro game and back
us today
at magmod our goal is to make awesome
photography easy by taking the tools we
work with and turning them into tools we
want to work with let's face it most
cold shoe amounts you come across just
plain suck with the max you we wanted
something not as clumsy or random as the
cold shoes photographers have had to
deal with for years
no more flimsy uncomfortable
time-consuming knobs latches or brackets
no more settling for something that just
barely works it's time for something
sexy the mag shoe takes that clunky cold
shoe body from basic to baller with its
universal compatibility and ergonomic
shape that feels just right in your hand
with its soft touch silicone light
coating attaching a flash has never been
faster or easier just slide the flesh in
and rotate the switch that's it
wait that's it that's it the comfort
grip knobs are gentle on your hands when
tightening the max you to a stand or
setting up an umbrella plus it's much
faster than those old dinosaurs oh and
that tiny tedious lock on your Flash yep
not even needed the mag shoe puts your
Flash on lockdown you don't have to be
worried about any bumps shakes or
jiggles as a durable custom locking
mechanism was built to tighten your
flesh in and make sure it isn't going
anywhere even when fully loaded with the
mag ring a couple of flashes and the mag
box
this thing is rock-solid a large
squeezable button sits right where you'd
want it letting you easily maneuver the
max you and lock it in quickly at any
angle you choose just squeeze and
release this means anyone can position
it quickly and easily whether it's down
low or up high and you can do it all
one-handed attach it lock it and adjust
it without ever putting your camera down
plus it's no problem to remove the mag
shoot from the stand to go handheld
getting the light at the angle you need
while being more comfortable than ever
before thanks to its elegant design
finally frustration-free shoots thanks
to a cold shoe that works the way you
want it to fast easy awesome
