what really connects a person to the
moment of taking a photograph there's a
shuttle man with an iPhone the virtual
shutter button and the volume keys
simply aren't at the right place and
that's why we designed a patent-pending
mechanism to place the shutter button on
the bottom right side of the phone this
way it feels right when taking pictures
and our hands won't get in the way of
the lens with the snap six with added
lenses to expand the possibilities of
taking photos we've had
Cpl telephoto fisheye and white Plus
macro lens now we're adding two more
into the mix ultra wide angle and
full-frame fisheye snap pro now comes
with interchangeable grips so you can
switch between moments like where you're
on photographer mode all we're just on a
go a new feature is that we use hybrid
materials to protect your iPhone by
adding soft rubber bumper layer on all
sides of the case it now provides them
greater shock absorption to your iPhone
snap Pro has a tripod thread hole
embedded to it so now you can do even
more with your iPhone with this feature
you can set up the tripod and use your
iPhone to take group shots nice views
landscape shots and even time-lapse
videos
introducing the next evolution of the
hyper charger the lithium card Pro hyper
charging evolve why call it the pro as
more and more of our smartphones become
faster with larger and brighter displays
they need more power so we'll need more
battery capacity to keep them powered
throughout the day beyond just adding
more battery capacity we wanted to add
more charging speed and the ability to
charge all USB powered devices plus
carry everything that made the original
lithium card great and do even more
here's how it works just like the
original lithium card using the lithium
card Pro is as easy as 1-2-3 step 1
recharge it simply flip out the USB go
with your card Pro can be recharged with
any USB powered port step 2
plug it pull out the lithium card pros
micro USB to charge it's compatible with
most devices for iOS devices there's
also a lithium card Pro with an apple
lightning connector step 3
power to start the lithium card pros
ultra-fast hyper charging press its
power button just like the original
lithium card
the lithium card Pro has a power bypass
feature it allows you to simultaneously
charge of the lithium card and your
smart phone the pro has additional
advancements that take it a step further
with its exclusive hyper port and sync
capabilities using the blue TM card Pro
easy as 1-2-3 recharge it plug it
power and now with the pro share it as
well as thinking you'll never need to
bring or buy another separate cable or
charger again we kept the credit card
sized form factor but only marginally
increase the thickness our philosophy at
linear flux is function follows form our
R&amp;amp;D team work tirelessly the result is
only twice the thickness but three times
the battery capacity of the original
lithium cover they developed what at the
time seemed to be the impossible with
its 3000 milliamp hour advanced battery
you can now fully charge an Apple iPhone
6 the pro also has computer and
smartphone syncing capabilities what
we're most excited about is the
additional hyper port it allows you to
share hyper charging power with your
friends the pro has a class-leading 3
amp or up to 15 watts of power so much
power that it outperforms the industry
benchmark for wall chargers you may be
asking what's that mean for me here's
how the comparison shows the Apple
iPhone charger versus the lithium card
Pro with its exclusive 3 amp hyper
charging circuitry we will be using an
off-the-shelf USB meter to measure the
amount of amps going into an Apple
iPhone 6 plus the most important number
to know is that the more amps a charger
can provide the faster your phone will
charge which means less time waiting the
Apple iPhone charger provides under one
amp this may have been adequate a few
years ago with older generation iPhones
but the new iPhones can take even more
power in some cases double the power of
the older iPhones double the amount of
power means half the time waiting for a
full charge the pro with its advanced
hyper charging technology provides as
much power as the iPhone can take over 2
amps for an iPhone 6 plus as smartphone
technology advances the pro has been
future-proofed and can deliver up to 30
amps or more than three times the power
of the iPhone charger
this means up to a third of the weight
when charging
ha no no no we are doing it again
hey you there yes you let me ask do you
think for the call from God is a good
reason for you to record your clothes
well I'm sure there are more reasons
than that to record an i phone call you
need internet connection and let's not
talk about external server dependency oh
and by the way it's never free that's
why we invented ich the first iPhone
case in the world that can record your
calls now you can record both incoming
and outgoing calls for freedom always
when we started designing the case we
knew that our biggest challenge was to
ideally position the components for high
quality recordings while keeping the
case slim elegant and doesn't fully let
on what it actually does chick is so
easy to use to start and stop recording
press the top button to playback press
they are the small button you don't have
to worry if the server is reliable
everything you record stays on your SD
card jig can playback your conversation
or upload it into your computer Jake is
ready now all we need is your help to
bring it to the recipe to use
you
welcome to project generation B we ask
that you please through photography to a
minimum as the information you are about
to receive is highly classified are you
tired of forgetting your charger when
you need it most
tired of carrying multiple cords around
to keep connected while charging as you
know it is about to change forever we
present to you the boomerang the world's
first smartphone case with a built-in
retractable charger for the durable 2
foot charging case and premium exterior
finishes the interchangeable boosters
provides additional battery life to keep
you connected on the go whether you're
in a car at the airport buy a laptop or
in the comfort of your home anywhere
there is a USB port you will have charge
this slim one-of-a-kind case comes in
threes stylish colors with seven
different finishes go to boomerang case
: now and join the revolution never be
without your charger again</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
