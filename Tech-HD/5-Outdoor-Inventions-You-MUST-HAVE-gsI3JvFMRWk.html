not an option it's just a matter of when
where and how I've always loved the
outdoors
mountain biking skiing trail running
camping you name it one thing that is
always bugged me is the hassle of
changing in and out of my gear when a
dirty wet or snowy out there balancing
my shoes or using my comments was how
was never a good option that's why I
created the adventure map
it finally makes changing outdoors
simple
the adventure that is a gateway to the
outdoors that allows you to transition
to nature without the hassle the magical
folding design ensures that the dirty
bottom of the map never touches between
top
enjoying the outdoors just got that much
more enjoyable
you
the radiate portable campfire candle
it's easy to light easy to carry around
easy to store and you can rest easy
owning one Bay from 100% recycled
materials they're reusable they're
reusable they're reusable burn cleaner
than would last about eight to ten hours
made in the USA and they're great in wet
conditions
don't waste your time looking for wood
we took care of it
yes it's almost summer but most of us it
means being outside enjoying nature
camping with friends relaxing at beaches
parks or festivals all these places are
fantastic but have one common downside
they tend to put us in these
uncomfortable positions once you sit on
the ground can this be the answer not
really
it's way too bulky for quick and easy
use what we need must be smart so you
can take it wherever you go super
lightweight and made of a special
material so strong that engine is used
in aerospace of aviation a new
generation of background it's called the
back tab
so how does it work
first you have to mount the bathtub
which takes only a couple of seconds
once you lean back the back that will
lift up slightly to fit your back
perfectly you can move your arms freely
and lean comfortable for a long time you
may think now wait a second these sheets
are just four millimeters or 0.15 inches
thick how can it hold a human body well
the material you are looking at is
called glass fiber reinforced plastic or
just GRP just to give you an example of
what this material is capable of
Engineers use it to build helicopter
rotor blades it's extremely strong yet
very light the elasticity of the
material improves the leaning comfort
significantly because makes the back
pipe fitter back even better it also
ensures the slight swing motion which
erases the feeling of leaning against
the heart and stiff object our GRT
sheets are made in a respectable company
located in europe produced by specialist
to master their techniques for more than
70 years to make our back type
convenient as it is we designed with one
of our partners from Europe special
kinds of hinges made out of high quality
stainless steel to fit the back there
perfectly
the cloth as we call them are also made
out of GRP milled by modern CNC machine
to make sure every client defines
decision the tax deal we use is
water-repellent Kia proof and has two
different types one size TTC coded which
prevents the vector from stripping away
and the other side soft and pleasant
optimum serum I can honestly tell you
that me and my team put all our hearts
into creating the backside and now
convince yourself how effective will
change your way of spending free time
outside wherever you are I hope you like
