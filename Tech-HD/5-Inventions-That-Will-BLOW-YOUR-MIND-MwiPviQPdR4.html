smart clean mobile power it's a portable
lithium-ion battery with the world's
most comprehensive array of charging
ports and one of the highest total
energy outputs of almost any storage
solution on the market it's designed for
everybody from outdoor activities and
indoor leisure to industrial
applications and emergency services
River releases you from the shackles of
an outlet so you can power a free life
the unit is equipped with 11 independent
charging ports which can all be used
simultaneously for a total output of 500
watts to put this in perspective that
means you're good power to iPhones to
iPads to MacBooks
a mini-fridge a lantern a drone battery
a mobile Wi-Fi unit and stereo speakers
all at the same time without limiting
the output on any port with the storage
capacity of 416 watt hours rever gives
you more powers than almost any battery
of its time you can jam on your electric
guitar for 20 hours straight or you can
watch a 10 hour marathon of your
favorite TV show by campfire
rivers battery can be recharged in three
different ways a standard outlet or a
car charger can replenish the battery to
full capacity in just eight hours with
eco flows portable solar panels River
can be recharged with absolutely zero
carbon emissions in just 12 hours the
real-time display allows you to monitor
the battery's current output power
remaining capacity and charge time being
a documentary filmmaker a lot of my
shoots happen outside a lot of times our
locations are way out in the middle of
nowhere first time I use River I was
really surprised at how much these
little units can accomplish on location
everything runs on batteries we have to
set up a DI T station a battery charging
station and we could even run our LEDs
when we need extra lights can never have
to worry about the noise and the
pollution of a generator applications
for battery power are endless River
isn't just an accessory it's your power
companion for harnessing clean energy
anywhere so you're free to go everywhere
and by the way this isn't just a concept
river has been tried and tested and as
you can see this entire production has
been lit by River
you
have you ever dreamt of improving your
home with crown molding or refrain when
faced with a tricky business of getting
it right
crown moldings are one of the
architectural features the really add
value to a home they had a visual
presence that makes a home feel more
upscale although until now installing
crown molding has been a task that
strikes fear in the heart of every
amateur carpenter even some
professionals because the molding sits
at an angle on the wall each joint is
made of compound angles and hard to get
rights the biggest problem has always
been cutting the angles rather than the
actual installation the angles in a room
of the shift slightly and very few rooms
have exactly square corners with 90
degrees because it comes out from the
wall it really is a 3d cut not getting
it right makes a time-consuming and
expense it because you get a lot of
waste and that is enough to make you
lose your mind luckily we have a
solution for you one cut is a world
patented measurement tool that lets you
get it right at the first try it makes
no difference whether it's an outer or
inner angle you have to measure you can
keep the instrument up against the saw
for precise cut no more calculations no
complicated settings of the saw no more
trial and error but perfect results each
time without wasted and failed efforts
so say goodbye to ugly gaps and crown
molding joints this handy little tool
will help you take on crown molding
installations along with other molding
projects such as base molding all kinds
of frames and many other woodwork
projects after numerous design
iterations and prototypes we finally
have a fully functional world patented
solution we've worked closely with
industrial leaders to find the best
materials and refine details we have
manufacturers ready the only thing
missing is your support check below for
more information about the projects and
the various reward levels you can only
make one cut of reality if we reach our
goal so please support us now we're
super excited to see what you can create
with one cuts thank you for watching
you
hi I'm Krista and I'm Lisa and these are
our kids Declan Cooper Nana like many
parents our kids provide us with
inspiration every day and like all
parents we want to keep them safe we
developed deca the toddler monitor after
a few shared experiences some funny but
some actually really scary
we both had all of the baby gear
including audio and video baby monitors
but we found that once our kids were
mobile they were no longer meeting our
needs declan's an active kid and when I
put him down for a nap I would sometimes
come back to him outside of his room
gain up to all sorts of trouble I knew I
had a serious problem when I found the
sprinkler in his bed one morning and
realized he'd gone out into our yard
sometime during the night I'm not a
heavy sleeper yet he'd still slept over
house without us knowing this really
scared me I want to always know that he
was where I wanted him to be safe in his
bed Coop's a little monkey and started
climbing out of his crib around 18
months he was constantly getting into
trouble and still is to this day I worry
when we're traveling as it's difficult
to make sure he's safe at his grandma's
house the lake and hotels Kristin I
talked and talked about this challenge
and after some research we realized we
weren't alone this is a problem that
other parents are faced with too there
are hundreds of cases at venues every
year about kids who aren't where their
parents thought they were supposed to be
some of these stories have tragic ends
and we couldn't believe how frequently
this was happening so we decided to
solve the problem ourselves by creating
dekho the toddler monitor a cute and
friendly motion sensor device that is
easily set up and can travel with you
and your family fueled by the
inspiration to keep our kids safe we are
very excited to share him with you and
your family Decco is a motion sensor you
hang on the door hang dekho on your
toddler's bedroom door and set it from
the smartphone using the toddler monitor
app if your toddler tries to leave their
bedroom the device will sense the motion
of the door and send a Bluetooth signal
to your smartphone you will be notified
by the toddler monitor app if there is
movement at the door and you will know
that your toddler is on the move Decco
hangs on any style of doorknob it's
durable and water-resistant made from
food grade bpa-free material
lightweight and travels well it's
controlled by an iPhone or Android app
the app manages up to three toddler
monitors at once from a single
smartphone the app can also be
controlled by up to three users at once
it uses reliable Bluetooth technology
and has an easily replaceable coin cell
battery we're not saying this will solve
all your teeth far from it but it will
give you the peace of mind that comes
with knowing that your child is safe and
sound and where they're supposed to be
Declan come on yeah we're almost there
sweetheart
we are dreamers
we are extraordinary we are innovators
we are leaders the future doesn't just
happen it is created by those with a
vision to change the world
sleep we spend winter our life sleeping
with only deeds and many of us wish we
got married yeah technology which has
transformed so many of our behaviors has
done very little to improve the way we
sleep some would argue that technology
has been worsening sleep I can stand for
I fidelity canopy and will change this
way of thinking back in 2008 I can
become the world's first smart bed ever
conceived
we believe it represented an icon in the
industry this first success give us the
motivation to go back to work and
concentrate all our efforts for the past
years developing a new again that is
much better in every way while designing
a king bed I was thinking about what
kind of experience we could create in
order to reach people lives this
experience is the driving force behind
the design of the product and it comes
to life thanks to technology we name it
our bed I can because it's design
suggests a new interpretation of the
classic canopy creating the ultimate
comfort zone around the bed and
expanding it to a new concept of cocoon
the new icon is much more than a bed
combined with an entertainment system I
can is the first bed integrated platform
based on open-source software every
feature can be tailored to individual
habits because few things are more
personal than the bed environment people
working on Advanced Research in sleep
technology will find I can to be a great
hardware and software framework for the
development of new sleep related
applications the new again is also
easier intuitive to use and will be
provided with amazing new features like
voice control and the health monitoring
application your idea of bath relaxant
dreams and entertainment will never be
the same
you
we're alpine laps and we make products
that allow photographers to see the
world differently
and to capture its most captivating
moments
with the help of people like you we
started building our ideas here on
Kickstarter and five years later we're
excited to introduce spark our most
versatile camera remote yet
one device built for hundreds of
different cameras spark is designed to
go where you go it has three distinct
triggering modes Wireless infrared
traditional wired triggering and app
control the infrared beam sent to your
camera's built-in sensor allows for
ultra quick setup and complete wireless
triggering so that you can get out from
behind the camera and be in your own
photos by plugging spark into your
camera's trigger port you can also use
it like a normal wired trigger and if
you want to quickly set up a time lapse
hold the spark button down count the
number of blinks and you're good to go
for a higher level of control use the
smartphone app it gives you access to
the complete set of spark features
including HDR time long exposures and
bulb ramping time-lapse you can even
control up to 3 cameras at once for
synchronized triggering and with
Bluetooth for technology spark connects
immediately so you can get right to
shooting
we've launched four products on
Kickstarter and last year we released
pulse to give photographers complete
control of their cameras after
delivering to over 12,000 backers we
went back to the drawing board to
explore how we could fuse the power of
app control with the ease and speed of
infrared trigger we wanted something
with extremely long battery life yet
nimble enough that we can always have it
with us so we created spark a device
that is super fast when you need it but
also has the power to take long
exposures time lapses and shoot with
more advanced techniques making hardware
can be challenging but your support on
Kickstarter has allowed us to build some
of the best photography gear available
we love being a part of the crowdfunding
movement and we hope you'll join us on
this next step of the journey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
