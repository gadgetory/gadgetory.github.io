back here with you on Kickstarter so
have you ever done this with your
backpack you don't realize it but your
backpack is straining your shoulders and
back and your neck and hips to a strain
is a stretching or tearing of your
muscles or tendons doing this day in and
day out causes serious damage so it's no
wonder that four out of five people will
suffer back pain and 45% of today's
office workers have neck pain pain that
totally disrupt our lives but it doesn't
have to be this way we've spent the last
year designing the perfect minimalist
and surprisingly effective solution so
today we introduce super straps the
world's first and only backpack booster
that instantly relieves shoulder and
back tension and lifts 27 pounds of
force off your neck
super straps will act as your super
muscle literally making your backpack
feel lighter it improves your posture
when you walk and instantly makes your
everyday backpack
ergonomic we've tested super straps all
year long check out what folks had to
say Wow
what's yeah it feels way more
comfortable it feels like I can actually
like walk around with this without any
strain or like I can run to if I wanted
feels lighter I don't feel as much
wearing care on my shoulders feels a lot
more comfortable I actually I can't
really feel it my backpacks on my back
anywhere definitely feels lighter and
more balanced if that makes sense
I feel like it's like it's almost like
doing my posture for me don't feel
slouchy I feel a little more free in my
back and my neck and my shoulders as
well there's less strain it's great it's
a magic trick because it definitely made
a difference when you put it on so how
does it work
super straps is minimal so when you're
not using it it's sleek behind your
backpack straps it activates in one
second flat and the arc distributes the
force of your backpack on up to five
times the surface area so you feel
instant relief in your back and
shoulders most of us use our necks to
counterbalance the weight in our bags
but even a 15 degree head tilt is like
walking around with a bowling ball on
your neck every single day
super straps fixes this our pulley
system poise the weight in your bag
moving it closer to your spine where you
can carry it ergonomically so you don't
need a slump and hurt your body every
step you take many of us carry two three
even four times the weight doctors
recommend in our packs each day if your
backpack ever feels heavy throwing on a
pair of super straps will give you
instant relief and long-term comfort
I've worn super straps every day for the
past five months and it's a total
GameChanger
so whether you're racing to a meeting
glass or the outdoors imagine feeling
pain free and light walking upright and
confidently able to truly enjoy the
moment

life

completely
we are Houska we create products to help
everybody get the best out of their
kitchens we are here to present the
revolution of home cooking with our
series of cookware the die cast
aluminium pots
frying pans and grills
after the success we had with our
kitchen knives we are ready to raise the
bar and expand our product range to take
the cooking experience to a whole new
level
we started studying the best cooking
technology and after two years of
projecting sampling and testing we are
here now to deliver an unprecedented
product at the fairest price possible
we have chosen diecast aluminium for our
cookware this aluminium is thicker than
other materials making it extremely
resistant it also delivers heat evenly
throughout the pans surface promoting
uniform cooking in less time
the die-casting technology protects the
aluminium and the coating from the
highest temperature extending their
lives and durability
all our products are compatible with all
cooking surfaces including induction in
addition we partnered with top-notch
Swiss brand
ELAC and decided to coat our cookware
with granny tech their highest quality
products to ensure the best performance
with safety for people and the
environment
granny tech is a five layer nonstick
coating reinforced by ceramic particles
able to enjoy any intense you see this
grants a long lifetime abrasion and
corrosion resistance
our pots have been designed to create
the most comfortable experience and in
three sizes depending on how crowded
your kitchen is we have also designed a
practical glass lid with a silicon rim
to save you from heat two different
strainers for draining and a perfect
norm to hold your spoon and avoid
dripping around your kitchen
even the pause handle holders are in
silicon and are detachable Dewey's
cleaning
our sets of two frying pans have
detachable handles designed to be easy
to attach and detach in no time and
facilitate compact storage plus without
the handles you can use them as a baking
tray in the oven and they are even
easier to clean
grill lovers won't be disappointed we
thought about them when designing this
special grill that also comes with the
detachable handle in addition with these
two canals you can easily get rid of all
the excess fat
we have studied every possible detail in
order to produce the definitive set of
cookware for everyone no matter how big
your kitchen is and how much space you
have does quality really have to be
expensive we don't want you to waste
your money for unnecessary expenses like
wholesalers or shops that dramatically
increase the product cost with no real
benefit our formula allows us to offer
the highest quality possible at an
affordable price now we need your
support back this project and we promise
you'll love our products Thank You
Houska a good choice
