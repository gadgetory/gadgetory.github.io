brewed coffee but don't have time to
brew it at home I mean who has time to
think about brewing coffee 12 to 72
hours in advance a cup of coffee should
make your life easier but in reality
making cold brew is a hassle that's why
we made the - rapid cold brew system a
coffee maker that Bruce smooth delicious
cold brew in as little as five minutes
just put in coffee grounds water and
adjust the strength to your liking five
minutes gets a cold brew but if you want
concentrate
crank up the brewing time - 15 minutes
the - cold brew system makes six cups of
coffee in minutes using our
patent-pending called boil technology
cycling water from the craft to the
brewing chamber cold brew extracts the
delicious flavor and caffeine from
coffee while eliminating some fatty
acids and very oils that aren't hot
coffee this makes it easier on your
digestive system and gives it a smoother
taste cold brew may go down smooth but
watch out this is some powerful stuff
you should dilute the concentrate with
milk or water we wanted to make cold
brew faster and more affordable we don't
have to tell you that cold brews
expensive but we did the math anyway and
a cup of day will cost you over a
thousand dollars a year with our rapid
cold brew system you can make a cup with
gourmet beans for about 30 cents if you
love cold brew just don't pay for itself
within two months regular hot coffee
goes bad if it's been sitting out too
long because hot water speeds up the
oxidation process
cold brew coffee just last longer so
after you're done brewing put the carafe
in the fridge and enjoy quick and easily
called brew over the next week our team
has been working hard to develop the -
rapid cold brew system we have a proven
track record of delivering innovative
products in 2016 we created the pancake
bot and with overwhelming support from
the IndieGoGo community we successfully
launched the so bro coffee table which
is shipping in September we're excited
to finally bring you the - rapid cold
brew system this isn't a far-fetched
idea we finalized the design and we have
our manufacturing partners in place all
we need is your help to start production
and begin shipping to you so please back
us today and be one of the first to get
a taste of the good stuff with the -
rapid cold brew system
introducing Kappa an innovative 3d
printer designed to give you an

nozzle to the bed the result a large
build volume with the small footprint
print more with less the modular design
requires simple assembly and can be
completed in a few minutes
this modularity keeps kapa compact for
easy storage the customized mold and CNC
milling process used to produce the
aluminum unibody tower ensures our
technical specifications are met exactly
every time incorporating a detachable
bed makes print removal effortless and
has eliminated the need to recalibrate
the machine after each use working out
of the National University of Singapore
