you're watching this video you're
probably breathing right now you know
it's not great
congestion not breathing properly hurts
look at this guy holding his eyes he's
trying to tell you that he's congested
and aches all over
we even had encircles behind him to
emphasize his pain good job circles if
you suffer from congestion you have two
options stop breathing which is not
really an option or uses steam device
yes those blender looking things they're
big too big to carry everywhere and
maintain a constant treatment meet a via
a steam device with two main advantages
it uses nanoparticles for the most
effective sinus allergy and congestion
treatment and it's portable
what's nano steam it's steamed downsized
to the smallest particles possible
while a typical steam inhaler produces
thick particles of steam that cannot
penetrate through the walls of the nose
into the sinuses obvious nanoparticles
are less than 5 microns these micro
particles can easily penetrate beyond
the nasal walls and into the sinus
cavities clearing everything that stops
you from getting your best breathing in
just 10 minutes you'll be breathing
clearly all you need to do is add saline
at just the temperature and then place
the nozzle under your nose here's the
guy from before after he used often now
he's showing you that he's breathing
great nose circles around him manage
thanks to obvious adjustable temperature
controls
you feel your steam needs to be warmer
than we'll just adjust it and since a
via is small enough to fit any back and
it's also chargeable you can take it and
use it anywhere breathe clearly in the
office and the park breathe as you bike
yeah you can go back to doing sports
because a via is light enough to carry
anywhere besides a clearing congestion a
via can be used orally to humidify the
vocal cords damp in a dry throat or just
improve breathing in general outlook a
surfer guy he doesn't have any
congestion just wants to breathe better
obvious created by poor emetic a
long-standing company the field of
respiratory devices in its essence a via
is patent pending tech created with the
components of an already working system
but measured down to a portable
easy-to-use all-around perfect device so
if you to feel that better breathing can
improve your life get up
yes
can I drink it now no ok drinking out

hi I'm here to share with you some tips
on how to use your touch points basic
when you get your kit you'll have two
touch points inside first you need to
decide which touch point is going to be
your leave device simply use the button
on the top to turn that device on when
the green light comes on you'll know
that it's on it's important that you
choose right away which setting you'd
like to use if you turn your device on
and then use blue you'll get to your
sleep setting toggle it again to get to
green which is the setting for calm and
a third time to get to the setting for
anger in order to now pair the devices
you're simply going to turn on your
second device with a green light turn
the window so they face each other the
second device will pick up the signal
from the first device you'll know your
touch points are properly working when
you feel a gentle vibration on the right
side of your body and then the left side
of your body
