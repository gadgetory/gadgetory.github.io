highways some eyeshadow through the sun
rays and
I phoned away melodies we haven't played
I don't know
I go in around these walls to create a
song
we'll go through the wastelands through
the highways through my shadow through
the sunrays and
we'll probably number if you burn time
to see the horizon turn us to sow
and will grow in number if you see the
we'll go
