the freedom of using your bike loves
going for an adventure through the
forest or takes pleasure in going for a
ride on the sunny day then you know to
be an efficient biker you need to be
organized thankfully veljko has created
the wing barn the wing bar is a smart
handlebar connected to your smartphone
with the wing bar you'll never get lost
anymore thanks to its turn-by-turn
navigation system the wing bar can guide
you through any adventures by the
blinking of its lights connected to your
smartphone this easy and safe navigation
tool will tell you when to turn left
right go backwards or even if someone is
trying to call you as we all know bike
theft is a major problem in many cities
and getting your bike stolen is not
exactly what you had in mind that's why
we created a global GPS solution in case
of theft you will get an immediate alert
on your phone and will be able to track
its location on a very precise scale
thanks to the dedicated wink app you
simply need to identify yourself using
Bluetooth or attack that's it
now you're free to control your bike via
your smartphone and if by chance you
can't remember where you park your bike
the app gets you straight to it the
Hwang Bart is also a fitness tracker
that will give you a summary of your
ride even in the darkness you can show
up it integrates smart powerful
headlights which will help you to be
seen by others and as we know that you
care about the style of your bike we
designed two different types of
handlebars to meet your expectations
today we can provide the best technology
on the market because it is firmly
attached to your bike making any bike
smart look no further the wing bar is
here hi my name is Johnny Smith
co-founder and most importantly bike
lover I bike almost everywhere I go and
realize just how much more efficient my
rights could be with a smart navigation
system so along with my talented team
tRNA and homo Savalas we decided to
create link to enhance your biking
experience after two years of research
and prototypes and months of intensive
testing with many bikers we are now
happy to say that wink is ready for you
all we needed your help to put link into
production and make it a reality for
bikers everywhere
Don us today on IndieGoGo thank you
you
and like except this is the micro mill
3-axis desktop milling machine
controlled by your computer
the micrometers bill from the highest
quality components by us here in the UK
becomes fully assembled with that thing
we need in the box so you have to do is
plug it in to get started
and local area on Jan 15 of 100 bicycle
no reasons its small footprint quite
operations and in close body make a
perfect musical home workshop organs and
micro milk is capable of cutting precise
usable parts and excuse ranging
materials giving you the cost and delay
process

aluminium brass micro has you covered
we're chosen to keep the Michel open
suits which gives you a huge render for
free and paid substitution
just update any few minutes and storing
workers to fool information to that
champion Facebook we have any questions
you
let's talk about taking the perfect
photo first compose the shot
check the histogram adjust the exposure
focus on your subject compute the
hyperfocal distance to keep everything
sharp enable bracketing to get more
dynamic range at a neutral density
filter update the exposure and then take
the shot
we built a better way today's DSLR and
mirrorless camera have amazing optics
and sensors but they do very little to
actually help you take a good photo
finding the right sentence involves a
series of complex techniques and
formulas as an engineer with a
background in artificial intelligence I
knew I could build a tool to simplify
the project I wanted something that
would let me focus on the composition
but would handle the details for me so I
created arsonist the world's first AI
photography assistant with one tap
arsenal fine settings to take the best
photo possible Arsenal's AI searches
thousands of images in its database to
suggest good settings next it fine Tunes
the suggestions by analyzing 18
different factors Arsenal uses
state-of-the-art machine learning to
help you take a great photo in any
condition
love you
many of the memorable shots you see
today are captured by combining multiple
exposures through a labor-intensive
process called photo second with arsenal
you can do this in second capture all
the details and scenes with high dynamic
range get everything in sharp focus and
create long exposures without buying
expensive filters using these advanced
techniques Arsenal lets you go beyond
the limitations of your camera sensor or
lint four times when you want complete
control you can wirelessly adjust manual
settings see a live preview and trigger
the shutter all from up to 100 feet away
Arsenal also improves the experience of
reviewing photos in the field you can
flip through the photos on your camera
zoom in to check out details at full
resolution then share your favorite
photos right from your phone and finally
Arsenal makes it easy to capture
stunning time-lapse
it automatically adjusts the exposure in
changing lights giving you a smooth
day-to-night transition you can even
watch a high-def preview of your
time-lapse while it's being taken
whether you're a pro who is already
mastered manual shooting or you just
bought your first DSLR Arsenal can help
take your photography to the next level
so before you replace your gear try
upgrading your technique with Arsenal
Arsenal is already being tested in the
field now I need your help to ramp up
production by supporting our campaign
say you can be one of the first to get
our we've got exclusive rewards for our
early backers and some awesome stretch
goals in the work I'm really excited
about the photos I've been getting with
