hi
as Eric and I love my air pods their
Bluetooth connectivity is seamless and I
like that they're loud enough to use
even while I'm out for a run but the
battery life is not amazing I have to
carry this charging case around and
remember to charge it every day or two
since I already bring an extra iPhone
battery with me now I have to carry
around three devices every day that's
why we created pod case pod case is a
slim iPhone case that charges your phone
and your air pods now your air pods are
always with you and always charged no
more fumbling to find the charging case
when your phone is ringing
just slide the air pods out of your pod
case to accept an incoming call pod case
is great for travelers or going to the
gym pod case makes it super convenient
to listen to music answer calls and use
Siri without taking your phone out of
your pocket naturally it's even better
with a SmartWatch it charges using a
USBC cable which is the same cable that
Mac books and other modern laptops use
we are part of the team behind the
pebble smartwatch and avacado headset
our past projects have collectively
shipped over 2 million units we have the
skills and experience to deliver pod
case on schedule if you're a fan of air
pods like we are and want an iPhone case
that can charge your air pods back this
project and help make it come to life
thanks
hi I'm Brandon Charleston 13 years Air
Force and CrossFit level 2 trainer and
I'm John Reyes 12 years marine corps
crossed with level 2 trainer and owner
of CrossFit Valley Springs in Northern
California we've developed the world's
first collapsible shaker bottle
we call it the Go pug the personal
utility collapsible canteen in our
experience we have found shaker bottles
to be difficult to clean hard to mix
supplements they're noisy not durable
and they can also leak over time
with the go puck we designed it with all
these issues in mind we designed with a
round bottom around top a drop in fan
blade agitator it's completely microwave
safe dishwasher safe and it can be
frozen it's designed to fit in cup
holders of all sizes and the finger loop
can be used to attach to any rucksack
backpack or travel bag when collapsed
the go puck can fit to even the most
overstuffed bag we've designed the go
puck to hold all hot and cold beverages
such as coffee tea protein shakes beer
or wine and any mixed drinks and it'll
collapse into the size of a hockey puck
we designed the go puck to meet the
needs of all military athletes outdoors
and anyone who is looking for a quality
product
over the last two years we've gone
through several prototypes to design the
perfect companion for all your hydration
needs
we've poured our heart and souls into
the development of this one-of-a-kind
product with the highest quality
materials with your help we'll have this
available in a variety of colors we've
already begun the tooling process with
your support we can take this thing to
the finish line and into production this
is a product we love and we know you'll
love it too
please share and back us now thank you
