starts in September I'm John - Stine
have been working for the past 10 years
as a creative technologist building
prototypes and applications and have
been interested in augmented reality for
a long time and now that the technology
is finally ready for it said based
augmented reality I've been wanting to
get into that space but the current
market is made of a lot of expensive
developer kits that cost over $1,500
that's why I created ghosts which is
complete augmented reality solution that
as a headset that is powered by your
smartphone as well as a set of apps
designed for it to provide an
easy-to-use and accessible solution for
mental reality we spend a lot of time
prototyping the ghost headset to make
sure we can have great quality augmented
reality solution using a smartphone
based headset once we achieve that goal
we turn to fates do-nothing who was the
perfect partner to turn this prototype
into a beautifully designed products hi
my name is Matthew Malone a partner to
product design consultancy based in LA
called fates - nothing
John originally came to us requesting
help to design an augmented reality
headset that's beautiful and also highly
functional
designing a headset is a challenge
because it's a very ergonomic product it
needs to live seamlessly on your head at
all times and feel comfortable while
functioning the ghost headsets designed
to work with a variety of different
mobile devices there's a window at the
front of the device that allows the
headset to work with phones of varying
camera location we actually leveraged a
lot of curvatures and geometries that
exist within the phone design itself so
that the two products fit together most
seamlessly we've really considered every
detail with comfort in mind there's a
foam pad that allows the product to fit
comfortably on your forehead co-molded
nose bridge and an adjustable strap the
design of the headset itself is meant to
feel a little bit more lifestyle and
less techie we just wanted to design
something that we all felt was cool and
we'd be proud to wear Faith's - nothing
is really excited to be a part of this
project and we're looking forward to
launching an amazing product with ghost
the headset is only half the battle
without good software design for it it's
pretty much useless experience mac OS no
new way ghost OS allows you to display
any mac OS application beyond the
display of your computer and have an
unlimited number of interactive windows
floating all around you
this is multitasking on steroids
with goes viewer you can preview any 3d
model in your environment and with
airdrop support you can wirelessly send
3d models to the ghost headset from your
computer hard drive or your favorite
online 3d library with Ghost Theater you
can watch any 2d 3d movies videos and
live stream on a giant virtual screen
while still seeing you surrounding and
with a picture in well feature you can
have your screen follow you around so
you never miss a second some apps
designed for VR actually work in AR with
ghosts one of them is YouTube you can
watch any 2d or 3d stereoscopic YouTube
video on a virtual screen floating in
front of you while still seeing you
surrounding all you need is the ghost
headset and the YouTube app for iOS or
Android ghost comes with a magnetic dr
visor turning it into a mobile VR
headset compatible with Google cardboard
apps we really believe in ghosts and we
spend a lot of time thinking of how we
can improve the current augmented
reality market but we need your help to
make it happen and bring it to the
public so pledge now if you want to be
the first one to experience ghost for
yourself many people around the world
experienced frequent power outages the
Luminizer make sure you always have
access to a safe reliable light source
it requires no batteries sunlight or
quartz instead the Luminizer converts
warmth to electricity using a single tea
light candle you're able to run powerful
LEDs for several hours the Luminizer is
small lightweight and rugged
and offers two practical light modes
avoid Falls safety be prepared for
