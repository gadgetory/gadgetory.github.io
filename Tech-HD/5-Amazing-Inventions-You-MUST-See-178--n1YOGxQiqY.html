we all love the new MacBook it's
brilliantly designed but don't you wish
that it should have some more ports when
you need to use your external hard
drives or sync your iPhone and iPad
connect external monitors or even
transfer photos and flash drive contents
there's a problem introducing Vista the
all-in-one hub for all the connectivity
you need on your matic unlike some other
devices it requires only one type C port
to connect to your macbook so now you
just need one device to sync or charge
your iPhones and iPads to connect SD
micro SD cards flash drives and external
hard drives you can also connect
external monitors using HDMI VGA DP or
mini DP designs to complement the look
and feel of your macbook v star is made
with precision milled aluminum alloy the
same as your macbook this star
incorporates all the ports you need and
the most compact design to deliver the
best user experience this one hub is all
you need to bid goodbye to your tangled
up desk it's sleek it's smart and it
makes life convenient this star

we are surrounded by technology more
than ever before in our lives we believe
that it should be seamlessly integrated
especially when we're on the move that's
why we found it this though the series
of tech filled backpacks for a whole new
generation of creative consumers they
are the world's most intelligently
designed and minimalistic backpacks
which intuitively charge your devices on
the go and light up your life with this
bow we've worked to create the best
backpacks with the diverse needs of
cyclists urban nomads and intrepid
travelers in mind powerful LEDs weld it
into the shoulder straps and bottom of
the backpack guide your way integrated
bike lights ensure a safe journey and
keep you visible after dark when you're
cycling through traffic both lights can
also be set to different modes depending
on your needs additional LED strips
inside provide a helping hand when
looking for your possessions novel
backpacks had a spacious interior with
roll-top closure allowing you to pack
all the essentials that the day or days
ahead might command our revolutionary
shock absorption technology molded from
high elasticity EPDM absorbs the maximum
impact from any accidental drop
constructed from tough durable and
water-resistant fabric the slow
backpacks have been designed to last a
lifetime
but when your phone or tablet need some
extra juice all backpacks come with a
specially developed power bank offering
thirteen thousand four hundred
milliampere rechargeable power capacity

30 minutes a side charging pocket allows
you to charge your phone by cable or
inductive Qi technology for extra
security an RFID safe pocket blocks

left shoulder strap also features a
hidden zipper pocket containing a wallet
capable of storing your keys the right
shoulder strap has its own hidden zipped
pocket which includes a USB port for
charging your device's having designed
and developed over 150 backpacks to date
our journey is anchored in the idea that
we're only as good as our last product
with this VOC we pushed that challenge
to its limits and created a new range of
backpacks which we knew didn't exist
until now it's been an exhilarating
journey so far with more than two years
spent getting the first backpacks from
the drawing board to launch ready
many months have been spent rigorously
testing retesting and improving the
countless prototypes
by supporting our Kickstarter project
you will become part of our exciting
adventure and propel the backpack into
production and into your hands thanks

hi I'm Jeff I'm Marty and I'm Ken and
together we created caddy cab caddy cap
is the world's first and only Universal
and reusable flip-top bottle cap
designed specifically for beer soda and
water bottles it's happened to us all
probably many times the dreaded spill
whether it's your beer soda or water
spilling sucks caddy cap is 100% spill
and leak proof and it's designed to keep
your drink in the bottle sometimes it's
hard to figure out which bottle is yours
with six different colors available at
launch and many more to come you'll
always know your bottle from the rest
whether it's water insects or sand caddy
cap keeps contaminants out and your
drink in caddy cap provides an
easy-to-use flip top lid aligned for
one-handed operation it's so easy even
your kids can use it it also sports a
hook for a carabiner or a keychain
allowing you to take your bottle with
you on the go with its gasket seal not
only does caddy cap keep your drink
fresh it also keeps your drink colder
for longer who doesn't want a fresh coat
drink caddy kept separate into two
pieces allowing you to mix and match
colors for your favorite team or a
special event our patent-pending dual
thread design allows caddy cap to thread
onto multiple bottles including glass
plastic and even aluminum caddy cap can
be used anywhere anytime a bottles in
your hand for example when you're
tailgating before the game fishing at
your favorite spot camping outdoors
playing a round of golf on the water or
at the beach kenny cap works great
outdoors or indoors whether you're at
the gym working out had a party with
friends in the car or on the go for your
convenience and safety caddy cap is
dishwasher safe and bpa-free
the idea of caddy cap was born from a
simple need the need to keep your beer
in the bottle and everything else out
after doing some research we realized
there was nothing on the market like
caddy cap for the past three years we
have secured several patents while
working through multiple designs and
prototypes
it's been a long but enjoyable journey
and we are excited to take the next step
the manufacturer has been chosen and the
mold making process has been started we
need your help to fund the mold and the
final production cost we'd like to thank
you for your time please share our
Kickstarter campaign with your friends
and family as we like to say cap it flip
it snap it
