anywhere
you
do you have a shirt that doesn't fit you
quite right I know I did
shirts will fit me at the neck and be
baggy in the body but if I bought a
smaller shirt the collar would be too
tight an ill-fitting sure can make it
look sloppy lethargic and sometimes like
hot air baloon traditional tailoring
methods are time-consuming and expensive
but with the zip seam you can tailor a
shirt and under two minutes let me show
you first we determine how much we want
to trim off each side for this shirt
it's about 1/2 inch then we'll just
place the zip seam 1/2 inch from the
edge of the original seat next we push
the fabric in the channel with any cord
and it should slide right in
and we'll just like to fit into place by
inserting this inner piece
just like that you are done with one
side and you'll just do the same thing
on the other side once again we're gonna
place a zip seam half inch from the
original see
push the fabric into the channel
and lock the fit into place by inserting
the inner piece
unlike traditional tailoring methods the
zip seam is adjustable and reusable and
boom you're done let's see how it turned
out
looks pretty good thank you for watching
please leave a comment our social media
sites and uh we look forward to hearing
from you

if you're sitting with poor posture
you're not just creating chronic back
pain you're cutting off circulation of
blood lymphatic fluid restricting
digestion and creating a true health
problem for yourself the Center for
Disease Control confirms it by calling
sitting the new smoking you need to sit
correctly and you need the right chair
to do it for you
introducing the back strong chair the
revolutionary advancement to sitting in
health while making yourself stronger
this novel design was created by
renowned doctor two celebrities and the
Los Angeles Clippers Denis colonnello DC
of Beverly Hills and Jim Grove
industrial designer whose reputation at
BMW design works and la design are
legendary the Backstrom chair was
developed with your actual body
mechanics in mind you will sit in
comfort you will sit in motion and you
will virtually eliminate your ability to
slouch hunched and sit wrong the back
strong chair instantly addresses every
issue first sit and it saddle hugs your
pelvis and gives you lower thoracic
support fitting to your physiology that
gets your hips and pelvis forward
upright and in an athletic position
putting the natural S curve in the spine
for natural support second the form
fitted back is contoured for an ideal
supported sitting position to keep that
posture correct third is where the
unique sit and motion technology takes
over most chairs have stagnant saddles
attached to the post under the chair the
back strong saddle actually hangs from
the arms of the chair and moves with you
like a swing it attaches precisely in a
location that mimics the ball and socket
of your hip joint that allows movement
that means you hunch forward and the
chair reacts organ amelie putting a
gentle supportive pressure in the small
of your back and the chair assists with
your posture
lean back the support increases again
holding that nice s-curve lean forward
and the support follows you it even
assists you with a supportive push when
you get up
being able to naturally move your pelvis
torso and back while you sit with great
posture encourages muscular stretching
core strength lymphatic movement blood
flow the result less back pain more
flexibility and feeling great when you
get up without the stiffness when you
sit better you live better hi I'm Dennis
colonnello and I created the back strong
chair my patients in Beverly Hills
wanted the best ease so it frustrated me
to send someone home fully adjusted out
of pain and then just a week later see
them all screw it up again I knew their
office chair was the culprit your body
was not designed to sit all day thanks
to modern work you have to to be healthy
your body needs dynamic movement for
your heart your digestion for your nerve
treks for your skeleton for your health
this is precisely what the back strong
chair does I work as a team chiropractor
in the NBA as part of my practice this
chair places you in a natural athletic
position of strength of engaging your
core legs glutes back and abs it's
active sitting you'll feel to develop it
I let a team that went through literally
hundreds of designs dozens of prototypes
and a myriad of materials we got this
right I guarantee you sit in it once and
you'll sit in it for life the back
strong instantly engages your core
making you sit stronger what I didn't
know when I started this was how much it
would cost to develop a chair for all of
us who sit more than we wish we had to
now I need your help to bring it to the
world I put together a great team found
a great factory and put all the elements
in place we are ready to make the molds
buy the raw materials and start making
chairs I want to make sure that every
single person can afford to have a back
strong chair in their office and home
through this crowdfunding raise you'll
help us finish the tooling of this
design we'll be able to deliver the
chair to you for a fraction of what we
thought it would cost and get super
premium quality that is
to last I was shocked by how much people
markup furniture we are not doing that
we want every two in America in this
chair in fact I told my team if we could
not sell this chair for the value of two
visits to my office we wouldn't do it
well we did it and we're ready are you
ready to try it we will deliver the
world's most comfortable supportive and
healthiest chair to you I look forward
to helping you have a healthy body and
back leaving your office every day
