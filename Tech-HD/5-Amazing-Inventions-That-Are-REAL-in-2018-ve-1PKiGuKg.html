we are go son and we believe the son can
and will power the future solar powered
technology has become more popular and
affordable than ever but we are still
burning fuel to cook it's time to
upgrade your kitchen with the gosun
fusion more than a solar oven
the fusion stands on its own as a
complete cooking solution it's portable
yet large enough to feed a family and
can even cook with the Sun at night
thanks to an integrated electric heating
element that cooks using a fraction of
the energy of other electric stoves it
uses about the same power as your
computer but cooks a full meal for five
in under an hour if you don't have
sunshine all it takes is the push of a
button to activate the hundred and fifty
watt heater with the optional lithium
ion power bank you can easily carry
enough energy to cook a meal anytime
anywhere with the solar PV upgrade the
electricity used to charge the power
bank can be made from the Sun so you're
cooking on sunshine day or night safe to
touch even when cooking above 400
degrees Fahrenheit the gosun fusion can
bake boil or fry many dishes in as
little as 20 minutes the gosun fusion is
a deliberate evolution of our original
stoves durable and reliable bringing
together the best of solar and electric
heating into an experience we believe is
totally game-changing gosun has been
making waves and outdoor cooking
thanks to breakthrough vacuum-insulated
technology you won't go hungry and
you're never out of gas
our stoves are being used by more than
25 thousand happy customers we've
created a full lineup of solar ovens
large and small but everyone has been
asking for a larger oven with the
ability to cook at night after four
years of development it's finally here
we're excited to introduce our hybrid
fusion here on Kickstarter where gosun
began with the help of this community go
Sun fusion lets you do the cooking at a
fraction of the power and a fraction of
the fuss
giving you the freedom to do the things
you love to feed those you care for and
to cook off-grid without gas gosun
welcomes you to the fuel free frontier
technology has transformed our world
forever it's how we keep in touch with
friends and family that we share most
precious moments and now we explore the
world so we find answers and learn new
things invites us to wonder and ask
questions technologies allowed us to
overcome every obstacle in boundary
connecting people and ideas from around
the world uniting us and bringing us
closer together
but what about our data think about it
more information about our lives is
being collected than any other time in
history every day we rely on services
that have failed us time and time again
from getting hacked to the misuse and
selling of private information it seems
almost impossible to keep our data safe
but what if we didn't have to give it up
at all last year we came to you with an
idea with your support we were able to
build software and ship thousands of
devices that has improved online
security for individuals and businesses
worldwide
what filter is just the beginning this
is being
it's a router that encrypts all your
information at breathtaking speeds so
your internet provider can't see what
you're doing and services can't track
you it'll protect all the devices in
your homes and threats online keeps your
physical location hidden so you can
access any part of the internet from
anywhere in the world it's the world's
most advanced router we created being
because we believe technology should
empower humanity not exploit our nature
to connect and learn your privacy
matters and it's worth protecting now
