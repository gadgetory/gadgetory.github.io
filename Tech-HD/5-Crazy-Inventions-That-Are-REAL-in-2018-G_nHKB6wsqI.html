introducing Auto the world's first smart
milling machine with Auto you can mill
anything you want you're only limited by
your imagination just mill fill and
chill and all at the touch of a button
ordinary grinders leave dry materials in
a powder and moist materials clumpy but
Auto is not a grinder it's the first
milling device that uses artificial
intelligence to expertly mill material
instead of grinding it here's how it
works inside Auto is our patented smart
milling technology first Auto senses the
density and consistency of your favorite
natural products then Auto automatically
changes the direction calibrates the
milling pressure and even adjust the
speed as it mills to create a perfect
round every single time and all at the
touch of a button
combined with custom-made aerospace
engineered cutting blades Auto will make
sure that your grind is a perfect
consistency perfectly milled perfect
every time whether your material is
coarse moist dry highly dense lumpy or
even sticky Auto will fill your waiting
sachet or cone evenly from tip to top
there's never been anything like it
Auto makes it easy to take it easy
and even though Auto is simple to use
it took almost two years of painstaking
engineering and problem-solving to get
it to where it is today
we keep redesigning building redesigning
until it's perfect this is the first of
its kind and it has to be an incredible
experience and be beyond your
expectations that's how hard we've
worked on the auto to make it a great
product and we have the best engineers
some of the best designers and
manufacturers working on this product
and I think everybody who gets it is
going to say wow they really gave me
what I thought I was gonna get we want
to make it easy to take it easy we want
to make it easy to take it easy because
you work hard enough
you can buy our product and you you're
in the banana brothers brand anything
you get from us is gonna make it easier
so you can just chill and if you love to
cook just magnetically attached the Oh
funnel and you'll find Otto's wonderful
in the kitchen
and like always perfect consistency
every time right now you could be making
chamomile tea centering your universe
cleansing your home of all that negative
energy or placing a scented sachet of
lavender on the pillow for a
rejuvenating night's sleep so Auto will
mill Phil well you just
well chill so if you're ready to mill
fill and chill at the touch of a button
Bacchus on IndieGoGo today and be among
the first to experience the magic of
Otto
memory can be tricky
even at this age of constant
connectivity being able to instantly
summon something from memory is as
important as ever and can give you an
incredible edge in your studies and in
life flashcards work great but they're
too clumsy to carry around and phone
apps not only drain your batteries but
also kill your learning effort with all
those notifications to improve our
memory wanted the solution is truly
dedicated to learning in a fun and
efficient way
so created the flip the flip it's a full
redesign of our target should be based
on decades of research and good practice
it has a simple buttonless
interface if you got it right flip it up
if you need more practice flip it down
whether you're traveling around the
world going camping in the wilderness or
just commuting to work or school there's
always a stretch of time that would be
ideal to prepare for an upcoming test or
to improve your language skills
the flip is light and fits in a shirt
pocket so you can always have it with
you and turn any idle woman in your day
into a learning opportunity
and since it's based on ePaper
technology it uses very little energy
the battery we fit in this super compact
form factor allows you to study for days
on a single charge it's high time to
stop putting your learning efforts to
waste with all those nagging
notifications and make memorizing as
easy and pleasant as it can be and since
we started working on the project
received hundreds of messages of support
and encouragement after 15 months of
research and development having used and
abused many working prototypes we are
ready to bring the flip to the market we
have partnered with the best
manufacturers and component suppliers to
get ready for production and to avoid
any unpleasant surprises if one is ected
reliable partners with whom we've worked
in the past now this step requires
expensive tooling and capital to buy
components at a volume discount back us
now and you will be one of the first
people in the world with this truly
innovative learning tool the flip this
is a bar of human food nothing else like
it exists it's made of 100% organic
whole foods and organic extracts it's
vegan paleo prebiotic contains no added
sugar no gluten or peanuts is high in
antioxidants and has been developed for
optimal bioavailability human food has
been formulated to support people on
vegetarian or vegan diets but is good
for anybody
each bar contains essential vitamins and
nutrients that can be difficult to
obtain from a plant-based diet including
100% of the recommended daily intake of
vitamin b12 and 50% of the recommended
intake of iron vitamin D calcium zinc
and Amiga 3
each bar also contains over 12 grams of
protein if you're already following a
complete plant-based diet
human food should make life simpler if
you eat meat from 1 to reduce or stop
human food makes that change easy
there's three types red green and yellow
all three also contain whole daily
amounts of functional ingredients
ginseng maca and cacao these ingredients
have proven curative and preventative
health benefits when taken regularly in
the right amounts the yellow bar also
contains 500 milligrams of high strength
turmeric curcumin the red bar has extra
antioxidants from cranberries and goji
berries and the green bar contains four
grams of spirulina no other food product
in the world contains whole daily
amounts of these ingredients human food
is a health food shop in a red green or
yellow wrapper human food is filling
enough to replace any meal it can be
eaten as a bar drunk in a smoothie or
broken up into musnier porridge the
tastes somewhere between sweet and
savory it tastes delicious
or not of anything specific the organic
nuts seeds and fruit have been finely
balanced to make the taste so smooth
it's almost neutral that's how it still
tastes good five days a week even after
a year and to make your own flavors you
just add fruit to smoothies
human food makes it easy to maintain an
optimum diet that is complete Organic
plant-based and includes whole daily
amounts of functional ingredients with
one bar of human food you know you're
good for the day five and you're covered
for a week 20 in your backpack and for a
whole month it will be easy to maintain
the best possible diet with human food
you don't have to choose between freedom
and health with your support we can
upscale production and begin supplying
human food by monthly subscription the
first intake is limited to 2,000
subscribers and the second intake six
months later we'll also be limited this
is to ensure that we grow at a healthy
steady rate without any risk to
standards human food is not a
corporation it's a cooperative our main
