exciting and interesting thing now I've
put a lot of thought and research into
ways of seeing small and delicate things

heavy they can only be used in certain
places but now the perfect microscope

can enlarge the target by up to 400
times its original size
the nurugo microscope not only can it be
use for research and education but it
can also be utilized in fields that
require a microscope such as work and
everyday lives the two key factors for
producing the high-resolution image are

capable of enlarging the target by up to
400 times its original size and this
lighting technology has also been
patented you can also get video without
