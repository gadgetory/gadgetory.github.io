tip adapters with zap tips you can

device simply snap it off the zap tip
was designed to be sleep and small so it
won't add any extra size for weight to
your device so small in fact that every
detail of this active had to be perfect
so we spend months and months testing
the zap tip to make sure you have the
fastest and most convenient charging

one size fits all good we no longer have
to struggle with charging the phone and
you only have one hand free leaves app

five years together we are constantly
delivering the most innovative solutions
for charging products you no longer have
to worry about your cable being cold
accidentally and damaging your connector
or even worse your device
let's go yeah hmm I really got the
feeling today that everything is going
my way now this is what I'm talking
about every time i see you smile it
makes me shout
hey Kickstarter I'm Doug and I'm Chris
and we're to product design is based in
London as you know phone batteries don't
last long enough and existing charges
are not always handy especially in
emergencies that's why we came up with
Vanessa it's small and light uses two
double A batteries give you a bit of
charge when you need a place it's
perfect for outdoor situations when your
battery's dead or if you just can't be
bothered to get up simply nip into a
corner shop or pop out the batteries
from wherever and off you go
you
you
you
you
you
you
these are nano holds they may look
simple but using nanotechnology each one
has millions of microscopic suction cups
with nano holds you can stick you are
flat back to device or case to smooth
flat surfaces as easy as that now holds
works on services like a glass metal
wood mirrors dry erase boards plastics
and screens let's take a look some
examples of how you can use nano holds
and
you can order your own nano holds right
now I remember to use hashtag nano holds
selfie to share your nano hold selfies
with us a place to plug in should be
more than just a cold it should look
right
beautifully designed and it should offer
powerful function in a slim profile
introducing the new doc power station
lamp from my tagged instant charging for
your iPhone Apple watch and backup
battery at the same time a lump for
anywhere touch brighter touch dimmer a
USB port for charging any USB device
non-slip rubber base keeps it firmly in
place time to head out
but what if you need a charge midday use
our portable backup battery newquay when
battery is low you have what you need

the power to keep going

both ways keep track of your iPhone and
Apple watch ok time for a pic drop your
phone now snap with the new key set the
sleep timer to give you your last light
something this neat should be admired
just a little the nuke
powerstation lump by my tag the idea for
hotshot started right here with
skateboarding it's a culture where every
trick is documented when we looked
around we noticed almost all of that was
being done with cell phones but what
really got our attention was the way the
phones are being held to get a decent
shot so we created the hotshot handle
with exactly that in mind every aspect
of our product was designed to enhance
the filmmaking experience it's durable
compact and fully adjustable to set your
phone between the grips tighten the
thumbscrew and you're ready to roll now
your shots are smoother your hands are
out of frame and your phone is
completely secure to further expand the
handles versatility we added a universal
tripod mount now you're able to get a
whole new range of creative shots out of
your smartphone
it sticks we're always on my deck on
just like the one thing that we don't
know for it it's perfect this is that
last missing link that was always
necessary I usually people to wear their
balls or just their hands everybody's
got a cracked iphone now they drop it
just keep us dirty keeps you on point I
can't waste your money on the one star
for my Instagram selfies and every day
they affect the whole scale it doesn't
wait for this to come out when you film
on your phone you can get super close
and if you bail and without the way so
you don't mess up your phone Hot Shots
the real deal with this you'd be getting
hot shots I'm out here with my friends
gantry and Garrett hill I'm introducing
their brand new product the hotshot hand
let me tell you this is going to
innovate the entire sport especially
skating you get some incredible
cinematic shots we could hook this up to
an avi to a tripod matter of fact I'm
gonna film Garrett hill right now here
