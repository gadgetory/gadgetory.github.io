London as you know phone batteries don't

double A batteries give you a bit of
charge when you need a place it's
perfect for outdoor situations when your
battery's dead or if you just can't be

these are nano holds they may look
simple but using nanotechnology each one
has millions of microscopic suction cups
with nano holds you can stick you are
flat back to device or case to smooth
flat surfaces as easy as that now holds
works on services like a glass metal
wood mirrors dry erase boards plastics
and screens let's take a look some
examples of how you can use nano holds
and
you can order your own nano holds right
now I remember to use hashtag nano holds
selfie to share your nano hold selfies
with us a place to plug in should be
more than just a cold it should look
right

just a little the nuke
powerstation lump by my tag the idea for
hotshot started right here with
skateboarding it's a culture where every
trick is documented when we looked
around we noticed almost all of that was
being done with cell phones but what
really got our attention was the way the
phones are being held to get a decent
shot so we created the hotshot handle
with exactly that in mind every aspect
of our product was designed to enhance
the filmmaking experience it's durable
compact and fully adjustable to set your
phone between the grips tighten the
thumbscrew and you're ready to roll now
your shots are smoother your hands are
out of frame and your phone is
completely secure to further expand the
handles versatility we added a universal
tripod mount now you're able to get a
whole new range of creative shots out of
your smartphone
it sticks we're always on my deck on
just like the one thing that we don't
know for it it's perfect this is that
last missing link that was always
necessary I usually people to wear their
balls or just their hands everybody's
got a cracked iphone now they drop it
just keep us dirty keeps you on point I
can't waste your money on the one star
for my Instagram selfies and every day
they affect the whole scale it doesn't
wait for this to come out when you film
on your phone you can get super close
and if you bail and without the way so
you don't mess up your phone Hot Shots
the real deal with this you'd be getting
hot shots I'm out here with my friends
gantry and Garrett hill I'm introducing
their brand new product the hotshot hand

innovate the entire sport especially
