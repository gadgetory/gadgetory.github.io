a thunderstorm is an impressive natural
spectacle especially for mosquitoes
once mosquito sends a storm they
instinctively seek protection mosquitoes
are genetically programmed to override
their instinct to bite for their own
safety when a storm is approaching but
can one simulate an approaching
thunderstorm and invent a natural
mosquito protection for human beings we
can and we did with no picks go no picks
go emits weak electromagnetic waves that
create a perfect imitation of the
atmospheric dynamics of a storm
that's how no pigs go brings a little
thunderstorm to your wrists and protects
you more effectively from mosquito bites
and other previously known methods

days which allows you to stay focused

matters
the nominees called stole deeply did
envy my name is Kurt Stoll but I'm the
inventor of no BIG's ghost I study the
mosquito intensively and discovered that
it doesn't only react to chemical
stimuli but also to electromagnetic
stimuli through their armor I'm able to
send electromagnetic signals to the
central nervous system the triggering
signals are transported through the
nervous system into the ganglia or the
brain and the DNA of a mosquito are
located which dictates its ancestral
behaviors
no pics NGO is developed and produced
using state-of-the-art technology in
Switzerland we ensure the highest
quality standards and the risk of
getting a mosquito bite is drastically
reduced tests at the Swiss tropical and
Public Health Institute in Basel have
proven the effectiveness of no pics go

Carlson and I'm the managing director of
