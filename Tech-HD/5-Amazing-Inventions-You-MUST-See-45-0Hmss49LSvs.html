recall hickeys a new lacing system a new
idea fasten ones never tie again make
all your shoes look better and feel
better the core heat is for everyone
they work on any shoe
what makes hick is so special once in
style you can slip on and off your shoes
you will never have these places again
the adductor muscles movement making

every carbon are we wanted everyone to
fill their feet muscles moving in
synchronicity with their shoes how does
it work the fact that he is 2.0 connects
only to I deaths at a time makes it
possible to the lever are targeted to
customize fit the key is to thread
hickeys using our different lacing
techniques if you have a high arch you
can loosen your key keys or tighten the
map if your feet are too narrow or flat
this is the only license systems Martin
ufff to be truly adaptive we want to
grow our Kickstarter family
and inspire more people to live a life

love your case thank you
what if you could control your dreams
fly over the Grand Canyon visit a
beautiful island or perhaps go back in
time to the age of dinosaurs now you can
meet a band plus the EEG brain sensing
headband for inducing lucid dreams and
improving sleep what is a lucid dream a
lucid dream is any dream in which you
become aware that you're dreaming
without you actually waking up dreams
occur almost always when you are in the
rapid eye movement phase also known as
the REM phase of your sleep in red phase
your brain activity is different than in
the other phases of your sleep cycle
IPAM plus accurately senses this dream
phase by monitoring variations in your
brainwaves
once I been plus census this street face
it plays audio visual cues
the subtle external stimuli of light
patterns via the LEDs on IBM Plus and
sound appear as anomalies in your dream
making your wear that you are dreaming
without them waking you up
once you are lucid in a dream you can
take control of your dream actions and
consciously reshape the dream to fulfill
any fantasy your wildest desires
unrestrained by the laws of physics or
Society
lucid dreams are vivid and highly
immersive once in lucid dream you enter
a virtual world where everything you see
hear touch taste and smell is as
authentic as reality lucid dreaming has
been researched scientifically many
psychologists and researchers have
recognized that lucid dreams can help
with artistic creativity problem-solving
improving sports and language skills and
can even help people prone to nightmares
to get their fears under control sleep
is also very important to restore energy
reserves and strengthen the immune
system even minimal sleep loss affects
mood productivity ability to handle
stress and even body weight Iban plus
tracks your sleep indicates sleep
quality and gives feedback on
improvement I penned plus also has the
most advanced smart alarm feature that
wakes you up with simulated natural
sunlight and sounds and the most optimum
period of sleep cycle so that you wake
up fresh every time
I ban plus headband communicates with I
band Plus app on your smartphone via
bluetooth so you can conveniently check
your sleep statistics and improvement
suggestions you can even customize your
iPad Plus from this app to set LED light
patterns and the brightness as well as
the audio cues developers can use our
open platform to create amazing new
experiences with future software updates
I band plus could be connected to
numerous smart devices in your home to
simplify your daily life dreams and
sleep are vital for optimal health and
happiness so we started working on Iban
plus with the goal to enable everyone to
control their dreams and to enable
everyone to gain insight into their
sleep we went through several prototypes
to realize the best Iban plus design we
are really excited to take event plus
from the prototyping stage to the
support finished product we want to hear
from you to know your ideas and
improvement suggestions be the world's
first to own I band plus back our
campaign and help us make event last a
reality thank you
the world around us is changing as we
speak and with that change comes a
constant evolution of capturing devices
go for allowed us to be present in this
world recording her beauty while being
there right in the action drones allows
us to take beautiful steady aerial
images from the sky we combine vessel
both worlds and created air air lets you
take aerial videos and photos simply by
throwing your GoPro
you
this is how it works start recording or
connect your GoPro to the remote or
smartphone app now simply snap the GoPro
in slide the two wings into each other
and screw them on to the head you can
start shooting
we have taken air into the forest upon
the mountains out on the water into the
city and this is just the beginning
whatever you would like to report with
your GoPro air we'll be ready for it
are you more into photos use burst mode
and throw air straight up to take
incredible aerial selfies
we also made sure that Aris portable to
take with you on your adventures
simply put air and your GoPro into the
bag and you're good to go
hi guys my name is mark and I start out
air with a couple of friends almost a
year ago what started out as a fun
experiment to get our Gophers in the air
without the use of a drone turned out to
be an amazing experience on its own and
the results they look more alive and
dynamic than ever before
the feeling you get when you really
throw your gopher in the air is one that
we want to share with everyone and
that's why we are bringing it to you
fast for the past year we sketch modeled
and prototype so we have the perfect
design and now we are ready for mass
production the manufacturing it is all
done in the Netherlands and we are ready
to go the minute we reach our goal we
are very curious to see what you're
gonna do with there step up your GoPro
game and back us today
you
many of us use RFID technology in our
daily lives these digital key cards
often provide easy and convenient access
to all of the places that we frequent on
a regular basis our home office parking
structure pool etc but until now there's
been no easy way to copy these devices
leaving you vulnerable to expensive fees
should you lose one and inconveniencing
you when you need to share access with a
spouse friend housekeeper or dog walker
and having a different key card for each
location can be a hassle enter Kesey a
small device that fits on your keyring
allowing you to copy up to four RFID
devices the process of copying an RFID
credential onto Kesey is simple first
hold down the button you would like to
copy be RFID credential to when the LED
light turns red simply hold key Z over
the key fob or keycard the LED will
blink red while key Z is reading the
device when the process is complete the
LED will turn green to use it simply
press the button near the reader and it
will work just like the original easy
works with the most popular low
frequency RFID devices from many
manufacturers using different protocols
and if you move or no longer need access
to an RFID credential you can simply
reprogram that button to copy another
device and if you need to give access to
anyone it's as easy as holding your key
Z to theirs and holding down the button
the simplicity and convenience moves
with you hi my name is Elliot fuller I
invented keys while living in downtown
San Diego it has been a useful tool for
me and I hope others can benefit from it
as well Kesey has been tuned through
many iterations of hardware and firmware
and is working well but due to economies
of scale we need your help to purchase
components in bulk and bring the cost of
manufacturing down thank you for your
support and helping us bring key Z to
market
hi i'm dave and i like to make things
for the longest time I've been looking
for a building system that's strong yet
convenient and affordable problem is I
just couldn't find what I was looking
for so I created make a pipe it's simple
affordable easy to use system of
connectors that pairs with inexpensive
electrical conduit the result is a
building platform with endless
possibilities it's a smart elegant way
to create what you love now let me tell
you the things you can make with it are
infinite so if you're like John and need
to support your leisurely hobbies Cheers
or if you go for something a little bit
more on the extreme side let's see what
you got
so I guess what I'm saying is make a
pipe is fun the only limit to what you
can use it for is your imagination our
desire was not only to make something
endlessly creative but also affordable
which we did and here's how electrical
conduit is an extremely inexpensive type
of metal pipe that electricians use all
the time you can find it at almost any
hardware store the maker pipe connector
system turns that conduit into one of
the most versatile and cost-effective
building materials you can find but not
only is maker pipe easy to build and
adjust it's completely reusable so build
something you love and if you get tired
of it turn it into something else
and when you get tired of that well you
get the picture transforming it from one
thing to the next or even breaking it
down to move it is as easy as turning a
hex bolt making it extremely portable
but this portability doesn't mean you
have to sacrifice the integrity of your
builds maker pipe is super strong and
durable to demonstrate we had the
biggest guy we know stand on it and then
we gave them an engine yes yes thank you
thank you mr. president
we've all received some great feedback
on these connectors makers love it
students and educators love it
robotics teams love it hacker spaces
love it and we know that once you get
your hands on it you're gonna love it
too with your help we can put these
connectors into mass production and
start you on your way to making your
very own designs of reality so check out
the building kits we have available
through our Kickstarter and join our
maker community back maker pipe today so
we can make these connectors and you can
make well anything you want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
