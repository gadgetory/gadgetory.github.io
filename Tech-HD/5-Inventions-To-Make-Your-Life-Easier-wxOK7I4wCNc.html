being organized is essential for great
living over the past four years we've
brought two significant products to you
here on Kickstarter with the help of
over 15,000 amazing supporters from all
over the world since then we've been
working relentlessly to help you
organize better and now we're back with
not just one product but an entire
ecosystem and we think you're going to
love it

system that all of us can benefit from
let us take you through them the Oba
keyring is our solution to one of the
most universally known problems with
completely redesigned the conventional
keyring to make attaching and detaching
your T's effortless no more trying to
find a sharp object or sacrificing a
fingernail with the patent-pending
locking mechanism you can simply pinch
pull down and rotate the inner ring
until the two openings align and you're
good to go
we've designed the ring to be slim
enough to suit many different types of
keys but durable enough to suit any
lifestyle whether you're looking for a
quick and easy way to connect two sets
of keys share keys with others or carry
just essential when you jog the orbit
key ring makes it super convenient and
secure
next up meet the Obi key clip with
design is for those of you who prefer
less bulk in your pocket and quick
access unlike any other carabiner the

to work great on their own but even
better together simply pair the object

convenience of access and maximum reach

polymer core create the perfect balance
between form and function Oh Becky was

you're thinking about coffee right now
aren't you of course you are a lot goes
into the perfect cup great beans good
strong pour and precisely the right
temperature that's why you spend up to a
thousand dollars a year on the stuff
think about that for a moment you're
spending that money because you crave
perfection right then look what you go
and do with it you pour it into this
 cup great coffee depends upon
precise temperature but your cup can't
hold its heat can it which means that by
the time you've taken your third or your
fourth set your perfect coffee isn't
perfect anymore
how would you like to keep your coffee
perfect right through to your last sip
tantalizing isn't it this is ember amber
lets you keep your coffee at the
temperature you like for as long as you
please I like mine at 138 degrees hot
how does Emma do that excellent question
not one I can answer phew I'm afraid
let's see I'm not a scientist I'm a
British actress I don't think about that
for a minute look at the mug beautiful
yes
this isn't nuclear fusion or brain
surgery here it's a coffee mug but it
just so happens that it's the best damn
coffee mug on lister and if you're going
to spend $1,000 a year on coffee why not
do it justice with the perfect mug
and that
you
from Edison's times to our days the land
socket didn't change at all
138 years have passed but we still twist
what if we say that game is a shame you
don't need to twist anymore
just one clip introducing the mag bolt a
revolutionary system which consists of
two parts and allows installing bulbs in
one place and it's all because of
magnets of course with bag bolts you
don't want to need to push and twist the
bulb and awkward lampshade it's no more
extracting broken bulbs using special
tools no pain for people with arthritis
and all those sufferings happen to you
when you're balancing high up stop it
now and start using mag bolts
please support us on Kickstarter
you
does this feel familiar
how about now our phones often die at
the worst possible places at the most
inconvenient times but there's no great
alternatives for us to tempted setup is
fast and simple download the app and
connect to your mother box experience
real wireless charging the mother box
mini keeps you charged on-the-go and the
mother box can keep your devices powered
while you relax at home we've been
developing this technology for three
years and can't wait to share it with
you be the first to experience the
mother box so you never have to worry
about charging your device's again
you
think about it what is the most boring
daily action we performed since
childhood experts recommend washing
teeth after each mill and brushing for
at least three minutes but honestly who
really doesn't and who bothers always
performing the right movements both
manual and electric toothbrushes have
been the same for decades often in a
hurry we brush our teeth mistakenly
which overtime forces us to turn towards
expensive and painful visits to the
dentist have you ever thought you could
brush your teeth perfectly in just three
seconds it's time to change your habits
for the better with unico</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
