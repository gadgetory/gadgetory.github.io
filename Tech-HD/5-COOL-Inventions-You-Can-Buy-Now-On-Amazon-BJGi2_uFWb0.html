we depend on our smartphones more and
more everyday to conduct business to
connect and share to listen to our
favorite music and to watch our favorite
videos so how come we never seem to have
a charging cable when we need one
maybe it's because our phones are
portable but our long and bulky charging
cables are not well now there's a new
class of charging cable introducing
lifelink by plus the world's thinnest
ultra portable cable finally charging on
the go is easy and stress-free because
taking life league with you is as simple
as tucking it in your wallet slipping it
into your purse or handbag or putting it
on your keyring so wherever you find a
USB port in an airport or hotel room on
your laptop or gaming console in your
car on the back of your TV your life
link will always be there to keep you
charged and connected incredibly life
link is the same length as a credit card
and as soon as just two cards stacked
together but when opened life link
extends to more than double its length
so you can still access a user device
while it's charging or syncing life link
is strong to engineered with durable
teflon technology and reinforced with a
metal spring for extra security life
link is available for all Android
devices and for all new Apple
smartphones and tablets so no matter
what mobile device you depend on

charging cable again because life link
works just like your normal charging
cable but it's always with you
