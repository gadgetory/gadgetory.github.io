making super efficient wood-burning
backpacking and camping stoves our
unique patented design doesn't require
any bulky batteries or fans all you need
is a handful of twigs or sticks year
after year we enjoy interacting with the
growing number of solo stove users we're
grateful that they trust our products
enough to take with them on their most
memorable adventures we believe that
time spent outdoors with family and
friends can create some of life's most
precious and meaningful moments but with
our lives becoming busier and busier
spending time with those we care about
is becoming more difficult so we're
making it easier for you to spend more
time with family and friends outdoors
introducing the solo stove bonfire a
backyard fire pit like you've never seen
before the bonfire uses the same
patented design and technology as our
other solo stoves but it's her largest
model yet it's designed with unique
double wall which allows airflow through
the bottom poles of the bonfire to
channel air to the bottom of the fire
and up between the walls this preheated
air allows the fire to burn more
complete which results in a more
efficient fire with very little smoke a
more efficient burn means you'll get
more fire from your logs compared to an
open fire pit
the bonfire is super durable made out of
premium 304 stainless steel and is
backed by a lifetime guarantee we can't
wait to bring the soothing ambience the
dancing flames and the rustic smell of a
glowing campfire straight to your
backyard we're excited to play a small
part in bringing you together with

phone star
functionality and stylish and hands-free
design our manufactures already and only
need is your support help us bring to
the air into reality
there's magicians that do sleight of
hand and then they call it magic stop
motion is animations it is magic have
something this is inanimate lifeless
object and then having an opportunity to
get in there and bring it to life is
that is magic
stinky bones is highly articulated
precision poseable animation puppet you
have the functionality of a skeleton
armature but then here the form of a
puppet as well it can eat up a lot of
time when you're in that exploration
phase of exploring poses so with sticky
bones does sort of bridges the gap
between your ideas to the computer just
focus on what we as and there's going to
do and that's just kind of me in great
stories as an animator our job is to
breathe life into characters that were
given the sticky bones I thought wow
this is a great way to explore a pose
not just in a flat 2d plane but I can
actually explore it in 3d to pose the
character in 3d is a very time-consuming
process is much easier to a little
sketch and with something like sticky
bones you can quickly pose it the way
you want
there you had all your perspective makes
the job really easy being able to hose
it out you know maybe I need to push it
more those are sorts of things that you
can like work out pretty quickly it's
gonna give you a different perspective
and what you are doing but sticky bones
I thought it would just speed up that
planning process to get any animating
that much
a person is Eric pitch the idea I know I
would have been using it throughout my
entire career holding a character that
we get to pose well in our hands kind of
magical
I love fabricating and making the
puppets and things like this but I wish
there was a faster way to have the
animation puppet like this already ready
for me to go like right out of the box I
take it out I just start handing it so
that's one of the first like seed an
idea happen
I start realizing all the other ways you
could use it besides just animation I
saw as a real tool where you can create
really cool poses to help animators and
artists to other stories faster and
raise Lee
sometimes you just want to play around
you just want something that the first
reaction was like and one more things
Viki bones would definitely speed up my
process sticky bones just seemed so
accessible and deceivingly simple with
sticky bones it can help like people who
aren't too familiar with stop motion get
more into it it's kind of more intuitive
it's just so fun to just quickly and
easily put it into fun storytelling
emotive poses sticky bones can change
the way people work we envision the
world where sticky bones could be a part
of every animators toolkit and we're
really excited to make sticky bones a
reality</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
