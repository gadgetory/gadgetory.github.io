street

global problem today you can join us to

realize how what's in the air might
affect our health unless we have asthma
or allergies we don't notice any
immediate impact on our bodies and never
really care about the air around us but
during the day the concentration of
volatile organic compounds carbon
monoxide and carbon dioxide indoors may
increase dramatically if the ventilation
is not good enough with atmo tube it's
easy to track the pollution around you
and understand what you can do to
breathe better in the big cities we are
often exposed to air pollution outside
too but we are always too busy to pay
attention to it
aDNA tube will immediately alert you
about potential danger
so you can prevent negative health
impacts aDNA tube can sense
environmental changes in real time to
help to make the right choices every day
and live healthier
we have been helping other companies to
invent and develop hardware and software
products for years then we finally
decided that it's time to solve our own
problem we've been working on ACMA tube
for over a year to achieve the most
accurate readings from the sensors craft
it's beautiful and durable titanium body
and create the best user experience from
the data that the admah tube detects now

hiking products into one efficient
package we have completely redesigned
what a truck pull can be over 50% of
hikers do not hydrate properly while on
the trail this award-winning filtration
system used by the most successful
outdoor companies is proven to remove
99.99% of all waterborne bacteria
protozoa and microplastics

complicated filtration systems obsolete
by not only being much faster but much
green as well it allows you to carry
less weight and spend less time setting
up so you can spend more time fully
enjoying the beauty of the outdoors hi
I'm Kyle Stringham the creator of pure
Trek I lived in Utah at the base of the
Wasatch mountain range for most of my
life and I've always loved being in the
great outdoors but for years I've
struggled with one simple set back to my
outdoor recreation water filtration
standard pump filters are a hassle they
are complicated and tiring to use often
requiring lengthy setup times and
uncomfortable positions it was when I
became a father that I knew that I
needed to find a better solution with
two active kids caring enough water for
everyone is exhausting and listening to
lukewarm water slosh around in your
backpack only to have it run out the
first drink break is no fun for anybody
it's finally took a 21 mile hike with a
bunch of Boy Scouts for a solution to
present itself as I knelt by a small
stream with a bundle of trekking poles
under one arm the pieces of intricate
water pumps in the other it hit me a
trekking pole with a built-in water
filter it just made sense to combine
these two must-have tools into one
durable easy to use solution that would
give a reliable results for years to
come and I haven't looked back ever
since we spent the last two years
developing this product with multiple
patents and prototypes to ensure that
our product will stand up to the test of
regular outdoor use
the poll itself is built with the finest
materials utilizing carbon fiber for
absolute lightweight dependability to
use peer track simply place the carbide
tip into the water source with a flick
of your thumb open the silicon lid and
attach the drinking tube insert into a
water bottle a drink directly from it
cold refreshing purified water is only a
few points away we have brought together
a world-class manufacturing team to make
sure that you get your pure Trek on time
and in the highest quality possible--
we simply need your support to move on
to production so please back us today
and get back to what matters most the
beauty of the outdoors
