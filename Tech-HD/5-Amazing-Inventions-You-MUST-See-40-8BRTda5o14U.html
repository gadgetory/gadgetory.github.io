old and this clock is same old same old
isn't it time for an upgrade introducing
glance clock the clock that can tell you
that that and that at a glance glance
clocks brightly lit LEDs represent
information you choose to see ahead of
time it tells you who's calling gives
you reminders shows you the weather and
displays your schedule by showing you
all your appointments meetings and
events in different colors so you know
exactly how your day is laid out let's
see how Jeff uses his glance clock
connect Lance talk to your fitness
tracker and have it show how well you
slept or didn't sleep how many steps
you've taken or haven't taken check what
the weather is like so you know what to
wear before going outside
or use the timer so you don't forget
about the important things and know when
to leave the house when your uber is
outside glance clock lets you make the
right decisions and take action
hey i'm anton the creator of glass clock
we've decided to create a product that
seamlessly combined beauty and
information a clock was the perfect item
to upgrade because it's familiar
beautiful and functional at the Greek
glance you will know more than just the
time all the information you want we'll
be right in front of you we are really
excited about what they've created and
we would really allow your support so
leave this behind and move forward
pre-order your glance clock today
we all want to be that person the one
who wakes up early dive straight into a
morning meditation is super productive
at work drinks those eight glasses of
water and always hit the gym but let's
be real living that life means building
better habits and our brains want to
follow the ones we already have not the
new ones we're trying to cram it but
sometimes all you need is the right
nudge hi I'm Kayla and meet modi a smart
companion for building better habits we
created modi with a distinct purpose to
empower people to take those small steps
that over time result in big impacts in
our health and happiness these more than
just a cute face moody is designed in
the latest insights from both behavioral
science and social robotics when you
place modi in your home or office every
time you walk by he becomes an instant
reminder to keep committed each time you
do your habit moody is there to help you
track and celebrate your small wins
giving you that immediate gratification
the better you get the more excited /
details but slack off and Modi might get
angry for sat or stay purely encouraging
Modi knows what works best for you
because he's connected to the web he's
constantly analyzing and evolving so he
knows how you're progressing if you're
at risk of falling off and when to send
the right types of nudges specifically
for you compare all this to the same
daily push notification you keep
ignoring still how can something so
simple actually change your behavior to
tell you about how we form good habits
let's start with something that we're
all familiar with forming a bad habit
ooh cookie
fundamentally your brain needs three
things to form a habit a trigger a
routine and a reward when I saw that
plate of cookies I didn't even think
about grabbing life my brain immediately
triggered me and I knew that eating that
cookie would reward me with it sweet
Joey deliciousness your brain forms good
habits in just the same way by
completing this loop over and over again
modi works by seriously integrating
these three elements into your busy
lifestyle modi himself is a trigger more
specifically what's known as an
environmental cue and by using modi your
habit is already set up to be small
distinct and actionable finally movie
celebrations provide an immediate reward
he makes sure that you feel satisfied
and accomplished each and every time and
perhaps a bit guilty if you're not Moniz
the outcome of over a year of human
centered design and engineering rigor we
discovered that triggers and rewards
driven by emotion are far more potent
than numbers lists or alarms now we're
finally ready to release movies straight
to you the only question is what habit
will you
when we can't help you magically climb
Mount Everest or run a marathon
overnight he's there to help you do
something more essential become a better
you won have it at a time but we need
your help please back us and be a part
of bringing Modi to life
hi everyone we're back since our first
campaign we've shipped thousands of
units to people in places around the
world we've heard your feedback we've
created something three times more
powerful than the original
you
you
if you could take the wall outlet to go
what would you power share this campaign
with all your family in France and let's
live life off the grid let's take the
wall outlet anywhere
hi Kickstarter I'm Eddie last year you
raised nearly half a million dollars to
bring photo the first stick and shoot
camera to life since then we've shipped
to 37 countries grown our team and been
enjoying all the pota photos you've been
sharing online we've also learned how to
do what we do better so let's get to the
point photo is back and better than ever
and even more affordable if you haven't
heard of koto it works like this just
stick and shoot done how you shoot is up
to you and not the reach of your arm
photo sticks using our special micro
adhesive pad it's quicker and more
versatile than any mountain and it
doesn't wear out to clean it simply wipe
with water and it sticks like new ok so
that's the Poteau we know and love
here's how we made it even better we put
in a brand new image sensor with pixels
twice the size before bigger pixels
gather more light meaning less noise and
better low-light performance in other
words your photos will look amazing and
unless you're printing your photos
bigger than this how many pixels doesn't
matter their size matters and compared
to the iphone 6s and Galaxy s7 well our
pixels are bigger next we put in a wide
angle precision-cut blast lens not
overly fisheye wide but enough to fit
you and the whole crew ok so this is a
cool totally new feature you can now
connect up to 6 photos and control them
with one phone imagine a 360 degree
photo booth or multi-angle time lapse at
your next party best of all photo is
available on kickstarter for forty-nine
dollars it's our small way of saying
thank you for supporting us the first
time but act now because this price is
only available for these 30 days so
order your photo today and get one for a
friend let's get creative and fun with
the way you take photos thank you for
sharing your time with me and go poto
I
this is altered nozzle a beautiful new
type of aerator that fits into your
existing tab by atomizing water and
creating a missed you can do exactly the
same things you do today only with
ninety eight percent less water this is
what happens with your regular faucet
most of the water either bounces off
your skin or just passes your hands
without touching them at all that's
millions of gallons of water literally
slipping through our fingers and down
the drain we need to change that and
that's why we want your help so how do
we save ninety-eight percent of the
water without losing functionality the
trick is in atomization you break up the
water into millions of droplets and
basically you're creating your heavy
mist with our mist you're getting
contact with much much greater
percentage of the water almost all of it
that's why you can wash your hands do
your dishes with just a fraction of the
water coming out of your tap but
sometimes you need more water that's why
we developed the switch in switch mode
you still save eighty-five percent of
the water compared to your regular tap
but you still get all the water you need
approximately eighteen percent of the
water used in our homes is water running
through our taps that's about thirty two
gallons of water per household per day
if we do the math and look at some of
the most water stress cities in the
world that's about 220 million gallons
of water running through the taps in
Tokyo 240 millions in Shanghai 40
million gallons in Los Angeles and 50
million in Rio de Janeiro every day and
most of it is down the drain
there are already millions of forces in
the world that's why we developed the
auto nozzle to be easily installed and
your existing one by altering your
existing faucet rather than buying a new
one you get the same effect but the
fraction of the cost the faucet is also
part our interior design so if it
doesn't look good it just going to end
up in some drawer that's why we spend a
lot of time designing the altered nozzle
we ended up with this drop shape it
clearly makes a mission statement but at
the same time it makes it easy to switch
between midst and saber mode today over
1 billion people are living in areas
with extreme water stress it affects
people in the United States Brazil China
Spain basically everywhere and by the
end of the year twenty twenty an
estimated three billion people are going
to live in these areas it's something we
need to do something about we're ready
for production but we need your help to
fund the first line of altered nozzles
be part of creating a really cool
product something we believe can be a
small and simple solution to a huge
problem oh and if you like it please
spread the word thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
