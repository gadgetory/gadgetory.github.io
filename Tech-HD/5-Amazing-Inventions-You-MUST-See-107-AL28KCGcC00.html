as people increasingly depend on the
smartphone's to organize their personal
life it is becoming evident that the
traditional computer has been replaced
by the smartphone as the main servant of
our digital needs from a simple way to
communicate it became the one device
that is every device mere access
introduces the mirror
the mirror book is health laptop and the
other half is in your pocket
it's just smartphone plug in your phone
and unleash its real power
instead of having a limited interface on
a small screen now you can be productive
in a 13-inch display with a keyboard and
a mouse pad the mobile first revolution
simplifies your life with only one
device to secure store your data and
access Internet
with its 24 hours battery and its slim
design you have the perfect combination
from mobility on-the-go
whether you need to make some research
work on your PowerPoint presentation or
just take notes
the mayor book is made for best abuses
you can play with the millions of apps
available on your windows or Android
phone
hi I'm Yanni and CEO and co-founder of
miracle over the past years we've been
working really hard on the new book
we've been to the Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas the IFA in Berlin and
the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
all of this to get feedback and bring
you the perfect neuropathy this campaign
is a turning point and not something
will change at the with thanks to you
the mirror team will grow and we were
able to finalize the motherboard and
cause manufacturers the mirror book is
part of something much bigger and the
mobile first revolution will rise by the
end of the year with your help
hi Kickstarter I'm young I've been
trying to go paperless for some years
now I've tried it with the iPad and all
kinds of styluses but it never really
worked it was impossible to write and
rest the hand on the screen spiders were
not precise and mostly it was just an
unsatisfying experience until the new
iPad pro and the Apple pencil came out I
was blown away by its responsiveness and
that you could finally rest the hand on
the iPad while writing regrettably the
plastic you feel when writing on the
iPad was an Apple pencil disappointed me
as I really missed the haptic feedback I
then decided to fix this as there was no
good solution in the market yet after
some extensive research and testing we
created this I colored the paper like
it's the iPad pro screen protector that
makes writing on the iPad with the Apple
pencil feel like writing on paper it's
incredible how it completes the iPad pro
experience no matter if in a meeting or
simply collecting thoughts handwriting
with the Apple Notes app and the paper
like is the most paper like digital
experience ever
you can even rest your hand on the
display without leaving finger marks
sketching with professional sketching
apps and the paper life is simply set
awesome with the paper like you have
more stroke control and your hand slides
nicely on the iPad surface making the
sketching experience much more rewarding
no more printing no more heavy books or
documents you can now write directly on
a page make notes or highlight on the
iPad while keeping the paper filled
combine the haptic feedback of paper
with today's connected digital tools
apart from also protecting your screen
from scratches the paper like
drastically reduces glare without at all
interfering with the Apple pencil
functionality forget that called an
alien sensation of hard rubber on glass
the paper like is an awesome iPad pro
upgrade for paper people like me check
out the rewards I'm sure there's still a
place for you in there and I'm looking
forward to revolutionizing your iPad pro
experience and having you onboard
