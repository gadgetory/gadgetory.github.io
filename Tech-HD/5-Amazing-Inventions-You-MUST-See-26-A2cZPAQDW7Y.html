development on mo G's Pro a small device
that can turn anything into a musical
instrument mo G's is now used by
professional musicians and DJs all over
the world to bring unique sounds and
performances to life but this got us
thinking could we create a device that
could be used for a range of
applications from making music to
playing games
something simple to use something fun
a device that everyone wants to play
with that also feels right at home in
the classroom we thought so so we came
up with mo G's play because with it you
can play the world
mo G's plays senses vibrations in the
objects it is attached to when these
objects are touched in different ways mo
G's play interprets them into sands or
actions on screen you can use pretty
much anything around you the software
we've made is extensive Jam makes you
the artist giving you accessible tools
to instantly build rhythms melodies and
loops using the acoustic properties of
the objects ranging
pulse is an addictive rhythm game it's
fast fun and unlike anything you've
played before it teaches the building
blocks of rhythm by stealth from simple
dance beats to afro-cuban patterns at mo
G's we want as many people as possible
to use mo G's play so we will be sharing
our technology with everyone allowing
developers to invent new ways to inspire
entertain and teach with mo G's play
with your help mo G's play will be super
affordable we will include software as a
free service our Kickstarter backers
will get new features and apps in the
future as we develop them and we'll also
offer special mo G's play plans for
educational and therapeutic
organizations with your support we want
to help a new generation of musicians
students gamers and tech pioneers around
the world to start playing and creating
with this unique technology we need your
help to achieve our ambition of bringing
a truly unique device for gaming music
and education to life
help us to launch more display as an
affordable product by supporting this
campaign thank you

luggage my trips got ruined and I know
that we do smart are going to be able to
travel with peace of mind so I'm super
