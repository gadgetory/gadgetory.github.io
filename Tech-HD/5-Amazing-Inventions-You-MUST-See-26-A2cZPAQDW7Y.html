development on mo geez Pro a small
device that can turn anything into a
musical instrument mo geez is now used
by professional musicians and deejays
all over the world to bring unique
sounds and performances to life but this
got us thinking could we create a device
that could be used for a range of
applications from making music to
playing games something simple to use
something fun the device that everyone
wants to play with that also feels right
at home in the classroom we thought so
so we came up with mo geez play because
with it you can play the world mo geez
plays senses vibrations in the objects
it is attached to when these objects are
touched in different ways mo geez play
interprets them into sends or actions on
screen you can use pretty much anything
around use the software we've made is
extensive Jam makes you the artist
giving you accessible tools to instantly
build rhythms melodies and loops using
the acoustic properties of the objects
ranging
pulse is an addictive rhythm game it's
fast fun and unlike anything you've
played before it teaches the building
blocks of rhythm by stealth from simple
dance beats to afro-cuban patterns at mo
geez we want as many people as possible
to use mo geez play so we will be
sharing our technology with everyone
allowing developers to invent new ways
to inspire entertain and teach with mo
geez play with your help mo geez play
will be super affordable we will include
software as a free service our
Kickstarter backers will get new
features and apps in the future as we
develop them and will also offer special
mo geez play plans for educational and
therapeutic organizations with your
support we want to help a new generation
of musicians students gamers and tech
pioneers around the world to start
playing and creating with this unique
technology we need your help to achieve
our ambition of bringing a truly unique
device for gaming music and education to
life help us to launch magis play as an
affordable product by supporting this
campaign thank you
mo jeez play come and play the world

traveler and even guys like this
pull the handle and the app will tell
you the exact weight of your carry-on so
that you never have to check it because
you pack too much god knows what a

even this guy wait a minute is this even
possible who invented this developing
new technology behind smart was a really
fun challenge we have to create new
devices combining sensors the two
mechanical devices and everything
connected to a microcomputer we needed
to come with the software to control
form your phone beyond the physical
carry on we're super excited about the
features we're building into that
imagine blue smart singing to your
calendar and to travel services that you
use so that you know when and what to

all your trips and see trends about your
travel habits all in one place the
suitcase becomes your personal travel
assistant and we think that's pretty
cool if you think about it suitcases
haven't seen much innovation for several
decades so we set out to reimagine how a
suitcase for this century should be blue
smart is a quantum leap for today's
travel we created a product that is
beautiful and powerful and yet
remarkably simple to use I am personally
super excited about blue smart because
it's a product that I would love to have
myself I traveled in the past and
because of problems with my luggage my
troops got ruined and I know that we do
smart are going to be able to travel
with peace of mind so I'm super excited
on top of that my phone is never gonna
run out of battery anymore and that's
pretty cool thank you for watching and
