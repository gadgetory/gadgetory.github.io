better to do than hitting the nearby
lake to refresh yourself
but once you've arrived you are faced
with this familiar and awkward situation
you want to jump into the water but who
will take care of your valuables
introducing the spin safe a compact and
lightweight outdoor vault that screws
easily and securely into the ground
so far we're taking lots of risks
regarding the loss of our valuables
finally this has come to an end put your
valuables inside and lock the spin safe
with its top shell and combination lock
finally you can go swimming or play
beach volleyball without any worries all
accessible parts rotate freely
therefore the safe cannot be removed
until it is unlocked again beyond
physical protection our theft warning
app helps to make the spin safe even
safer if someone is tampering with it a
noisy acoustic signal alerts you and
people around our outdoor vault is
developed and produced in Germany in an
eco-friendly manner as it contains a
high percentage of recycled material but
the best thing is you'll not only have
one more lest but you'll always have
cash at hand for a tasty scoop of ice

sorry a new type of furniture collection
designed for maximum flexibility and
based on a modular framework this six
piece furniture collection can be mixed
and matched provide over 20 functional
uses for your home so you can create and
recreate the furniture you need without
many tools variety is aligning furniture
with the way we actually live today our
homes are way more dynamic than they've
ever been in the past now there are
remote offices Airbnb rentals and
Instagram backdrops hi I'm Jaime I'm
Laura and we are the creators of Aria if
you're a person like me who moves a lot
you know it's really frustrating trying
to find functional furniture that's
first of all enough to keep up the first
apartment I ever moved into I bought
these really cool barstools and I love
them I moved into my next apartment that
had a really small kitchen and I didn't
meet the barstools so I just put them
over in the corner and they were sitting
there for months until eventually I sold
them on Craigslist lo and behold a
couple months later I moved into an
apartment that needed barstools even if
you're not dealing with the pains of
moving for still furniture is essential
for compact urban living I live in a
small apartment I love having my friends
over to cook however I don't have enough
seats for everyone sometimes people end
up sitting on the floor
I need furniture to adapt when I have
people over but not always space on an
ordinary day
so when me and Laura first started out
we analyzed the dimensions of every
object in the typical home and we
noticed that of our stools the same
height as the legs for a desk but coffee
table is the same height of the seat of
a chair and the headboard for your bed
is the same size of the four person
kitchen table these shared dimensions
power bar area by reinventing nearly
every piece of furniture in a home with
a simple framework the Bharat collection
has two elements frames and accessories
the first element is the frame right now
we have two standard frames a jade frame
and a seat frame each joint is welded
steel which will not come loose unlike
flat-pack furniture sold in post regular
stores the frames are powder coated
paint which makes these pieces water and
scratch resistant so you can use them
indoors or outdoors the phrase are light
so you can move them to transform your
space or move them to your new home the
second element is the interchangeable
accessories our goal is to design
accessories that are useful wolf on and
out of the frames the accessories are
made of high quality materials that will
age and we're gracefully such as solid
wood
not press board that disintegrates or
veneer nut peels the Farian collection
is designed for quick assembly you will
no longer take you boxes of tools
interpret confusing gay rights or store
leftover hardware when it's time for a
change simply push the top out of the
frame to bring this product to market we
need your help
we're on Kickstarter to raise the funds
we need for manufacturing startup and to
build our online store to give you the
furniture you need maria is furniture
that makes sense for the way we live
today we moved between cities we run
businesses out of our apartments we have
band practices we host dinner parties
and we build new technology in our homes
our homes our studios meditation spaces
and urban greenhouses we need furniture
that can transform our home into the
spaces we need when we need them
Varia is furniture as dynamic as you are</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
