if you always snore loudly I'll make
choking noises while you sleep
or you have morning headaches and don't
feel rested after sleeping if you have
excessive sleepiness I believe that you
have sleep apnea what this means is that
your heart and other vital organs become
starved of oxygen that can lead to a lot
of health problems normally you will
need a series of tests and an overnight
sleep study in a sleep clinic go to
sleep is the new way to monitor your
sleep and screen sleep apnea to use go
to sleep all you need to do is put it on
before you go to sleep at night and take
it off when you wake up in the morning
it's the smallest home sleep test device
on the market it weighs only about six
grams and looks like a capsule held in a
soft silicon ring the battery can last
three whole nights and the memory can
record seven nights sleep data go to
sleep keeps a track of your blood oxygen
saturation heart rate perfusion index
tossing and turning during your sleep
and you will get whole night of sleep
monitor to test the severity of your
sleep apnea it was fascinating to see
such a detailed analysis of my sleep
pattern I've always had a snoring
problem but I didn't know my blood
oxygen levels dropped from 96 to 80 to
20 times in an hour which was really
scary
but this could change it all sleep apnea
can come with a range of clinical issues
such as feeling constantly sleepy in the
daytime fatigue and high blood pressure
stroke and heart attacks no arrhythmias
and diabetes all this can seriously
weaken the immune system a classic sleep
apnea patient that we think of is an
overweight man with a large belly and a
thick neck however it can affect anyone
9% of women and 24% of men suffer from
sleep apnea unfortunately over 80% go
undiagnosed and untreated the condition
really needs long-term management go to
sleep provides continuous data instead
of just the snapshots that clinical
monitoring provides by continuously
collecting and mining your sleep data
the correlation of some chronic disease
with your sleep quality can be revealed
I've gone from wearing all this at night
to this tiny little ring I just
literally put it on at night wake up in
the morning check the app and it's all
done cannot believe it I really want to
get one
use go to sleep every night to get a
better night's rest and to improve your
overall sleep health and lifestyle
