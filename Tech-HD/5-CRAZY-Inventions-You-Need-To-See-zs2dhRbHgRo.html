Kubota is looking forward to jamming
with you that's why we want your mate
the Bandicoot a single chassis quad
optic lightweight fully adjustable USB
rechargeable silicon headlamp headlamps
or head torches are usually fabric
straps buckles and bulky boots the
Bandicoot is designed differently so
there's no more bouncing around fiddling
with yourself blinding yourself blinding
others waking others wearing out and
looking
the advantage of using the silicon in
the Bandicoot is it allows you to merge
the strap with the housing in the one
material and therefore doing so it makes
it more streamlined and less bulky I
guess the truth with silicon is what you
can do with it it's more versatile is
more comfortable it's less obtrusive the
overmolding allows us to house the leads
and battery in one chassis but without
the bulk and oversimplified optics of
traditional headlamps it doesn't tangle
your hair it's not like a rubber band
waterproof it's easy to clean and this
makes it ideal for running hiking
climbing fixing camping
beer pong ii searching reading sleeping
