there's one thing that we could all use
a little bit more of its space big
clunky furniture can make your home feel
more like a cage sometimes finding
something as simple as finding a place
to put your nightstand can become quite
the challenge so I set out to create a
solution that would work for everyone in
every living situation from the college
dorm room to the studio apartment to the
best of all and my favorite the bunk bed
this bedside shelf is easy to install it
attaches firmly to the edge of your bed
frame without tools using a simple and
time-tested clamp and knob mechanism of
course it had to be extremely sturdy to
safely hold all of your bedside needs
design wise it features rounded edges
and a neat wire slot for charging your
phone we chose to handcraft the bed
shelf feet out of bamboo
do you love bamboo it's four times
harder than oak and matures in just
three to five years it's eco friendly
and has a ton of great character over
numerous designs and sketches later
we've arrived to a clean minimal form
offering a wide range of versatility
