Leroy is again
sometimes he wins sometimes not
oh come on Leroy don't be mad
everyone loses you just need to find
something to give you an edge
cue the loop box new box
this is the beacon a wearable gaming
device feel the power feel equipped with
color changing LED lighting and attached
directly to the Shuar foot the beacon
connects to the PC via bluetooth and can
be mapped freely the beacon works
alongside your preferred peripherals in
any game for more interaction at the
same time the beacon links the motion of
your foot to whatever keystrokes you
would like with four distinct motions
Leroy has immediate access to up to 24
additional hotkeys use it to pilot your
ship or to transform your character or
to change your sense and want to the
right or to the left and or I guess roll
back to the right and then come on Leroy
now you're just rolling around in the
dirt let's get going want to keep your
focus on movement and aiming use your
foot to switch weapons to reload
I've leaned from cover or anything you
want and thanks to the beacons zero
point calibration you can play in
whatever position you want for tactic
sake or simply to make it gaming more
comfortable
the beacon reduces mechanical fail
making trigger complex combo without the
use of automation scripts are macros the
possibilities are endless you're saying
I can map anything I want of course you
can you can map any key or any game you
can oh wait a minute I see what you're
doing here
well played Leroy
you
Atari on
more than 40 years ago Atari opened a
portal into our living rooms with the
Atari 2600 now we're ready to reopen
that portal and introduce a brand new
atari product inspired by the past but
created designed and engineered for
today introducing the Atari VCS the 2600
was just this meteor from another planet
it crashed here and kicked off the
evolution of all gaming life as we know
it not only was this sort of a video
game console but it was turning
television into a more social activity
it was like we were transported into the
future something magical happening on
the TV for the first time it is pretty
exciting to see Atari kind of come back
and take what they did well and
reimagine that for this new generation
that are playing games differently
consuming media differently having
different social experiences around this
type of media taking everything we loved
about that first sort of simple retro
Atari experience the first time we use
it and bringing it into a modern context
which is a bit more complex one of the
unique things about the Atari VCS is its
PC architecture and Linux operating
system you can play hundreds of classic
Atari games on it but there's more to it
than that
modern games will be there too along
with social media streaming video music
and so much more hey Atari let's play
tempest 4000 our mission was to create
an iconic and authentic Atari product
one that's beautiful and evokes emotion
not just another box to shove under your
TV the 2600 offers this amazing palette
of iconic details you've got toggle
switches and woodgrain fins and angles
we looked at taking each of those core
components and evolving it for a next
generation it was something that feels
like it felt and not trying to look how
it looked then so with the 2600 it was a
box with ribbing on a surface and we
were looking at that detail and started
talking about well what if the box was
entirely ribs it's not a box with
applied ribs it's actually constructed
from individual fins and layers we found
a way to inlay a real natural wood
product and it's a beautiful finish but
it also becomes a really
if part of the product the interface
shines through that material we feel
strongly that a product like this
deserves a little more thought a little
more effort a little more heart by
solving for design intent
manufacturability thermals designed for
assembly all at the same time one of the
things that was exciting me the most
about it was the controller to see sort
of a reimagined yet more versatile
version of the same thing that I grew up
with in my hand was instantly the one
thing that I was super happy with we
wanted to do something really special
for our biggest Atari fans we've created
a special launch edition of the VCS only
available on IndieGoGo Atari is kind of
transcended beyond even those who had a
chance to play it everything that I've
personally done in gaming past that
point all trails back to those original
roots it's a refreshing breath of air to
have the Atari brand come back to gaming
technology has transformed our world
forever it's how we keep in touch with
friends and family that was Sharon most
precious moments and now we explore the
world so we find answers and learn new
things invites us to wonder and ask
questions technologies allowed us to
overcome every obstacle in boundary
connecting people and ideas from around
the world uniting us and bringing us
closer together but what about our data
think about it more information about
our lives is being collected than any
other time in history
every day we rely on services that have
failed us time and time again from
getting hacked to the misuse and selling
of private information it seems almost
impossible to keep our data safe but
what if we didn't have to give it up at
all last year we came to you with an
idea with your support we were able to
build software and ship thousands of
devices that has improved online
security for individuals and businesses
worldwide but filter is just the
beginning this is beam
it's a router that encrypts all your
information at breathtaking speeds so
your internet provider can't see what
you're doing and services can't track
you it'll protect all the devices in
your home from threats online keeps your
physical location hidden so you can
access any part of the internet from
anywhere in the world it's the world's
most advanced router we created being
because we believe technology should
empower humanity not exploit our nature
to connect and learn your privacy
matters and it's worth protecting and
now more than ever join us today visit
the link below for more information or
share this video to help spread the word
where passel and our goal is to create a
better future all we need is you
