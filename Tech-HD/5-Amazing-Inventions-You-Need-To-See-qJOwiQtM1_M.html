pound skin on frame boat that folds up
neatly into a backpack assembly takes
just three to four minutes and is super
easy because the aluminum frame is
already inside the boat skin designed
with adventure and travel in mind the K
pack is versatile durable and
comfortable to operate above all it
provides easy access to the water
anywhere hey I'm Pete flood creator and
founder of the folding boat company and
I love spending time outdoors it used to
be that whenever it be traveling hiking
or exploring I'd often find myself in
these outrageously beautiful places near
water but unable to take advantage of
all the opportunities while I was there
you know I realized that canoes and
other small boats are kind of heavy and
bulky to use they weren't very practical
so I did some research and found there
were other folding kayaks out there but
they were all very expensive and a
little bit difficult to assemble I
realized I needed a folding boat that
would be super light compact and easy to
assemble a boat you could have with you
all the time and take anywhere the K
pack is just that a versatile
lightweight packable skin-on frame boat
that features a simple assembly to get
you on the water in the quickest most
stress-free way possible the butterfly K
pack uses a patented ingenious
wicked-cool
internal aluminum frame that pops open
and locks into place in just a few
seconds the lower portion of this frame
is attached to and nest between four
independent air tubes that run the
length of the boat when you attach the
pump that comes with your boat to the
manifold you will fill each air tube
simultaneously which allows the boat to
fill symmetrically every time inflating
the air tubes compresses the frame to
the outer skin these air tubes also
provide shock absorption and floatation
to ensure durability we use custom-made
high tenacity polyester fabrics coated
with urethane for maximum terror and
abrasion resistance our seams are sealed
with radiofrequency welding machines the
assembly is designed to be very simple
you can set it up with your eyes closed
but what's most important is folks say
it's the most comfortable seat they've
ever paddled from when it's time to play
you shouldn't have to worry or think
about how much effort it's going to take
to get your boat ready if you like to
travel it's easy to take this boat with
you you can even check it when traveling
by commercial airlines plus the boats
are light enough you can pack extra gear
and clothes inside the backpack this
boat is so compact it can live in your
closet or under your bed ready to go in
a moment's notice and the bonus there's
no need to spend $600 on a roof rack it
fits perfectly in your trunk allowing
you to finally reach those hard to
access places you've always dreamed of
it's also a very stable boat great for
fishing exploring nature photography a
lazy paddle or an excuse to get outside
for some fresh air maybe even an upper
body workout from urban areas to
backcountry secret spots does solo take
your family or even carry multiple boats
if you need to say you are camping
RVing or even if you have an extra hour
- on a Sunday afternoon with a K pack
you have an easy option to go play on
the water you can get some fishing in
take the kids for a paddle or find some
serenity on a quiet lake or river we
like to think it's more important than
ever folks to get outside so they can
appreciate and support the natural
wonders this world has to offer thank
you for backing our project go unfold
your next adventure
my MacBook charging is broke because
nothing lasts forever and everything you
love will die and Apple hates its
consumers god I'm actually started
crying of my broken macbook charger I am
such a fool baby I broke my third
consecutive macbook charger I don't
lasso these these things they are
durable hey Atmore gorilla we are
lassoing arch either check this out hey
I'm Scott and I'm Lucas we've designed
something for the tweeters and everyone
else who's been round to 80 bucks for a
broken back book charger
it's called juice box it's a case of
eventually charger cord from frame juice
box there's a patent-pending trumpeter
design which keeps your cord from
bending at sharp angles we got here by
having this problem ourselves well hi
state product design students and we
enter the idea of a juice box in a
competition at school after taking first
place we use the winnings to begin
prototyping through multiple stages of
designing 3d printing mold making and
product testing we arrived at this we
put a lot of work in a juice box but now
we're asking for your support to put a
juice box in your hands so check out our
wards and back us on Kickstarter
we we cheers in drinking our children
and then to the air we're choosing each
other that's it that was perfectly
awkward
stones which ISA leading us love is all
will ever trust ya know I don't always
through the wastelands through the
highways to my shadow through the
sunrays and
the way melodies we haven't played I
don't know
going around these walls fighting to
create a song mr. B
we'll go
through the wastelands through the
highways through my shadow through the
sunrays
hey Kickstarter I'm Tom this is Dan and
this is the mark one a minimal durable
retractable pin last year we launched
Hanna book a notebook for your desk the
perfect follow-up of course is a nice
pen to go along side it there's nothing
quite like riding with a high quality
pen and we think you'll love what we
made a pen in many ways is an incredibly
personal tool and we spent the last
several months fussing over every detail
through countless iterations it all
started when we discovered a fantastic
refill beloved in the pin world the
Schmidt p8 won 2-6 rollerball it quickly
became our favorite so we thought we
should make a great pin for this refill
so that's what we did the Schmidt refill
is a dream to write with the ink flows
smoothly and dries quickly the pen body
for mark 1 is completely seamless it has
no logo and comes in two colors the
black and white they both have a
slightly textured matte finish and the
polished metal not to provide a nice
little accent to each we always knew
that we wanted our pen to be a
retractable click pen but getting there
was another story
there are many off-the-shelf click
mechanisms we could have used but none
of them were quite right for what we
wanted so naturally you're making our
own mechanism it's an all-metal
construction which gives it an
incredibly satisfying click seriously
the video doesn't do it justice you've
got to feel this thing to believe it
every part of the mark 1 is made out of
metal making it the first all-metal
click pin on the market and the pin is
coated with seracote an extremely
durable ceramic polymer coating which
aside from being incredibly robust gives
the pin a great feel in the hand since
everything about this pen is custom
machine there's a sizable upfront cost
to get it off the ground
so if you're interested in supporting
your new favorite pen hit the green
button to help ring mark won into
existence thanks for watching and have a
great
here's a question for you have you ever
had the situation you're out working on
your laptop and find your battery is
nearly out of power it's not too
surprising and without a power adapter
on hand the only option is to ask others
and hope that their power adapter
matches yours as technology advances
more and more products are switching
over to type-c charging as an industry
standard but unfortunately other older
charging options are rendered obsolete
having little utility or purpose but to
be tossed out or boxed up introducing
anyone a smart adapter that gives you
the power to easily connect to most
traditional chargers no matter the
voltage settings and conveniently and
safely charge your laptop or mobile
device with any watt you'll have more
options and more flexibility when it
comes to charging you can borrow nearly
any charger from your colleagues friends
or strangers at any time in any place
and ensure your laptop stays charged
that's one less thing you'll ever have
to think about currently any watt
supports three main power interfaces
ThinkPad DC and MagSafe chargers the
product uses smart charge technology
supporting a USB PD charging standard
which means it can automatically adapt
the output based on what it connects
with 20 volt 15 volts 12 volts 3 a the
any watt is a modern design adapter
that's super small and ultra portable
easily stored with your computer gear
are attached to one of your old chargers
making sure that your power supply is
stabilized and always ready to go
our team's intention for the any wot
design really sprung from a desire to
reduce a waste and find a more greener
solution that would leave a lighter
footprint the adapter was our answer
protect the environment stay green and
save everyone support our campaign and
get a limited time offer on the any watt
adapter take a moment select one of our
pledges support environmental friendly
tech support anyone Thanks
