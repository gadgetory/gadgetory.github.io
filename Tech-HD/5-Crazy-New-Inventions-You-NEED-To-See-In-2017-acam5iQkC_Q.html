with you the Riptide r1 an electric
skateboard that blends massive power and
a compact design let's check it out
the riptides has dual belt-driven motors
at 1,800 watts of power you can fly up
the line and get it to the top speed of
20 miles per hour in no time with all
that power riding up hills is no problem
the board is rated for 8 miles of range
and it actually gets it once you get
your destination just grab it and go
more than anything I designed the
riptides out of my love for surfing
skating and snowboarding this board was
built by riders for riders which drove
some very key decisions first it had to
have a kick tail so I can tack it around
or kick it up then it had to be built to
shred so it can handle anything I throw
at it to ensure a smooth ride it has
wide trucks and some of the best long
boarding wheels on the market finally I
knew I'd want to bring it on all my
adventures so our battery pack is UN
approved and airline friendly I've
ridden almost every electric skateboard
on the market and I found the perfect
board for me doesn't exist so I designed
the riptides focusing on big-time power
and a small pad
at Riptide Electric we build a board
that blends massive power and a small
package if you can handle it you're
gonna love the way it rides
what's the difference between these two
Mustangs same engine same transmission
the $15,000 difference is in the new
technology but why pay $15,000 when you
can get the same technology for 399

hi I'm Chris you've been watching a
right track of my product shred mate
we've taken a humble speed sensor back
to the drawing board to create the first
dedicated mountain bike computer shred
matrix for speed jumps g-forces and
trails completely automatically our
algorithms convert dates for a motion
sensor to measure your jump time and
landing g-force by training to reduce
your landing g-force Rebney helps you
improve your jump technique and flow
shred matrix pg4 still on the trail and
ultimately detects rough trail sections
so you can easily view the total imagery
there are sections of trail that
mattered the most the sensor attaches to
your fork and connects via bluetooth to
our app which is a free download a
manufacturer is ready and we've received
our final four sites by backing us
you'll be helping to raise the funds to
meet our minimum order quantity help me
make shred materiality so you can start
tracking and improving your riding thank
you for watching please share this
campaign
alright guys I got my Andrew
phone here it's already connected to the
MCE MCU unit inside of my arm I'm gonna
bring up the ink tattoo app now which
controls the display in my arm so by
default I have a bunch of different
tattoos loaded in here I can now
actually go ahead and load these tattoos
directly onto my arm I'll just be there
yeah so I can go ahead and any contacts
damn and you can just upload your own
yeah so you know if we have our default
tattoos in here but in the long term
we'll have anything that can be loaded
onto that and I can cycle through these
tattoos from the app I can control
anything on the EI display so we can
load different app connections on there
the dashboards we can also do animation
so check this out resolution is pretty
good on that yeah so the refresh rate is
good and the load times are really
really fast
