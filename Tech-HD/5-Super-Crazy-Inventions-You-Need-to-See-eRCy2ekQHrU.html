dream big where your story begins our
memories are created where you leave
everything you love expecting it to be
there when you return great pizza by the
way let's talk about home security we've
all heard the statistics a burglary
happens every 15 seconds
half of all burglars simply use the
front door 74% of burglaries happening
regular residential neighborhoods but
only 2% of burglars have a mustache as
glorious as mine
did you know that burglars are three
times as likely to break into a home
without any visible signs of a security
system thank you for calling alarm how

habits and provide the highest level of
home monitoring now can Fido do that and

stick the alarm monitors to whichever

the past two years our team's been
working on the world's smartest home
alarm system and now we're ready to make
your home a safer place we believe that
home security should not just be a
luxury but a necessity so back us today
14 months ago I gathered together a
great team of talented designers and
engineers to develop a totally new type
of backpacks the idea was born from the
sheer number of times when I found that
I just didn't have enough space in my
backpack however I didn't want to lug
around a huge back normally it's
unnecessary cumbersome and just plain
ugly a modern person needs just a laptop
bag to go to work or to the coffee house
still when you need to carry your new
purchases or temp loads if there must be
enough space inside but now after many
months of hard work we are so excited to
share the results with you we'd like to
introduce you to lead pack the most
functional urban tech backpack attack
our fundamental goal was to create an
expandable system which allows you to
get an unbelievable capacity in an
incredibly thin pack so now when you
need a bigger bag you can create one in
just two seconds
living in a crowded city we know
perfectly well what it means to worry
constantly about the safety of our
belongings if that is why the second key
feature we focused on was FLE flex
anti-theft protection
hidden sense and a special security
front panel are primarily designed to
make a getting in sight bleed back
impossible without attracting your
attention and of course but there is a
built-in lock
we created two different compartments
one to keep your work items in but the
second compartment is tailored to hold
your personal staff we thought through
every detail that you could possibly
need in an everyday backpack we came up
with secure but easy access to hidden
pockets hidden sternum strap easy access
to an extra charger and lots and lots of
other features
bleeped back is the result of a
collective passion and we want you to
join us on this journey please read this
project and share the video on your
social networks now
you
life is about experiences it's about
getting out of your comfort zone doing
the things you love and never feeling
held back we wanted to simplify the
complicated nature of scuba diving while
pushing the restricting boundaries of
snorkeling we wanted to bridge these two
domains in the best way possible this is
super hookah the world's smartest and
safest hookah diving system whether
you're a scuba diver snorkeler free
diver vacationer or thrill seeker super
hookah is made for you it simply floats
on the surface of the water air is
pulled through the snorkel and is pumped
down the air line to the regulator
allowing you to dive up to 30 feet or 10
meters for as long as two hours on a
single charge our power bank utilizes
the safest faa-approved batteries and
with the included solar panel you can
recharge on the beach and head out for
another dive it's never been easier to
explore new worlds
supera hookah is packed full of features
in a compact design convenient interior
storage allows the airline smart vest
goggles and snorkel to be stowed inside

wallet and other personal items with you
on the water stored safely inside you

while you dive you can even film your
dive through the viewing window with a
smartphone camera or gopro safety has
always been our number one priority so
we've included a ton of features that
will keep you safe in the water the best
mounted controller lets you keep an eye
on battery life audibly and visually
alerting you when it's time to ascend or
additional base mounted strobe lights
will activate in unison with the
controller's LEDs our dive smart vest
with auto inflation can safely assist
you to the surface if the batteries are
fully depleted or if the air line is
severed or disconnected in case of an
emergency you can inflate the smart vest

air reserve directly from your vest
