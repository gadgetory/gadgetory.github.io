round off the sharp corner of a table
top so you scrounge for something a can
a lid a coin that you can use to trace a
curve that's reasonably close to what
you need rocklers corner radius routing
templates offer a quicker more accurate
and more easily repeatable way of not
dis tracing but also cutting precise
curves on sharp corners the set includes
three durable inputs that provide 12
different radii along with a fence that
offers excellent control when working in
a router table with the bearing guided
flush trim bit using them as easy pick
the radius you want a machine on the
corner and snap the fence into place
clips and posts on the fence allow quick
alignment and rubber strips on the
bottom of the template help prevent
shifting
put the template on your workpiece and
set the bit height so the bearing will
run along the edge of the template make
sure the posts and clips are tight
against the edges of the workpiece grip
the finger hold then route in the
direction indicated on the fence
keeping the bearing against the edge of
the template you end up with a precise
radius on your workpiece that requires
only a little finish sanding if you want
to quickly easily and accurately shape
curves on the corners of tabletops
countertops and more check out rocklers
corner radius routing templates at your
local Rockler retail store or at Rockler
calm the Rockler center offset marking
tool lets you take care of two tedious
tasks with one convenient device the
first is drawing a centerline on the
edge of a board just put a common
number-two pencil in the center hole
place the tool on the board twist it
until the posts make contact and then
slide just like that you have a
perfectly centered line on boards up to
one and a half inches thick the second
job is marking offset or reveals four
jobs like installing moldings just flip
the tool but it against the board choose
the offset and slide the tool to draw
the line it marks offsets from 1/16 to
1/2 inch from the edge in 1/16
increments when you're done you can take
advantage of the built-in magnet to
store it on a metal surface for easy
retrieval next time the center offset
marking tool another Rockler innovation
to help you create with coffee you love
turning but hate the tedious and
time-consuming sharpening that goes with
it you need to take a look at
woodpeckers new ultra shear turning
tools these revolutionary new turning
tools feature razor sharp replaceable
carbide inserts that have been carefully
engineered to cut cleaner and last
longer than any other carbide insert on
the market
shaping your project with ultra share
tools couldn't be simpler first adjust
your tool rest so the cutting edge is on
the centerline of your lathe keep your
tool level with the floor and press into
the stock moving side-to-side creating
the profile you want use the square
insert tool for initial roughing and for
outside curves or beads use the round
insert tool for inside curves or coves
the round insert also works great for
hollowing bowls the sharp detail tool
inscribes precise lines to accent your
work there's also an optional radius
detail tool for fine beads and coves now
here's the feature that separates ultra
shear from all the others when your
project is nearly complete roll the tool
right or left on your tool rest until
it's sitting flat on one of the
alternate bearing surfaces now the
cutting insert is on a 45 degree angle
to the stop make another lighter cut
still keeping the tool level with the
floor you'll notice the cut is much
cleaner needing little or no sanding
let's take a closer look at how each
component of the ultra shear tool comes
together to make the best carbide insert
turning tool on the market the tool
shank is milled from a special chromoly
steel tough enough to be used for NASCAR
roll cages after machining the tanks go
through a two-stage heat treating
process that makes the shaft rigid and
smooth minimising vibration and making
the tool glide easily across your tool
rest and the sides are tapered to
prevent interference in your tightest
cuts the seats for each insert are
carefully designed to provide full
support bracing the insert with at least
three points of contact the tool handles
are turned from rock
with a hand rubbed oil finish aircraft
grade aluminum Ferrell's support the
handle where the tool shank is pressed
in and the end cap protects the handle
from splitting and indicates the tool
shape and size you'll never pull the
wrong tool out of the rack the cutting
inserts are formed from a nano grain
carbide and the materials in the carbide
matrix have been carefully blended to
make sure the inserts are topped as well
as fine grain when an edge finally dulls
just loosen that screw and rotate the
cutter to a fresh edge when all edges
have been worn simply replace the insert
with a new one available everywhere
ultra shear tools are sold plus each tip
is laser engraved with its replacement
part number no need to try and hunt up
an old package when it's time for a
replacement
put it all together and you get super
clean cuts straight off the tool that
need minimal sanding spend more time
turning and no time sharpening
now available from Rockler three of our
award-winning silicon gluing accessories
bundled together to take the stress and
mess out of your glue ups if you've ever
used the typical acid brushes to spread
glue you know what a mess they can make
they leave glue on the bench have lousy
coverage and after one use you have to
throw them away as a result many
woodworkers have resigned themselves to
using their fingers but that's a sure
way to get glue on your bench which
causes scratches and glue spots in your
finish and holes in your clothes but all
that changes with the 3-piece silicone
gluing kit from Rockler the silicone
tray features a neat notch that holds
the brush and catches excess drops and
even when used without the tray the
bristles never make contact with your
bench best of all when your glue up is
done you can set your gluing tools aside
and forget them once the glue dries it
peels off easily and you're ready for
another project</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
