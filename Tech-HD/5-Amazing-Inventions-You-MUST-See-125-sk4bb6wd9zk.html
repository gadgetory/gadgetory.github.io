planta pod is known for making the
world's most compact and versatile
tripod a tool for every photographer who
never wants to miss that next great shot
two years ago we introduced a
pocket-sized flat an incredibly durable
tripod for low angle photography and
unusual spaces they can use almost any
tripod ballhead after we launched that
concept to the world through a
successful Kickstarter we gathered your
suggestions to create two new amazing
products the new plateau pod ultra is
perfectly designed for when compact is
critical it is more stable more
adaptable more convenient more future
pet and now with a new optional multi
accessory kit add-on more compatible
than ever before
while the platypus provides enhanced
features for support with bigger
professional cameras platypult responds
an ergonomic smartphone size design and
is the perfect companion for compact
cameras on the go you wanted more
stability you wanted more adaptability
you wanted more transport ability and we
wanted to pack it all into a plant a pod
that begins with you the new plateau pod
ultra is both thicker and wider than our
original pro model for even greater
sturdiness and durability with four
heavy-duty spike feet ultra can balance
easier in more situations to get that
low to the ground shot platypi excels at
ultra stays steady when things get
exciting as it maintains a better grip
and tight hold on all surfaces including
uneven rocks and concrete not only does
apply to pod ultra come with more spiked
feet than our original pro model
it also features more places to use them
ultra has five threaded holes so you can
balance it in even more unique in
difficult positions that other tripods
could never fit into three new openings
in ultra are engineered for carabiners
and bungee cords
additionally ultra can be permanently
attached to walls and boards with three
fully countersunk holes ultras two new
open belt slots will let you strap it to
poles
trees railings and many other
freestanding objects Ultra includes a 20
inch velcro cinch strap just to get you
started
however almost any belt will work those
same belts lines and ultras compact
design make this product perfect to take
on the go
Ultra can easily fit on your belt or
slip into your bag so you can capture
that perfect moment wherever you go a
compact wallet is also provided to store
the spiked feet when not in use and can
easily be linked to the ultra with the
included carabiner the Platypus altura
removes the pros quarter-inch bolt
creating an unobstructed surface that
has greater compatibility with more
tripod heads and allows for portrait
style camera orientation at a 90 degree
angle newly added quarter-twenty and
3/16 threaded holes near the center of
ultras plate allow it to easily attach
to tripods monopods
and quick release plates making it a
simple task to quickly switch from one
to the other making things even more
compatible we have introduced an
optional multi accessory kit add-on as a
companion piece that can be used with
ultra or max expanding on the
versatility of the plateau pod system
this kit features multi-purpose
essentials and includes the following a
three inch long anodized aluminum spigot
adapter for flash mounts and mono lights
a silicone pad that prevents slipping or
scratching on flat surfaces a wider 36
inch tension strap for even bigger
objects like telephone and streetlight
poles
an anodized aluminum riser with a
quarter-twenty male bolts to accommodate
bump heads with wing knobs and levers
that previously would not work on a flat
surface in a pinch you could even mount
a compact camera right on the riser
without a bald head and last but not
least the multi accessory kit comes with
a drawstring pouch so you can keep all
of your plan about accessories neatly
together for any shoot the platypus
alter and multi accessory kit represent
more than just an upgrade they embody an
understanding of photographers needs and
interpret those needs into sleek and
elegant design while enhancing the key
features you loved and finessing them to
better adapt to your creativity we look
