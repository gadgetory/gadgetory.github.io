hours a day on mobile devices for

picture size sound quality and more
everyone makes this compromise but we
shouldn't have to
that's where capsule comes in
introducing capsule by nebula the
world's most advanced pocket cinema a
soda-can sized pico projector with
remarkable picture and sound when we
started building a powerful speaker into
such a small device without compromising
the picture seemed like an impossible
challenge so we had to get creative we
proactively built in a 360-degree
speaker with enhanced bass and boosted
treble and cut 9000 holes into the
speaker grill to make capsule the
world's first pico projector with
omnidirectional sound but we didn't just
want it to be small and loud we wanted
to make it really smart traditionally so
called smart projectors come with TV
chipsets which make them big and laggy
we integrated the most advanced
smartphone chipset ever used in a pico
projector into capsule making it the
smartest projector the world has ever
seen
capsule is the first projector ever

seamlessly watch Netflix YouTube and any
other streaming app directly plus

meet Hayden a 31 year old designer from
Hawke's Bay New Zealand with a love of
coffee but a frustration was waste Haman
realized he should design his own
espresso maker that would lower the
environmental and physical cost of
making coffee without compromising on
design and this is where the Newton was
born this is where Ellen comes in a 63
year old craftsman also from the sunny
Hawke's Bay with an extensive history
crafting beautiful pieces of art had a
new he was the man to take his drawings
to to make them come to life together
they worked through the prototype stages
fine-tuning the design to what you see
today a beautifully functional espresso
dressed throughout the prototype stages
the Newton was put through a vigorous
testing to ensure it produced high
quality espresso with rich crema and
this is where we come in with Alan and
Hayden focused on the design and the
production we managed the marketing and
the day-to-day running of the business
what you get for backing us today as a
quality handcrafted espresso press the
base in the handle are crafted from
maple and the piston and chamber are
anodized aluminum crafted with style
functionality and purpose in mind the
Newton makes the coffee by pouring
boiling water into the barrels treating
it to flow through the person by lifting
the lever and then the force on the
lever generates the pressure needed to
push the water through the grinds and
into your cup for a delicious espresso
shot
from something that started as a few
images on paper it has now evolved into
this simple elegant design that we all
love to have in our kitchen we are now
super excited to share this with coffee
lovers around the world as soon as we
reach our funding goal we will begin
production right here in Hawke's Bay
please back us today and enjoy a
lifetime of stylish design and great
coffee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
