in the envelope is what makes the paper
scope come to life

take Eve we're a global community is
formed around a small team and it's
passion for great Hardware together
they're creating the first ever crowd
developed computer what drives this
community to keep on pushing themselves
to study learn debate and then says time
and again that every detail is
considered people want a great display
whether it's for watching movies editing
images or just working in the Sun and
this is important

be the best and so our community fought
it out until they got the screen they
wanted music melody the sound of your
family's dream do from a world away the
community one of the best audio
then we've answered with the most
advanced and powerful audio
configuration out there we thrown
ourselves into designing the most
beautifully crafted and functional
computer imaginable big companies are
racing for the slimmest devices possible
but when the eve community realized that
real all-day battery life would only
cost him a millimeter it was a
no-brainer people want to create objects

balanced they don't achieve mastery and
take pride in the details that's why
they rejected the both we're keeping
this tool sharply true today we live in
virtual spaces and in these spaces we
dream together we dream of the things we
will make things that one day we will
touch our dreamers have pushed us to
make the V the king of ports they
