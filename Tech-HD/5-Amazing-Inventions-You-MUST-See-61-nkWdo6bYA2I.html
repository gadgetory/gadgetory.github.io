away
they love geeky uncomfortable and
distracting and having a camera stuck to
your face it's kind of creepy
introducing the world's first pair of
smart glasses that match your lifestyle
and regular earphones transmits sound
through the air but views bone
conduction speakers transmitted through
vibrations send directly to your inner
ear only you can hear it you has two
designs classic and trendy with its
easy-to-use charging case views
batteries last up to 100 smart glasses
that fit your lifestyle and your look
say hello to the
our lives are like kaleidoscopes full of
colors made of little details and in
constant change that's why we've created
paper scope a customizable card that
turns any little keepsake into a
kaleidoscope of emotions just take a
piece of your day put it in the envelope
and post it to anywhere in the world
with a few simple steps your recipient
will make a real working kaleidoscope
with their own hands it's so easy
assembling it becomes a game in itself
we're proud to say that paper scope is
green and 100% recyclable each little
part of it is made with love and care
making sure whoever receives it as the
best experience from opening the
envelope to revealing the colorful image
and most importantly whatever you've put
in the envelope is what makes the paper
scope come to life
no matter what grand adventures you take
on your experiences will be filled with
little moments with paper scope you can
turn them into a full range of emotions
instead of just sending a postcard send
a unique experience send paper scope
what do people want I mean really what
drives people is it money is it power or
isn't something simpler
take Eve we're a global community is
formed around a small team and it's
passion for great Hardware together
they're creating the first ever crowd
developed computer what drives this
community to keep on pushing themselves
to study learn debate and then says time
and again that every detail is
considered people want a great display
whether it's for watching movies editing
images or just working in the Sun and
this is important
it's our window into the world it should
be the best and so our community fought
it out until they got the screen they
wanted music melody the sound of your
family's dream do from a world away the
community one of the best audio
then we've answered with the most
advanced and powerful audio
configuration out there we thrown
ourselves into designing the most
beautifully crafted and functional
computer imaginable big companies are
racing for the slimmest devices possible
but when the eve community realized that
real all-day battery life would only
cost him a millimeter it was a
no-brainer people want to create objects
of beauty tools that are perfectly
balanced they don't achieve mastery and
take pride in the details that's why
they rejected the both we're keeping
this tool sharply true today we live in
virtual spaces and in these spaces we
dream together we dream of the things we
will make things that one day we will
touch our dreamers have pushed us to
make the V the king of ports they
realize the value of connection today
we're proud to introduce our computer
it's been made by our passionate
community v what people want
