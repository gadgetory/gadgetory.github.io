the lava-lamp just got a whole lot more
interesting this lava lamp has magnetic
fluid inside called ferrofluid and it
definitely breathes new life into a lava
lamp concept now you can interact with
your lava lamp using regular magnets the
ferrofluid dances and forms geometric
patterns
you
ferrofluid was invented by NASA in the
1960s as an experimental rocket fuel is
comprised of iron oxide nanoparticles
using it lava lamps a brand new idea and
was patented last year by inventor Kyle
Haines who sold the first-ever models on
Kickstarter in 2015 the new model is
shaped like a rocket to pay homage to
ferrofluids original beginnings it is
33% larger and 50% less expensive than
the first model limited-edition alien
head bottles are also available these
bottles are part of Kickstarter's make
100 challenge only max of a hundred will
ever be made the ferrofluid is green in
color and the surrounding fluid glows
green
there are two alien head sizes small and
large a small rectangular bottle filled
the same green fluids is also available
but only during the Kickstarter project
make 100 outerspace ferrofluid
collection back the project today
