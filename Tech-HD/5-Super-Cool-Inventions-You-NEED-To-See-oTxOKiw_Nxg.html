design product experiences that inspire
and enable our customers to have fun in
nature we believe outdoor experiences
are better when shared in just over two
years we've established the Wildhorn
brand as one of the fastest-growing
outdoor venture companies in the
industry Wildhorn Outfitters helped to
popularize the full-face circle mass
revolution with our original Seaview 180
which quickly became the best-selling
mask on amazon now meet the CB 180s v2
the next generation of our wildly
popular CB 180 snorkel mask the CB 180s
v2 represents our commitment to
constantly innovate expand boundaries
and improve our customers outdoor
adventure experiences our goal with the
S v2 is to provide the best snorkeling
experience in the world by improving fit
breathability and visibility we've read
over 2000 reviews with customer feedback
after over a year and a half of design
and engineering behind the concept as
well as eight rounds of prototyping and
fine-tuning the S v2 is primed and ready
to launch the circling adventure
experience to the next level traditional
snorkel gear is outdated awkward
uncomfortable and often unsanitary from
leaking and fogging to gagging and
soreness for tubes held in your mouth
the experience can distract from seeing
marine life the cv 180s v2 improves and
simplifies snorkeling on every level it
all starts with our unique
patent-pending flow tech system which
allows for 100% completely natural
breathing through both your mouth and
low-tech has two chambers to allow air
to circulate in and out freely this
airflow designed eliminates breathing
constriction and helps to reduce fogging
in the mass the newly enhanced CV 180
full face design provides a much larger
viewing area giving you a completely
immersive underwater viewing experience
our patent-pending tube design creates
more clearance against waves and helps
prevent unwanted airflow stoppage the
snorkel has a dry top seal to help keep
water from entering the tube if any
water does happen to make it into the
mask simply raise your head out of the
water and the integrated mouthpiece
drains automatically the mask is secured
by a dual comfort strap system for a
customized fit that doesn't inch will
pull on your hair and scalp we've
designed an action camera mount so that
you can easily capture and share your
experience all these features combine to
make the SP 2 the most unique
user-friendly snorkelling product ever
Wildhorn cv 180 SV 2 is set to make a
huge splash in the water adventure
