well isn't it about time someone thought
of this the security camera for your
home makes sense which got us thinking
would it be nice if we could take that
idea and hit the road that's how we came
to build the first security camera for
the car we call it al
owl has a forward-facing camera and an
inside facing camera
owls cameras are always on an owl is
connected to its cloud service 24/7 by a
fast reliable 4G internet connection
just like your phone which means you can
check on your car with live video
streaming anywhere anytime an owl
sensors let you know immediately if
something happens to your car and sends
you an alert with an instant video clip
report and here are a few other cool
things about El owl is always on even
when your car's off its very presence
and it's pulsing security beacon keeps
away the lurkers and the sticky-fingered
and since owl is always recording the
cameras will be rolling even during
traffic stops owl protects you from
contentious crashes because the camera
never lies
unlike that guy that ran the
intersection and since whatever does
happen is recorded you can go back and
check it out later whether it's the
weird the wonderful or the outrageous it
all happens all around us when we're
driving an owl captures it all when you
see something you want to share just say
ok presto an owl will send the clip
right to your phone owl sets up in about
five minutes with just a few simple
steps and all video is protected so no
one except you can get to your video
unless you choose to share it so that's
al the world's first security camera for
the car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
