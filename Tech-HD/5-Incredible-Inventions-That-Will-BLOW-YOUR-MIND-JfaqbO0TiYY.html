living in the future right now Jennifer
Haines has a smartphone that enables her
to order a ride home control the
temperature turn on the lights - face it
we're living in a technological
Wonderland and yet here we find Phil
who's forgotten the culmination of his
travel log is the current solution to
that problem
we live in an error filled with
technological marvels and yet this is
what happens when Phil forgets a lock
combination is that the best we can do
no because we live in an era where the
air baltics is the air bolts is a travel
lock you control with your smartphone
it's the law the future deserves a lock
with customizable security settings this
airball opens whenever my phone is
within Bluetooth range well maybe you
don't trust anyone in your lives that's
fine the settings on this head well
require me to went to a password into
the app well maybe your vaults been
stolen
that's fine too because you can set your
air ball to activate an alarm when it
moves too far away from your phone or
you can activate the alarm manually stop
that man it's the justice the future
deserves hi Bill hi tell them what
happened bill I lost my bag you lost
your we live in a world where I can use
my smartphone tomorrow my sleeping
patterns but bill here can't find his
bag if bill have been using the air
balls instead of some antique you could
have located it using the air box
crowd-sourced GPS networks or if you
lose your phone well you can still
unlock your air ball by logging in for
another device well you can enter a
backup button code using your hands like
some kind of prehistoric man
the airport has a rechargeable battery
which only needs to be charged once a
year by a standard microUSB connector
it's CSA approved so airport security is
not an issue the app will record a
history of every time you've locked and
unlocked your Airport you can even share
access to your a vault with your friends
so you'll be able to unlock it from the
other side of the world thanks pal
you're welcome buddy
and look how small it is seriously look
at it it's really small ambled it's the
travel lock we all deserve
the carry bag is round and flat as the X
Jack has a reinforced lifting platform
to minimize the risk of it being damaged
by sharp edges under your vehicle while
the grip feet stabilized the base
secondly as well as the normal feelings
to connect the bag with the exhaust
there is a conventional tube fitting for
inflation by means of a compressor this
will allow you to operate the X Jack
even if you are having a problem with
your exhaust system inflation by the
compressor is a great insurance policy
and does allow you greater management of
the inflation process heavy duty mats
are included as an added precaution
against damage
after assessing the underbody for the
best lifting location position the ex
jack and repair to lift if necessary
chop the wheels and start the engine and
push the cone over the exhaust making
sure that there are no kinks in the hose
under no circumstances should you get
under the vehicle while it's supported
by the jack
[Laughter]
what's clear fill the hole and pack the
sand under the tires will now lift the
driver's-side using the max air to
inflate the X Jack
to the flight simply release the
pressure under control while carefully
opening the valve on the hose extension
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
