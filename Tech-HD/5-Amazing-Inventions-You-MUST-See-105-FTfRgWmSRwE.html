inhibitions most of us end up using our
stuff instead the more technology
evolves the more gadgets we buy and the
dream of travel can be replaced by a
nightmare we had enough of those
panic-stricken moments what if we could
prevent disaster before it happens this

rechargeable tag that notifies you
immediately if you forget something got
an upcoming calendar notification like a
flight where you'll need to remember a
long list of stuff you'll be reminded
just in time ensuring you never miss a
beat to surf in the app main the items

stressful than a day at the office once

your way through a mob of passengers

arrives on the belt you'll know through
an instant notification when it's ready
for collection no more searching and no
more stress

roller coaster of our own devices and
perfecting the mutex potential our team

more excited to have partnered with the
top manufacturing names in the business

flexible and uniquely modular we're
ready to bring the mutex to you but we
need your help the top of our growing
manufacturing costs and overheads we
need funding discern our dream into your
reality we're dreamers creating world of
three travelers and cattle free gems oh
the places you'll go let's run tomorrow
today together we'll use it for
you don't like to keep things clean you
have tried hiding you might think that
your living environment is hygienic too
well I'm going to let you in on a little
secret it isn't you're a hand sanitizer
fangirl you gleefully spray chemicals
like alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium
chloride willy-nilly all over your
baby's room even though it's highly
toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates
oh don't worry it's only slightly toxic
to humans you're the hygiene hero so
it's no wonder you think you're winning
the constant battle against microbes
that can spread like wildfire and make
your entire family sick nasty little
buggers sure your personal hygiene is
phenomenal but what about the hygiene of
all the products and environments is
that your loved one views every day we
call this enviro hygiene and if you're
ignoring it it is a real problem here is
your solution take back your personal
space hiding with our orbit
antimicrobial lightbulb scientists have
known for decades that certain
wavelengths of light eradicate all kinds
of growth microbes like mold and
bacteria do you really want her inhaling
any of the microorganisms breathing like
millions of lovestruck bunnies inside
that mm-hmm nope not this mama so what's
so special about our or of anti
microbial life it uses sub UV light
wavelengths that are safe for humans and
are still ultra powerful at killing
microbes but it's convenient size and
shape means it can fit into all kinds of
products it's waterproof these three
attributes make the orb incredibly
useful
don't get gross just because you have
good personal hygiene doesn't mean you
have good environmental hygiene here are
some of the billions of ways that our
product can help like putrid pet bowl
and stinky water bottle it makes your
fruit last longer they keep your baby
safe the orbs can be connected by
bluetooth so you can easily select
different settings like fridge
humidifier or oh my god shoes plus they
come with this snazzy magnetic charging
station so why are we the brand that you
can trust a buyer hygiene is a sister
brand of revived light therapy which is
sold consumer and professional grade LED
light products for a health beauty and
pain relief for over a decade so never
fear dear kickstarter backers you can be
sure to receive a quality product and a
timely delivery so if you are a living
breathing demon who wants to join the
bike for environmental hygiene we would
love your support on kickstarter
you're careful about eating healthy food
and drinking clean water but what about
the air you breathe do you realize that
you actually ingest 12 times more air
than food and five times more than water
introducing thus primo personal air
monitor a key chain sized air monitor
that plugs into your iPhone and lets you
see what you smells the app gives you
real-time readings for temperature
humidity and air quality based on
precision measurements of volatile
organic compounds a colorant number
scale tells you the quality of the air
around you opt in to our community and
share your results and contribute to a
worldwide real time air quality map we
are constantly surrounded by toxins in
the air around us from common products
like cleaners and dirty clothes to swamp
pollution secondhand smoke paint and pet
waste the most obvious results are the
one in 12 people who suffer from asthma
or the more than half of Americans who
live in areas with unhealthy air quality
but in reality almost everyone is
subjected to poor air quality at some
point during the day screamo can monitor
your air wherever you are or confirm
your suspicions so you can do something
about it hello my name is dr. key Joslin
you know after 23 years in practice one
of the things that I have found out that
it separates sick people from healthy
people is that healthy people know their
numbers if you don't know your blood
pressure you're going to have heart
issues if you don't know if the numbers
about what's in the air that you breathe
you're going to have breathing issues
that's why I find that a personal air
monitor is absolutely required for
people to be healthy supremo keeps you
informed whether you're at work home
school
outside a bar salon restaurant were the
airport supremo was founded by ray combs
and Harold Hong Ray has helped bring
about products like the palm pilot and
Amazon Kindle and is passionate about
improving indoor air quality to help his
son who has asthma Harold has been
studying chemistry for years at New York
University where he got his PhD and
hails from China where air pollution in
many cities makes it impossible to go
outside thus primo air monitor let's you
be fully aware of those deep breaths
you're taking you screamo is helping
people breathe easy Wow the air quality
here so great today okay everyone let's
take a deep breath
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
