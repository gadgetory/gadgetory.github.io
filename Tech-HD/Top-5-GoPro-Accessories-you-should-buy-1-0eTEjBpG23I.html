you want extremely stable GoPro footage
no matter where your GoPro mountain meet
the remote us1 the world's most
versatile gimbal for gopro cameras the
remove u.s. one is designed to be as
versatile as your gopro camera allowing
you to mount your s1 wherever you can
mount a gopro remove us one comes with a
Bluetooth remote control joystick that
allows you to control the cameras
position use the remote control joystick
while is mounted an s-1 hand grip or
from a distance wirelessly easily attach
and remove your GoPro camera using our
innovative one-click mounting system
additionally the remove us one is the
world's first rain proof gimbal the
motors in the body were specifically
designed to be water resistant whether
you're in the rain or in the snow you
can focus on getting the shot and not
having to worry about your camera
equipment
do you love your GoPro but hate how it
runs out of battery so quickly do you
find yourself constantly looking at the
battery level during your adventure I
know you're worried about dropping your
gopro or damaging the lens every time
you change batteries the Moto wireless
charger keeps your GoPro charged at all
times so you can have more fun with your
camera and focus less on the battery
level
leave your camera safely in its housing
and charge it wirelessly the motor was
charger for GoPro works with all
batteries made for Hero 3 and here for
super simple fully wireless and
eliminates the need to wrestle with the
housing with plenty of power you'll be
able to get the GoPro spare batteries
and your smartphone charged to develop
this special technology optimized for
the GoPro you're going to be able to use
any Hero 3 and hero 4 compatible
batteries so you don't need to invest on
a whole new set you're going to be able
to charge your GoPro on the go and be
ready to shoot immediately and finally
you're going to have a spare battery
available to you as well as the ability
to charge your smartphone at any time
you
have revolutionized the world of video
and photography when it comes to action
sports but the reality is most of us
spend more time hanging with friends
than hanging in midair introducing the
exo gp1 a brand new way to make your
gopro go further the GoPros an
incredible camera for a lot of
applications but what we're doing is
helping people revitalize and reinvent
their GoPros the first major feature
that the gp1 adds is the optical
viewfinder previously there was no way
to frame your shot without an external
screen or monitor this clever feature
gives you a simple way to see what
you're shooting and allows you to use
your GoPro just like a regular DSLR or
stills camera the second feature is the
increased size of our design this adds
an ergonomic grip to what was originally
an awkward and clumsy form factor for me
having a comfortable camera to hold it
is really important and that stems right
across from a large professional comb
that I would use normally right down to
a smaller
you don't need to have your large
massive camera foot for every type of
shoot the third is the quarter-inch
tripod mount this allows compatibility
with thousands of third party
accessories that are commonplace in the
camera industry when designing the gp1
we not only wanted to increase the
usability when it comes to stills
photography but we also wanted to add
more functionality to the video
capabilities we installed a cold shoe
mount which allows you to add numerous
accessories such as microphones LED
panels handles for those super low angle
shots and even an iPhone mount to use as
a monitor while filming we've also
incorporated a strap which allows you to
always have your GoPro on hand rather
than having to store it in your backpack
or in your pocket the camera is
constantly at the ready just like a
regular DSLR or stills camera the body
is made of solid aluminum and provides
ample protection for the GoPro which is
your GoPro and allows you to use it in
all new ways be the first to own the new
EXO GP one and make your GoPro go
further
you
we are polar Pro a company designed by
adventure for adventure from extreme
sports to everyday moments our products
make it easier than ever to document
your life the Power Grip h2o the world's
first waterproof battery integrated pole
system allowing you to charge your gopro
six times or increase film time over 12
hours designed in three sections the
Power Grip h2o can be used as an 11 inch
grip a 22 inch pole or a 33 inch
extension pole this design allows for
both compact storage and the ability to
keep the grip out of the cameras field
of view
that extension arms are fitted with
cable slots to securely run the charge
cable for powering the GoPro while
filming our custom thumb screws make it
easy to tighten the arms for the GoPro
with ease waterproofing was our number
one priority for the Power Grip h2o we
wanted one accessory we could take
everyone from scuba diving to skiing and
everywhere in between
the waterproof door installed the Power
Grip has a depth rating of 99 feet with
the included skeleton door you can live
charge above water we added a quarter 20
mount to the base of the Power Grip h2
of allowing users to turn any tripod
into a power source for extended time
lapses
running out of power while filming
outdoors is a common issue so we packed
in as much power as possible without
sacrificing comfort or design the 6700
Millea battery has enough juice to power
phone's speakers or headphones while out
for the day
the two USB ports can simultaneously
charge two devices another feature that
we wanted to add was cell phone
compatibility a smart phone cameras
continue to advance shooting with mobile
devices is becoming more and more common
the included cell phone mount enables
mobile users to harness all of the
features of the power grid next we
address the waterproof live charging we
knew it wasn't going to be easy but
after a few designs made a custom GoPro
backdoor and Power Grip door that would
provide waterproof charging down to 99
feet
we are fired up about how versus how the
Power Grip h2o is
you
babban of gopro cameras have
revolutionized how we see the world with
the nice wide angle lens and the
buildings mount anywhere we can capture
the point of view from truly epic
moments or simply glimpse a radical new
perspective on something familiar the
problem is that they just don't work
well in low-light conditions and any
footage at night underwater or even in
shadows comes out poorly exposed that's
why we want to build a light that can go
wherever your action camera does and
provide the extra light it needs to
capture amazing imagery introducing the
sidekick sidekick is a perfect companion
light for your GoPro it provides the
light the hero sensor needs in any
condition including deep underwater the
Plus model has two beams a wide 600
lumen flood which is perfect for
capturing the action and a narrow for
Hubble image spot which is great for
navigation the two button control is
simple and intuitive to use
and speaking of simple and intuitive we
design the light to be factory sealed no
messing with batteries or doors just
slip on the external charger plug into
USB and full charge can be accomplished
in just over four hours great lights not
enough it has to mount securely with
your GoPro which is why we designed a
very simple mount you place the standard
nut with the extender nut mount your
GoPro as always use our longer finger
screw add friction washer and screw
directly into your sidekick tighten
adjust
and turn on your ready to go it's secure
on helmets bike bars or grips additional
mounting options include a lock line
system which allows you to mount the
light directly over the camera the body
has been machined from a single piece of
aluminum the two button and single
button designs are complete currently
the rear cover is machined from Delta
with your help it will be injection
molded circuit board is well tested the
custom spot and flawed optics are also
molded the circuit board mounts to a
thermal plate which transfers the heat
away from the LEDs and into the main
body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
