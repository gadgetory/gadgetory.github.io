I don't care how old you are the zero
blaster smoke ring launcher is awesome
and it's even more awesome if you have a
friend to do battle with I'll be right
back
the zero blaster fires harmless smoke
lines made from a water-based non-toxic
super fluid the vortex rings range from
two to four inches in diameter and can
fire up to 12 feet there's a ray gun
sound feature you can turn on and off as
well as a function to adjust the speed
at which it fires vapor rings timeout so
how does this thing actually work the
zero blaster creates an area of low
pressure and when that area has air flow
surrounding it the smoky vortex forms
okay cover me I'm going in
the average office prays for work and
creation but in recent years a new
hazardous phenomenon has arisen it is
known as the screen slouched this is a
screen sloucher look at him slouching in
front of a screen here is the female
screen sloucher slouching in front of a
much smaller screen the slouching makes
her appearance less confident her back
aches every day for 8 to 12 hours
slouching is an inherent part of the
office habitat this is upright girl a
small wearable that helps the slouches
become upright it is the simplest way to
improve your posture just stick it on
your back and press the button that's it
a bride would vibrate every time you
slouch look at the effect it has on the
screen slouches such a smile has not
been seen on their faces for a long time
since upright go sits directly on the
back it is the only device that truly
senses the back it's also the only
posture trainer that works no matter
what you're doing sitting standing or
walking oh look one of the screen
slouches has discovered that if you
press the button once more upright go
switches to tracking mode a mode that
doesn't vibrate when you slouch but
still keeps all your daily posture data
in the upright app incredible to
conclude our research we returned to the
office two weeks later the results were
astonishing after two weeks being
upright became second nature
here is one sloucher two weeks ago and
here he is now see
how much more confident and
better-looking he appears notice also
how he doesn't suffer from back pain oh
we're in luck
it seems the male ex sloucher finally
feels confident enough to approach the
female ex sloucher exciting so if you
two wish to stop being a screen sloucher
