help the environment

hello to go bout the world's best

separate containers consumes valuable
space and the containers often late no

keeping track of too many containers can
be difficult hi I'm bebe I'm here today

which product you are dispensing to
access the capsules for refilling open
the bottom part and take the capsules
out like batteries from a flashlight
robot comes in two sizes a large and a
small version for the large version is
capsule is less than 3.4 ounces or 100
milliliters which means at some airport
security checks
you just have to remove the capsules
from the main body and for the small
version you don't need to remove the
capsules at airport security because it
complies with aircraft rules
before go back we have been carrying
separate travel sized bottles

worst spot is on your back usually in
the emergency room three times that's
really good that's like the spot to see
be sweating that's here for sure hi I'm
Rob and I live in sunny and hot Houston
Texas I lived all over the world and
mostly warm places such as la Okinawa
Hawaii Miami and now Houston I love warm
weather but I don't like feeling
uncomfortable that's why I create a blog
the leader in wearable cooling
technology by combining air flow with
aromatherapy flow allows essential oil
users to bring the health benefits of
their diffuser on the go P when it gets
ahold of you there's little to no relief
unless you do this this or even this is
it us or does it seem that the summers
are getting and staying hotter longer
while our homes cars and offices are set
up with a CD
what about Homer on the moon fortunately
there is relief meet blow the world's
first micro cooling device that uses the
natural power of essential oil to cool
you off here's how it works
place your essential oil insert inside
add one drop of peppermint oil turn it
on and choose your speed if you want to
wear it on the front clip your shirt
like this for those of you is short here
who want to wear it on the back clip to
your shirt like this
you also have the option of clipping it
on your pants with the back clip we
recommend tucking your shirt into the
front clip to keep the air between your
shirt and skin use it to cool off during
a variety of activities such as running
hiking biking working out and anything
else but we didn't stop there what also
comes out in summer months mosquitoes
use blow as a personal mosquito
repellent by simply adding lemongrass
oil
goodbye chemicals hello relief we've
already secured the best manufacture and
sourced the best durable materials and
now we just need your help to make our
first production run
so please Bank our campaign today I'm
your very own personal blow and
experience the power of mobile cooling
technology
hey guys I'm Chris and I'm Dylan hey
we're really excited to show you what
we've been secretly working on over the
last 18 months and we're hoping that in
the next three minutes we can encourage
you to support our project as we all
know getting asleep in noisy
environments is next to impossible so
whether that's sleeping next to noisy
neighbors next to someone who snores or
trying to sleep while traveling it can
be difficult to get a consistent great
night's sleep so 12 years ago I used to
work night shift and I invented this
product to help me sleep during the day
which is the sound booking slight loss
little pets view they walk a little bit
of sand after this thing's - all the
feedback from our loyal customers we
realized that this sound blocking device
was really the focus of everyone's
attention and we knew that that was our
most important area of improvement so
with that we came up with this medical
silicone cuff that fits over the years
snugly and blocks out a significant more
amount of sound so if you've ever had
problems falling asleep like to
introduce you to the new hive inmate and
we think you're gonna love it
we took our one and only prototype to
the streets and ask everyone what stops
you from sleeping my husband I have a
really loud story husband that just
never lets me
she's got a real snoring is she that
breaking through it together as a couple
schmuck
Carla
so we hired a specialist product
development company cobalt nish the
folks that were responsible for bringing
products like the kid kept alive the new
hyper made features a completely
innovative patent-pending design which
incorporates a soft outer cup made from
medical grade silicon just as
importantly we wanted the new ear cups
to look amazing approaching one aware
while you're traveling or lying in your
own bed we've introduced a special sound
reducing memory foam which rests against
your head and sits neatly inside the cup
the cup itself features two special
rails which allow for full adjustability
no matter what it attaches at the back
using two straps so they'll fit on your
head perfectly not only that it puts no
pressure on your eyes so it won't
interfere with your important REM sleep
patterns it's also the only sleep mask
in the world with front adjustability so
instead of filming around at the back
you can independently adjust the top and
bottom headband strap in seconds you can
use the sleeping earmuffs and mask as a
headband or as a sleep mask on its own
if noise isn't a problem simply by
slipping off the ear cups all together
we've been working with engineers with
chemists with sound-blocking phone
experts and our amazing seamstress to
bring you this working prototype that
you see in front of you today none of
this would have been possible without
their help and today we're asking for
yours with your pledge you'll be getting
the new hybrid mate upon its release for
a significantly discounted price and on
top of that helping us kickstart an
incredible project that helps thousands
of people around the world get a better
night's sleep
so it's been an incredibly fun journey
over these last 18 months and we really
hope that you love our new idea with
that we're looking for you to pledge
today and to share this project with all
of your friends and family so that we
can reach production thank you so much
for your time thank you
you
you
meet Mesa a new kind of light it's
portable foldable and directional with
just the right proportions it's tall
enough to work under and short enough to
see over the unique form factor allows
for natural illumination for your
backyard campsite or workshop I'm Ravi
Varma and I'm an industrial designer I
spent years working on high-end lighting
and I used my experience to engineer the
perfect portable light and home your
lights are directional to help you see
what you're doing but they aren't very
practical to take with you the lights
that are portable are all really harsh
that's where Mesa comes in it's a
portable light that doesn't shine in
your eyes
the leg snap open automatically
and it folds quickly into a custom
carrying case
it's easy to pack and take with you it
has three power settings recharge it
with microUSB for up to 50 hours on a
single charge it's aluminum unibody
design makes it watertight incredibly
strong and has fewer parts that can fail
I'm using the highest grade materials
Mesa to make it much better for years to
come
I think well-designed products are
simple and beautiful and useful every
day I spent the last two years sketching
and refining the design through
countless prototypes I took the time to
get the details right and now Mesa is
ready for production
I need your support to make this happen
please back me on Kickstarter and bring
Mesa to life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
