craftsman 25 foot Sidewinder tape
measure standard measuring tapes stand
straight up causing them to frequently
tip over while in use with the
Sidewinder the patented design rotates
the tape to lay flat making it the most
stable tape measure on the market
exclusively from craftsmen the steel
rear tang provides increased
stabilization and allows you to make
repetitive layout marks based on a given
distance rather than pulling out the
length of the tape and doing difficult
math
and easy-to-read tape makes reading
fractions a breeze the auto blade block
makes the job easy automatically locking
in place so the tape only retracts when
you want it to and a convenient writable
surface helps you keep track of
measurements
the new craftsman 25 foot Sidewinder
tape-measure craftsman when it matters
the wheel style marking gauge has earned
its place for tight tolerance joinery
layout you just can't beat that crisp
cut but let's face it there are times in
the shop when an accurately drawn pencil
mark is even better
introducing the approved woodpeckers
marking gauge and pal marking gauge both
ingeniously designed with an integrated
mechanical pencil so now you can make
either hairline cuts or easily readable
pencil marks with dead-on accuracy
machine from aircraft grade aluminum
these upgraded marking pages are built
to last and enable greater control and
more precise marking and by using the
optional spacers and second marking
field you can lay down dual scribe lines
in sixteenth inch increments from eight
inch to half inch all in one pass the
large neural locking knob features a
built in hex wrench to tighten or loosen
the wheel cutter and spacers and you can
conveniently keep all of the extra
components inside the tool and now
included with the metric gauges are
metric scribe pill spacers ideal for
scribing both border shoulders
simultaneously when using a Festool
Domino the anodized aluminum bar has two
precision laser engraved 32nd inch or
metric scales one for the wheel marker
and one for the pencil mark the bar
itself is three quarters of an inch in
diameter giving you a solid grip on the
tool
the new-and-improved marking gauge and
panel marking gauge from woodpeckers
precision built in the USA for behind
woodworkers everywhere
please listen and watch this real screw
driving demonstration screwdrivers that
don't hold up tools that don't cut it
inefficient systems that damage screws
bits and surfaces stop the madness
choose the magnet driver from now on the
real revolution in the world of DIY the
secret is in the powerful magnetic ring
inside a special soft and flexible
sleeve which makes the magnet driver
patented system like no other place the
magnet drive in your screwdriver or
power driver bed like so and be amazed
once you match the magnet driver to the
color-coded power bed position the screw
and stick the magnet driver against the
screws head then place the power bit
inside the drill until the magnet driver
rests in place now start screwing and
watch carefully the magnet driver
compresses gently to embed the
countersunk screw into the wood now
drive with the magnet driver until the
surface is totally in contact with the
screw the screw stays there impressive
right that's the power and efficiency of
magnet driver now you've got an extra
hand your work will never seem so easy
and it's so simple that everyone can use
it the magnet driver adapts to all kinds
of screws screwdrivers and bits for
power drivers and there's a color for
each size well-thought don't you think
look how much time and efficiency you
gain in this screw driving sequence you
can screw perpendicularly and increase
your strength and performance the
binding power is so strong because your
tools and the magnet driver form a
single body we even driven into a
ceiling with a much heavier power driver
look at this this is the efficiency of
the magnet driver even when it comes to
deeply sunken screws the magnet driver
adapts to all situation without damaging
surfaces even in confined or
inaccessible spaces where work used to
be impossible magnet driver is still on
your side did you get that you gain
strength and power the images speak for
themselves it's amazing and one of a
kind the possibilities are endless the
magnet driver links instantly equip your
screwdrivers and power bits with the
magnet driver from now on the magnet
driver will lend a hand it's always the
right tool projects will be simpler from
halation drywall - mechanic were the

always be on your side it's fantastic
you'll save time and money everybody

the job site or in the garden the magnet
driver is simply great with the magnet
driver system screwing has never been so
easy the magnet driver is a product of
my Katan
when tapes are inconvenient or not long
enough taking accurate measurements can
now be as simple as taking a photo
introducing Stanley smart measure Pro a
laser measuring device and app that
works with your smartphone and tablet
take photos and capture real-time
measurements including height width area
length and target location there's even
a built-in estimating function for
estimating project materials whether
estimating residential or commercial
jobs or designing and managing remodels
Stanley smart measure Pro will change
the way you take measurements
we're demos and we have made the best
shove 11 other shovels crack bend and
break demos beats them all literally
last year we launched our kicker tool
the stealth shovel on Kickstarter people
loved it
but they all agreed on one thing they
wanted something bigger badder and made
for everyone so we listened and gathered
our team to make the bestest toughest
dam this shovel ever and we did
introducing the alpha shovel mother
nature meet daddy you wanted big oh it's
big over 20 inches long and 12 inches
deep of glorious aircraft grade aluminum
means you can shovel away the Ice Age
for your driveway
it's got serrated teeth to cut ice and
shovel gliders to protect your deck
beneath so when we say it's cutting edge
but we mean it the Alpha shovel is
durable and tough rain or shine dirt or
snow we built it to weather through a
lifetime of storms in a storm through
any whether our collapsible shaft makes
it easy to pack and the built-in strap
holders makes it easy to carry and we
added a saw for good luck use it to cut
anything that might get in the way
choose between a D handle for better
grip or a t handle for better
compatibility best of all everything in
the Alpha shovel is interchangeable with
the rest of the demos family allowing
you to build a collection of
multi-purpose tools for life every job
every day for everyone
the alpha shovel conditions be damned
Deimos is a collective of lifelong
innovators and adventurers if we like to
go out and wreak face with nature and
come back to make the best products ever
we're born and raised in Jackson Hole
but but our family goes far beyond town
and state borders this is a
collaborative effort not just between
the team but with pro athletes action
enthusiasts and most importantly our
community back our campaign today and
join the demos collective we thank you
for all of your support truly the most
defined not by us but by you our backers
let's keep crushing it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
