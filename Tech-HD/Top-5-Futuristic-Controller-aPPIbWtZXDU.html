hi Kickstarter let's
about remotes we think there's something
wrong with them it's a concept that is
not evolved for more than 30 years we
have so many different devices and each
one has their own remote or app you end
up with so many jumping from one remote
to another or when using an app finding
her phone unlocking it finding a right
app and waiting until the app is ready
it's cumbersome and inconvenient it
would be so much easier to control
everything from one place that's why we
have created new neo is a smart system
that connects to all the devices in your
home and makes them available in one
easy-to-use app and for the ultimate
simplicity used in your remote it
recognizes you and lets you control
everything instantly so whether you're
watching a movie setting mood lighting
relaxing with your favorite music or
lowering the window shades neo makes it
effortless and trust us setting all of
this up is insanely simple new includes
a superb high density touchscreen
display surpassing even apples a
high-poverty in a standard we embedded a
hand detection technology engineer for
which we have a patent pending the
technology knows you and shows you your
favorites instantly the neo will even
help you set and manage parental
controls neo goes months with
needing to be charged and if you can't
find it use your burn to activate the
SOS so you know where it's hiding the
