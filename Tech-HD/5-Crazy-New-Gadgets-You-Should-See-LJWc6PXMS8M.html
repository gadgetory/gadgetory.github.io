sleep is something that you realize when
you're losing it first you lose your
focus and then your good spirit but also
it will go to severe health issues at
the end but upside here is that we can
also affect positively your health by
improving your sleep so we started
making studies to find the solution for
it I am proud to introduce why don't
sleep
this device is one of the kind there is
no other active noise-cancelling
earplugs but you could use for sleeping
there are other devices for the sleeping
purposes like a foam earplugs the
problem with that is that they can't
really cut the snoring sound there are
some devices which are creating more
noise meaning of this kind of masking
noise that you can hide the snoring but
then you need to listening the noise
what that device creates so we are
making silence
the first Parag was already massive hit
it went all around the world and got a
really really positive feedback from
different segments especially for the
frequent travelers but also the people
who are working in the noisy
environments but still we found some
room for the improvements especially for
the sleeping our new device is more it
is soft it is optimized for the snoring
sounds it's also have two modes there's
hearing mode and sleeping mode the great
feature of this device even though we
went really small that they're still
enough battery life so there's 20 hours
in a single charge
I'm privileged to work with this kind of
device which have the major impact on
people's lives
since have been our started in indiegogo
go there and order your own thank you
for supporting us
there are those who say there's more to
life than beer and barbecue but we don't
hang out with those kinds of people

more live ma√≠am biscuit I am a good boy
but my dear human gave biscuit a bad bed
why would you give a good boy a bad bet
we all make mistakes maybe we do listen
most pet beds are gross they stink
they're hard they're lumpy and they look
like this the pet bed world needed an
intervention so with the comfort
scientists at purple eye engineered the
all new purple pet bed the first and
only pet bed to feature Purple's crazy
comfy super Sayan see purple technology
oh wow
please give is excite whoops biscuit
peed a little it happens and poo we all
do but on the purple pet bed that's okay
you see first we looked at other pet
beds most come in a variety of covers
ranging from cotton and nylon to
microfiber and polyester problem is most
of these fabrics are easily penetrated
by moisture creates bacteria and
bacteria smells gross this means even
when you bathe conditioned and deodorize
your little buddy as soon as they lay
down on their bed that old dog smell
returns like a bad sequel I'm looking at
you Michael Bay so just toss the cover
in the wash right wrong because the real
problem is the bed itself foam slab
cotton batting fluff chunks these
materials are a breeding ground for
bacteria mold and fungi no Kai's the bad
fungi that means your pet that not only
smells gross but might be making you
more allergic to Fido or cat Fido
that's where the purple pet bed comes in
when we develop the purple pet bed we
addressed all these issues starting from
the inside out the core of our bed is
made of our ultra comfy hyper elastic
polymer the comfort core is then wrapped
in an antimicrobial water pre odor proof
protector that means no bacteria no
smell better than my human son and are
easy to remove ultra durable cover is
also antimicrobial as well as stain and
moisture resistant not to mention a
beautiful statement piece for any living
room bedroom or pet room you know if
you're one of those people guilty now
here's why your furry friends are gonna
go barking mad over the purple pet bed
it's just so dang comfy don't be jealous
ever notice that even though you bought
the $200 plush microfiber therapeutic
deluxe edition pet bed at a big-box
store your fur children still prefer
your bed over theirs boy do I love
shedding is probably what cats think as
they diabolically spread their fur all
over your bedspread but hey
they're just so cute also you might
notice your Morpher heavy friends prefer
to sleep on the cool tile floor over
there soft dog bed kind of like how I
prefer Chloe to Kim that's why we
engineered the purple pet bed to be
temperature neutral your little buddies
can rest comfy pant freeze meaning no
panting I think that's pretty cool as
cool as your fanny pack nerd as your pet
ever utterly destroyed his or her bed
first off maybe they're trying to tell
you something but also let's love to
scratch and chew but nothing scratches
and chews with more precision look in
the claw our way to test for durability
the purple pet bed wood stood over
60-thousand claws from this monster the
purple pet bed is the absolute greatest
pet bed of all time so if you love your
pets like she loves sloths then treat
your furry friends to the best rest of
their unfortunately short lives and hey
we a purple don't discriminate the pet
bed is great for dogs cats pigs goats
