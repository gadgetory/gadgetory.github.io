time spent on decks should be a time of
peace and relaxation not time spent
looking at all the problems warped
boards split ends and nails or screws
popping up traditional built decks
constructed with nails or screws driven
through the face of the board cause not
only eyesores but they can be dangerous
as well
now the Kreg deck jig system puts a
brand new angle on an old approach to
building decks utilizing tools and basic
skills that you already have this
concealed fastener system allows you to
build a beautiful long lasting deck you
have always wanted combining the
strength and durability of face screwing
with proven pocket hole technology to
hide the fasteners this system is the
perfect one-two punch for a deck that is
simple to build gorgeous and safe the
core of the Kreg deck jig system is its
solid metal drill guides which allow you
to drill holes and drive screws at the
precise angle and perfect depth time
after time the angle of the guides not
only hide the screws on the edge of the
board but are optimal for maximum
holding power while the screw depth is
precisely controlled which eliminates
overdriving and blowing out the board or
under driving leaving exposed fasteners
and loose boards this process is made
fast and worryfree by the included depth
collars on both the driver bit and drill
bit that are set using the gauges molded
right on the jig once set just drill the
hole load the screw and drive it home
the Kreg deck jig is equipped with three
drill guides a center guide and two
angle guides using the center guide in
the center of the joist allows for the
most holding power while the angle
guides provide you flexibility by going
where the center guide cannot suggest
spliced or obstructed ends the fasteners
themselves are specifically designed for
use with the Craig deck jig featuring a
deep
KTX square drive that gives you solid
driver engagement which means no cam
outs self-tapping tip for fast easy
driving and they are built from case
hardened steel to eliminate bending or
breaking these screws can also be used
as face screws for a variety of outdoor
projects available in pro tect code and
stainless steel finishes choose which
one is right for your application the
Craig deck jig system does not stop
there the kit comes with sample screws
an instructional DVD and spacer rings
these 1/4 inch and 5/16 inch spacer
rings allow you to maintain consistent
spacing on your deck boards which not
only gives your deck a better overall
appearance but more importantly allows
for proper air movement which reduces
moisture buildup making for a
longer-lasting deck the system is light
built for rugged use and comes with a
lifetime guarantee rubber feet on the
bottom of the jig prevents slipping
while drilling and driving and the
oversized handle provides a comfort grip
keeping your hands away from the action
