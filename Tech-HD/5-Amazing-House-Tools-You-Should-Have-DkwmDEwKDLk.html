solid metal drill guides which allow you
to drill holes and drive screws at the

after time the angle of the guides not
only hide the screws on the edge of the
board but are optimal for maximum
holding power while the screw depth is
precisely controlled which eliminates
overdriving and blowing out the board or
under driving leaving exposed fasteners
and loose boards this process is made
fast and worryfree by the included depth
collars on both the driver bit and drill
bit that are set using the gauges molded
right on the jig once set just drill the
hole load the screw and drive it home
the Kreg deck jig is equipped with three
drill guides a center guide and two
angle guides using the center guide in
the center of the joist allows for the
most holding power while the angle
guides provide you flexibility by going
where the center guide cannot suggest
