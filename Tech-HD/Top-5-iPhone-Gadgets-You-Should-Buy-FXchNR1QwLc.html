Nancy Navarro got a Passover suture or

introducing the new hyperdrive USBC hub
that has a built-in cable connect USB
flash drives SD and micro SD memory
cards 4k HDMI monitor Gigabit Ethernet
even more USB hard drives and charge
your computer at the same time oh and
did we mention it can also charge your
iPhone as well wirelessly it also works
as a wireless charging stand for the
iPhone that doesn't interfere with your
gestures with adjustable viewing angles
you don't even need to use it with your
computer just connect it to any USB see
power here the five reasons why the
hyperdrive is the best iPhone wireless
charger and USB seva one it supports the
new faster of 7.5 watt wireless charging
standard developed by Apple for the
iPhone traditional so-called 5 10 or 15
watt wireless chargers that were
previously created for the Android will
either not work or charge the iPhone
much slower at 5 watts or less to
traditional wireless chargers generate a
lot of heat which causes the iPhone to
reduce or stop wireless charging
completely hyperdrive is designed to be
a power efficient low temperature device
what little heat is generated is
isolated from the iPhone by an air gap
layer and insulator stand tray three
traditional wireless chargers are made
with low-cost materials that have
fluctuating electromagnetic frequencies
that may interfere with the iPhone
functions like touch and face ideal
hyperdrive uses a fixed frequency
designated by Apple and is guaranteed to
work perfectly with the iPhone 4 because
hyperdrive uses USB C input instead of
DC input it is the only iPhone wireless
charger in the market that is firmware
upgradeable to support higher wireless
charging power in the future last but
not least hyper drive is built on USB C
hub capabilities that helped raise over
3.1 million dollar
Kickstarter and IndieGoGo and with
thousands of positive reviews it has an
average four star rating on Amazon as
despite incorporating a USBC hub
hyperdrive is no bigger than the
ordinary wireless charger sold at the
other school and it's actually thinner
than the most popular Android wireless
charger on the market and these don't
come with the USBC hub a single
hyperdrive replaces an ordinary wireless
charger countless other us AC adapters
this pile of USBC adapters and wireless
charger will cost you over two hundred
and fifty dollars at the Apple store but
you can get the hypertrophy for special
price only if you pledge right now get
more from hyper
you
