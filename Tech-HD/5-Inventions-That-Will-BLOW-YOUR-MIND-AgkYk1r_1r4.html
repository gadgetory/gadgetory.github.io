inflated tire is three times more likely
to cause a crash so let's do some damage
thirty-eight psi a good tire deflating
it to 27 huh 25% lower now it's three
times more dangerous now this one and
this one
okay owner it's come here I want you to
guess which front tire it's under
inflated this one looks a little
different Dell is the same yes they do
and this is the real danger you can't
tell by just looking that's how we
developed a device to help keep you safe
introducing the Zeus smart tire safety
monitors the next-generation technology
that puts you in control of your driving
safety safety has never looked so sexy
using the most advanced German sensors
Zeus monitors both tire pressure and
temperature in real-time and sends this
data to the app Zeus is the first ever
tire monitor to be able to detect slow
leaks with its advanced data mining
technology this proprietary algorithm
called accurate temp analyzes pressure
and temperature data over time and
alerts you to any slow leaks that other
tire monitoring systems would have
missed the app report clearly pinpoints
the exact tire and the rate of leakage
to make it even more versatile we've
designed it as a device that anyone can
self install take it with you on your
next trip and easily install in just
three steps on your rental cars
when it comes to protecting your family
everywhere you go choose the next
generation and safety technology zoo
smart tire safety monitor Binondo
today's technology for yesterday's call
back that's now on IndieGoGo
every year millions of houseplants died
because of too little or too much water
unsuitable temperature overly dry air
bad lighting or simple lack of love my
name is Johnny I'm the happiest house
plan in the world but I too is once
close to death then one day my owner
brought Rovia home and I realized the
owner still loves me and cares about me
Grobe is a smart watering system it
waters me when necessary and controls
what I receive just as much water as I
need grow vo monitors my health in
real-time and tracks moisture air
humidity temperature and light intensity
now I have another close friend who
takes care of me my owner can safely
leave for business trips for up to 45
days because I have grow vo to look
after me now I can tell my owner what I
need what's wrong and what can be done
about it
that's super handy also I can be moved
anywhere because grow vo is wireless and
we can sit together where our human
wants us to what's more now I can have
new friends because grow vo can manage
even three flowers with their individual
watering settings the grow vo app helps
our owner be sure we're healthy and
happy all the time
hiding solder I'm Alex and I'm the
partner of Gloria I believe we can do
more to save our favorite house plants
from drying out
it's not just a smart device that
controls environment of your home but it
also provides an interactive aspect all
your farm you can respond to their needs
in real time we have finished the design
and are about to start the mass
production that's why we need your help
over the last two years we've built
dozens of models in for work in Paradise
iterative ly we create and improve the
user interface experience to make it
more practical and useful support grow
your campaign to make our world a bit
greener place thank you
detective ppppp please take extra tick
tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick
what 50% after to be on time
and
keep it protected me PP keep a clean
escape it could be protected it
protected people to actively building
detective ppp-please
I really want people to understand how
profound this is okay this is not just
another device that is going to count
some things for you this is
life-changing and it's already been
life-changing for thousands of people my
patients needed solutions outside of the
office to reduce their stress response
and what it came down to was when people
nervous systems are in fight or flight
nobody's at their best fighter flight
kills all of our rational thinking it
inflames our body it creates 90% of
chronic health problems and I think we
need a solution that's simple effective
and that anybody can use so that
everybody can be their best
touchpoints our neuroscience wearables
that decrease stress levels and as
little as 30 seconds the devices used
gentle vibration on either side of the
body to help you calm down focus
optimize your performance and even sleep
better touch points come in a set to be
worn on either side of the body and can
be purchased at any one of four colorful
options they can be worn as wearables on
your wrist clip to clothing hidden in
pockets or socks are held in each hand
making them useful at any time of day
just 30 seconds of using touch points
can reduce stress by up to 71% we're
currently using the touch point in the
preoperative evaluation so when a
patient comes in for surgery that day we
ask them to rate their level of anxiety
about having surgery and if it's at a
level of 5 or greater we give them the
touch points to hold during their pre-op
evaluation it's like their history and
physical process of getting their IV
started it's been phenomenal we've had
really great success and the patients
are loving them and what to buy them to
use at home I purchase touch points you
know because I have a child in the
autism spectrum last year we went
through a very tough time where she
would even get out of the car for her
favorite activities so I saw the touch
points and I decided to try it so it was
very easy to use our third day with such
points she just ended up coming out of
the car and we were back to our routine
so that was an amazing experience for us
I'm in grade five at Santa and charter
school in their gifted program I use
them right before a test and sometimes
in class well they help me a lot with
anxiety and I just help me relax a lot
my name is Justin white I work for
Arizona industries for the blind as the
touch point solution Account Manager my
specific responsibilities are I make
sure that orders get out on time I also
handle billing and then any other
customer service enquiries 70% of people
who are visually impaired or blind are
unemployed
I've been visually impaired to all of my
life touch point Solutions has been
wonderful about choosing us as a partner
to help bridge the gap so we have
pre-existing scientific research then we
have something called archival clinical
data where I have years of clinical data
then we have the neuroscience
electroencephalogram data which shows a
reduction in the high frequency waves
that are associated with anxiety in less
than 30 seconds now that we know this
work and we've got user data that
confirms all of my prior scientific
findings we're listening to our
customers and they're really asking us
for a simpler solution that's more
affordable you know when you change one
hit from going into fight or flight
every day in a classroom you're
affecting that whole classroom and
you're affecting all those classrooms
you're affecting the whole school and
when you're affecting entire schools
you're affecting the entire to me
and it just goes on from there
you
I received a fitness tracker as a
Christmas gift a couple of years ago and
I really lost the product I was so
excited to wear it but I felt like
because it was party season it just
didn't really work with my style and
with the outfits that I had chosen to
wear and so that's when I started to
think wow we can do something really
really cool here and the concept for
benefit was for the benefit bracelet is
designed so that it fits with all
fitness trackers on the market
I'm Karen Whelan I've been living in
Shenzhen in southeast China for almost
five years now working mostly with
entrepreneurs and small businesses who
have really great ideas and I have them
then to bring the product to the market
working with people who are so ambitious
so driven it really really inspired me
to make benefit happen when Karen and I
first started talking about benefit I
started picturing a design that was
really beautiful
something very sculptural like a piece
of art for your wrist we wanted to
reveal the chapter so that fellows that
wasn't stealing the spotlight was
sharing it I'm Angie Kim I'm a designer
and I love designing products especially
products people find a connection with
our team stretches beyond Angie and I to
Hongkong San Francisco Pyrus like a
bunch of coast friend working really
really hard to get us to this point
we love you how to get our product made
all of your port or boat or
manufacturing tuning and ultimately
getting develop it into your hand</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
