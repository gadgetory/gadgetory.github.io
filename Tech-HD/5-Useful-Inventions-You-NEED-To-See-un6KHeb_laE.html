does your backpack keep your equipment
safe no matter how tough your bag is
there's a hidden danger humidity and
moisture introducing Enrico the world's
best waterproof camera back package
Enrico has enough space for two cameras
five lenses
in other outdoor gear
our professional-grade carrying system
distributes weight evenly making the
backpack comfortable to wear
Enrico uses an airtight zipper chain in
double sided waterproof material making
it one of the few backpacks on the
market that offers complete protection
from water wading through a river
braving the rain or even floating the
enrico keeps your gear dry
unlike other waterproof backpacks
Enrico incorporates a bluetooth humidity
monitor you set the threshold and if the
humidity in the bag passes it you
receive a message in your phone
prompting you to make sure the bag is
sealed or to add a new dehumidifier the
airtight zipper opens in less than a
second
meaning you'll never miss the shot the
open bag design means the camera goes in
easy and you always have easy access to
your gear
a Bluetooth connection measures her
distance from the back and will remind
you if you've left the Enrico behind
with a message in your phone
Enrico is not the first one a proof
camera backpack but it is the most
versatile other waterproof backpack
zippers are not as water tight in the
backs don't monitor temperature and
humidity Enrico is not our first

delivered the case air camera controller

Enrico and will offer a refund if we
don't meet that promise please support
us and keep your camera equipment safe
