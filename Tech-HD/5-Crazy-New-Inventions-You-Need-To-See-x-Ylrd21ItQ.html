experience sounds above you sounds below
you really imagine yourself in a big
balloon or a big bubble where a sound
can occur anywhere at any distance and
at any angle now sound is so subtle it
can be some moving it can be the key to
a flood of memories for me it's the
perfect marriage of science art and
human experience
essentially what Yara does is you hear a
lot of vividness in in the sound field
you hear depth you hear height and that
produces this profound impression of 3d
audio we think that we have a technology
that's versatile enough to play in a lot
of different fields for people who are
interested in movies and cinema but also
a serious music listeners can really get
a lot out of this technology and so
we're kind of closing that gap between
what you hear in the studio and what's
being played in the home traditionally
with surround sound there's a money
scene and unfortunately that's only for
one person with Yara several people can
be in the money seat because we can tell
you are aware the money seats are
several people can still experience that
very intimate very precise 3d sound
phenomena in the gaming world we've
often heard that that people don't like
to be isolated from their environment
for hours hours Anya
we might have a multi-user game in which
each person has their own sweet spot
they have their own perspective
it's just more natural to not have
something attached to your head when
you're listening to media of various
kinds very often our ears lead our eyes
we are multi sensing beings we verify
our take on reality by comparing what we
see with what we hear if what we hear is
vivid enough we can navigate in an
environment even from a young age I've
always enjoyed video games so over time
to stride to discover a way that I can
play those games that sighted people
still enjoy I don't think I've ever done
that that quickly he builds a full model
of an environment based entirely on
audible news on 3d audio
and I'm so excited that he responded so
positively to the 3d immersive
experience that he had with URI we feel
that the my beam technology that's at
the core of yarra is gonna go a long
ways it's going to be in your phone it's
going to be in your car it's going to be
in communication systems this will be
available q1 next year and we're
inviting you to be part of the community
that brings this technology to the next
level
hi I'm Adrienne passionate storyteller
and creator of victory tripod because
I'm always on the go I've been looking
for an ultra portable and
multifunctional tripod that works with
my smartphone DSLR camera and GoPro and
that's ready to use wherever I travel
victory stands apart from the pack
because of its compact size unique
design and extendable legs fast to set
and easy to use
victory will help you capture the moment
like never before
forget flimsy selfie sticks that have
limited angle versatility and often end
up visible in your pictures no more
improvisations and no more compromise
other tripods on the market are heavy
bulky and inconvenient to transport to
location and halt to the site victory is
sleep light and comfortable to carry you
can now be part of the picture part of
priceless memories have perfect control
over your images and get the best angle
without interrupting the moment don't
ever miss out on a great photo
opportunity no matter where you are
thank you
meet ex Jimmy see
you
area you can project beyond traditional
screen limits
you
what a wonderful effect
g'day I'm Michael from core electronics
and this is the desktop infinity era we
were compelled to create a kit that
fuses various methods of making and can
be assembled in an afternoon this is a
do-it-yourself kit you'll get to
assemble it run the wiring solve the
connections and learn to code at the
center of the kit is the particle photon
a clever little board that features
Wi-Fi connectivity and is easy to code
that means that once you've finished
assembling your desktop infinity mirror
it's really just the beginning we're
going to produce a series of tutorial
articles and videos that show you how to
remix your mirror however you like I'd
like to make something clear we've got
the laser color it's how I made this
prototype that means that all the laser
cutting and kidding is going to happen
right for you in Newcastle Australia we
have been in the maker industry for
years delivering maker electronics to
your door and helping people with their
projects now with your support something
special is about to happen we're going
to build our own style of educational
kit that we know you'll love as always
if you have any questions we'd love to
hear from you in the comments section
below and to wrap up whether you're a
seasoned maker tech curious or just
looking for a unique educational gift
consider that women's campaign
intruders are non fortune in fact in our
lives and we do our best to secure and
protect the homes from some dickheads
breaking in now people have a lot of
possibilities when it comes to
protecting their homes you can buy home
alarm systems for a few hundred bucks or
even lease one for small fee every month
the company you lease it from might even
install it for you for little or no cost
and then you can also get yourself
wireless systems and to save some money
you can even install it yourself all you
need is pretty much a drill and some
guidelines introducing fenoli the most
cost effective home personal and
neighborhood security solution on the
market when I say cost-effective I mean
it's cheaper than anything else on the
market with no hidden extra fees and
compared to this guy it's only a
fraction of the cost and the size for
that matter and you won't need any
drills or guidelines just put the
batteries in
download the fan Oriya and finish the
installation takes no more than 30
seconds and this guy he could go back to
doing what he does best which is winning
strongman competitions and of course
best known for
and last but not least go back to being
strong considerate now
let's take a quick look how it works I
live in a small flat and therefore
1/4 note is enough for me but if you
live in a big flat or a house then no
worries just buy more for notice and
place them around the house
then connect them all together through
the app the fenoli is made to be simple
therefore there are no physical buttons
on it everything is built into the app
so when I come home I get a reminder to
turn the alarm off the system is even so
smart that it allows me to schedule the
time of day it should automatically be
turned on or off now if there would be
an intruder coming in and not me this is
what would happen I told you before that
fenoli was the most cost effective home
personal and neighborhood security
solution on the market and when I say
neighborhood I mean the whole
neighborhood can help each other out
dealing with unwanted intruders the
amazing Icelandic summer you can easily
connect with your neighbours via the app
so they get notified if some is
breaking into your house why because if
you're chilling in the summer house far
away from home and you for nobody goes
blasting your neighbor can check your
home for you because your neighbor is
much faster reaching your house than any
security company or the police now let
me tell you how far nobody can help you
with your personal security you might
get into the circumstances where you
need immediate assistance you know that
kind of circumstances what you normally
scream for help
but what if nobody can hear you or
you're not able to scream at all just
whip out your phone open up the phone or
the app and press panic and the people
in your network closest to your location
get notified that you need help and you
can rest assure that somebody will come
to the rescue</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
