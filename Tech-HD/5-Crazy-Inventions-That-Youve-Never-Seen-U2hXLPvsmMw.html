oh that's also that's so good
we are domi oh sports the company behind
the top-rated helmet audio system domi
oh after having successfully launched
and shipped our first product worldwide
we're here with our second product the
all-new domi Oh Pro the inspiration
behind dome EO was simple with our love
for music and outdoor sports we
struggled to find an audio product that
worked well when wearing a helmet many
didn't sound very good and all were
uncomfortable but most of all we never
felt safe using any of them they blocked
our ears from hearing the outside
environment cutting off a vital sense
when we needed it most
when we couldn't find something we built
a device that mounts to the outside of
the helmet but transfers sound into the
helmet using a technology called micro
vibration we adapted this technology to
transfer the full spectrum of audio
frequencies into the helmet resulting in
a powerful and rich surround sound
experience without blocking the outside
environment that was back in 2016
fast-forward to today and we've grown to
a team of 9 sold and shipped thousands
of domi o--'s worldwide received 5 star
reviews and worked with top-tier
partners in manufacturing electronics
and marketing our die-hard customers
kept telling us how much better doneö
would be with one important addition
voice communication so we decided to do
something about it
the domi o pro features our new fully
wireless air mic a state-of-the-art
beamforming noise cancelling microphone
that delivers seamless connectivity and
voice clarity the device and mic mount
to the helmet using our snapping helmet
mounts backed by the toughest 3m
adhesive so they stay on no matter how
hard you ride
we put hundreds of hours into carefully
designing and testing the dome EO Pro
and now we're ready to kick off
production so join us today and be the
first to ride with a dome EO Pro a
game-changer helmet audio and
communication
if you're watching this video you
probably have a sweet pair of bluetooth
headphones and everyone's favorite
on-the-go console the Nintendo switch if
I'm right you're probably even wishing
they work together
this is Genki and it's about to make
that wish come true
Genki simply brings Bluetooth audio to
the Nintendo switch not convinced let me
give you three movies first thought is
designed just for the switch check out
how it works and just like that you've
got an upgrade Nintendo switch press a
button and you're listening to the sweet
tunes of Mario on your favorite
Bluetooth headphones whether you're just
chilling at home playing mob wins or
making your daily commute through new
dog city or even just killing time at
work jumping between barrels okay we
won't judge it's even designed to look
like your joy Kahn's
so you know it's good quality secondly
thank you let you pair up to two
headsets so you can share the fun just
pair a second headphone like you did
with the first and you can throw banana
peels at that friend you've been
secretly checking out or play another
battle test with that colleague whose
name you always seem to forget and
finally even defeat that hairy Canadian
with the pro controller and third we put
some serious tech for you to kick out on
check out this sweet rendering our
designer mate Genki uses very low power
through the USBC port without ever
needing a charge the latest Bluetooth is
compatible with all your audio devices
and arrange further than you'll ever
need we've licensed the best audio
codecs so you won't have to ever worry
about lag you can even pair a better
speaker so go ahead and host that
rooftop party or at least impress your
friends with a full on cardboard concert
with our dock adapter you can continue
playing late into the night without
disturbing others at home or not hey
thanks for making it to the end of the
video we've got everything in place for
production and we need your support to
get to the next stage we put together
some pledge options below and with that
we should be able to get Genki into your
Nintendo switch by the end of summer
