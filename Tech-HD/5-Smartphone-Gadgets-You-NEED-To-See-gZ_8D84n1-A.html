almost six years ago we launched a glyph
a tripod mount for the iphone 4 on
Kickstarter the glyph is a tool that
unlocks the full potential of your
smartphone as a camera after numerous
iterations and customer feedback over
the last six years we feel we have
designed the best version yet to do that
we focused on three areas number one an
innovative quick release mechanism grant
tripod mounts in the market today fall
into two categories the slow and
cumbersome yet secure screw style or the
quick but insecure spring style we
wanted to create a mount that is the
best of both the quick-release lever
when open allows the jaws to move freely
making it easy to quickly load or remove
any device with or without a case here's
the clever bit when you close the lever
it automatically Titans and locks around
your device resulting in a super secure
connection
number two the ability to mount in
portrait or landscape the glyph has a
side mounted tripod thread which allows
devices to be mounted directly in
portrait orientation this is useful for
panoramic photos periscope snapchat or
whatever the kids are using these days
number three extensibility we want you
to consider the glyph the starting point
of your mobile photography rig as such
the glyph has a total of three mouths
these allow you to add additional
components like a microphone or a light
and speaking of additional components
along with the glyph we are launching a
couple of our own a handgrip and a wrist
strap not every situation calls for
mounting on a stationary tripod the hand
grip and wrist strap provide a
comfortable and secure handheld Center
even just combining the wrist strap with
the glyph is a handy way to add a bit of
comfort and security when shooting with
your smartphone the hand grip is made
from solid cherry wood and the wrist
strap is made of durable paracord and
leather everything is tough robust and
built to last we hope you'll join us on
our campaign to create the best tripod
mount ever the bulk of our funding goal
goes towards the considerable upfront
investment needed for injection moulding
we've received quotes from our
manufacturers here in the US and if this
campaign is a success that are ready to
start production we can't do this
without your help so please hit the big
green button to become a backer and help
bring this into reality thanks for
watching and have a great day
you
phone has your whole life on it it's
your point of connection to the people
and the world around you it's also an
incredibly powerful computer the speed
and power of our smartphones rarely
holds us back for the small screens and
limited interface often do that's why we
created the Superbook a simple
plug-and-play device that turns your
android smartphone into a beautiful
laptop computer just connect your phone
to the Superbook using a USB cable the
Superbook provides the keyboard
multi-touch trackpad and display in your
smartphone brings the computing power
along with your files and apps and of
course the Superbook can use your
smartphones data Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
connectivity the Superbook has over
eight hours of battery life and it even
charges your smartphone it works with
all modern Android devices and its
future proof when you get a new
smartphone it'll still work with your
super bowl it's like getting a brand new
laptop every time you upgrade starting
at just $99 the Superbook is a fraction
of the cost of a traditional laptop and
is even more convenient hi I'm Andrew
co-founder of enduro miam makers of the
Superbook I was frustrated with having
such a powerful smartphone but with an
interface designed purely for mobile use
our goal the Superbook is to eliminate
the restrictions that hold smartphones
back the software side of the Superbook
is andro miam an app that makes android
function like a familiar desktop
operating system you get a mouse cursor
keyboard shortcuts desktop class
browsing and easy file management
everything is intuitive and optimized
for productivity there's no custom
firmware to install and no technical
knowledge needed simply download the app
from the Play Store and connect to your
Superbook you can use one of our native
apps or any of the millions of Android
apps in the Play Store we're also
introducing an open SDK to enable
developers to add a dromio optimization
to the apps we've already released a
beta version of and Romeo in the Play
Store where it's received hundreds of
thousands of downloads and extremely
positive reviews we've been developing
the Superbook and entro miam for over a
year and we're excited to finally
release them our prototypes are complete
and we're ready to move into full
production we're looking for your
support to help us make this new
kind of computing a reality the
Superbook is just the beginning and
we're excited for you to be a part of it
thanks for your support
you
hi Kickstarter's
sometimes you just can't reach your
phone maybe you're driving or it's
buried in your bag or perhaps you just
want to quickly activate one of your
phone's functions well allow us to
introduce Q mode the all-in-one smart

device in a slim and elegant brushed
metal shell and is equipped with a
single easy to click button commode is
also water resistant with a battery life
that allows you to click the button up
to 60,000 times here now are just some
of the many things that you can do with
your commode commode can trigger snooze
on your alarm for a bit more sleep or it
can activate Siri

you just can't find it or start
navigation when your phone is on the
dashboard mount Q mode can act as a
handy wireless presenter connecting
easily to your computer and requiring no
extra software or hardware to clutter up
your desktop Hugh mode is one of the
many channels on ifft the world famous
Internet of Things platform this means
that Q mode can remotely control smart
appliances such as nest and we mo and
will be compatible with future if the
pleione TSA's and applications the
ability to turn on your air conditioning
and house lights while driving home is
no longer science fiction but an
affordable reality for everyone setting
up Q mode is as easy as pie q mode is an
intuitive app providing you with all the
functionality you can imagine thank you

creativity q mode is capable of much
more than this video can show we're not
raising funds to bring Q mode into
production and each of you can help make
cumulative reality thank you so much for
your support
okay is it rock huh okay finally where's
my phone I will accuse you Kim Walt oh
yeah okay oh here it is got it
gadgets we all love our gadgets we're
inseparable from them they're part of
everything we do there's one big problem
they constantly need to be charged every
single day this can really hold you back
when you're on the go current solutions
like battery banks far from convenient
and battery cases for smartphones are
bulky heavy and you still have to plug
everything in I mean that's pretty old
school like using Ethernet to get on the
internet can you imagine life now
without Wi-Fi it's time to break free
from wired charging introducing the
world's smartest wireless charging
ecosystem by bowels we have designed
jackets pants shorts wristlets wallets
the charge your devices wirelessly when
you're wearing our pants and shorts just
slip your phone in one pocket and your
wallet in the other voila now your phone
is charging wirelessly inside your
pocket and our jackets work the same way
wallet in one pocket bone in the other
and the best part is that you can use
your phone while it's charging here's
how it works we've designed the world's
thinnest wireless charging pads and
place them into the phone pockets of our
clothing and we've designed ultra slim
battery bank that fits into our wallets
or works as standalone and they send
power up the charging pads when you
place the phone in close contact the pad
transmits energy the phone receives it
and it starts charging wirelessly
charging pads are smaller than a credit
card and so light you'll barely even
feel them and guess what they're machine
washable they're designed to work with
any qi compatible smartphone and with
our ultra slim cases for iphones
at night just leave your wallet on the
bow backs charging pad and its battery
will get charged wirelessly and our
jackets are the world's best travel
jackets they've got a tablet pocket
inflatable neck pillow that inflates in
only two seconds and they have a
built-in i mask oh i almost forgot about
the earphones we love music but hate
entangled earphones and bluetooth
earphones have poor battery life and
it's a pain to chart introducing bow
backs bluetooth earphones they've got
longer battery lives and the best part
if we just attach to the collar the
jacket and charge wireless not wearing
our jackets you can directly put them in
your wallet and charge them there
we've also made wristlets that charge
our bluetooth earphones as well as
smartphones
you can place our wireless charging pads
around your house off the school and
charge your phone and wallet
simultaneously our pants shorts jackets
wallets wristlets earphones come in a
whole bunch of different colors and
styles we created a new way of living
where you're not held back by the
battery limits of your devices we call
it mindless charge stop messing around
with those cords stay out late in 80
days don't hold back on netflix in
snapchat use the GPS as much as you want
experience a new sense of freedom where
your device is charged while you're
on-the-go be limitless go wireless bow
backs
what if you could see the world around
you in a microscopic scale blips is the
world's thinnest set of microscope
objective lenses that will turn your
smartphone into a digital microscope
when in use a tiny objective lens
electrostatically adheres to your
smartphone camera enhancing its optical
power and allowing a perfect distinction
of microscopic details blips was created
by the researchers of the neuroscience
Department of the Italian Institute of
Technology exploiting their know-how in
optical microscopy and micro fabrication
of devices for neuron imaging blitz uses
high-quality optical and mechanical
technology a soft film supports the
objective lenses which are specifically
designed and manufactured to achieve
great performances with smartphone and
tablet cameras too sticky bands of
engineered adhesive for multiple reuse
and clean replacement stick near the
edge of the film ensuring perfect
cohesion on any device blips is

the best settings however blitz can be
used with any app for cameras
two lenses for two different purposes
are offered blitz macro provides an
optical magnification of about 10 times
for high-definition macro images of the
most diverse subjects blitz macro is
also usable as a high power
magnification lens for quality checks or
for precise manufacturing where the
naked eye isn't sufficient blips micro
is perfect to observe the tiniest of
details and represents a first step into
the realm of microscopy it can
distinguish details of a few microns and
allows to capture images of cells and
inhabitants of the micro world blitz
offers two main kits the basic kit which
includes one micro and one macro lens to
enjoy both microscopic observation and
macro pictures the lab kit for a more
precise observation of the micro world
with an adjustable mechanical support to
stabilize the working distance a proper
light source and a set of selected
microscope slides
blitzen in the first product of smart
micro flicks it's been off of the
italian assistive technology our goal is
to provide everyone the tools to explore
the microworld</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
