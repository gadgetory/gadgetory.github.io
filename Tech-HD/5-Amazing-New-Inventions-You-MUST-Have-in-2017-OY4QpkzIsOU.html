how would you describe luxury sunglasses
high quality great design highly
protective lens made a precious metal or
acetate we agree with the first three
but not with the last one why there is
no luxury sunglasses made of natural
materials whose fabric is set out to
break this rule we are inspired to
elevate the sustainable fashion idea and
create high quality sunglasses by
perfectly combining wood and stone our
design team is inspired by the beauty of
Easton with architecture and that of the
Western stone heritage after researches
and adjustment we introduce them with a
modern design and optimal shapes the
slate song collection here is how we
make it with fabric uses a layering
technology originated in Germany to
enhance the quality of the sunglasses
this technique make sunglasses more
durable more elastic and not as easily
broken as using a whole piece of food
this fabric sunglasses are simply and
perfectly made of wood stone and glues
we used CNC machine to ensure the
precision detail and it is the most
eco-friendly way because it maximizes
the use of materials every pair of his
fabrics and glasses is scented with
three different grades of sandpaper and
coated with high-quality oil and wax for
the key of every optical products lenses
we use ties one of the highest quality

a nice cold drink
refreshing but the lack of an effective
solution for the frustrating
condensation ring leaves us with only a
few subpar options wrap it with napkins
stack it inside a second cup will resort
to using an old-fashioned stationary
coaster so here's how it all happened
feeling confident as ever ready to make
a lasting impression I was prepared for
everything it seemed if only I hadn't
overlooked the condensation downpour
that would leave me sloppy and
embarrassed we knew there had to be a
better way so we created barnacle
coasters barnacle coasters a mobile
coaster that is convenient reusable
actually keeps you dry we listed all the
things that were wrong with the current
options and weren't satisfied until we
created a product that solved them all
in order to make a mobile coaster that
people would use we had to prevent drip
while at any angle a patent-pending
design captures condensation allowing it
to enter and preventing its escape
the barnacle coaster accommodates the
cup of your choice a fun and colorful
product that can feature any pattern or
can be used as a marketing Avenue
offering readily visible advertisement
space our dishwasher-safe barnacle
coasters mean that those pesky
condensation drops are a thing of the
past not to mention they can easily go
with you anywhere you go at school in
the office around the house they even
fit inside the cup holder of most cars
think about it where will you use your
barnacle coaster
we use barnacle coasters all the time
and we know you will do
you
here at Mason we believe that quality
tools are essential for great cooking
two years ago we launched the me--some
chef's knife right here on Kickstarter
with the help of over 13,000 amazing
backers but our story didn't begin with
the knife it began with a tan like
quality knives well-made pots and pans
are essential for great cooking
but finding perfect with where it can be
exhausting
kitchen sorter stocked with hundreds of
confusing options with loaded price tags
once again
consumers are forced to choose between
quality design and fair prices this
didn't seem right to us so we decided to
make something better so initially our
design process started with a lot of
research while we wanted to create
something that was incredibly
high-performing and a powerful tool in
the kitchen once it create something
that was beautiful as well we found that
a lot of the pans that were out there on
the market weren't meeting the
functional needs that they needed to
each of the bases for each component of
the cookware set is specifically
considered and designed for the task
that it's meant to accomplish when we
approach the design of the skillet basis
we looked a lot at the curvature of the
walls and what would really achieve the
most ideal situation for sauteing in
Tulsa the saucepan has straight vertical
walls and the saucier has much more of a
curvature and so we focused our approach
and a saucier because that wall
curvature does allow you to mix and
whisk much more easily the design of our
handle centers around three main points
one organ AMA says they relate to
comfort and control to the ability to
stay cool while cooking and three
abortional balance in relation to its
pan all of the formal aspects of the pan
respond to functional needs but maintain
an aesthetic beauty we wanted to create
something that you would enjoy using and
want to keep around
nice and cookware features three
millimeter five ply stainless steel for
more even heat distribution
ergonomic stay cool handles for comfort
and control rounded edges for drip-free
boring and durability to last a lifetime
over the past year and a half we've made
a ton of progress we've tested and
selected incredible materials sourced an
amazing manufacturing partner and
designed hundreds of prototypes we even
finished the custom tooling machinery
for our footwear but now we need your
help your contribution will enable us to
complete our first production run
funding the inventory and skilled labor
we need to craft our code work we're so
excited to be back on Kickstarter where
we can share each step of the
manufacturing process with you
