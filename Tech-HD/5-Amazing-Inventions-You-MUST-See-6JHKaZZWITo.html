nowadays smartphones are one of the most
important parts of our daily lives we
use it for personal communication
finishing tasks or work checking social
media posts or even playing your
favorite game during lunch break it
almost feels like an extension of
ourselves with traditional charging
options we can't satisfy the battery
needs for heavy usage of our smartphones
making us frustrated every time when the
phone pops up and low battery
notification hi Kickstarter
my name is Toma and I'm here to say that
the traditional ways of charging mobile
phones are inconvenient today we need a
better simpler and more convenient way
to charge our phones we have researched
and tested many different ways of
charging including wireless solutions
and we decided to use magnetic adapters
for our charging packs as a proper
solution with corresponding magnetic
adapters you can charge any kind of
smartphone
the charging pack is only 15 grams
weight which is extremely portable for
everyday carry in 30 minutes this tiny
little pack can give an iPhone 8 a 25
percent battery boost so that with four
of these places in total your phone will
maintain fully charged for charging
packs can provide an iPhone eight about
nine hours of battery usage also the
charging station is a portable battery
with 5000 milli amperes this is our
magnetic charging cable which supports
fast charging due to maximum 2 amp
currents now let's see how finger pal
can help
yeah
mother
we are confident that finger pal will
help bring back convenience to our lives
and furthermore help us to utilize our
smartphones in a better way we look
forward to having your support thank you
very much

this is a review of the FMA GP nbg 18 a
dummy non-functional replica of the
night-vision goggles
used by Tier one Special Forces
operators these goggles became very
popular after the movie zero doctory
being worn by the SEAL Team six in
operation Neptune spear
the loca of the FMA GP + VG 18 is
certainly impressive but the quality
itself isn't great while the plastic
isn't bad you can see plenty of
leftovers from the molder vision through
the lenses is very blurry and turned
upside down you won't be able to move
around with these goggles on the
attention to details is known and less
satisfying
basically they're great for showcases
and photo shoots for being kept up on
your helmet during games just for the
sake of look and a more immersive
experience the Box in which the unit
comes is actually pretty nice and well
done
you'll get replacement lenses and QR
code speakers as well
goggles are routed to a via dummy
battery pack / counterweight with a dual
core attachment in conclusion get these
goggles if you want to capture great
footage or if you want to add them that
last bit of realism to your kit don't
forget that you need a night-vision
mount such as the Wilcox to install the
goggles to your ailment</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
