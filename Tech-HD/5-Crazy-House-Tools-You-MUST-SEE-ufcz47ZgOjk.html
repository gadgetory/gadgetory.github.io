attachment or an assemble system it will
typically be loaded with between two and
three liters of mortar which only takes
a few seconds it works well with cement
or lime mortars self mixed or bagged the

pressure the mix will not separate so
you will not experience clogging and
stoppages and with precise delivery
control from the drill trigger
