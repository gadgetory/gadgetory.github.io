this unassuming ordinary looking microbe
is a dinoflagellate or dino for short as
a group dinos are incredibly diverse and
can be found in oceans and lakes all
over the world although their existence
may seem trivial from our macroscopic
world view these fascinating tiny
creatures offer us a beautiful example
of what makes life itself so exceptional
inspired by the ability of these dinos
to bioluminesce or generate light from
life itself we set out to create a
product that would enable people not
only to witness this beautiful
phenomenon but interact with it from the
comfort of their home or classroom after
countless hours of sketching prototyping
and testing we're so excited to finally
introduce bio glove letting it bubble
creates a calming effect to relax you
into sleep
or swirl the Bayeux blow for a sensation
of glowing vortex this Kickstarter will
enable us to purchase the tools and
molds necessary to bring bio glow to
life thank you so much for your support
