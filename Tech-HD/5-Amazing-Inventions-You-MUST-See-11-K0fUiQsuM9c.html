holding the paddle I was very efficient
with that started out and it seems but
then it got so much harder I mean
there's something for every skill level
I've actually played pingpong robots
before ah actually blew my mind hi
Kickstarter i'm alex and i'm harrison me
and my brother always tried to kick each
other's ass while we play ping-pong so
we start booting first train about with
just the garbage can to just search for
us to smash but later on we find out
with app and software you can do a lot
more you can simulate games you can
create your own drills and the coolest
part is you can share those drills with
anyone in the world three months ago we
decide to join acts which is the world's
largest hardware accelerated we source a
lot of motors and we also design the all
the mechanism from the ground up to give
you the funny experience that we want
you to have we have talked to many
manufacturers now now the last part it's
just cooling and Kickstarter that's why
we need your help please back and share
this campaign and Kickstarter so we can
bring turnabout to you thank you
you
we are all curious each child peeking
through a gap in the fence every
scientist hunting for an answer and
while the lovers staring up with the sky
while dreaming or while searching we
have always turned to the night sky
filled with the wonder of a billion
stars and the infinite space around us
all of us look up but how many of us can
capture it frame it bring it home and
share it now you can capture a space in
the palm of your hand that's why we make
tiny one the world's smallest smartest
and most social astronomy camera
redesigning one you can capture the nice
guys never before you no longer have to
worry about expensive equipment or
advanced photography knowledge just
point and shoot we developed proprietary
noise reduction technology that allows
you to effectively improve image quality
over various environmental conditions
without sacrificing on image Mandela
this coupled with a powerful sensor fits
in the sleek and compact form factor
that means that the tiny one sees better
at night and fits perfectly in your
pocket p program and augmented reality
star map to help you locate planets and
constellations easily the tiny one is
also compatible with all the lenses out
there and even telescopes did we mention

seamlessly to your smartphone and allows
direct sharing to your favorite social
media so the tiny one is not just about
the night sky it's about you like Neil
deGrasse Tyson said when I look up at
the night sky I know that we are part of
this universe we are in this universe
but more importantly the universe is
within us
we want you to not only be able to see
the infinite expanse of the universe but
to be able to capture it in a way you
rarely get a chance to we have been
working on a tiny one for the past two
years to make a show that RV easy and
accessible to all now we need your help
to bring tiny one into production and
into the hands of every curious Explorer

everyone loves outdoor activities but
with all that fun comes all that cleanup
that's why I created the rinse kit it's
like having a hose to go my name is
Chris Crawford and after countless hours
of developing I've created something
that is truly revolutionary rinse kit is
super easy to use to fill it simply
attach the Quick Connect adapter to any
sink or hose bib turn on the water it
will fill in 30 seconds attach the
nozzle and it's ready to go there's no
pumping or batteries required it uses no
moving parts and it will hold the water
pressure for months okay so right now
you're probably asking yourself how in
the heck does this thing work inside the
rinse kit there is a sealed chamber when
you connect it to a hose bib the water
pressure from your home simply
compresses the air in the chamber the
best part about this design is that it
essentially uses the air as a spring
there's nothing to wear out we
specifically designed the rinse kit to
be easy to carry and travel with it
holds two gallons of water which will
spray for over five minutes on the
center setting and for over 30 minutes
on the mist setting the lid detaches so
you can clean up and change on it you
can also use it as a cutting board or to
sit on as you rinse off your feet
rinse kit is bpa-free so it's safe to
drink out of and it's extremely durable
you really can't hurt this thing
throughout the years mankind has pursued
their outdoor passions and has suffered
unnecessarily we've always felt that the
rinse kit could be the ultimate portable
shower if it could make its own hot
water but our early attempts to heat the
water in the rinse kit were a little
impractical finally we figured it out we
developed a heating probe that drops
into the tank and runs off every
chargeable battery it quickly heats the
water in the tank to a nice comfortable
shower temperature I even included a
smart USB port for charging your devices
we've had some help from friends and
family but we're essentially still a
startup company we need your support to
help develop the engineering tooling and
production on this game-changing heater
accessory
no more excuses it's time to get outside
and have some fun thanks so much for
hearing our story we hope that you'll
support us with one of the options below
and please make sure to share us with
your friends on social media
you
we think things should be easy and that
you shouldn't have to waste time on
every demonstrations like this so we
designed nipple
nimble is the world's first one finger
cutting tool you can use nimble to open
almost any type of packaging making
plastic a nimble isn't just opening
packaging it can be used to cut out
vouchers for crafts present wrapping and
more I believe solution should be simple
and that's what we've achieved with
nimble we made countless prototypes of
nimble during development and tested
them with over 150 volunteers around the
country to make sure that nimble does a
job better than anything else out there
it's rubber body especially designed to
be one size fits all so you don't have
to worry about choosing the right size
you can use nimble with either hand left
or right a safe blade design means that
although or packaging should be afraid
of nimble you need of me nimble's blade
is made out of zirconia ceramic a
special material which is much harder
than steel so you won't need to worry
about finding replacement anytime soon
nimble's bright color midi you can be
confident that you won't lose it in
kitchen or desk drawer it's compact and
portable size makes that deal to have
around the home or on the go we believe
nimble can save you time and frustration
on a daily basis we've worked really
hard to get nimble to the point is up
now and now ending your help to take the
last big step and get nimble produced on
a larger scale so please backers and say
goodbye to wrap rage with a swipe of
your finger
