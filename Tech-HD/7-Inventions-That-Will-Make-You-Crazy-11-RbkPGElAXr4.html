new fetch toy and with your support on
Kickstarter your pup to be one of the
first to enjoy this gravity-defying
100-plus foot flying ring launcher the
hurricane 9 ring launcher built to give
your dog maximum exercise and just a
fraction of the time it's made from
durable Evie a foam which is built to
withstand the sharpest teeth forget
about the slobbery tennis balls the
hurricane nine works indoors it floats
and yet you could take it to the dog
park all dogs love the hurricane nine
even if your dog's not typically the
type to chase the tennis ball even
though we haven't gotten to market yet
the hurricane 9 prototype has already
been featured on the news and selected
as a top five must-have toy at the san
diego pet expo did i mention it was
invented by a rocket scientist hi I'm
John Hunter co-inventor of the hurricane
ein i work at high speed airplanes solar
airplanes and now the world's most
bodacious dog toy and one day I was
working on a sporty good that would
apply a really long ways based on an
airplane wing like this he's taking
everything wrapped into a circle and
flies a country mile I took it to my
daughter's house and just for fun I
tried it in front of her dog Amos and he
was went crazy so I immediately realized
after about 20 more shots that Amos
really like this thing we had a great
dog toy in our hands here we go dogs
dynamics 101 while we've been teaching
dogs we've been talking to dog trainers
to something really great about this toy
is that I also floats so if you have an
active dog who likes the water would be
a great idea as well
like most of us Emma's owner is a busy
person and so she doesn't get that daily
exercise a study show is proven to make
a healthy happy pub and so she's left to
dream of that blissfully exhausting game
of fetch after just two launches your
dog has already run the length of a
whole football field and it's easy to
use you just load the ring pull it back
and release and to use it inside just
pull it back part of the way and if
you're feeling old-fashioned just throw
it without the launcher you go tiger it
also doubles as a great training aid
the hurricane 9 comes with three rings
with six rings or with six ring sold
separately we need your support on
Kickstarter to fund mass production so
that your puck can be flying through the
air as soon as next month so please

seen when I woke up was an energizing
essential oil and the beautiful item

smart diffuser it allows you to enjoy a
hundred percent natural and organic
essential oils virtues and it's
extremely simple do you want to know
more let me show you essential oils can
help you well being in many ways for
example if I was working for two hours I
would start to have a serious headache
so here is how to simply set a new
capsule that's it and we're ready to go
for a month when I set or change a
capsule on the diffuser the app will
instantly detect which one it is in this
case I've plucked the clear head capsule
in oh and look it's already on my screen
voila bye-bye headache Oh haven't I told
you I can also control Lumiere from my
SmartWatch but even better it can start
spreading automatically that way when
tebow comes back from work he doesn't
even need to think about his relax
capsule Lumia mobile app learns from you
to automate the diffusion matching your
mood and schedule it also asks the
volume of your rooms to spread the
perfect amount of oils as well as
contraindications to always guarantee
absolute safety
beyond their benefits on well-being
essential oils have all the specific
perfume that you can use just to set up
the atmosphere you want
