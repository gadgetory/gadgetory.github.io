there are generally four elements to a
great cocktail glassware ice liquid and
garnish
while most cocktail lovers wouldn't
settle for less than perfect ingredients
or glassware they're often forced to
settle for cloudy impure ice that looks
bad
melts quickly and dilutes the
hard-earned drinks for the past four
years our team at Winter Smith's has
harnessed the power of clear ice to
bring cocktails cold brews and cold
beverages of all kinds to a whole new
level
we were thrilled to have launched two
crystal-clear ice molds here on
Kickstarter the ice baller and the ice
chest after getting some great feedback
from our backers we have found a way to
take everything you already love about
winter Smith's and give you more of them
Phantom is a complete ice system that
can create seven clear ice spheres six
clear ice cubes eight clear Colin Spears
and sixteen clear standard cubes and the
best part all these crystal clear ice
shapes can be made with regular tap
water and your everyday freezer look out
for more shape trays coming soon to
here's how it works
one fill the stainless steel container
with ordinary tap water to insert shape
tray and place in any freezer three
remove in about 24 to 30 hours and twist
the shape tray out of the container for
serve or store the ice for later
phantom increases the amount of ice that
you can create it also includes upgraded
double wall vacuum insulated stainless
steel which means improved quality and
durability in case there are any
slip-ups now let's get a little nerdy
and talk about the science at play clear
ice is created by controlling the
freezing process and removing any air
bubbles or impurities this also makes it
denser so it won't crack apart keeping
your drink cold for longer another thing
Speirs had the lowest surface area to
volume ratio and will melt very slowly
while several small cubes have the
highest ratio and will provide faster
dilution for stronger drinks phantom
solves this with its variety of shapes
and sizes
we could not be more excited to be back
on Kickstarter with Fanta
your support has made winter Smith's of
reality and your incredible feedback
over the past four years helped us
develop phantom if you're looking for an
easy to use device that improves the
experience of enjoying any cold beverage
well you've come to the right place
Cheers
