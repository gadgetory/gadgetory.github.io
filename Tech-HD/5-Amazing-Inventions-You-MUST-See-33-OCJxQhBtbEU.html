we love our smartphones we take them
everywhere we go they help us plan our
day keep in touch with friends and
family and for most of us they even
support our work day but all these fun
functions come at a cost battery don't
you just hate it when your phone runs
out of battery our current solution
includes carrying around our power bank
plugs cables and everything else we need
to ensure we don't run out of juice
imagine if there was a smarter way this
save your precious phone battery from
running out all the time something
lightweight and easy to use say hello to
cube it's the world's first
revolutionary power bank that combines
three features in the one compact device
power bank memory card reader sink and
quick charging cable you don't even need
your USB flash drive anymore cube turns
into a memory storage device and it's
compatible with any laptop via the USB
port there's no need to carry around any
other accessories ever cables are often
messy but knock you simply wrap it in
this tuck away slot and you're good to
go how really does the cube work well
it's a simple concept just plug your
cube into your phone and into the power
source it detects when your smart phone
is fully charged and redirects the
charge to its internal battery unlike
your power bank that must be charged
separately cube automatically charges
itself while charging your phone so you
always know that cube is there for you
and will never let you down hi my name
is question as every busy person I was
often on the road and almost every day
my phone was running out of the battery
in the afternoon instead of messy wires
and power bank I wanted to have only one
small device that can replace the number
of home accessories I have
carry everything when we started to
think about the cube look at the
existing technology on the map and we
quickly noticed that most of the
available devices were not complete and
not use a friend together with fear our
head designer we developed the cube we
went through several prototypes to find
the best design review the designer this
elegans compact and practical it was so
challenging with all those
functionalities together into a swollen
cool design with a significant victory
oxidation it was something that had
never been done but we made it and we so
proud and excited to bring it to you
cube is the world's first compact and
lightweight device that combines the
functions of a power bank a memory
storage and a sinking quick charging
cable you'll also agree it's one of the
coolest looking power banks around
