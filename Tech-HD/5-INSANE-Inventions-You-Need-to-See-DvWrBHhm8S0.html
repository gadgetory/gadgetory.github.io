computer
or constrain to surface architects
designers and engineers can use marathon
to rotate their visualizations in three
dimensions it provides a simple and
unified solution where you can drag and
drop elements even drawn flies and
showcase 3d models simply by moving the
pen in midair we are now ready to take
the next step we love our product and
need your help to make marathon the next

bittersweet and would it be crazy to
call it magic
because it's like I'm there there with
you that's my real I never actually
alone
piloting drones is a relatively new
activity that most people are starting
to explore we wanted to design a drone
that introduced as many people as
possible to the first person view drone
experience without breaking the bank
introducing a whole new flight
experience the bolt is an innovative and
versatile first person view drone
available at a radical price it's a
complete ready to fly out-of-the-box
solutions that easy and safe to pilot
the drone for everyone there are three
ways to fly first for beginners to start
flying simply turn on the drone and turn
on the controller the two will sync up
and pair and you can take off the drone
features altitude stabilization and a
beginner's mode that makes picking up
the basics of breeze learning how to
safely and confidently maneuver and
control your drone next for those ready
to expand their horizons attach the
screen to the controller and start
piloting the drone further away simply
turn on the drone and the screen the
camera on the drone will automatically
sync and broadcast a live
high-definition feed mount the screen on
the controller and you're ready to go
finally for those ready for the whole
first person you experience swap the
screen into the goggles and prepare for
a whole new flight experience immerse
yourself into the world of fpv piloting
and cruise around high in the sky or try
your hand at fpv drone racing and
experience the incredible excitement
from every twist and turn drone racing
is a new and exciting sport that is
quickly growing around the world using
fpv goggles pilots race their drones
around courses to compete for the
fastest times it is truly the sport of
the future the bolt can be used to
experience drone racing at a fraction of
the current price it's an exciting
virtual reality flying experience
the ball drone was designed and tested
in Los Angeles by a team of expert
product designers aerospace engineers
and drone enthusiasts it's built on a
carbon fiber frame that offers unmatched
performance and durability the HD camera
provides crystal-clear video and photos
and the battery easily slides in and out
for quick swapping the drone design is
modular so that individual parts can be
replaced the result is a highly
maneuverable lightweight and aerodynamic
drone the bolt features a unique and
innovative fpv viewing system that
allows seamless transition from
traditional viewing on the controller to
fpv viewing using goggles we're excited
to offer the bolt drone at a radical
price traditionally consumers purchase
their drones at a high price point since
importers wholesalers and retailers mark
up the price of a drone up to 500% by
cutting out the middlemen we are able to
sell directly to you and pass on the
savings the both drone was designed to
introduce as many people as possible to
first person view piloting and racing
without breaking the bank with our
finished prototypes ready for production
we're here on Kickstarter to raise the
money we need for our first batch with
both drones we want to make first person
view piloting and raising accessible to
everyone with your support this can be
the start of something big thanks for
watching
