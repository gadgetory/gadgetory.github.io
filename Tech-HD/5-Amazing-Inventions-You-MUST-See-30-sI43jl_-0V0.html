hello my name is Cathy I'm an
intrapreneur professional writer
activist friend mother and longboard
writer and healer to celebrate the day
when technology caught up with my dreams
to make the world a safer place for
everyone in 2000 I was attacked by a
complete stranger he cut my throat
opened my stomach up three times into my
heart area it happened in a safe
neighborhood in the light of day 200
feet from the police station I fought
for life with what I had tooth and nail
but what actually saved me was the call
for help
16 years ago I heard few options so I
used my voice I was extremely lucky the
help came to me I'm alive and being
alive is all the difference
since that day have been thinking if
anything could have kept me away from
bad experience someone easy and smart to
save lives and give a warm feeling that
you and your loved ones are safe and
sound
at long last there is one this isn't him
the ring with the panic button to send
an alert to friends people nearby police
and private security services with just
a touch of them when an emergency simply
push the button the message with the MF
coordinates immediately reaches your
safety circles
NIEM helps you feel safe in any
situation of suspicion of threat or
direct danger give it to your loved ones
and you will always know when they need
your help is there in emergencies
including fires floods robbery armed
attacks sexual assault or health
problems
it's the fastest and safest way to send
another
with the ring they can send the signal
without no one who loses that we don't
need to dig around for the device and
then look at her to find the button you
don't need either hand to be free
you don't need to have a long
conversation with the 9-1-1 operator
together a great team you created the
system that drops the latest high
technology design around your finger in
the application you can manage a list of
receivers as defined on health issues
say frequent rolls and store other
critical information we've made
thousands of prototypes to make sure the
ring is nice and comfortable to wear the
bottom is functional and the false
alarms are negligible we aim to build
community where people come forward to a
pro helping hand to those in trouble we
call it crowdsource security and we
believe that society's ready to protect
itself name is available in two colors
to fit your style it looks and feels
good
whether you're on a morning run a
business meeting or parsley it meets any
dress code and looks appropriate in most
situations of your active life I wear
mine in everything I can work late and
writers do that all the time go for a
night write or do anything entertaining
my daughter takes it under there out to
crazy parties and I let her go with a
lighter heart I embrace their known
while feeling safe and secure I want to
share that feeling with you imagine the
world will help us always there we can
make it together
Becca project on Kickstarter help us to
make the world a safer place for
everyone
project shadow is bringing back the
ultimate outerwear to Kickstarter this
time we redesigned and took our
windbreaker to the next level for people
with innovative minds we needed a jacket
that was super lightweight and
weatherproof
yet keeps you dry with maximum
visibility for safety this jacket is
packed and ready for any occasion and
has a fashion-forward design for the
urban outdoors we call it the ultimate
loom inject these weatherproof high
visibility jackets are specially
designed for travelers commuters or
anyone who wants to make their travel
beyond ordinary based on a feedback from
our backers we designed our lumen jacket
to provide maximum visibility in
low-light condition to keep commuters
safe we've made upgrades to existing
features such as adding mesh line bends
on the chest and back for maximum
airflow an invisible back pocket with a
larger eight and a half inch opening on
side seam to keep your essentials on an
elastic cuff and hem band for more
comfort and flexibility a larger hood to
give you extra coverage and a harsher
weather
in front pockets that are finished with
water resistant zippers to keep your
belongings dry we've made multiple
prototypes tested materials improve the
fit and explored every aspect it creates
the ultimate lumen jacket packed with
new features the ultimate lumen jacket
gives you total control with an added
earphone outlet inside the left chest
you can now listen to music with the
earphones locked in place we've also
added a detachable patch with magnets to
easily hold your earphones we came up
with three jackets that will fit any
need first the ghost made with a special
fabric that absorbs the light and glows
in dark second The Olympian
made with flash reflective fabric so you
will always be seen in the city streets
third the shadow made from fully water
repellent materials to always keep you
dry in the harshest conditions we wanted
to create a jacket that was practical
and functional to make it accessible to
everyone at an affordable price to do
that we are skipping the middleman and
offering it to you our backers
whether you wear it on your weekend trip
on your next camping expedition or just
on your regular commute the lumen jacket
is the most versatile jacket on the
market we need your help in making this
project become a reality so take your
performance to the next level and
support the ultimate lumen jacket
as in the inventor you have these hopes
and dreams and the only thing that
really keeps you going is being
optimistic that yes we can make this
idea work and to finally see it work
after a decade of tinkering away in the
shed with my dad was extraordinary our
next big challenge was to take our
invention to the world and crowdfunding
allowed us to do that in a way we never
jump to as possible suddenly our small
campaign attending to a community of
passionate beekeepers all around the
world now numbering over 35,000 and
growing it's amazing to see their
enthusiasm for beekeeping and their
willingness to learn to share knowledge
one small act right of saying I think
I'm gonna try bees that it opens up not
just this world of bees but it's sort of
a window into being more connected to
nature in a much larger way I thought it
was an awesome invention I'd seen how
typical beekeeping takes place how
harvesting honey happens and I thought I
didn't want to do it that way I'd rather
try something different one of the
coolest things I've ever done in my life
was pull out the first frame crawling
with bees honey harvesting is such a
pain and it's a tremendous amount of
work and it makes a huge mess it's very
disruptive to the bees it's just it's a
kind of a disaster no matter what you do
no matter how hard you plan you just end
up with you know honey everywhere so to
actually just have it pour out of the
side of the hive into a jar and skip all
of that mess is amazing when we got the
first fly hive going
it was obvious that it was such a
peaceful and entertaining experience
every time we get honey we make sure all
our friends come over and experience it
is really special but what a beautiful
treat to have especially if you can know
where it's coming from from your
backyard
it's the least processed food that I
know as far as a sweetness go and a
taste bloody good it's been a really
busy year for filling all the orders and
it's such a good feeling to see all the
photos and videos flowing in from all
corners of the globe as beekeepers
experience the joy of harvesting pure
and processed handing directly from the
hive our bees are very very happy with
the flow they're filling up the frames
with honey as fast as we can harvest it
lovingly shared by happy bees and urban
honey has this variety to it in depth
that you continue to taste I love it
love it harvesting a frame of honey and
just being able to smell it like a glass
of wine and actually the floral notes
are are there I mean if you smell a
bottle of honey that's that's been
extracted it just it's not the same and
I think that's a amazing thing that is
hard to believe until you experience it
we've seen the videos on the website but
there's nothing that compares to your
first experience actually seeing it flow
out of the hive it was just absolutely
amazing none of this could have happened
without the IndieGoGo community who
jumped on board to support us and shared
our campaign far and wide we did that as
soon as we could within seconds of it
going online been wanting to do bees for
decades and decades and decades so to
say thank you to the IndieGoGo community
for making all this possible our most
popular flow hive classic will be back
on IndieGoGo an original campaign
process for the next two weeks so the
best bit is you don't have to wait we've
got hives in stock all across North
America Europe and Australia ready to
deliver to your door if you need to be
gaping be sure to check out our
educational resources and forum at honey
flow comm and connect with your local
beekeeping group to learn all the
fascinating things about caring for bees
we're also excited to announce a special
range of organic cotton t-shirts and for
these next two weeks 100% of all profits
from this range will be donated directly
to the rain forest trust to help
preserve forest ecosystems around the
world
our forests are really important habitat
for thousands of species of pollinators
bees is such a good reminder of the
interconnectedness of life on earth the
little piece of magic they do we call
pollination is essential to the cycle of
life that we all depend on and if we
look after the beans they'll look after
us and the honey really is an amazing
bonus
