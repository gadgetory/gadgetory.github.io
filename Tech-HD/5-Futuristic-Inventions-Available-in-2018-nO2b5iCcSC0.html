didn't get the computer all day really
takes its toll on my back
yeah uh-huh
no I'm good it's super annoying I just
wish there was a way there is a way you
can fix your back pain the plexus will
plus the plexus will plus is our
brand-new patented wheel designed to
give you a full away spinal stretch so
you want to give the plexus wheel plus a
spin that feels great
I felt this good in years I'd say it's
10 out of 10 what a neat product if you
cou co-workers are like me you've tried
using other tools exercise balls foam
rollers problem with those tools is they
aren't designed to fit between your
shoulder blades
unlike the plexus wheel Plus which fits
easily allowing for an upper neck to
lower back stretch and plexus will we
are serious about spines our over 50,000
customers have been rolling out their
stress on the original plexus wheel for
over a year now during that time we
listened to their feedback the plexus
wheel plus has all the goodness of the
original but with added upgrades why am
I sitting shirtless next to this grand
fireplace on this faux bearskin rug I
don't know but I'm excited to see what
happens next
this is Sarah we think she's gonna help
you focus while I talk about the
grotesque problems facing our All
American backs
you see 20% of jobs in America are
manual labor and all that manual action
can put a lot of stress on your back but
see the real reason that our backs are
hurting is the nearly 80% of American
jobs that require mostly sitting at our
office chairs we sit all day at work
causing our backs to slowly contract
into this position all this lack of
activity can cause
nerves sore muscles and sciatica yep
your back feels gross for the plexus
wheel plus we engineered our thickest
ever super comfy compression mat the Mac
design features a spinal canal so it's
more comfortable on your back and
because your spine presses deeper into
the mat the muscles lining your
vertebrae are stretched horizontally as
well as vertically allowing for an
insanely relaxing four-way stretch it's
easy enough for everyone to use preggers
bigboy even grand-grand the plexus wheel
plus comes in three sizes gentle medium
and deep tissue Hey feel like you don't
need all that plus the original might
suit you just fine and our happy back
guarantee means if you don't like it
send the dang thing back for a full
refund so if you have a fact the plexus
wheel plus is for you get yours today so
uh you guys want to go to my house and
watch the mash
producing K&amp;amp;Z sand flux true Wireless
dual driver headphones with the unique
dual driver audio system sound flux
headphones are consistent and perform
extraordinary well with an ultra dynamic
range with crisp eyes detailed mid-range
and unforgettable bass sound flux
defines the new standard of quality its
sound past feature when enabled allows
you to engage with the environment
without pausing your music
the truly Wireless form factor provides
not only stereo music but also stereo
phone calls sound flux headphones
contemporary design makes it comfortable
and secure for every ear the headphones
come in a rechargeable case that extends
music playback over 24 hours
my name is Brenda Phillips Tyler I'm a
producer musician pianist and drummer
I'm Michael Lewis and I am the artistic
director of the Elena wooden project my
name is Harry I've been playing music
since around sixth grade my initial
response these headphones are
comfortable when I think about like even
Apple earpods or beats in ears after a
while I have to take them out because
they hurt my ears as a conductor I'm
really looking for balance so I really
need to find a headphone that can
properly display the treble very well
and the mid you want bass to be there
and we live in and the bass society what
I do love about these is that I can
still feel the bass I don't feel like
the bass is compromised these earphones
are different from the past ones I've
used I feel like these have a much more
natural sound and it's not forced
headphones are using the past still have
way too much bass or not enough at all
this one kind of has an even
distribution of everything okay so I'm
gonna get a call now and it's gonna be
in both these Wow okay like you really
sound like getting my head when I talk I
hear myself I hear you
my music is still playing so really
really clear definitely different from
different headphones because I feel like
it's the voice is all around 360
surround sound these headphones sound
paths feature is pretty cool I would
definitely use this feature especially
being at the gym you don't have to keep
taking your headphones off you want to
talk to your friend
pretty weird being able to listen to
yourself and other people it's not just
other people you can hear yourself talk
to so I think it's definitely really
cool so typically when I leave the house
I do this one through three pack which
is phone keys wallet to mature I've
everything I need I feel like now I have
to do up one two three four pet which
would be my phone my keys my wallet and
my door driver true wireless headphones
that's what you hear people say right
whether you're sightseeing or whether
you're at a sports game or maybe it's
baby's first steps camera or your cell
phone on you what you do I mean it's not
like you can turn back time or can you
well believe it or not you can with
something called the rotor so just after
the fountain started I actually press
the record button the fascinating thing
about this piece of tech is it's
actually buffering video all the time
kind of like a short-term memory but not
recording it take a look right here on
the app and what you'll see is it's
recorded 10 seconds before the fountain
started and 10 seconds Rhodri is a new
concept we have a new way for people to
capture unexpected moments things that
usually are not captured nowadays so we
think we can open up a whole new world
of content well you you walk on the
street you see something funny happening
and you try to grab here's a smartphone
you're too late so we wanted to create a
technology that makes it possible even
if the moment has passed you are able to
capture it the camera is buffering all
the time kind of like a short-term
memory so it will capture the 10 seconds
before you press the button takes a clip
that started 10 seconds back in time
until 10 seconds after and then this 20
seconds clip is automatically
transferred to my phone so I can
instantly share it with my family and
friends the rotor is a time machine
video camera we call it that way because
it goes back in time well we brought
rotor to CES to Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas but we were present at
the start of Buddhist is the area where
a lot of startups present their products
we got a lot of media attention we have
been covered by the local news in the US
but also many websites even by Discovery
Channel and the BBC for us the most
important thing is that all the
which actually helped us understand our
concept ourselves because we learned
from how people write about it and how
their reception is and it gave us a lot
of ideas to help us focus to concept
even more and make it even better but we
have spent two years on developing and
creating this product we are almost
there we hope that people will support
us making this investment happen and
therefore making this product into a
success we've been developing an
extensive towards roadmap that all
follow the same principle record back in
time we give a really nice incentive to
back us early and to help us to get out
the first product we believe there are
many unexpected moments that can be
recorded so please help us capture those</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
