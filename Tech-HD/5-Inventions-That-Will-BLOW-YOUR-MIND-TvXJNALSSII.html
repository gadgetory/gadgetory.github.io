unlike anything you've ever seen or
tasted watch we're about to cook Center
uses advanced electronics and software
control inspired by satellites so what
you're seeing here is not a standard
grill with standard heating coils
syndra adjusts hundreds of times a
second to control your foods temperature
to within one degree
syndra is more precise than your
thermometer temperature precision is
required to perfectly cook your steak
chicken and salmon edge to edge without
guesswork when you pan fry at home it's
difficult to nail the temperature that's
precisely a difference of just five
degrees makes or breaks your food this
is even difficult for restaurants to do
but with cinder you nail it every time
what I'm showing you here is exactly
what your steak will look like all I did
was set cinder to my desired doneness
place the steak inside and wait 30
minutes for cinder to beep it knows when
the food is reached temperature as a
final step I cranked Center up to for
250 degrees for a quick sear to
caramelize the exterior that makes it
look and taste exactly like this in some
sense it's just a regular frying pan
except with precise temperature control
but wow that precise temperature
controller makes all the difference
we make salmon that melts in the mouth
and you know thick porkchop because I
can never cooked before because it dried
out while we put it in the center and
it's perfect
sakes perfect it gives you the precision
of sous-vide but with the convenience of
microwave cooking anything you can put
into a normal grill you can put into
cinder and not only cinder is easy to
use as a normal grill it also makes it
impossible to overcook your food because
senders grill plates constantly hold
your food at target temperature
you
you
this is the lolly microphone the world's
first digital 3d microphone that plugs
right into your iPhone as a musician
it's important I can have high quality
audio at a moment's notice
like when we need to record a demo the
second inspiration strikes yeah we're
actually we give you guys a demo and I
barely have to think about it because
lolly doesn't need a separate app
battery or memory card it's as simple as
plugging into your iPhone and recording
lolly can also be a great addition to a
filmmakers kit it'll instantly give you
industry standard 44.1 for 48 kilohertz
audio lolly is designed to be 3d so no
matter how you turn your smartphone it
adjusts the orientation so that when you
listen to it back it creates an
immersive feeling like you're really bad
and with the reversibility of the
Lightning port Raleigh can easily be
used with either camera we understand
that you guys are debuting a new song
tonight can you tell us a little bit and
for the podcaster a radio journalist
lolis portability means you can always
be ready to record professional
interviews and when you're going to
conference lolly is a great way to
document the excitement getting crisp
sound even when your front row
recorded lolly because great sound
matters
standing desks you see them everywhere
they're messy they're absurdly expensive
and they overtake your entire desk
at this view we decided it was time for
a fresh perspective deskey is a flawless
mix of form and function the 25 by 15
inch working surface is designed to come
in a laptop papers drinks and anything
else you may need weight work desk view
is an affordable standing desks option
that transforms any workspace in less
than 10 seconds simply choose the
working height you desire press down on
the levers and just like that you have
the best view in the office
the secret to desk view is simple we use
the strongest industrial-grade suction
cups on the market giving our desks
unparalleled hold strength all without
damaging your wall or window hi I'm
Jason Crouse key that mic bellows were
the creators our desk you the window is
the highlight of any office he had a
majority of office desks facing the wall
it's not exactly an inspiring view so we
set out to rethink the problem we
created is the first window mounted
adjustable standing desk we launched our
initial design in 2015 and people loved
the ease strength and versatility of
desk view but we wanted to take it to
the next level so we partnered with
award-winning product development firm
minimal
we wanted to make desk you strong and
easy to install so that anyone could do
it we embarked on this long campaign for
months and months we were working and
reworking the brackets for desk view and
finally we came up with the design that
we go with today we over engineered
every piece of the product from the
suction cups to the levers to the
working surface to the edges god we went
through so many prototypes editing the
window is such an underutilized portion
of an office or a home anywhere and so
when people realize that you could take
what was an empty space that no one
could use and turn that into a desk or a
functional space they loved it and what
we created is an elegant sleek versatile
design
des view features high grade lightweight
aluminum brackets for strength durable
rubber suction cup components for a safe
secure suction force and a securing
lever that's designed to fit any hand
and firmly secured SPO one fluid motion
we finished up design and prototyping
and we're ready for production we have
our manufacturing partners lined up but
we need help to get it into your hands
so join us today and free yourself from
the shackles of traditional this V is
right great
you
yeah
you
hi we're the team behind refill like
many of you we carry reusable bottles
but we get frustrated when there's no
place to fill up and we get even more
frustrated by all the plastic waste from
bottled water so we created refill
service that lets you easily fill your
bottle on-the-go with cold filtered
water we already have a functioning
pilot network around the village in New
York with your help we can start
expanding the network around the city
this summer eventually we'll spread
throughout other cities until refill is
available worldwide the timing is
perfect
cities around the world are banning the
bottle and everyone agrees that the flow
plastic pollution into our oceans has to
stop so please support our campaign now
and help people ditch bottled water for
good
