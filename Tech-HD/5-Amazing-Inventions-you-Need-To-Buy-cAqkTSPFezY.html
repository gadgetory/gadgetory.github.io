card of meltable bioplastic that you use
to make fix and modify the world around
you you can mold it quickly and simply
to make little solutions to everyday
problems
when it school is really strong like
nylon so you can make solid durable
solutions with it
and then you can reheat it again and
again to adapt change and reuse it
because it's handy card size you can
keep one in your pocket wallet kitchen
drawer or toolbox so that it's there
whenever and wherever it's needed and
because you know melts in a cup of hot
water that might be in a cafe to fix a
broken umbrella all around a campfire to
fix broken tent pulp
it's strong enough for quick solutions
to emergency situations like when you've
forgotten a tool for a job or handle
great on something
plastic has got a bit of a bad name it's
associated with a cheap disposable world
in which things break easily and then
end up in the bin form card is the
opposite of that world when it's very
hot it sticks to other plastics so you
can actually use it to instantly fix
things say a plastic shovel when you're
on holiday there are loads of amazing
applications and we'll be posting more
examples online as the project develops
but I believe in this material has place
in everyone's kitchen drawer toolbox and
backpack like blue tackle sellotape so I
developed it into a flat card form that
would always be around and always be
ready to use the size and thickness of
the card is exactly the right amount
material the quick types of fixes that I
need you it fits in your wallet and it
fits in a cup so you can take it and use
it anywhere you can find hot water it's
quick clean simple instant and fun we've
made form card affordable and everyday
product and are now producing them loads
of amazing colors of every possible
application
I want forum cards reach everyone who
thinks about fixing things instantly
when they break
just take one out of your pocket drop it
into hot water and fix things simple
