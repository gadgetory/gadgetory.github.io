hi Kickstarter I'm Eric the inventor of
straw bees
and one of my favorite inventions of the
50s is the hovercraft a vehicle that can
travel across land and sea and a cushion
of air and bring us a little bit closer
to the dream of the flying cars of the
future so that's why we invented a
modular cardboard hovercraft kit using
only cardboard low-cost material trash
bag low cost material and our cool
snap-on motor system slightly higher
cost material we love innovation I want
to share that with you so that's why we
turn to you Kickstarter helped us make
this happen and raise your friends and
family 50 style
rude that's the hovercraft
if you're wondering power
hi my name is Austin and I'm one of the
founders of a company called B cheese
and we created the world's best outdoor
and beach accessory today I'm out here
in beautiful Santa Monica California to
show you how it works
as you can see standard drawstring
backpack but when I open this up out
pops a seven foot by seven foot
microfiber polyester sheet that's sand
resistant water resistant and heat
resistant perfect for days at the beach
the park camping hiking or even hanging
out with your family in the yard we
added a couple cool features like
weighted corners which holds it down on
a windy day like today one of my
favorite parts is when you're ready to
go all you do is reach inside the bag
turn it inside out give it a couple
stuffs and it's right back in its
original form just like that we left
with a lot of extra room in the back you
want to bring additional belongings with
you like sunscreen lotion beach toys or
whatever you prefer we also added a side
pocket to protect your valuables like
your phone your keys and your wallet and
when the beach sheet is open and it's
laid out the pocket is actually on the
inside throw it over your shoulder and
you're ready to go that's Pete's
hey guys I'm Austin and I'm Dave thank
you so much for watching our video

and we sold a thousand units in 60 days
it sold out to sort out the reviews have
been crazy people love the product so we
need your help donate today so that we
can raise enough funds to bring the
manufacturing cost down and get this
product out on the market we appreciate

Malibu California for our launch party
