for my family and friends I can't
believe how much coffee I was wasting
before it looks amazing in my kitchen
and is so quiet to use it's simple
controls I get the right amount of
perfectly ground coffee every time 25
years ago I started designing premium
coffee products this is where my passion
for creating excellent coffee began
since then I have learnt the barista
quality coffee can only be made using
exactly the right quantity of really
fresh ground beans I became frustrated
because the perfect fresh grind is so
difficult to achieve with current
grinders due to issues such as retain
grind inconsistent yields and Hoppus
full of beans going stale I soon
realized there was nothing on the market
that addressed these problems so four
years ago I set out on a journey to
design the solution the niche grinder
it's simple to use all you need to do is
weigh the exact amount of fresh beans
you need for your next coffee drink pour
them in here close the lid and switch
off and watch all your beans being
quietly ground by the large professional
conical purse you then get all those
same beans freshly ground here meaning
your grind is as fresh as the beans you
use it's simple environmentally friendly
and quickly produces precise quantities
of fresh ground coffee saving you money
saving your coffee saving our planet the
niche grinders unique no retain grind
design is further enhanced by large
conical burst
delivering the coolest freshest grime
ossible the stylish design and premium
materials elegantly complement your
kitchen it's total cord storage keeps
your workspace clutter free we have also
added a clear safety interlock lid
giving peace of mind whilst you watch
your beings been expertly grounded the
infinitely adjustable grind dial makes
it easy to produce a complete range of
coffee's including expresso pour over
and French press I have moved the idea
forward from initial sketches and
detailed computer designs to over 30
fully working prototypes I've been
joined by a wide range of experts and
we've engineered a patent-pending new
product we have combined this classic
design with all the features you would
expect and more to bring you a coffee
grinder like no other
we are working with skilled craftsmen
using the highest quality materials and
hand building high performance grinders
here in the UK we're now at the stage
where we are ready to start manufacture

the first production and make niche a
reality so if you're passionate about
getting the best tasting coffee back our
