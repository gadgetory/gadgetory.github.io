wearable that gets you out of bed keeps
you out of bed and helps you form a
consistent productive morning routine
the Pavlov prize vibrates silently in
your lightest stage of sleep to wake you

enough the device can only stay
selectable impulses to signal your brain

padlock Rhys knows when you're actually
awake it doesn't just get you up it

person and thousands already have with
the path la prise now it's up to you

order the Pavlov fries hi I'm Annie
shakey founder and CEO of palak we've
been lucky enough to crowdfund and
deliver on two campaigns the pavlok and
the shot clock devices that helped you
break bad habits and wake up early and
now we're back with something that we
think is even more revolutionary a
wearable that doesn't just help you
break bad habits but helps you form a
good ones we call it Havelock rise what
we found is that the most successful
people in history all share in a
keystone have a consistent morning
routine this is where the pavlok rise
comes in it's the first device that
helps you get to sleep get up and form a
productive and consistent morning
routine
tens of thousands of previous padlock
users had already used our devices to
wake up early here are a few of their
stories I've always had the worst
trouble for waking up when I heard that
Pavlov was a device that helped you
break bad habits then I thought I could
give it a try it's finally gotten me to
out into the habit of waking up and it's
been a success so far I'm an insomniac
and I actually take medication to sleep
so it's really hard to wake up in the
morning because it leaves me kind of job
I think the first time I used it I got
right up the morning before padlock word
very kind of tiresome felt pretty groggy
getting up until I had my cup of coffee
or energy drink I feel a lot better now
with hablok than I did when I didn't
have it way more like what I'm getting
out much faster from bed and ready to
kind of conquer the day with over 40,000
nights of sleep data with our AI and
machine learning algorithms we found the
exact times and the exact sensations
that wake you up feeling refreshed how
does it work rise will gently vibrate
and beep to wake you up but if you're
still stuck in bed well Rises electric
stimulus and new sensor cortex will
change that once you're awake we'll help
you stick to the goals that you've set

everything in the house only after
passion all the undersea a rigorous tear
the drone is ready to be shipped thanks

live the sea a unicellular and
multicellular organisms take root on
every underwater city and growth
