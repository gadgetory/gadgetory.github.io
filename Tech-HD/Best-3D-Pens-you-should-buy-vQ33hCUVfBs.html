when we first launched the 3doodler
we asked the world to imagine a pen that
could literally draw in the air two
years on we've made the world's first 3d
printing pen even better with a new and
improved version that's slimmer lighter
quieter and even easier to use the
3doodler heats then rapidly cools
plastic allowing instant 3d creation and
with no software or computers the
possibilities are limited only by your
imagination we've shipped over a hundred
and thirty thousand first generation
three jewelers and our community has
used them to create amazing things from
jewelry to RC planes fully three doodle
dresses architectural models and even
writing Braille it was because of the
support of this Kickstarter community
that we were able to make the 3doodler
dream
to say thank you we've decided to bring
3doodler 2.0 to you first completely
redesigned from top to bottom and housed
in a sleek aluminum casing the new
3doodler is the result of over two years
of research and development all aimed at
giving you the best three doodling
experience possible the new 3doodler is
also packed with loads of enhancements
making it smoother sleeker and easier to
use than ever before we're also
releasing exciting new accessories
including the jet pack a portable power
pack that gives you the freedom to three
doodle on-the-go to help kick-start
creativity in the classroom we've
created a special educational bundle
complete with pens plastic accessories
and curricular materials which you can
send to any school library or makerspace

or wave a finger in the air you can
create with the food water our community
website has hundreds of projects and
stencils that you can download for free
and it's filled with how-to videos and
images of inspiring creations from
around the world
unlike other 3d printing pens on the
market poly s utilizes light curing
technology photosensitive polymers are
exposed to ultraviolet light at the same
time this allows the poly s to avoid
disadvantages found in other printing
pens that use abs or PLA materials we
have completely eliminated all high
temperature parts so that drawing no
longer means having to work with high
temperature 500 degrees Celsius tools
our goal is to provide users with the
safest experience possible
we believe that 1.2 inches is the ideal
diameter for hand operated tools this
provides users with the greatest degree
of control when holding the tool with
one hand from the LED battery indicator
and ink level port to the Pens elegantly
designed concave pen tip every aspect of
the poly s has been designed with the
needs of everyday users in mind so that
drawing is an enjoyable experience the
world should be colorful poly s is
beautiful exterior should come Institute
poly yes say yes to a polychrome world
poly s is not only car from the outside
it's filled with color you can mix and
match inks in every color of the rainbow
we also have Santa dings dings a
transparent glow-in-the-dark inks to
change colors with different
temperatures and many other fun options
poly essence white ready events provide
users with a feast for the senses that
goes beyond just 3d the most colorful
pen is also the safest blue LED
developed exclusively by future make can
be solidified using lights from the
normal visible spectrum which makes poly
s safer for children to use the nanny
other 3d printing pen our researchers
put significant effort into developing
blue LED technology which was recently
awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics this
technology can achieve the same
solidification effect as ultraviolet
light but without any danger to eyes
in addition the poly esketh a tilt
sensor and safety switch which is not
only a technical improvement but also a
way to make sure that the poly s is
completely safe for child use
