volts is non hazardous low voltage you
and your children are safe from electric
shock when exposed to water you can

we are radians the manufacturer of
rocket radians will continue to launch
innovative heating related products
ranging from the world's first 5 volt
comforter wireless cooking utensils
wireless hair drunk we also plan to
utilize and implement our SFI M
technology to various industries
including residential heating and
agriculture we envision to lead the
deployment of future renewable energy
while helping humanity conserve and use
energy more efficiently experience
rocket at IndieGoGo now rockin
so this is the
bulb that has actually been up to space
and past the drop test from a hundred
thousand feet back to earth
the world is switching to LED but LEDs
are kind of pretty horrible at the
moment doing products with lightbulbs
we've experienced and notice that the
light that we want is not really what we
can find in the market lighting has a
really big role in how we feel and
recreating this filament with this new
design that sort of characterizes fire
at the same time create something that
is also energy efficient and that's
really where the idea of art came out
before we started flights we used to
send things up into space now that we've
gotten to making crazy levitating light
bulbs we thought we want to send
something from flights up into space the
idea of nature and lightness and then
kind of fit perfectly with the idea of
our launch so we went in the middle of
nowhere in one of the darkest days of
the year
it's freezing here it's more like oldest
and darkest places to be we're going to
set a light bulb free by putting it on a
near space balloon we've done a few film
shoots here at flight and we have never
done anything where you spend weeks
preparing but as soon as you let go you
can't do anything
a lot of preparation is necessary timing
is critical it's about 95 percent
planning and 5% execution every little
angular of the cameras every little
sensor everything has to be perfect
there is no adjustment
you
we managed to pull it off then we had
the challenge of actually finding and
after three or four hours we didn't get
any communication from our rig we had a
problem with the GPS transponder we
think it's because of the extreme cold
it's minus 60 up there that's when our
team sort of gave up on the idea of ever
recovering it again but the next day we
got a call from a local ice fisherman
Tommy an ice fisherman found it the next
morning in the middle of nowhere so it
was a really nice interesting mix of
randomness and human kindness that
brought this whole project together
you
advantages of having LED lights in our
homes in offices everywhere the thing is
that with this advancement we forgot
about one important factor is that le
days to be appreciated they must also
look nice we want to make an affordable
version one that can hang in bars and
cafes and homes all around the world our
LEDs last 30,000 light hours so that's
14 years at six hours a day so if
they're gonna be lasting a long time
they might as well look really nice
we're working with one of the best
manufacturers in the world but
nevertheless we still needs your help
with your support on this journey we
could really bring this product to life
and set the light bulb free so this is
the actual light bulb that's been up to
space as much as we'd love to keep it we
do plan on letting one lucky backer take
it home so if you're into the idea of
having something in your home or
business that has been into the
stratosphere this might be the pledge
level for you thank you
you
you
you
to fully leverage cutting-edge
technologies
innovative
