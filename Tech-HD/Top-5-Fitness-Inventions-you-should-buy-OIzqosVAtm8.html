two years ago we set out to help people
get in the best shape of their lives
reaching our fitness goals can be hard
we're all busy we're all different and
it's not always clear what's most
effective for us at sculpt we believe
that improving your health and fitness
starts with knowledge knowledge about
your body knowledge about the progress
we're making towards your goals and
knowledge about what will work best for
you as a unique individual that's why
we're launching the chisel the simplest
smartest way to measure how much leaner
and stronger each of your muscles is
getting just place the chisel and the
muscle you want to measure and that's it
the chisel immediately measures the fat
percentage and muscle quality for that
specific muscle and effortlessly
connects with the sculpt app for the
Bluetooth smart so the information is
right in the palm of your hands the app
tracks your progress so you can see how
far you've come and it guides you to
your goals so you always know where
you're going with the chisel you get an
accurate reading of your total body fat
by measuring just three muscles triceps
abs and quads but you can measure up to
24 different muscles to get even greater
insight if you're working on getting six
pack abs you can set a goal of reaching
12% fat on your abs and stay motivated
by tracking your progress if you're a
runner you can focus on ensuring that
your muscle quality is symmetrical
between your right and left legs and
between your front and back muscles to
help prevent injury we're going even
further we're working with leading
fitness professionals to automatically
interpret your data and give you insight
and guidance we're all different what
works best for me might not work best
for you that's why we're building
fitness programs based on your specific
goals
in your unique body our goal is to help
you reach your goals as efficiently as
possible let us show you how your
workouts are affecting your muscles
before the mirror before the scale and
before your pants came why so you can
get the best results faster
you
you
introducing the world's first self
Rowland young man
we call it the yo-yo Matt let us show
you how it works
to unroll the mat give yo yo Matt a toss
with the top side facing up when yo yo
mat is unrolled it stays perfectly flat
with no annoying curling edges and when
you're done simply flip your yo-yo mat
over it will roll itself up or give it a
quick it stays rolled up without the
need of straps or bags the more it's
used the better it rose and the storage
is never been easier and cleaner to make
a working prototype and require a lot of
thinking and hard work a lot of creative
engineering this idea seems simple at
first it turns out wasn't as simple as
we thought first I had to get the idea
out of my head and onto paper
finally we worked all the kinks out came
up with a prototype and after all that
we also secured two US patents the yo-yo
Matt's not made just for yoga for all
fitness activities kids playing that
stretching dancers and soy the Frenchie
loves it so normal of that allowing you
a little more of this
Oh
more than 40% of our lives are spent
inhabit for most of us that time is
wasted
the secret to transformation is not to
try harder it's to replace bad habits
with the habits of excellence if you
wanted to transform yourself how would
you start first identify the habits that
hold you back
paired them with a negative stimulus
like electric shot each surge of voltage
trains your brain and weakens the neural
connection until the bad habit is
severed next replace the bad habit with
a positive one reward yourself when you
complete your daily goal commit to a
penalty if you fail the fear of loss
stimulates your basal ganglia while the
chance of reward motivates your
prefrontal cortex in fewer than 30 days
the action becomes a habit
Havelock is the first system designed to
help you build good habits and break bad
ones earn rewards when you succeed pay
the price when you fail and experience
the electric shock that keeps you on
track contribute to the crowdfunding
campaign today hi i'm annie Satie
founder of pavlov now I know that
electric shock sounds crazy but
sometimes crazy works like many
revolutionary ideas ours started off
just as a fun project but it turned into
something much more together with my
co-founder Jim Lynch we set out to
create Pavlov the world's first device
that doesn't just track what you do but
actually changes what you do here you
see pavlok in this wristband form but at
its core hablok is a small module small
enough that it can stick anywhere on
your body
now padlock is able to vibrate beef and
even electrically shock you on command
but what padlock can do is much more
you
our first device wasn't available to the
public for about a year and a half after
we came out with it we were selling
specifically to professional and college
teams the reason why we're doing
Kickstarter is to release our second
product which we call the Viper to all
of our professional athletes all over
the world at the same time as making it
available to the public we look at this
opportunity to really share our creation
with everybody not just professional
athletes not just college athletes
because we all want to move better we
all want to feel better we all want
tools and technology that can help
enhance whatever experience we have as
an active person that's really the kind
of ethos of our company
the relationship we have with our
athletes is one where not only are they
participating in the innovation and the
design of the products but giving their
feedback and giving us that information
so that we can go out and make a better
product is something that I really think
separates us from a lot of companies the
first two athletes we gave the Viper to
were Blake Griffin and Adrian Peterson
having you know those two as the guys
that really use a product first but also
kind of gave us their feedback on what
they would like to see in the product
this is invaluable to have the feedback
of athletes of that level they're going
to hold you to the highest possible
standard they're not going to use
something on their body just for the
sake of using it they're going to use it
because it's going to add value to what
they're doing
I'm not I got is be able trying you know
a lot of products I like it
yeah all right we have
the Viper is a multi-purpose fitness
device that uses the combination of
pressure and vibration to loosen up
muscles and increase circulation I
always work backwards you start with the
idea of what you want it to do what you
want it to be so we figured out how much
force we wanted how much frequency we
wanted and to do that to some pretty
advanced engineering and that's where
our engineer Rob Martin really came in
and we really had to search long and
hard for the components that would
deliver the type of performance we
needed the first challenge with the
product was how we're going to get that
much power into such a small space so
you need an energy source and because it
was going to be portable
we knew we went right to lithium-ion
batteries that are rechargeable similar
to what powers a phone or Tesla motor
we're throwing an incredible amount of
force and power and frequency through
this device and that's the one thing
that is really hard to describe is the
power of the device it's really
something you just have to put your body
on to understand
as a company we're really proud of the
Viper
the market for fitness bands and other
wearables has become increasingly
populated saturated with numbers but
little in the way of motivation
this is jaha it's an all-new fitness
band but with the twist
and that's why we created jaha we
developed jaha with the idea that the
fitness platform can provide more
function and feedback than the band
itself let me explain the apps that are
tied to these expensive bands will
usually only track numbers that
correspond to your daily goals steps
calories and sleep patterns pretty much
every time you check your app or fitness
band you'll be greeted with numbers
which could lead to a lack of motivation
but jaha is different imagine going head
to head in a virtual fitness competition
with celebrities or being able to burn
more calories and a professional athlete
that day
take your pick who would you want to
challenge compete team versus team or
friend versus foe or make it a friendly
competition with your co-workers with
jaha challenges you can challenge anyone
anytime even celebrities you can also
find other people you want to follow and
compare your fitness tracking stats and
goals even view a newsfeed of all your
friends progress you could also make
yourself private at any time looking for
a running buddy or workout partner set
your options to automatically find
friends using the GPS feature or locate
running partners spotters and friends
nearby using the GPS tracker after you
run you can access a tracking map of all
the paths roads and locations your feet
have tread now all that bundled in this
affordable price there must be a catch
well you're right the best part is we
caught the fault of some of the
top-selling brands and fix them creating
jaha to combine the best features style
comfort and function that does not exist
in other fitness trackers plus we
created an open protocol so other band
manufacturers can utilize this app as
well and that means the jaha community
will grow faster and stronger with more
users and chaough
jaha low key challenge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
