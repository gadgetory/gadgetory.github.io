hi I'm Ben and I'm thrilled to introduce
yato a clever speaker for kids
Yatta gives your children access to
wonderful music stories and learning
that grows and adapts over time kids get
to choose what they listen to using
physical cards which means fewer
distractions from screens and phones
more family time together
inspired by Montessori philosophy kids
control yato with physical cards and can
listen to their favorite music and
stories as well as the best children's
podcasts and radio from around the world
yato can help fire their imagination for
learning and language with games they
love to play
yato includes loads of content out of
the box and with new cards coming out
all the time yato can grow with your
children and not become another
discarded toy parents can even upload
their own content and create
personalized cars for all the family
yato access is a curated library of safe
age-appropriate content selected by a
team of editors and parents can use the
yato parents app to order new cards set
sleep times and to turn yato on and off
from a monster point of view I think
it's absolutely fantastic piece of
equipment because it gives a child the
freedom which promotes the independence
it gives him freedom to choose what they
want to play and when they want to play
it so we tested an early prototype and
the least favorite part was that you
could just listen to the music whenever
she wanted to after a couple of days
Lily wanted to bring it to her room and
you loved it the new to create yato
we've assembled a team of experts from
the worlds of music and publishing as
well as product design and manufacturing
and we're working with leading
educational institutions and renowned
authors and artists to build a great
library of content
yato is designed by families
families and we've been testing in homes
for over two years it's all of the good
things about internet content were none
of the bad stuff like addictive screens
or dubious YouTube videos it's fun but
it's also educational and inspirational
it's about giving our kids the best
start in life now we need your help to
bring yato to families everywhere so
please back our campaign on Kickstarter
say Kickstarter over there say it that
way they kick stuff yeah
more than eighty percent in that
Romanian absolution levels and the
British we should see a huge
environmental impact we to the World
Health Organization even treatment when
so many there once again copy the file
and a link is about capturing air
pollution before it enters the
environment from their cars from a
trucks from the diesel generators that
are spitting out this particulate matter
and then converting that into inks of
various sorts we did the initial
research and prototyping for this idea
at MIT Media Lab for the last few years
we have been getting a hands dirty on
the roads of Bangalore to solve this
problem after we are done capturing air
pollution we take it through a
purification process and then we treat
it with solvents to create printing inks
but developing new ways to be able to
paint and create without the negative
effects on nature is an awesome idea I'm
so into it it's so much pollution that
just half an hour can paint an entire
pair of shoes
I'm excited to work with something an
ink that will merge both together beauty
and environmental awareness a way to
advance humanity and to save the space
around us
by gravity we started as a small group
of hackers supplying science technology
and creativity to solve hard problems we
thought how can we take something that's
totally undesirable ugly and as bad as
air pollution and turn it into something
beautiful something that everyone uses
as common as inks so every stroke on
paper that you make is essentially a
quantification of that particulate
matter you would have otherwise read in
when you're walking outdoors by backing
us you help a scalar pollution to
capture technology and bring a ring to
as many people as possible what's the
best place for this carbon so to go is
it your lungs or is it something like
inks that we make
got this new accessory for the fire box
nano it's a case and it's actually a
stand for the fire box nano as carbon
felt inside to protect the nano take the
nano out take the carbon felt out and
then down underneath are these pins that
fit right into these little grooves they
slide up into the carbon felt and kind
of have to form the holes for these when
you first get it and you can just slide
the pins right back into those same
holes create a wind block the X pattern
locks the nano in its open position
allowing you to tip fire great up and
put sticks going all the way down to the
floor to create a micro Swedish fire
torch works is an ash pan for no trace
cooking I've been putting this one
through its paces and it's deep ribs
really seem to give it the strength that
it needs to hold up to all that heat of
a wood fire I'm gonna go ahead and use
it a little bit more right now and cook
up some sausages and grill up some steak
it's good stuff
that's good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
