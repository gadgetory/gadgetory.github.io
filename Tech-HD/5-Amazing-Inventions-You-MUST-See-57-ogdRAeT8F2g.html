beer is pretty awesome and we all know
that beer tastes best fresh in the tap
with the perfect amount of carbonation
and texture but in order to reach the
masses beer is sold in cans and bottles
worldwide and unfortunately for us beer
lovers it just doesn't taste as good as
it does fresh from the tap until now
introducing wait tap wait tab has been
developed to deliver that fresh from the
tap experience no matter where you are
whether you're at the barbecue dinner
party sporting event or a camping trip
or wherever you enjoy beer wait tap
delivers the best possible beer drinking
experience with our patented visit
technology when you pull the tap handle
forward the beer is poured under
pressure to maintain the carbonation in
the body of the beer and when you push
the handle backwards the beer passes
through our sonic oscillator which
creates an ideal density film that
provides a rich smooth full-body texture
of an authentic draught beer
we don't use any gas chemicals are added
it just thoughtful science and a passion
for making beer tastes the way the brew
masters intended last year we introduced
our first generation products to the
market through crowdfunding and the
response was overwhelming not only we
found an audience for our product but we
also found a community of people who are
really passionate about beer the same
way we are since then we built a small
team and have been all over the country
meeting with backers customers and
brewers hearing directly from them about
how much and why they love physics with
our new way tap draft beer system we set
out to build a more portable and
affordable design so beer lovers and
beer novices alike can enjoy the flavor
and taste of authentic draft beer
at home or anywhere we're coming back to
the crowdfunding community with our new
product because we want to put it in the
hands of beer lovers who are the most
passionate at the end of the day where
people just like you who love beer and
the community around it well thank you
for your support
Cheers
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
