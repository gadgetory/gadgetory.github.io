introduce to you today a fabulous new
product the wine squirrel decanter the
special decanter allows you to have a
glass or two of your favorite wine and
enjoy the rest of the bottle days or
even weeks later
now some products tried to solve this
problem of wine going bad with a device
that you insert into the wine bottle
problem is that were still trapped air
inside and the seal wasn't good enough I
thought why not decant the wine bottle
into a special container that completely
avoided any contact with them we teamed
up with talented Australian designer
Clive Solari and now we're proud to
present the wine swirl decanter this
unique product can completely change the
way you drink wine I can now enjoy a
glass of wine with dinner and not worry
about the waste so how does it work well
the product consists of this beautiful
lead-free crystal glass decanter and a
seal after you pour the wine into the
decanter you simply insert the seal at
the level of the wine and turn the seal
you've just created is so effective you
can turn the decanter upside down no
wine will come in when you're ready to
drink the wine simply disengage the seal
and remove
we're here in Sonoma County California
with vineyard owner Jennifer crane who's
been using our wine squirrel I opened up
a bottle of my whoa Farms crane vineyard
designated poured it into the wine
squirrel after a week the flavor was
perfect it was like I just opened the
bottle resealed it with the wine
squirrel
two weeks later opened it again tasted
it again just as if I'd opened up the
bottle this product works
it looks fantastic you can put this
right onto the table every wine lover
needs this in their house
you
you
my name is Bradley Devine and I do
travel and lifestyle photography and
videography my name is Jessica janae and
I'm an international wedding and fashion
photographer I'm in Deer Isle and I am a
destination wedding photographer my name
is Erin Brimhall and I am an outdoor
lifestyle slash automotive photographer
well I love about the universal lens
count is I love how it grabs onto the
lens and the only way it's gonna come
off is if I pull it off and I love that
it does fully pretend to protect what's
most important about my lens and the
glass and I feel like and it's something
that should have existed a long time ago
my favorite thing about the universal
ends cap is when I have the lens cap on
I'm shooting something a wedding I bump
against something doesn't just fall off
so I like that these really grip your
lens it's super hard and so no matter
what happens it doesn't fall off which
is glorious and nothing kick it in it I
feel like even if I'm shooting in sand
and dirt and dust and nothing can get in
there into the cracks water anything
it's very protected I love that it's
Universal because I can put it on both
ends of every single one of my lenses
and it's so much nicer for travel so I
don't have to like pack every single
little type of lens cap for each
specific lens
I keep way better track of them and it
keeps my lenses protected throwing them
in and out of bags and stuff like that
well I like about this the most is you
mean you can put it in your pocket
you know whenever you need to it's not
like in there as like a big old bulge
like how its stretchy so it can fit on
any like
any type of wounds you have you know
fits on the 7250 all my wives on this
even like my Sigma's that have the
design I'm already you just stretch them
over it's nice and then if it's on the
back so you don't have a cap anymore I
feel like it's something that should
have existed a long time ago and lenses
have existed so like this is something
that's definitely going to protect
what's most important to Cameron that's
the glass and lens so I really like a
music
you

information we believe that proactive
artificial intelligence will allow us to
focusing on the things that really count

best interfaces for as little
distraction as possible in the company

Spotify top 50 Brian we need to talk

we enjoy playing popular switch games
with friends and we are accustomed to
working with our cell phones and our
computers when we are on business but
running out of battery is really painful
for us even though we may bring a
portable power pack with us it takes
several hours to charge therefore we
have to keep it in mind to charge it at
all times is there a power pack that can
be charged within a few minutes instead
of several hours now we have it Apollo
the world's first portable power pack
using graphene composite battery and USB
DCPD
technology it supports up to charge at
60 watt which means battery with
capacity of six thousand milliamp can be
fully charged in 20 minutes or so Apollo
supports the power delivery 3 protocol
you don't need to bring a separate
adapter with you because it is
compatible with USB C power adapters of
Nintendo switch Apple MacBook Lenovo
laptop Dell laptop or
