smart suitcase that follows its user
while avoiding any obstacles in its path
the code moves system is the brains of
the r1 in charge of sensing the
environment planning reasonable paths
and avoiding obstacles all while
following its user the sensing ability
of the comu system is made possible by
multi sensor fusion technology which is
mainly based on a set of sonars a depth
sensor coai and cliff detect sensors
that allow our one to avoid stairs and
other dangerous drop-offs a customized
bracelet will be provided with each r1
the como system ensures that r1 rolls
along with at an arm's length distance
to the bracelet on the user at all times
a pair of active wheel units what they
retract will design similar to aircraft
landing gears propels the suitcase
forward when both wheel units deploy the
active wheel units will retract as soon
as you touch the handle switching our
one from autonomous mode into manual
mode

four point five miles per hour
sufficient for most daily needs the
wheel units are powerful enough to
tackle any and all kinds of terrain code
smart intelligent lock will
automatically lock itself to ensure your

can I get a medium latte please
hi I'm Sarah like many others around the
world we love using styluses they're
perfect for using on those tiny iPhone
keyboards so that autocorrect doesn't
right I hate you instead of I love you
realize that though everyone loved using
a stylus no one brought one with them I
mean let's be honest pocket and first
real estate is precious no one wants to
stick something big in their pocket so
for the past year we've been solving
that problem trying to find the balance
of ergonomics and practicality being
comfortable in your hand but
unnoticeable in your pocket the stylus
flex is the first stylus ever to have
its entire body be able to be user touch
people you can use it while you're
checking out because the person in front
of you sneezed on their hands or use it
as a stand while you're sitting at the
coffee shop watching funny cat videos
with your friends
use it as a selfie stand get creative
with it not only a mobile stylist but so
much more
so now is the time we need your help to
hit the minimum order quantity and
produce the first order of stylus flex
our manufacturers and our materials are
ready to go so please help us now make
stylus Flex reality
I'm Lauren and 11 Munich in a cozy
apartment with my roommate novena hi
I'm Jana I also live in Munich I've been
Lauren's best friend since first grade
over the past three years we have been
planning testing and building a pre
prototype of an electric vehicle called
sign the cool thing about scientists
that it has solar panels on the entire
colony so the Sun recharges the battery
during the day even if it's cloudy we
use polycarbonate to protect the solar
cells polycarbonate has the advantage of
being unbreakable and scratch resistant
and it's even lighter than glass with a
total area of 7 point 5 square meters
solar cells recharged the battery up to
30 kilometers a day conditionally to the
normal range this car is perfect for
commuter who dress every single day to
his work in the evening the country or
for a camping lover because the science
supports bi-directional charging and
Sarah can plug in all your electronic
devices you have just imagine here of
electricity
wherever you are no worries about the
range no worries about the cloths or
even just for your everyday work the
sign provides you working tools at the
power output of up to 2 kilowatts
another useful feature is our system
called
reso no it guarantees cheap maintenance
car
due to very cheap spare parts online you
can get solutions download 3d data or
just order the part which needs to be
fixed and get it delivered to your home
by a partial servers finally unbox and
exchange the damaged part with an
easy-to-use instruction manual and video
tutorials however this doesn't mean you
have to repair the sign on your own
because everyone has access to this
repair manual it will guarantee you a
dependable service network from the
beginning with small business and brand
independent car repair shops all over
the world for the interior we developed
a system called pre zonal the special
thing about it we use a certain moths it
is integrated into the vents and acts as
a natural air filter using
electromagnetic charge this mas filters
out pollution light fine dust produced
by the industry and combustion engines
it really requires no care since this
plant draws its water from the air
it is also soundproofing and assigned in
the fire protection class b1 and the
best thing is we offer two different
models at a price of model extender for
sixteen thousand euro with range of 250
kilometres and model urban for twelve
thousand euro per range of hundred and
twenty kilometers we started to build
this car four years ago an orderly
garage with a lot of passion and only
one aim to save the environment it's not
just about the carbon dioxide and
nitrous oxide coming out of yur exhaust
it's about a gas flaring worldwide while
extracting oil where gas gets burned
24/7 rather than getting used every year
four hundred million tons of carbon
emissions have led into the atmosphere
accounting for roughly 1% of global
carbon emissions that's as much as all
cars in the UK France Germany Limits
together it's about the company's
polluting our earth with our significant
consequences
it's about you and me being dependent on
oil and everyday situations we want to
see some changes but you can't do it
without you you can support us with a
non-binding pre-order of the sign price
at 100 here only where the money of this
crowdfunding campaign we will produce
several production ready prototypes so
that every supporter can test on a sign
in early 2017 after the test-drive each
donor has a choice to purchase designer
this preset strategy enables us the
production of the sign and large
quantities so let's build this car for
all of us to see some changes
