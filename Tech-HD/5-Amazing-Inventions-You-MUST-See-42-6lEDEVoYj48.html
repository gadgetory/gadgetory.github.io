traveling is a blast what's not fun is
filling our bags with underwear or worst
of all running out of a fresh pair just
when you need it that's why we created
silver air a revolutionary new underwear
that doesn't smell so you can pack
lighter and stay fresh longer our secret
is pure silver the same silver that's
used in hospitals and even in spacesuits
for its antimicrobial properties it
prevents the growth of odor and keeps
your gear fresh over long periods of
time so go ahead grab two pairs put them
in your bag and you'll be set for the
week to create the most comfortable
fabric we used a 17.5 micron premium
merino wool which feels softer than your
most comfortable cotton underwear while
delivering better performance than
anything you've ever worn it even
regulates temperature so no matter where
you go your jewels will stay cool dry
and insanely comfortable best of all the
silver is permanently bonded into the
fabric and last a life of the product
finally there's this something all guys
can relate to so we created smart grid
which uses soft silicone beads to
provide just the right amount of hold so
your underwear doesn't write up and
instead of being these guys you can be
that guy
from the smart design to the beautiful
craftsmanship we've thought about every
single detail and cross us in the
process of creating the ultimate travel
underwear we just made the best damn
underwear for daily wear boom
you
we first came up with the idea of
chalice for several reasons really we'd
been looking on the market to see what
was out there and although there are
some things a little similar there isn't
anything that has all the key
requirements that the chalice has
because we invented and designed the
only true snack and drinks vessel that
can be used domestically and
commercially the chalice has a thermal
barrier so you get your chicken nuggets
in the top there and then you've got a
cold drink here by the time we get to
the bottom those chicken nuggets are
still going to be warm the bowl is
sitting on top of the cup it's for your
snacks so we've had fruit salad we've
had fish and chips we've also had self
sir we tried everything that was the fun
bit about the telus we got to experiment
I don't think anyone likes food or
crumbs in their drink and what we have
here is a water tight connection to say
for instance you're eating nachos nachos
you've got those tiny crumbs you've got
salt you definitely don't want that in
the drink with the water tight
connection it's going to prevent any of
that falling into your drink or any of
your drink coming into your nachos all
you have to do is pick it up drink your
drink eat your snack you can be walking
you can be sitting down you've been
watching your favorite sports game and
you never have to take it apart just
keeping it how you have it all set up
and good to go we've created
compartments so that you can put all
different snacks in your container at
any one time there are so many different
permutations of the chalice because in
everyday life we're always doing
different things so you're going to a
sporting event you want to load up the
large chalice with all your favorite
snacks and your favorite drink or if
you're going somewhere small you want to
take the smaller chalice because you
don't want to be carrying it around all
day you just want to have it around your
neck on the line yard you put your
snacks in there and your drink and
you're good to go
