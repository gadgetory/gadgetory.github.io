vertical space to conveniently and
efficiently store your gear you've got
gear but no space zero gravity rack save

effective it uses an air compression
mechanism to do all the heavy lifting
for you use multiple hooks for different
types of equipment our unique locking

equipment above and your valuables below
our smallest unit can lift up to 25
pounds for our largest unit and lift up
to 50 pounds installation is simple and
easy no ladders or special drill bits
needed it's time to get smart and save
space zero gravity racks take back your
space
you
you

traveling is a blast what's not fun is
filling our bags with underwear or worst
of all running out of a fresh pair just
when you need it that's why we created
silver air a revolutionary new underwear
that doesn't smell so you can pack
lighter and stay fresh longer our secret
is pure silver the same silver that's
used in hospitals and even in spacesuits
for its antimicrobial properties it
prevents the growth of odor and keeps
your gear fresh over long periods of
time so go ahead grab two pairs put them
in your bag and you'll be set for the
week to create the most comfortable
fabric we used a 17.5 micron premium
merino wool which feels softer than your
most comfortable cotton underwear while
delivering better performance than
anything you've ever worn it even
regulates temperature so no matter where
you go your jewels will stay cool dry
and insanely comfortable best of all the
silver is permanently bonded into the
fabric and last a life of the product
finally there's this something all guys
can relate to so we created smart grid
which uses soft silicone beads to
provide just the right amount of hold so
your underwear doesn't write up and
instead of being these guys you can be
that guy
from the smart design to the beautiful
craftsmanship we've thought about every
single detail and cross us in the
process of creating the ultimate travel
underwear we just made the best damn
underwear for daily wear boom
you
we first came up with the idea of
chalice for several reasons really we'd
been looking on the market to see what
was out there and although there are
some things a little similar there isn't
anything that has all the key
requirements that the chalice has
because we invented and designed the
only true snack and drinks vessel that
can be used domestically and
commercially the chalice has a thermal
barrier so you get your chicken nuggets
in the top there and then you've got a
cold drink here by the time we get to
the bottom those chicken nuggets are
still going to be warm the bowl is
sitting on top of the cup it's for your
snacks so we've had fruit salad we've
had fish and chips we've also had self
sir we tried everything that was the fun
bit about the telus we got to experiment
I don't think anyone likes food or
crumbs in their drink and what we have
here is a water tight connection to say
for instance you're eating nachos nachos
you've got those tiny crumbs you've got
salt you definitely don't want that in
the drink with the water tight
connection it's going to prevent any of
that falling into your drink or any of
your drink coming into your nachos all
you have to do is pick it up drink your
drink eat your snack you can be walking
you can be sitting down you've been
watching your favorite sports game and
you never have to take it apart just
keeping it how you have it all set up
and good to go we've created
compartments so that you can put all
different snacks in your container at
any one time there are so many different
permutations of the chalice because in
everyday life we're always doing
different things so you're going to a
sporting event you want to load up the
large chalice with all your favorite
snacks and your favorite drink or if
you're going somewhere small you want to
take the smaller chalice because you
don't want to be carrying it around all
day you just want to have it around your
neck on the line yard you put your
snacks in there and your drink and
you're good to go
you
some people are natural sleepers others
not so much a great day starts with a
good night so why don't we pay more
attention to sleep meet kill Oh more
than an alarm clock it's an advanced
sleep trainer that helps you fall asleep
faster snooze less wake up earlier tune
your body clock and much more Kelo is
leading the sleep revolution it starts
with looking forward to waking up with
the sounds you love and without your
phone with smart home integration you
won't even have to get up to turn off
the lights chalo gets you to sleep in no
time just follow kilo's lights with your
breath and you'll slow down to your
natural rhythm for sleep ditching the
snooze button is tricky because it's so
tempting to squeeze in those extra
minutes lucky for you kalos got you
covered it only allows you to press news
say three times a week kella can also
help you wake up earlier so you can get
more time for yourself in the morning it
trims a few minutes from your wake-up
time every day and within a few weeks
you'll really wake up earlier without
even realizing kelo makes tuning your
body clock simple so as you start the
morning after a great night's sleep
kello helps unlock the potential of your
day wake up to a better sleep and back
kelo now full sleep makes us do the word
out and unproductive that's why we
jumped on a mission to fix this we did
research on the body clock on sleep I'm
waking up and we ask you how you
pictured your perfect body Keller will
be by your side every night and every
morning that's why we had to make it
personal and beautiful we relocated to
Asia to be closer to our factories we
are with the best experts in hardware
design and manufacturing we've been
working with the callow team for more
than a year I wake up to kelo every day
