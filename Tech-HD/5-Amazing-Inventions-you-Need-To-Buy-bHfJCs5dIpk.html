most consumed alcoholic beverages in the
world beer is a part of our everyday
lives you can find beer at bars little
breweries or shops but did you ever
think that you can make your own beer
right in your own home brewing beer is a
beautiful but complicated art using the
traditional methods it has been a long
and complex process that requires exact
timing knowledge of ingredients space
and some level of expertise these
complications have stopped many of us
from becoming home brewers until now
brewing the world's first fully
automated home brewery if you're new to
brewing the only thing you have to do is
choose your preferred recipe and you'll
get all the ingredients you need for
your brew place the hops and malt into
the machine add water manually or let
bruit do it automatically scan the RFID
card containing the recipe and that's it
push brew and let brewery do the rest
step like mashing sparging boiling hop
addition up to for cooling and cleaning
brewery is perfect for beginners and
experts alike experiment modify recipes
or create new ones set the temperature
for mashing and loitering choose your
own ingredients set different times for
adding hops or choose one of the 23
other parameters for your brew with
bruit you can literally brew any kind of
beer it's hard to connect with other
Brewers that's why we've created a
platform where you can share your
experiences exchange recipes or even
organize local events after all beer
tastes the best among friends
brewing beer based on your taste
you
hi there I'm dr. diva to me and as many
of you know I'm the CEO of Salonika and
inventor of kaya the natural lighting
robot kaya first premiered on IndieGoGo
this past September and ever since we've
been offering her on IndieGoGo in demand
as a pre-order over the past several
months kaya has evolved past even what I
could have dreamed we have changed her
name for those of you who remember Lucy
and have significantly improved her
design to the point that today we call
the final version kaya 2.0 we are now in
the process of getting kaya manufactured
and the entire Salonika team is
absolutely thrilled that we'll be able
to start shipping soon to our backers in
just a few short months but now let me
tell you a little bit more about what
she does
using kaya couldn't be easier just place
in a sunny spot point her towards the
room you want to illuminate and turn her
on she'll find the Sun all in her own
and redirected slide into your home or
office
kaya solar-powered so you never have to
worry if she's charged and she
continuously monitors the movement of
the Sun throughout the day and remembers
where you want to send the sunlight so
you have natural light indoors all day
long if you have a dark or gloomy room
in your home or office
then kaya is for you with more than half
a million dollars raised to date on
IndieGoGo it's been a truly
life-changing experience to see the
amount of support for kaya around the
world as an organization we here at
Salonika believe in the importance of
upgrading our indoor spaces into places
in which we don't only live but we
thrive we won't be on IndieGoGo forever
so I strongly encourage you to take
advantage of our limited pre-order
offers on IndieGoGo and as always have a
bright day
my name is Benny me product developer
and founder of the EB Tool Company we
use tools to make tools me and my father
spent seven years developing the quick
gripper uses patented technology to
convert pulling force into gripping
force anytime you get a nail or a staple
that needs to come out it's always a
paint hammer uses a conventional cloth a
lot of nail much like the cat's paw it's
on the back of the foot the quick
gripper basically coming around the head
and then pulling the nail out that way
the quick Ripper it's got that cat's paw
but it's also got these jaws it'll pull
just about anything you can get in those
be it screws staples nails whatever you
actually get a lot more leverage with a
quick Ripper more force up top more of
it is translated into pulling force
because of the way it's designed so as
you're pulling it out it's gripping
harder and harder and harder the harder
you pull the harder it grips and it
makes just about anything come out
staples are a pain to get out with a
conventional hammer because it can only
grab one side at a time the quick
grippers wide jaws can grab both sides
of the staple at once pulling the whole
thing out in one fluid motion no matter
where it's at
nothing else pulls a nail in the corner
out but the quick Ripper does the jaws
will pull out what conventional forks
won't ever come close to because it can
actually get right into a corner and
hold those nail screws and staples out
things like long nails right now
conventional hammer can't get a nail
past a certain point the quick Ripper
allows you to take a second bite at that
nail and pull it all the way through
pretty much no matter how long the nail
is you can get it out with the quick
grip it doesn't matter if the nail is
mangled if it's headless in fact it's
got enough gripping force that it can
actually grab the pointed end of the
nail pull it right through a board
doesn't matter if the head is there or
not the quick rubber helps save you
money in several different ways it
replaces a lot of tools that you
wouldn't normally have to carry around
things like locking pliers a large
crowbar a hammer it replaces several
tools at once so you don't have to hunt
for another tool when the one you have
won't do the job does a quick River does
them all it can actually help you
repurpose wood you can take old boards
off of a deck pull all the nails out no
matter how embedded that head is you
just grab the whole thing pull it
through in one fluid motion reuse all
those boards it works great for trim
because trim always uses those little
tiny Brad's that are pain to get out
because you can't pound them through
where they Bend
but we could just grab them from the
back side pull them right through and
you can reuse that trim it saves
everybody time and money
no matter what their project the quick
Ripper was designed to be used by
everybody from professionals down to
your home hobbyist who's just got a
small project that they need to do the
quick Ripper is great for everyone from
the professional construction worker
down to your home hobbyist who just has
a project here and there makes a great
gift and it'll make every job that much
easier

the Yeti touch defrosting Ward will
defrost hard rock meets poultry and fish
in as little as 20 minutes
this amazing design literally pulls the
chair away from the meat and into the
tray
once thawed you can even use the board
as a cutting board for dicing and
slicing if you want to thaw out beef and
then slice it for fajitas you can easily
with the board thawing your meat on this
board reduces the spread of contaminants
microwave defrosting poses because there
is no heat source there's no chance of
spreading salmonella staph or any
contagious disease you could attempt to
run water over it and defrost it faster
but then you're washing away vital
nutrients minerals and it's most potent
flavors the design of the cast molded
aluminum literally pulls the cold and
frost out of your food reducing your
thawing time from several hours to
sometimes minutes best of all there's no
messy overflow to clean up after defrost
all the water carefully runs off and is
trapped in a safe water secure tray
underneath the tray
no batteries or electricity needed makes
food preparation or breeze
