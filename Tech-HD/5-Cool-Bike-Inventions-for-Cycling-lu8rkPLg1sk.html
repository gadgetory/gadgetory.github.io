from rockets that can explore the depths
of space to driverless smart cars while
some forms of transport have evolved
entirely innovation has neglected the
humble bicycle we've seen modern-day
bikes get sleeker and lighter but
commuting to work on a bike can often be
physically exhausting and embarrassing
while most have ignored this modest form
of transportation the evil wheel comes
in five sizes and fits over 95% of all
bikes in the market and allows you to
transform your bike into a pedal assist
by in a mere 30 seconds attaching the
wheel is simple and hassle-free by
simply replacing the front wheel of your
bike the first of our fully wirelessly
control options is our Bluetooth enabled
control unit you can decide how much you
want the innovative power assist system
to help you pedal accurately from zero
to a hundred percent you can monitor
your speed travel distance and battery
power in real time alternatively you may
use the dedicated app to control the
assist level that you want the app
displays five different mode settings
giving you more authority over your
cycling experience even wheels
incredible pedal assist systems make
cycling uphill a walk in the park
charging the wheel is as simple as
plugging it into any socket a single
charge can allow you to travel up to 54
miles meaning your commute to work the
next day will be easy and hassle-free
make your commute to work enjoyable with
the state-of-the-art Evo will support us
now hi this is Harry my name is Paul we
are the founders of Macbeth and we would
like to introduce you today our magnetic
pedal innovation
well it's a real new innovative panel
which was designed to give you solid
performance a Suicide Club with
supporting force without fear
hassle-free pikey this is one of our
first prototypes we have to do a lot of
innovations to come to this product
exactly and what's really good on this
panel we can equip with different magnet
sizes so what you see here is our
standard panel
this gives you a pulling force of about
15 kilograms
click on solidly and you pull up
straight but as soon as you start to
shift your foot a little bit even in
case of critical situation you will get
up very easily in fact you will almost
not feel the magnet on the shoe
we have metallic plate it fits on every
SPD compatible shoe one of the big
advantages of this setup is that it is
totally insensitive to dirt
you will not stretch any floors because
this is all inside the sole without any
elevations it's a much lighter pedal and
we have a stronger neodymium magnet
which is the strongest magnet that is
available in the market we have a
similar damper unit on it which gives us
the ability to adjust the magnet height
to fit the shoe and also to give you
that solid feel when you connect onto
your shoe and when you write
all the best for a safe ride really hope
to see you out there
hopefully view from Macbeth on your bike
technology in cycling that has come a
long way but with all the advancements
were seen one thing remains the same
we'd like to introduce to you a new way
to carry your water bottle in fact any
accessory so let us present the freedom
cycle system it all starts with our pin
this pin allows us to think differently
our bottle or accessory sits on not in
eliminating the cage
we can map anything on our pin the
freedom ease is our traditional round
bottle the freedom fast is our standard
the art aerodynamic bottle wind tunnel
design this arrow bottle matches modern
frame geometry and it's fast the freedom
fix is a revolutionary toolbox simple to
use yet aerodynamic and versatile the
freedom system is simple one pin that
secures many applications the freedom
cycling system as flexible as your rides
this is max max bought himself a new
road bike because he likes to go road
cycling with his friends his friends
also like to do cyclocross rides
unfortunately Max's bike with its slim
tires isn't made for off-road cycling it
is also impossible to add a bike rack to
his road bike so when he does a bike
trip with his friends he's having a hard
time
that's why max went back to the bike
shop and asked for advice hi I'm Stefan
the founder of a Popeye's eight-bar is a
small bicycle brand from Berlin Germany
we are doing customised bicycles since
2011 when Max came back to the shop and
told me his issues
I explained him the differences between
a road and a cyclocross bike first they
have a different tire clearance for the
front and for the rear wheel and second
different heads and see tube angles so
the question was how can we develop a
frame set that can be used for a road
and the cycle first bike that's why we
developed the a parameter a bike that
can easily change its attributes from a
road to a cycle first bike max want to
give it a try
you can use it as a road bike and change
it to a cyclocross bike within 15
minutes change the fort by changing the
foot the front of the bike is also
rising up which gives the rider a more
upright position and shadow ahead and
seat tube angles
swap the tires move the slider drop out
to the rear end which gives you more
tire clearance and changes the wheelbase
at the same time that's it now max is
ready for having fun with his friends
off the road
last but not least the eight bar meter
can be your perfect adventure bike
because it's got rack and fender mount
now max can enjoy the ride and doesn't
need to carry a heavy bag anymore
the eight per meter needs some special
tooling because of its unique
construction that's why the production
costs are higher compared to our usual
bikes beside that we would like you to
be involved in our decisions because at
the end you should love the product now
it's your turn back our project today
