inside a tennis bat and it was created
with one sole idea in our minds everyone
should own a tennis ball launcher just
like water or air or earplugs if you
live under a beginner cellist if you
play tennis you definitely want a tennis
ball launcher to make a tennis ball on
sure as a common commodity it needs to
be three things
portable useful and incredible so that's
what we did
slingers designed as a tennis bag and it
can carry things like a tennis bag can
that's real nice but it's not the cool
part the launcher is the cool part
slinger holds 36 balls when closed and
72 when open and hits them all across
the court at speeds ranging from 10 to
80 miles per hour
that's faster than a cheetah haha lazy
cheetah slinger can be set to launch
different shots the shots vary not only
in speed but also in feed and angle was
that good practice nice it can also be
set to low speeds and low feet attacked
as a ball boy so no more of this slinger
is light enough to carry but also comes
with wheels so you can carry it on your
back like him or as a trolli
like her because everyone should be
comfortable carrying their tennis ball
launch we also believe everyone should
have a USB port to charge their phone
while they play so slinger has one and
if you want to use slinger just as a bag
you can take the bag out now it's just
the back magnificent so they're portable
useful and credible oh and we forgot
affordable slinger is affordable because
as we said everyone should own a tennis
ball launcher slinger is made by joe an
avid tennis player that realized the
massive necessity for a great tennis
launcher everyone can
after two years of research and
development with a highly experienced
team of industrial designers and
mechanical engineers he created Slater
now slinger is ready for mass production
we just need your support so if you also
believe that everyone should own a
tennis ball launcher get one you can
also get one just because you want one
that's totally fine slinger
meet ferry a small yet powerful

a tree struck making is what we do we
pride ourselves on creating innovative
handcrafted products here in the UK we
would like to introduce link the new
magnetic belt system from Rhys trap
unlike its standard bow link is made
from specially manufactured elastic
webbing that moves with you with the
patented magnetic bubble link is the
easiest ball system you'll ever use with
itself locating system on 100 release
will guarantee muscle each buckle is
rated to 50 kilograms and we guarantee
you into any breakages that's how
confident we are all this finished in a
classic grease trap label putting a
choice of two cos
please help us bring link to the market
and support a small independent
family-run business the quad fusion
printhead gives you a lot more freedom
of choice and flexibility than any other
3d printer before to be able to take
cyan yellow and magenta and then key it
with something like a black or a white
or a clear gives us more than 50
thousand colors you can use any filament
that's a standard 1.75 of millimeter in
the quad fusion printhead and what that
allows you to do is take stock and mix
colors or create your own custom color
palette and create materials of new
properties that never existed before so
if you look at a real world object
you're not going to see usually just a
single material or single color and a
single property in the earlier days when
3d printing was hyped around 2013/14 a
lot of people thought that 3d printers
would be in everyone's homes because
they replace your need to buy things
from Amazon and I think the idea of a 3d
printer making a finished complete end
product is a great one day something
that were
eventually achieved and so for 3d
printers to realize the potential that
they're going to essentially take over
manufacturing and make it be spoken
locally in the next few decades
you're going to need multiple materials
to be able to achieve some of those
types of prints Takagi
what we did that's special is we use our
material expertise to create a color
calibrated line of filaments calibrating
the pigments their size their molecular
distribution all of that stuff so that
it really falls within a NOAA range and
what that gives you is critical it gives
you a wider color palette it gives you
the ability to put in one material
encourage out and another one faster and
it allows you to get controlled
calibrated mixing ratios we decided to
take our core competency the places
where we add value our materials
expertise and our ability to make lots
of machine parts very affordably even
worked well and to get those products
helps to backers and consumers and
enthusiasts as well as businesses who
know that this is the future
so the Kickstarter community is a very
unique one that appreciates innovation
and especially innovation in 3d printers
they've been supporting the development
of numerous dozens of 3d printers over
the years and now that many of them own
3d printers they want to take the next
natural step to enhance their experience
and make more
located products but we also want to
nurture the ecosystem for those people
that already have spent money on a
high-end 3d printer so we're going to be
making a few mountain plates that allow
people to adapt a quad fusion printhead
to a typical printer so we're already
building mounts for the MakerBot
replicator 2 series we've made one
chemical mega and horsemen for the crane
in the past if you wanted to print a lot
of different colors you would have to
stock all of those colors by a huge
quantity of filament and now with just
four or five maybe six major colors and
keys you'd be produce any color on the
fly whether you just want one new color
or if you want multiple colors within
the same print and the same applies to
multiple materials so the ability to
take for example a flexible and a hard
material and merge the properties and
have a print with mix properties
throughout it is definitely going to
advance the field and help us realize
the potential of 3d printers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
