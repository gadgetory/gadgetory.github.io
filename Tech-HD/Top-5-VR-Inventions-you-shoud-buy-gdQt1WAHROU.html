essence of reality in virtual worlds to
enable human integration with technology
that is so seamless all it takes is a
glance for your digital environment to
react at the speed of thought
we are fove the world's first eye
tracking virtual reality headset folks
infrared cameras track their pupils and
register the slightest movements because
fove knows exactly where the user is
looking with imperceptible delay we can
enable a technique called fovea -
rendering this allows us to focus the
fidelity in the part of the vision that
matters most leading to better
performance on lower end hardware than
is currently possible further nabel's
software to present virtual environments
with realistic depth of field improving
immersion and allowing the eyes to relax
when viewing objects of varying depths
with eye tracking we can create a truly
natural user interface that is nearly
subconscious in action with fove
artificial intelligence becomes more
responsive and nuanced reacting to the
player's most subtle intentions and
providing a more realistic interaction
it enables users to deeply interact with
the virtual reality world by translating
subtle I movements into emotional
expressions which can be read and
reacted to just like in real life but
that's just the beginning both
technology enables entirely new forms of
expression communication and movement
those with restricted use of their hands
can simulate a mouse and keyboard using
only their eyes users can even control a
robot to look around the room and give
others instructions in the I play the
piano project photic nology enabled a
student with muscular dystrophy to lead
his school choir in song while playing
the piano with just his eyes
both has a profound future

spaces like museums or social events are
just a few examples of what the wireless

outside the games industry but the alter
gaze is more than just another VR
headset because the entire body is 3d
printed it means that pretty much any 3d
printing facility or even 3d printer
owners can become an alter guest partner
we will supply them with a language and
allow them to embed our online
customization tool on their website we
will also give the Magnum control over
it so they can personalize the interface
pick what options they want to offer for
their clients and for what price for
non-commercial use all the paths for
free printing the alter gauge will be
free to download and completely open
source
we've been looking at different products
on the markets on the heart on the
market yet they're coming that we could
utilize in some sort of way they've been
multiple problems with those and every
single situation either way to expenses
to be able to do it on a mass experience
or sort of your hundred or two other
people they were very connecting with
lots of different wires popping out
places we're really really impressed
with what's been put together here it's
nothing compared to what we've seen
before for kind of mobile Springs and
virtual reality using an iPhone five the
density of the pixels on the phone is
actually better than any other vr device
we've seen because the screens are so
goddamn good on these devices harnessed
with the optics and a way to put
together just means it really works
after six months of intensive work the
Alta Gates project is almost complete
but I need your help to raise twenty
five thousand pounds in order to finish
the development of a few free to
download via experiences and to sort the
manufacturing process these funds will
also be used to develop your online
customization tool right the SDK for
developers and contact 3d printer owners
and facilities to make the ultra gates
available all over the world so please
share this with your friends and help me
get the outer gates project off the
ground
