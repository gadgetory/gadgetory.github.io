dinner cooked in your own kitchen from
scratch all with just the simple tap of
your finger some might describe it as
the future others a lifesaver
we call it Suvi the refrigerated
multi-zone kitchen robot cooker plus
smart meal kit delivery service life is
busier than ever
providing nutritious fresh flavorful
meals for our families has become such a
challenge the time and energy it takes
to shop prep cook and clean we just
don't have it our fresh chef inspired
dinners are all created with natural and
raw ingredients that can be customized
to your tastes and delivered straight to
your door in refrigerated packaging
weekly zoovie automatically detects your
food and keeps it refrigerated until its
algorithms tell the appliance exactly
when to start cooking
so everything is ready for you at the
same time all you have to do is load
your soup in the morning go about your
business and come home to enjoy a fully
cooked dinner no prep no stress just a
perfectly prepared dinner that's ready
when you are
imagine the freedom and time you'll save
hi I'm Kevin a former Apple engineer and
I'm Robin founder of review.com
two years ago we set out to design a
revolutionary cooking appliance that was
beyond anything on the market we were
tired of takeout and delivery and we
found that traditional meal kits took
too long to prep and cleanup we knew
there was a better way and that's when
we invented Suvi the smart refrigerated
multi-zone cooker that works with meals
of fresh raw ready to cook ingredients
we estimate that was Suvi you can save
an average of 6 hours per week that's 6
hours you could be spending with your
friends or family or just be more
productive and getting more things done
you can always put your own food in Suvi
but if you order Suvi meals
there's no prep required you can pick
one of our chef's design meals that
serve two to four people
or customize your own from over 10,000
combinations mules are made up of raw
proteins fresh vegetables raw starches
and delicious sauces created by our
gourmet chefs to cook your fish chicken
and meat Suvi uses the French MasterChef
technique of sous-vide heating them
vacuum sealed in a water bath to the
perfect serving temperature pastas and
grains are boiled and steamed vegetables
are cooked flawlessly using steam and
then roasting and soomi even
automatically drains pasta for al dente
perfection unlike traditional sous-vide
systems su V has a broiler that roasts
your vegetables and proteins right
before it's time to serve your meal and
our award-winning chefs have created
sauces and garnishes to give your meals
a five-star finish over the past two
years we've tested and iterated on
dozens of prototypes now we're ready to
bring Suvi to you and we're looking for
your support to help us revolutionize
dinner together
let the sous-vide kitchen robot give you
the time and gourmet healthy meals you
deserve the future is here join the sous
vide dinner revolution today introducing
the skull and cold case so I bought the
new Nintendo switch just like you did I
love my Nintendo switch I take it
everywhere with me providing me with
hours of entertainment but I always find
my hands getting tired from playing for
a long period of time so I thought to
myself why isn't there a case with
comfortable gripping for the switch just
like the other joy cons then I started
designing by gathering simple data
within the market for instance kids and
adults hand shape and sizes we've built
various prototypes in order to fulfill
our vision
firstly we wanted the case to have a
cool and slick look we designed two sets
of grips in grey or neon red and blue to
match your Nintendo switch they can be
easily switched to fit comfortably
within the gamers hole the case will
provide a stronger grip and more
comfortable experience no matter
children or adults casual or hardcore
gamers
this is made of soft TPU material which
makes it easy to put on and remove
we made the back of this case extremely
thin so there is no need to remove the
case to charger a Nintendo switch in the
dog plus we have also designed a
hardshell case to store the Nintendo
switch when the case is on the hardshell
case provides extra storage spaces put
power bank adapter USB cable handset and
almost everything you think is necessary
just pack and go you'll love it
we are an experienced team and our
manufacturer partners are ready to go
with your support we can take this grip
case into mass production
the keyboard layout that we use everyday
was designed over 100 years ago without
comfort in mind but now people type far
more than ever before coders riders
everyone we all deserve a keyboard
designed for the demands of today meet
expose the mechanical air dynamic
keyboard for more comfortable typing
experience expose cross linear design
angles the key columns inward allowing
for your wrists to sit at their natural
angle this allows you to type for longer
without feeling discomfort by moving the
modifier keys into the middle of the
keyboard we reduce the workload on the
pinkie now a weakest finger and transfer
it to our underutilised thumb mechanical
keyboard switches add to the experience
by providing a more satisfying typing
experience at last a keyboard that
combines comfort and productivity all
yes sleek package</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
