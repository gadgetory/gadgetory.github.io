hi my name is Heather and I'm a
professional slackliner from the US when
I'm on the High Line I tried to be fully
in each moment in each step and nowhere
else so when I'm using my slack landing
gear I don't have to constantly be
thinking about if I'm safe because I
know that I trust the gear I trust it's
rating it's the same thing with other
products in life you know you don't want
to have to a pack that's digging into
your shoulders or hurting your back the
way that it's sitting and position it's
distracting you from what your purpose
is so finding a backpack that is
comfortable looks nice and can be in
pretty much any situation it was really
amazing we get it you carry around a lot
from laptops to water bottles but the
conventional backpack just doesn't cut
it
we've noticed most everyday backpacks
are made to save money at our backs
expense they may look great
or seem smart but they do little to
protect and sometimes even harm our
backs that is why we spared no expense
creating a beautiful backpack that's
well balanced and perfectly tailored to
your body a backpack that gives your
body a break meet Joey whether you take
your bike for a ride
a rushing to work or on your way to the
gym
Joey's got your back every day
everywhere in fact we listen not only to
Heather but to you the travelers who
love exploring foreign cultures to
thrill-seekers looking for that next
adventure
and those who just want to enjoy a
stunning sunrise Joey is different from
the conventional everyday backpack
we took high-end technology from travel
gear and brought it to your everyday
life Joey is on point well balanced and
perfectly tailored to your body need a
more space
Joey expands in a very unique way
retaining balance even when doubled in
size looking for accessibility Joey has
a pair of easily accessible pockets you
can take out your cell phone wallet or
keys on the go and store them safely so
you can have your hands-free again and
we don't even mentioned the countless
ways to stow things like your laptop
charger power bank umbrella or passport
koala stands for uncompromising quality
and visionary design Joey is our
masterpiece we only use waterproof
fabrics and zippers and place great
importance on durability
Joey is comfortable versatile
sleeeeep
organized
sophisticated
and yet simple we're a group of people
who try to see the world from a slightly
different angle together we founded
koala to challenge the way backpacks are
used the best thing about our campaign
is that we are ready for production but
we need your support to make it happen
on behalf of koala thank you for
bringing Joey to life
you
meet Gary we got really tired of things
of the air phones in our pockets so we
search for a way to keep them organized
and we realized there is nothing on the
market that can actually fulfill our
needs we decided to make a winder that
is sleek compact and easy to use so up
there are several prototypes we came up
with a perfect solution we may carry for
active people just like us but don't
have a spare minute to fight through
these annoying wires and one easy access
on the go now that we've got moldings
finished we need your support to produce
first batch please help us bring Gary on
the market and into buckets say yes to
Earp on freedom and no to tangled wires
Gary your wait is over
