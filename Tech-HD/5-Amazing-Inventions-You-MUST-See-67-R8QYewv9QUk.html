every fingerprint every set of eyes
every set of ears is completely
exquisitely different this belief is
what drove us to create arc
the custom-made earphone using the
world's first standardized ear sizing
chart they come with an innovative
rubberized shape and tail design for
superior comfort and more secure wearing
experience
there is no such thing as one size fits
all when it comes to our ears
conventional earphones while supposedly
made for comfort can either be too big
or too small and do not adapt to
critical differences for our ears they
fall out and often cause pain after
wearing them for extended periods of
time so we change the game disrupted the
industry a project for years in the
making with hundreds of thousands of
ears being studied researched and
modeled enabling us to develop the
world's first groundbreaking
comprehensive ear database and sizing
charts in a similar way to clothes and
shoe sizing we find the right gear phone
for you it's as simple as taking a
picture of each year with a quarter and
submitting them through a website or
mobile device your ear data will be
analyzed and within a week you'll
receive arc earphones designed for your
own unique type of ear arcs patented
design ensures maximum comfort and
incredible HiFi sound quality it will
change your experience of listening to
music podcasts or simply making a phone
call switch from wire to bluetooth in
seconds to be ready for whatever life
throws at you leave them in four hours
you'll forget they're even there take
them anywhere
do anything we're so excited away start
an account with to share it with you
thank you for backing us we have big
goals for the future
arc custom-made for you
you
you
if you want your children to be
intelligent read them fairy tales if you
want them to be more intelligent read
the more fairy tales Albert Einstein
said this and it is deeply impacted the
way I parent it has also inspired me to
nurture the imagination of my own child
through reading ready for a bedtime
story that's me Natalie founder of
moonlight and mom to a fun sweet
imaginative little four-year-old girl
Chloe my inspiration behind moonlight
okay as you can see bedtime stories have
become a lot more exciting in our house
something we both really look forward to
because of moonlight a children's
projection story reader that easily
attaches to your mobile phone and
instantly adds magic to story time
stories have always been a staple in our
bedtime routine as I'm sure they are for
many of you they give us a chance to
bond unwind and snuggle with our kids
after a long day
it was sometimes difficult to keep chloe
engaged in reading books so one night I
decided to shake things up a bit and use
the flashlight from my phone to create
our own story at a shadow puppets Chloe
loved this she was so engaged and I
loved seeing her use her imagination to
create stories with me eventually she
started to prefer the shadow puppets
over her actual books and that's when it
dawned on me what if I could turn her
bedtime stories into images that could
be projected onto the ceiling just like
the shadow puppets and that's when
moonlight was born it uses the flash
from your mobile phone to project images
from a small real on to your ceiling or
wall all the words to the story appear
on your phone screen making it easy to
read while projecting the images I also
added in some neat sound effects to make
it a full audio visual experience
and the coolest thing is that I was able
to incorporate page detection software
so as you turn the real the story turns
the page on the screen for a completely
seamless reading experience moonlight
has made our bedtime routine simply
magical it has revived the love and
excitement of reading and most
importantly has helped nurture and fuel
Chloe's imagination while creating an
incredible bonding experience that we
both look forward to every single night
my ultimate dream is to make moonlight
available to every parent who treasures
reading to their children as much as I
do and who knows maybe we'll create the
next little Einstein
you
with go touch you can turn the TV or
projector you already have into an
interactive whiteboard so you can share
your brilliant ideas learn a new
language and use your computer like
never before work more quickly as a
group whether you're all in the same
room or thousands of miles away
connected by the internet and of course
you can keep and share what you create
setup is easy download the app in pair
go touch with your smartphone or Windows
PC connected to your TV or projector and
start creating our team has been working
on goat house for more than a year it's
already working properly and office and
goes across Korea but we want to bring
go toss to the rest of the world to do
that we need your help to scale of our
production the antibody can make in our
small office please support us on
Kickstarter and you can make any TV or
projector interactive
I've been bragging about these here in
the Portland market yeah you guys got to
check out these new lights like oh yeah
and then they finally seen them right
and like oh my gosh you're right these
are amazing and then I've got clients
out there like repeat clients we do the
same show basically for them every year
and they go what what why does it look
so much brighter and better this year
what's what's going on so they notice it
without me telling them what we're
actually doing differently they see the
changes so what we have is a really
unique lighting product that's got the
performance of a professional-grade
theater lighting product but has the
simplicity of a consumer product the
typical party light that mate with LEDs
that can get for you know ten dollars at
the hardware store really is just a
blast of one color and it doesn't do
very much when it reflects off of
something it it doesn't really show you
a good representation of the thing is
reflecting from our light is meant for
lighting something up and people look
great because the skin tone renderings
good it's a whole different animal you
don't have to worry about it any kind of
gels or any additional hardware it's all
built in to the light and into the app
we're a production company third-party
production companies so we provide audio
visual services for anything from
weddings to corporate meetings I've
never seen something to amber so well
cobalt so well the color blending
technology is hands down the best I've
seen the big theater professional
lighting systems require a special
network a special control console here
and somebody up in a control booth
running the show we know that people
can't do that in their home so we
created a Bluetooth app that you can run
on your phone and basically get the same
experience you're running the show just
by touching your finger on a screen and
sliding it around and getting all the
colors you want just when you want them
if you don't want to control those show
and you want it to run by itself there's
automatic capabilities so the lights can
do a sequence all by themselves they can
listen to what's going on
respond so they're interactive with your
music you put three or four of these in
the ceiling and anytime you want to
change the lighting you just pick up
your phone or your tablet and adjust it
and so I think we've taken something
that's kind of high high performance and
made it really accessible this actually
has the same brightness as
thousand-dollar lighting it's amazing
when you go to a theater you watch a
show where everything looks just really
spectacular and you get this really
great experience emotional we're trying
to take that experience you would get
bring it into a consumer environment
usually have to get like some kind of
special tea light or I have to do the
pre-production work of talking with the
client to get the right color
temperature of light these ones do
Kelvin degrees anywhere from twenty
seven hundred Kelvin to all the way up
to your fluorescent light just dial it
in with a fader on a board to the
customers liking right there on site
