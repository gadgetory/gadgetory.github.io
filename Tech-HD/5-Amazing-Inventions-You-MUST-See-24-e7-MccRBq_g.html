Mike Wazowski and Nam markers Laos key
and we're super excited to finally share
this campaign with you guys
skateboards haven't changed for decades
with the amount of abuse a typical
router puts the board through they're
simply not strong enough for its chip
lose their pop change fuel over time
this can throw off the consistency of a
skater and affect their riding more than
they might know some professional
skateboarders need to change their decks
daily to keep the board feeling
consistent with live slate construction
we've created a lighter stronger more
durable skateboard deck our boards use
for plies a maple surrounded by carbon
fiber carbon fiber is a lot stronger of
material than maple we use two layers
inside the board this prevents pressure
cracks and helps maintain a consistent
responsive feel while maintaining the
same flex of a standard deck the nose
and tail of our boards use a
high-strength polymer this material is
extremely resistant to razortail
is virtually impossible to chip and has
much more pop than a fresh maple deck
this combination of materials makes a
board that lasts an average of six times
longer than an industry standard
skateboard because our decks feels so
consistent through their life you can
spend more time progressing your skills
rather than relearning we've been
testing these boards for over five years
getting feedback from multiple Pro
skaters and now we believe we created
the perfect skateboard
look
but good looks really good
all we need is your help to get the
funds to start manufacturing we can't
wait to get these skateboards under your
feed thank you so much for backing our
campaign</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
