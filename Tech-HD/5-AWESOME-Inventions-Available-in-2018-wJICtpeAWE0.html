what comes to mind the peephole the
chain lock may be the classic stark
warning but you are probably thinking a
bit more high-tech introducing yuffie
ever cam the first of its kind home
security system that gives you
everything you want with none of the
hassles no need for wires and no need to
deal with frequent battery changes 365
days of battery life we partnered with
anchor to put their most advanced
battery technology inside the ever camp
and by using a low frequency
transmission signal to stay connected on
standby mode saving energy by up to 70%
ever cam will keep on working for up to
a year without needing to be recharged
with the adjustable ball shaped mount
ever cam can be positioned and
repositioned use either the single screw
mounting base or skip the mounting
hardware the magnetic 1080p HD camera
will just stick to all kinds of metal
surfaces BAM
ever cam with stands temperature changes
and moisture so you really can put it
just about anywhere motion triggered and
Wi-Fi connected ever cam sends you a
notification when someone's at the door
or someone's on the sofa even when
someone is raiding the fridge the
artificial intelligence uses a
three-phase system to ensure you see
what you want to see and ignore what you
don't step one it's able to screen out
movement that doesn't have a heat
signature using an infrared sensor step
two it detects human body shapes in
various positions and step three facial
recognition technology allows ever cam
to recognize faces of people you want to
give clearance to or keep a closer eye
on so just set your preferences to send
an alert when it matters and ignore it
when it doesn't oh yeah and it has
two-way audio Brian step away from the
we are the first to put an SD card into
a Homebase securely storing 60 days of
footage locally no need to go to the
cloud no up charges or monthly contracts
we have a great team of top engineers
software developers AI experts and we
are working with industry leading
manufacturers to make all this happen
we've built an amazing system that's
ready to go right out-of-the-box easy to
set up yourself without compromising
security but we need your help to take
what we have and get it to market no one
else is offering a wireless camera with
a year of battery life and ever cam just
keeps getting better by the day there
are a ton of other great features so
make sure you check out all the stuff on
our campaign page we have suppliers in
place the prototype is done all we need
is your support
I've learned in life that things may not
always be as they seem or go according
to plan and I have to say the past
several years of my life have been the
perfect example while new doors had
opened many were slam shut no matter how
chaotic and unorganized my life had
become I kept my problems hidden from
the outside world muscle and joint pain
full-body fatigue
memory loss body tremors and migraines
are all things I still deal with today
but they're nothing in comparison to my
initial symptoms from a small mosquito
bite the transferred West Nile virus
into my system I want to expand flat
lacing system two and a half years ago
for runners hikers bikers walkers kids
elderly and individuals with
disabilities but what most don't realize
is I was actually utilizing my own
product out of necessity in order to get
my shoes on easier and it was definitely
better sleep while it would be so easy
to look at West Nile virus as a negative
I looked at it as a blessing in disguise
because I quickly realized what's most
important in my life and one more time
needed to be spent I've since
reconnected with the pillar product
design team who helped design our flat
elastic lacing system to help us create
the ultimate round elastic lacing system
these guys have helped develop snowboard
bindings commercial safety harnesses and
a slew of other locking mechanisms I
have to say the expand' quick-release
system is a brilliant design it easily
snaps in place and lies flat against
your shoes it's reversible so it stays
hidden if you're wearing slacks or pants
and won't come undone or loosen up you
can
cashews and when you're ready to release
simply pull the tab and flip up you can
also just slip your shoes on and leave
it unlocked for a comfortable casual fit
we quickly realize this product is quite
useful for many different applications
outside of just shoes and our one-piece
design is bulletproof in comparison to
other products that require two separate
pieces and a spring in order to function
not only was our design simpler it was
much more effective when it came to the
holding power our design held over 30
pounds of pressure before any slippage
occurred this means our single clip
holds as much pressure as four of these
other clips combined and installation is
extremely simple lace your shoes up
slide the lock down snap in place
install the pull tab and you're good to
go each pack will include everything you
need to complete one pair of shoes we
also wanted to make sure you get a
perfect match so we're offering over 40
colors to choose from that's the expand
story and while there's no cure for West
Nile virus over the past year those
closed doors have started to open again
allowing me to get back to my old self
if you think that expand quickly system
is a good fit for yourself
your kids your parents your grandparents
or anyone else in your family I would
love to have you on board as a backer so
we can place a huge initial purchase
order with our manufacturers and get the
system in your hands by mid-summer and
if you don't think the system is a good
fit for yourself I hope you found
inspiration within my story just
remember we can't control everything
life throws our way but if you focus on
turning negatives into positives you'll
be in a much better place thanks for
watching
yes this that was definitely my first
time riding an electric skateboard and
i'ma definitely do it again that was a
lot of fun traffic is crazy this thing
though I can definitely see myself
getting on this and kind of zipping
around oh yeah you go pretty fast on it
you know it's pretty easy to learn you
learn in like five seconds when I rotate
was super stable and the controls were
like perfectly normally I would never
escape but this is so smooth and easy
for beginners I give it two thumbs up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
