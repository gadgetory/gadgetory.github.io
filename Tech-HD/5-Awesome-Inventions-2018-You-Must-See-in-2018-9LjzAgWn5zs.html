first fixer campaign to set new
standards for oral hygiene with a
toothbrush you only reach 70 percent of
your teeth this is why we have developed
a fast and efficient solution for
cleaning the left out tooth surface the
wing brush because traditional
interdental brushes and dental floss are
inconvenient to use and don't offer the
same high cleaning power as our wing
brush we combine easy handling and high
cleaning performance because our Fila
helps you to find the gaps between your
teeth this is also displayed by our
studies by using the ring brush you can
reach more interdental spaces while
decreasing gum bleeding at the same time
you see no gum bleeding this community
is just simply awesome the hive during
our first Kickstarter campaign was
overwhelming initially our aim was to
stop production and we really didn't
expect an interdental brush on
kickstarter who cares but believe it or
not 13,000 incredible people from 102
countries in the world supported us now
we wanted to know how you liked our
winged brush so we conducted a survey
this survey was sent out to 13,000
backers and 2,000 of them responded
thank you for your feedback we really
appreciate it
75% of our backups were really satisfied
with the wing brush that makes three out
of four but I heard that you had
problems by using the wing bro let's
talk about that
hey mr. Beckham I heard you didn't like
our wing brush what's the matter
well the brush was too short then I got
something for you
35 people told us that the brush was too
short and didn't mean the molar teeth
sufficiently therefore we have extended
the brush size by 25% hmm
mr. Beck oh you also told me that the
brush burns too easily right the wire of
our brushes has a special coating now
that increases stiffness this prevents
the brush from bending so that sensitive
areas such as gum set implant surfaces
are better protected yeah
that's not a problem anymore but I know
that there was one last thing on your
mind the tension wasn't high enough for
you right well we worked on that
but convince yourself a pluck with a
shortness of 75 was placed between the
handle therefore the tension has
significantly increased in to brush
sights fruity incidental space more
easily amen
don't forget your wing brush have a good
day after first Kickstarter campaign
with more than 12,000 backers who build
up reliable production structures and
set up processes for fast delivery to
over a hundred countries the supply
chain is working perfectly now we're
able to handle a big amount of worldwide
orders to improve our product even
further we develop new functions and
fight another patent application
production can start with your support
give height off paradin titles of tools
became we ask you to give us the chance
to realize the wing worth 2.0 we have
done our homework and prepared well
after our last campaign support us
proving oral care
