it's electing a charger you have to
decide where you're going to use it what
you're going to charge with it how many
devices you'll have to power and what
devices it's optimized for but what if
you didn't introducing the Pearl charger
a 50 watt for poor charger with no
compromises the Pearl could deliver 2.7
amps to all four ports at the same time
most multi port chargers have an overall
power rating so when you plug in too
many high power devices one or more of
the port's will be throttled the Pearl
lets you draw a maximum power from all
its board's simultaneously when you
connect your device the Pearl will
detect and adapt to the devices charging
scheme maximizing the amount of power
delivered and minimizing charging time
you can power it using lithium ion and
lithium polymer batteries lead acid
batteries ac/dc adapters and car
adapters the integrated watt meter
allows you to see how much power devices
drawing so you no longer have to guess
how fast your devices are charging we've
carefully designed the pearl charger
over many iterations optimizing and
refining the design to this point in
preparation for production we produce an
initial batch ironing out all the kinks
and making sure that the Pearl charger
is ready to manufacture we've sent many
of them to reviewers around the world so
you can see what others think before you
make the pledge we now need your help to
scale up production
we hope you'll back us on Kickstarter
and make the Pearl Charger a reality
outside I don't know
stores which is leading us all will ever
trust
we'll go
through the wastelands through the
highways so my shadow through the
sunrays and
creativity innovation and quality these
are the three main ingredients that we
do here anyway
we take everyday problems fix them with
clever simple ideas
first up a revolutionary new carrying
device for paddle boards paddle boarding
is a fantastic low-impact water sport
that is great for people of all ages the
problem the size of the boards we have
spent the past 12 months developing a
solution that works for everyone and
doesn't involve spending unnecessary
money on carry cases or trolleys at
first glance easy strap appears to be
just a regular surf leash which it is
with a little hidden extra open this
pouch and suddenly your surf leash
becomes your carry strap simply sling
the loop over the nose of your board and
slide the padding back over your
shoulder and you're good to go when
you're done just fold a loop back into
the pouch until next time
it was really important to us to ensure
that the easy strap carry leash was
comfortable to use so we've used extra
thick neoprene padding to stop the
weight of the board digging into your
shoulder and secondly and probably most
importantly it needed to be durable
enough to withstand the everyday wear
and tear and strong enough to support
even the heaviest boards we've used only
the highest quality materials and
trusted manufacturers to work with to
keep the final quality of the product
uncompromised and finally and always at
the top of our list aesthetics it had to
look good
instead of the standard plastic cord you
would expect to find we've designed a
much cooler extendable leash that we can
customize and various different colors
to suit your board easy strap is
available in six different sizes to suit
all board lengths check out the size
guide to see which one you need thank

strap now and receive exclusive
