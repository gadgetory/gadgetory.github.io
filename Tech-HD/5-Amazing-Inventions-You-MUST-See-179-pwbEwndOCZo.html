say hello to dusk
a unique wall clock that changes shades
when time goes by we designed dusk to
adapt its colors and transparency
depending on the time of day at dawn the
light shades of grey started the cycle
of your day and while the day progresses
the shades turn darker
and darker
until the dusk turns into a night shade
of black
this cycle from start to finish takes 12
hours to turn dark and another 12 hours
to become light again dusk is incredibly
easy to install and calibrate to any
timezone
dusk never look at time the same way
again
no one likes to see their child struggle
imagine if your child struggled with the
most common way of learning if letters
on a page looked foreign if it took them
three times longer to finish a simple
homework assignment imagine if your
child had dyslexia what would you do
more than 45 million people across
America struggle with dyslexia every day
that's why we've created the reading
style pen a patent-pending electronic
reading pin though instantly convert
text to audio with a simple path of a
hand by reading text aloud the reading
style pin will help your son or daughter
learn to overcome obstacles on their own
boosting their self-confidence and
making them more independent the reading
style pen was built with the classroom
in mind because it stores no information
it can be used on tests with no risk of
cheating this means never again will
your child experience the pain and
embarrassment of being pulled from the
classroom at home your child will be
more efficient knocking their homework
out in a fraction of the time leaving
them free to be a kid we start this
project three years ago with the mission
to support the education and empowerment
of people through technology getting to
this point has taken a lot of hard work
patience and personal growth but finally
in a position to bring this product into
the world with the support of the
University of Kansas our family and our
friends we have made a great deal of
progress our prototype is complete our
manufacturer is ready to go now we need
your help to make the reading style pen
a reality
our goal is 40,000 dollars which will
cover the equipment tooling and
inventory necessary for our first
production run by backing at one of our
three pad dyslexic peers you will be one
of the first to get your hands on the
reading style pen for those who don't
have dyslexia and still want to show
support we have custom design apparel so
you too can help spread awareness of
this common condition click the button
that says back it right now to support
our project and be sure to share it on
all your social media the more support
we receive the faster we'll be able to
ship your rewards
you
we start a NOAA to bring SmartLink
technology directly to runners and
athletes all over the world as quickly
as possible we've actually been working
with a community of runners over the
last two years to perfect the technology
and to create Nova the essential running
jacket the responses have been
overwhelming we've seen an incredible
amount of excitement for the product and
what the technology is really capable of
and we really believe that it's gonna
change the game for running at night
four out of ten runners feel at risk of
being struck by motorists when they run
at night part of the reason is because
reflective gear alone just doesn't
provide the right amount of illumination
and strap on LEDs are bulky and tend to
weight the runner down when they're on
their run what we've done it with no
vibes we've seamlessly integrated
silicon light guide technology which is
machine washable and extremely durable
what's beautiful about it is with the
click of a button you're good to go for
illumination up to eight hours we've
partnered with two of the leading
suppliers in the apparel and technology
industries for example we partnered with
mas who's invested in numeron pinks and
ethos All Humans launched remarkable
products into the market and what this
means is that we can bring high quality
innovative products directly to you much
faster than ever before we're launching
the Nova jacket on IndieGoGo this
holiday season and we'd like you to join
the community and be one of the first to
get your Nova jacket
and chanted by those big eyes I'm sorry
but I don't really have time don't you
ever have time for for poor confidence
