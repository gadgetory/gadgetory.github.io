certified solvers professional and one
of the developers of Cooley bought a
compact affordable yet professional 3d
printer my dad and I started out in the
garage our goal was to imagine 3d
printing for a wider audience and make
this tool usable for everybody for most
people
3d printers are either too large too
expensive too difficult to use or just
basic tiny toys with unacceptable
quality we wanted to create something
that would be high functioning yet
affordable simple enough to use for
everyone just plug it in and click print
after two and a half years of hard work
we are proud to introduce you to kuiba
the first machine that makes 3d printing
available to all people you don't have
to be an expert or a technology buff to
use it
cubot is capable of printing any object
you can imagine and design however to
jumpstart your creativity we have
created our own design database that
contains many different designs ready to
be printed all you need to do is browse
the database and click print for your
favorite design the use of this database
will be completely free for our users
and Coolibar owners simply enjoy your
creations as they come to life we design
kou Bharat with a priority on health and
safety so that you can bring to the bar
into your home your office your
classroom or labs goobie pod has a built
in ventilation system with the
replaceable filter making cubot safer
than other non filter 3d printers
compact doesn't mean less powerful
k√ºbra watts heated bed and
high-temperature nozzle enable it to
print with a wide range of materials
including PLA plastic for toys and hobby
engineering plastics such as ABS and PC
and flexible materials as well Kuby bots
smart status notification lets you know
what it's up to at all times
kuba bot is also Wi-Fi and cloud enabled
allowing users to print wirelessly from
their computer or phone using our
Android and iOS apps

price kuba bot is truly for everybody

toys or school projects engineers and
scientists who need to produce quick
prototypes teachers architects and
business owners no matter what your
vocation or purpose might be kuba bot
makes 3d printing technology practical
accessible and effortless and fun for
everybody right now kuba vada exists as
fully functional prototypes but we need
your help to finalize the web-based
platform and manufacture the molds
needed for production when our
Kickstarter goal is met we'll be able to
take Ruby bot from porta type to
production and get it into the hands of
people like you we built a technology
that puts 3d printing in the hands of
everyone with a dream now it's up to you
what will you create with kuba

remember important information over
