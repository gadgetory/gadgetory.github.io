welcome to our advocate car campaign
this project began four years ago at the
collaboration between Montag and the
expressive repair shop kan and coffee
housing the same space in our studio in
Berkeley California Montag the skin made
an American design consultancy who has
brought dozens of products to market for
both fortune 500 clients and small
startups every day we'd see new machines
come into the repair shop different
problems of the same look as the diners
passionate about coffee we ask ourselves
what can we move the table in a sea of
similar coffee machine making the same
materials producing the same quality of
coffee
all our Elsie the same price where's the
added value our design process took us
on an extensive investigation in
materials and production approaches
after several trips to local salvage
yards a unique aesthetic emerged we
wanted to elevate the at-home coffee
experience by treating an appliance like
a sculpture making it earn its valuable
bit of real estate on your kitchen
counter
designing Anza has been a rewarding
experience from sketching computer
modeling to prototype we have ensured
that anser will perform technically at
the level you expect from the
top-of-the-line espresso machine given
our complex aim we quickly realize this
with the profit we will have to figure
out ourselves so in order to begin
prototype in-house we constructed a 10
piece flexible mold after experimenting
with several mixes and finishes we
finally settled on a concrete mix
without chemical additives which gave us
the raw brutalist look we were going for
our design team has gone through many
rounds prototypes and have now secured a
full-scale manufacturer overseas and
we're going to deliver the best product
possible we'll continue to make
refinements right up until the final
production stage with your help we hope
to secure the funds that hit go on
manufacturing and deliver the hands with
the kitchens around the world it's been
an exciting journey to get here and this
is the final step in our process we hope
that you enjoy the end as much as we did
making from all of us here thank you
thank you
you
you
you
Oh
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
