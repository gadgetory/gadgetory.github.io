one day and we were talking about
Bluetooth speakers that exists these
days most of them are ones that are in
home speakers they're not outdoors and
the ones that are that might be
waterproof or that might be somewhat
durable you take them outside and you
still have to worry about them if you
drop it it's probably gonna break
there's just all these options out there
nothing that really solves the problem
of taking it somewhere and not having to
worry about it at all and and adding
some fun to it so what we did first was
basically took a regular foam football
that you can get off the shelves cut it
in half and put a small speaker in it
just to kind of see how that would feel
it doesn't even work a couple of the
issues we came up with was you know how
do you get the sound out of a foam
football where it sounds good so we
added a little mechanism to get the
sound out the low tones resonate through
the football and the higher end tones
come out through the front probably had
six or seven iterations of the prototype
to get to a point where it sounds good
it sounds high-quality then they showed
me a video clip where they threw it off
the balcony of a seventh floor building
it smashed the ground musics playing
loud didn't even miss a beat and I was
like we're onto something this is
awesome we started to bring the product
to customers to see what aspects of that
product they liked so waterproof and it
floats you can actually just bring it in
the water with you with the range being
you know up to like 50 yards I think
that's a major selling point right there
the ball can actually charge your phone
or whatever device for that matter and
because it's a football it's also a hell
of a lot of fun to play with yes it's
fun to have music but you bring
something that you can throw around
that's a part of the action and it's ten
times the fun people love the verb all
i'ma phone 2.0 is built from modern
music we've developed a dual driver
design the low frequency driver within
that walnut block drives bass response
that modern music is built on underneath
the horn itself a mid-range driver just
sings
we reimagined vintage design with modern
days out
hi my name is Alan I live my life from
my phone it arranges my life for me it
stores all my special memories it also
keeps me in touch with the world but I
have a serious serious problem
I'm always losing my phone I've lost
more than ten phones over the last three
years I'm tired of losing my contacts
schedules photos everything this has to
stop
I need a better way to protect my phone
now I use the duet just click and the
duet device helps me find my lost phone
even in a heart to reach spot in fact
when I'm more than ten meters away from
my phone I can set the device to alert
me so I'll never be late for another
class again it can even track my other
lost items by the protag app my wallet
my keys laptop whatever because the duet
protects my phone it protects my life
too
introducing Princeton audio site one
speaker site one speakers are built to
look as good as they sound what makes us
unique is we use instrument quality
tonewoods
and patent pending wireless technology
your site one experience begins with the
same words used to make the highest
quality musical instruments using
carefully selected tonewoods master
craftsmen build each speaker by hand
throughout assembly each speaker is
individually tuned to produce rich room
filling sound what really makes the site
one extraordinary is it's
interchangeable wireless interface no
other speaker in the world gives you
freedom to choose from Wired Bluetooth
or Wi-Fi simply by switching the
interface plug the site ones external
interface is interchangeable with future
technological upgrades ensuring that the
speaker will last for years to come
thanks to an internal battery with 12
hours of playback the site one speaker
goes wherever you go
whether you're in for the night with
your special someone or just sitting
around the campfire with friends site
when speakers provide the soundtrack at
Princeton audio we build more than just
speakers we build handcrafted
masterpieces that are designed to last a
lifetime
introducing the Hydra designed to bring
modern creature comforts along for the
ride the most significant feature is the
powerful Bluetooth speaker built into
the cabin your smartphone playlists
provide the source and the Hydra keeps
you rocking in all these locations and
more the speaker is removable so you can
flip it place it on a table and extend
the legs
this augments the sound by bouncing the
high end while the legs transmit the low
end into the table increasing the base
well on your bicycle listening to music
with headphones is simply dangerous they
reduce your aural awareness of your
surroundings with the Hydra your music
goes with you but safely of course we
can't live without our trusty
smartphones especially when out and
about
so we built a charger into the base of
the bottle that will fully replenished
your device keep the music thumping and
charge anyway but guess what the Hydra
is just getting started
we've added powerful LEDs to the base
the bottom let's shine up into the
frosted surface and a refract through
the liquid at a picnic table the solid
white light makes a great lamp to
illuminate your ghost stories or play a
game spot or set your Hydra on your
bedside table for a reading lag
not only does the bottle provide good
night hydration the lamp can be set to
color fade to set the mood for calming
sleep now add our free Hydra night
timeout
it sends soothing sounds your Hydra
ensures you'll be low
the hydras most important lighting
Center is your safety in mind the bright
red light will ensure you aren't missed
while on the road at night today we have
a fully functioning prototype the
Bluetooth speaker sounds terrific and
our circuit design is complete and being
manufactured the charging station is
working great the lighting system is
being updated with the RGB functionality
and the red light will be flashing so
we're here on Kickstarter to expand some
of the features and execute the next
phase of design we have sculpted the
body modernize the look and improves the
grip the addition of the speaker ring
will improve upon the already fantastic
sound and we're adding a few more
features such as an FM radio receiver
and even a microphone so you can take
phone calls on the trail plus a
carabiner with a bottle opener and even
a secret storage space that will hold
keys in cash and as expected we will be
offering Hydra in a variety of colors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
