inflammation of the ligament on the
bottom of the foot in the United States
alone more than 3 million people each
year will be diagnosed with plantar
fasciitis a whopping eighty percent of
women have foot problems with plantar
fasciitis being one of the most common
causes of their pain we want to change
that so meet high healer your personal
food therapist
it's the most versatile food care device
on the market you can use hi healer
anywhere you want to relieve the pain in
your foot most people that are suffering
from foot pain have plantar fasciitis
the high healer is interesting in that
it now allows us to strengthen the
intrinsic muscles of the foot which we
were unable to do before I'm dr. Steven
Bui I'm a surgeon podiatrist I have been
practicing for more than 15 years I'm
the inventer of the high healer a high
heel is for anyone who suffer from foot
pain heel pain for example athlete like
runners for people that their weight
create a lot of stress on their feet
people that are on their feet a lot
during the day I'm a runner and I
definitely think this high Heelers for
me I don't work out I love high heels
and my feet are flat and it makes me
feel better it makes me feel like my
feet aren't consistently suffering I
love it it's perfect for me this is good
man it's good it's not for specific
people this this is for everyone even if
you don't do even if you don't run you
don't go to jail sometimes you walk from
one place to another it's always nice to
eat like to get those legs stretch and
it is something very good you don't need
to go for massage i healer is the first
of its kind never had anything in the
industry that can do all the modalities
at home there are 4 main function of the
high healer first is the cooling effect
of the roller which help the
inflammation of the plantar fascia if it
has a rounded edge on one side and a
sharp edge on the other the rounded edge
is used for the acute inflammation where
you can't put down as much pressure on
the ligament when you're pressing and
the other side is the sharper one for
the chronic inflammation which you could
push down a little bit harder it has the
benefit of the adding both heat and cold
so that if you have an acute case of
plantar fasciitis you could use the ice
if it's a chronic you could use the heat
allow the ligament to stretch out the
second feature is stretching massaging
off the plantar fascia third function is
to activate the intrinsic muscle within
the foot to help stabilize the foot and
strengthening the foot stepping along
activating the small muscles that
actually fire when these things fire and
stretch and pull it strengthens the
bottom of the foot thereby the ligament
that's being destroyed which is called
the plantar fascia it doesn't have to
work so hard so the muscles will help
induce strengthening and the last
function is to help loosen up the
Achilles tendons the stretching will
stretch two types of muscles bottom of
the lake and then a little bit higher
behind the knee normally it would take
you thirty five minutes or so work
through all the exercises that need to
be done but using the device you can cut
that time down to about 10 to 15 minutes
our first Kickstarter campaign with high
bowler was a great success our campaign
was funded by 200% with the help of 1700
amazing backers all the backers received
their products within three months the
campaign ended together with our
manufacturer we have already designed
the tooling and created the production
plan for high healer now we need your
support to bring this project to life
as a dog owner have you ever experienced
something similar to this I gotta tell
you love what you've done with the place
thanks but alright so I have a quick
question what is what is the creepy box
thing in the corner underneath the towel
oh that if you're a dog owner maybe
already know that crates are the easiest
great to train your dog but why do all
the crates out there look like we're
punishing our precious babies
introducing pod the best nesting space
for your dog that will make all other
crates obsolete
hi I'm Amy founder of chasing monkey say
hi monkey I'm a devoted dog mom and also
a product designer I spent the last
fourteen years designing cars gaming
controllers and products for some of the
industry's top brands
now I'm devoting my time and energy into
improving dogs and dog parents lives all
over the world that's why I set out to
design the best space for dogs we looked
at everything from design to
functionality and how it fits into your
lifestyle so why air creates importance
dogs are natural Denning animals so
crates give them a space where they feel
safe and comfortable crates are also
essential in potty training your little
ones because most dogs will not soil
their sleeping quarters but what makes
pod better pod is safe pod doesn't have
sharp metal edges where your human and
fur babies could hurt themselves it's
made from 100% non-toxic polypropylene
plastic which is same materials used to
make baby bottles metal crates are heavy
clunky and hard to collapse pod is
lightweight and easily collapsible
once it's collapsed you could simply
carry it with this built-in handle and
is super easy to clean because pod isn't
made out of metal the patterns on the
wall not only gives pod structural
strength but it gives your dog just
enough privacy to create that Den like
feel the door is designed to fully open
outwards and stay open so that when
you're done training your dog your furry
one could use it as a quiet peaceful
nesting space a chasing monkey we
believe in helping parents provide the
best and feel good about it - we're
gonna revolutionize the way you think
about your dog's nesting and training
space best of all you and your furry
ones are gonna want to show it off
please help me a monkeys dream to
provide a happy home for dogs and dog
parents around the world

does your bedroom look like this what's
keeping you awake no that's it that's
the sound of knowing he won't sleep
tonight you are not a born snore it can
develop at any time up to 64 percent of
couples have a snoring partner and it
makes 25% of couples sleep apart and
it's not just your relationship that's
in danger
your health is too when you fall asleep
your jaw relaxes and drops back closing
down your airway to the point where it
vibrates as you breathe this doesn't
just keep the whole house awake it also
stops you from getting the deep
refreshing sleep you need and that can
have serious implications for in your
life such as fatigue irritability
headaches restlessness poor
concentration diminished productivity
and adverse affects on your heart and
brain you could spend hundreds of
dollars on quick fix solutions with bold
claims and disappointing results
you could just grin and bear it or even
try Snorlax these super simple strips
are easy to apply and comfortable to
wear and they're quick and painless to
remove 100% cotton and fully
biodegradable Snorlax keeps your jaw in
its normal position and your airway open
stopping your snore in its tracks our

countless relationships restoring health
and harmony but we need your support to
get Snorlax into full production back us

the market it's the most affordable - we
can't fix everything but a good night
