let's face it kitchen knives are a mess
the knives in your kitchen were probably
a wedding or graduation present am i
right at or low we know if more people
cook from home they'll have a healthier
and happier lifestyle finding joy
putting together healthy meals and
spending time in the kitchen there's no
better way to enhance that experience
than by buying better tools and the
knife is the most important tool in the
kitchen the more you understand how and
when to use each knife the more joy you
will get out of cooking so we came
together and created the last knife set
you'll ever need complete with for high
quality Damascus steel knives and knife
roll all four are constructed using vg10
Japanese Damascus steel we chose the
steel because it will help your knife
stay extremely sharp they're five times
stronger than traditional steel knives
as well as the longevity in withstanding
rust we also spent months designing and
redesigning the shape landing on these
four simple but effective designs
control while cutting is one of the most
important things to look for in a knife
to reach that we used an engineered wood
plastic composite it's not only
extremely durable it's also shape to
your hand giving you force while keeping
you safe after research and testing we
found that these four knives are all
that are needed in any cooking situation
having a great chef's knife is something
most people will never experience but
once you do you'll never go back a
chef's knife is king of the kitchen this
is the knife that you will use most of
the time for your slicing dicing fruits
and vegetables cutting meats and fish at
three and a half inches the paring knife
is perfect for slicing smaller items
like garlic strawberries and other
smaller fruits and vegetables the size
of the blade allows you to pay more
attention to detail the serrated knife
is amazing for slicing bread but it is
also really good for slicing items that
have a hard or slick surface like
pineapples or Tomatoes the serrated
edges catch on to the heart or slick
surface and slice right through
the carving-knife can do most of the
things that the chef's knife cannot the
flexible blade makes cutting around
bones and filleting fish quick and easy
all of these knives can be stored in
this hardy knife roll made from waxed
canvas and oil stain leather it's
designed to hold four of these knives
perfectly and keeps your knives
organized in your house or on-the-go
making you feel like a chef every time
you cook because we know that we're not
the only knives out there we made it
possible for you to buy each knife
individually or as a complete set it's
time to upgrade your knives or lomax</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
