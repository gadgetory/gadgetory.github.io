I'm Zakir and I want you to be seen hey
Kickstarter I'm Sachi and here's a story
about my turn signal cloths it's 2010
and I'm living in San Francisco working
for Google as a programmer my friend
Whelan a fashion designer from New York
crashes on my couch after going to
Burning Man we both can't sleep so we
created this outfit called the Hydra
pack it's like a camel pack but it glows
our friends liked it and I start wearing
it all the time one day I wear the Hydra
pack to a fashion show and the fashion
show organizer sn√•sa picture being says
who made this amazing outfit and I said
I did and he's like you should make five
more outfits and I'll put them on the
fashion runway so I called my friend
from New York and say hey on the fly to
San Francisco I made five more outfits
and put them on the runway he's like
okay so we do it one of the five outfits
was the original terms of of gloves and
everyone loved it so now I'm on a
mission to make electronic clothes for
everyone I asked my friend Marat who
made circuit boards for his jacket if he
can make my circuit boards with Marat as
my co-founder if the gloves look awesome
I quit my job at Google and work full
time getting the gloves ready for
production and now here we are
production is ready and we need your
help so that we can get these gloves on
your hands so that you can be seen
I'm entering your passwords every time
you want to unlock your phone but you
still want to keep tip-top security and
you like having you sticker on your arm
for days at a time
well the blink has something for you a
digital tattoo I imagine for mobile
gadget and today we're taking a look at
the brand new digital tattoo one that
unlocks your phone or should I say the
Moto X the digital tattoo comes in a
stylish container showing the logo and
the metallic design finish with a
slide-out pamphlet with 10 digital
tattoos now remember the tattoo cut our
side effects and you should probably
take a look at the warnings before you
slap it on putting the tattoo on is
fairly simple to pull it out of the
sheet of 10 and paste it on it will
easily stick and won't come off now go
enjoy your day and it won't matter how
many times you wash your arm or whether
you're in the shower the digital tattoo
is not going to come off of course after
a while it will affect the skin that's
covered in it sending it up is fairly
simple just slap your Moto X against the
digital tattoo and the setup should
begin it isn't any kind of special
technology its NFC of course make sure
you have a pin in case your tag is not
around you can also place it anywhere
anywh like a difference even if it's
under your clothes so the question is is
it easier and better well that comes
down to personal preference it's
definitely easier to place your phone to
your wrist putting it in a password
isn't that hard either and after three
days it did come off but when it was off
I felt like it was still there and I
wish it was because I kind of got used
to using it just remember to dispose of
your tattoos where no one will take it
and finally in my opinion I felt the
design was very well related to the
purpose each being unique and not
fashionable choice but any trick to show
your friends and make your life a bit
simpler when you want to check your
phone quickly
thanks for watching guys I'll see you
guys on the next one this was Andrew
with a quick video on the Motorola
digital tattoo
welcome to Toyota at the 2014 Geneva
Motor Show let's take a look at the
future now with a European debut of
Toyotas sv 2 concept a concept which
embodies Toyotas fun to drive philosophy
this futuristic vehicle enhances driving
experience by connecting both physically
and emotionally with the driver unlike
any other vehicle the FV 2 or fun
vehicle tube doesn't come with a
steering wheel instead the driver
operates the vehicle by shifting his or
her body weight to intuitively move the
vehicle forward backward left and right
together with intelligent transport
system technology the FV 2 is connected
to other vehicles in the area and the
local traffic infrastructure providing
the driver with safety information
whether it's morning the driver about
blind spots at intersections or
promoting safer driving drivers can also
form an emotional bond with their XP -
using technology developed by the Toyota
Hart projects but only can the vehicle
determine the drivers mood but the FV -
keeps learning through accumulated
driving history on the outside the FV 2
comes with an augmented reality
windshield whilst the colors and
exterior display on the body panels can
be customized a will to create an even
more intimate relationship between
driver and vehicle
if you had an FB - what would you
display on the digital panels
we do in almost every morning and over
33% of us do it at least three times a
day hitting that snooze button that
irresistible urge to snooze the stain
our comfy bed is something we fight
every morning and it makes us late brush
out the house that's stuck in stressful
traffic and lose valuable morning time
it's time we stop losing to the snooze
this is ruggy the world's best alarm
clock getting out of bed has never been
so easy simply stop your alarm by
resting your feet on its soft memory
foam padding thank you just fall back
into bed my keys alone needs to sense
your pressure for at least three seconds
and now that you're up
rugby rewards you with customizable
speeches have it's a daily motivation or
just something positive in a funny voice
just to start your day off right the
true beauty of rugby is that it lets you
easily get out of bed earlier because
it's no secret early risers are often
linked with success the CEOs of Apple
and Starbucks champion athletes like
Mike Tyson and Kobe are all known to the
early birds and when you effortlessly
get out of bed early you feel more
optimistic became minutes to your days
hours to weeks and day
years extra time is spent on what you
want to do before what you have to spend
it with our loved ones our on ourselves
to focus and achieve whatever it is that
we want you'll literally get more out of
life with writing so join us in taking
back this precious time from the snooze
back ruggy today
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
