innovative seven circular pivot points
pivoting flat clamping pads and lift
spring feature bring this hold down
clamp to a whole new level
it will help woodworkers save time while
improving safety and precision the
knuckle clamp with its multi lock
endpoints enables you to deal with
different workpiece thicknesses and
shapes this capability is enhanced by a
pair of pivoting flat feet with molded
rubber pads which applies targeted
pressure to lock down the workpiece
without marring its surface molded from
reinforced polycarbonate this clamp is
virtually indestructible the adjustable
spring lifts feature starts with locking
the clamps bolt to your track then
adjusting the spring nut to bring your
clamping pan to about 1/8 of an inch
from the top of your board tighten the
locking knob to lock it in place
loosen the locking knob and the spring
lifts the clapping pad off the board
allowing for movement and the clamp
stays in place now that's cool and with
the knuckle plant bench kit you get
everything you need to make an easy to
install easy to use face vise for boards
on edge and end grain work which is easy
to remove when the job is done like all
woodpecker brand woodworking tools the
knuckle clamp is manufactured in our
shop just outside of Cleveland Ohio in
the USA
introducing poly gauge SS a precision
machined polygon with five angles
commonly used by woodworkers and it's
magnetic dual purpose knob and phase
connects the tool to steel machine tops
allowing for hands-free adjustments now
you can set table saw blade angles
perfectly the first time
place the poly gauge SS horizontally to
set miter fences easily
or use with a miter saw to accurately
set fence to blade angles quickly set up
miter cuts with confidence and tackle
complex projects previously avoided with
poly gauge SS we set out to make a more
modern and functional polygons that's
made right here in our shop originally I
designed the polygons to be made out of
aluminum but once I machined it had the
part of my hand I decided to didn't have
the modern feel that we're looking for
so from there we decided to go towards
the stainless steel because it gave a
modern look and a more accurate edge the
high quality stainless steel gets cut
out with our laser cutter from there it
gets leveled and sandblasted which gives
it a nice matte finish and we precision
mill our edges to keep our angles within
eight thousandths of a degree which is
ten times more accurate than our other
competitors after inspection the
stainless steel gets passivated and
moves on to be laser anneal giving the
tool its high contrast easily readable
markings and we designed the perfect
handle by really printing multiple
prototypes to make sure it's securely
fit the tool instead of the typical
screw off handle we made ours with two
rare earth magnets which allows for
quick and easy attachment
I think we built a really cool modern
and highly functional poly huge and I'm
proud that it's made right here in our
shop poly gauge SS precision made in the
USA
simplify your dado cuts with the
woodpecker's dado setup fixture or DSF
and when paired with the woodpeckers gap
gauge tedious dado setups are a thing of
the past
the traditional method for setting up
dado cuts can be a repetitive
frustrating pursuit and without a
precise way to measure dado width or
securely arrange the dado stack you're
forced to reach inside your saw again
and again to get the right cut
by mimicking the mounting of the dado
set on your table saw the DSF allows for
an easy aergon onic setup just take a
physical reading of the material with
the gap gauge then match with the DSF to
set the perfect data width
eliminating the need for multiple test
cuts saving time and stress the DSF
incorporates a 5/8 inch brass Arbor and
threaded knob that fully compresses the
dado stack just as your saws Arbor nut
would and can accommodate dedos up to
fifteen sixteenths of an inch thick
quickly secure the DSF with a bench vise
by drilling into a work surface and
inserting the included three eighths
inch pins or mount to a Festool MFT with
its perfectly matched bushings a clever
addition to your shop the gap gauge
makes gauging the thickness of material
or the dimensions of a joint a one-step
operation and the mini gap gauge is
perfect for mortise and tenon joinery
work more efficiently and make dado
setups quick and easy with the
woodpecker's dado setup fixture and gap
gauge
a combination built for precision in the
USA
this is the dust right lathe dust
collection system from Rockler it's got
a distinctive scoop shaped dust port
that cups spindle turnings to capture
dust and fine shavings as they're cut
from the workpiece before they get into
the air no other dust hood gets us close
and the dust right system is fully
adjustable to provide access for sanding
without sacrificing performance if you
turn small projects you owe it to
yourself to check out the dust right
lathe dust collection system just go to
your local Rockler retailer or Rockler
