believe the future of video and
photography should mean a more immediate
and immersive experience everyone should
enjoy making a 360-degree our patented
three lenses system makes a highly
compact design plus it all we form the
device so small that it's portable in
the palm of your hand the 360 cam is
what our resistance we overcame many
challenges to integrate a curved LED
screen GPS and Wi-Fi antennas a powerful
battery for a fully functional camera
now it can go anywhere you want to take
similar high-resolution 360-degree video
and photos our suppliers are ready to go
this is where we need to pre-order 360
cam we appreciate your support and
feedback will ship the first 360 cam to
you in November thank you
it's a problem everyone can relate to
nobody likes making their bed whether
you're young professional without the
time to spare have a teenager who
doesn't want to bother or simply
struggling with mobility issues we can
all relate to the feeling again after
walking away from an 8-minute we
invented the smart Dubey because there's
nothing better than getting into a bed
that feels like it was made just for you
our patent-pending design uses air
chambers made of space-age fabric that
attaches to your duvet in a non
permanent way and fits inside your duvet
cover using the app you can set your bed
to be made while you're awake so that
shortly after you have a hotel quality
made bed every time once we realize the
simplicity and effectiveness of our
design it opened the door to many other
benefits first of all we added a duvet
placement book
this makes the smart duvet rigid so you
can easily attach the device to your own
duvet
solving once and for all the age-old
struggle of placing the duvet in its
cover
also our smart attach system allow smart
Evette to place both duvet and sheets
simultaneously smart duvet is fully
compatible with most even duvet covers
if you do not have a duvet yet check out
our advantageous bundles so there you
have it a simple invention which works
with your existing bedding and makes
your bed automatically every day we
completed the design and have a fully
working prototype hey guys this is chris
with smart duvet
live at CES 2017 smart do event right
now on IndieGoGo check us out we need
your support to make bed making a thing
of the past
you
hi guys I want to present to you our
first prototype as you can see in the
dark station it is capable of charging
three different devices at the same time
you can ask me what is unique in this
product I will tell you we have
developed a special application which
allows you to watch remotely and
insensibly what is going on in your
house apartment office or anywhere else
where your second device is connected to
the z-tech dock station while you are
anywhere in the world
also you can remotely Pan the dock
station to 360 degrees it's a
multi-purpose intuitively controlled
device for the price of a standard
charger we are sure you will enjoy using
it every day we strive for your
satisfaction thank you my friends</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
