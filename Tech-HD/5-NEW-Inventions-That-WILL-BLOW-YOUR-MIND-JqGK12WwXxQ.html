i'm eric from anymore we created a
gadget that will transform your phone
into a professional camera i came up
with the idea when my camera bag got way
too heavy to carry on my travels and i
was missing out on photo opportunities
that's why we designed a smart and
lightweight solution that will make your
phone and more powerful camera we offer
a protective case that can mount a set
of detachable lenses that will truly
enhance your images made by pro
photographers but suitable for everybody
and super easy to use just attach them
to your phone and create better content

ultra high definition the possibilities
are limitless whether it is nature
animals or abstract imagery Lamora will
enable you to see different double your
optical zoom you can take stunning
landscape photographs or create more
fear of death for amazing portraits see
wider angles and make your phone create
that epic look of an action camera you
can create photographic masterpieces all
you need is your phone our mission is to
make professional photography available
to everyone
we're Milan right now to show you how
the product design began started by
engineering the set of lenses that are
very compact precise and lightweight and
they're crafted from very high quality
materials photo accessories stem for
position and that's what we have created
and what we are conveying with our
design language protection is very
important that's why we designed an
interior drip system that reduces the
impact surface with the body of the
phone and on top of that we design an
extra free that protects the screen and
prevents it from extra vandalism it took
us over one year of constant product
development designing engineering
testing and reiterated we created a
product that we can be truly proud of
and that will change the world of
photography we are ready for production
but we need your help to make this
project come reality please support us
on Kickstarter so we can make
professional images available to
everybody
anytime anyplace
between zero sleep sobbing babies and
shocking diapers blowouts it's safe to
say that Parenthood is insanely hard
less complicated here your baby should
it be today when we carry our babies on
our hips we're constantly shifting them
from one side to the other to give our
back hips and arms similarly with
carriers we struggle to get them
strapped in and it's often more of a
hassle than it's worth
especially for short periods of use hi
my name is kami and I'm a mother of two
and a half girls and I've created touch
baby so that we can comfortably carry
our kids and easily access the things
that we need this baby is a hassle-free
baby carriers diaper bag and purse and
one it's a simple seat that rests right
above your hips it's just one buckle
with two safeguards that's it take
seconds to put on and it's comfortable
to wear for short or long periods of
time made for both men and women the
waistband evenly distributes the baby's
weight and the suit absorbs some of the
weight too so you can hold them without
sticking out your hip and straining on
your back and arms our Organon mchip
seat puts your baby's hips in the proper
end-state position that's recommended by
pediatricians so it's totally safe for
little ones in fact kids love to sit on
their chest baby because it's soft and
squishy on the cute little tissues and
they're free to engage and be part of
the conversation or just hang out while
you hold on you work like crazy and went
through 12 different prototypes to
create the perfect carrier with all the
features parents ask for push baby has
four built-in storage pockets right in
the carrier which means you're going to
Turse diaper bag and stroller in the
minivan there's a big one beneath the
seat where you can carry things like
diapers wipes bottles pouches all the
baby essentials
there's another pocket in the front for
smaller items like a possum
they're the two side pockets are perfect
for your phone keys wallet sunglasses
you name it you can stash whatever you
need you can attach a baby toy to the
loop and and you want to store this bad
boy away we'll take it on the go it
folds up in fastens with a handy little
button tush babies made with premium
quality materials including memory foam
with in the seat and YKK zippers it can
be used for babies from zero to three
months old
for breastfeeding support and then from
four to thirty six months for forty-four
pounds for the hip seat we've designed
touch baby with the overwhelmed parent
and caregiver in mind we've come to
Kickstarter to bring piss baby to a
crazy hectic wonderful life our trusted
manufacturers are ready to go all we
need is a little financial love from you
to start production we're expected to
start shipping fish babies to our
Kickstarter backers in July 2018 so just
a couple of short months away
we're thrilled to bring this baby to the
world and each pledge bigger to mom
makes a huge difference from all of us
here at coast baby we feel your pain we
want to help you carry your kids
comfortably and we thank you
we created a flask for people the chair
say values you know that our craziest
craziest we are everything we do at work
is really not reasonable Felix the
founder of work he always tells us if we
have time to count the components on our
watches we don't have enough work but
I'm sure McCallum they counted the parts
on the floss once we send it over to
them you have little levers you have
little details you look around two
flavors if you have push buttons and you
have the little drawer in turn the
cylinders if you deploy the flaps they
give us like a landing gear for the
rocket flask so if you land you have a
stable surface you stay for standing of
the flask the idea is the two times we
came up with the idea of labeling it you
have to know which whiskey's in which
tanks so you can keep your favorite very
old one for yourself and then you give
it a little less rare one by rotating
just a mouse please before you posting
it to your friend we like to have the
interaction and play visit and always
see a little detail and new detail next
time and then look the flaws they will
see an author angle a different detail
and in all the complexity we put inside
of the of the engineering of the flask
