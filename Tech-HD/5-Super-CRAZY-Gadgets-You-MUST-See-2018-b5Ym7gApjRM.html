after the industrial design aspects of
the locket the brief was clear from the
start we wanted a magnetic product that
had high confidence in holding heavy
objects such as fully loaded water
bottles or heavy tools rolls of cable
etc we designed the locket with plenty
of pulling power but as well as getting
it on the surface it's really important
to design it so it's easier to get off
we achieve that with these angled sides
holding with confidence and then a lot
of pulling power there but we can roll
the product and just get it off
regardless of what kind of shape we're
holding so the design process of the
locket was extensive a research space
focusing on the magnetic properties and
requirements and then after various
testing we settled on the this cut
magnet which is incredibly strong for
its size then looking at the functional
aspects and again various prototypes
looking at how the magnet was going to
stick to the surface how it's going to
grip the surface on a shiny surface and
that's why we've got this rubberized
face and also resetting the magnets by a
critical amount so that you get maximum
full force without actually any damage
to that surface the way the products
designed behind with its ultrasonically
welded rear creates an inherently strong
product and then the way the product
flows into the DES strap handles at the
side again creates that ultimate angle
so that as you bond the strap around you
get that that flow and that strength the
strap itself as well many trials and
iterations to come up with an
aesthetically pleasing strap but also
one that is incredibly strong with again
X
grip
the idea came when I was climbing st.
helens I was mid hike and surrounded by
beauty when I noticed another hikers
tampon trash in the middle of the trail
I too was having my own troubles with
tampons it wasn't convenient changing
them every two to three hours and I
would find myself running between
activities only to realize I didn't have
enough supplies on me
they were often uncomfortable causing
dryness irritation and odor I wanted to
know why so I gave it a googol it was
the fibers and synthetic materials and
them making my cramps more painful the
most pads and tampons are bleached and
contain chemical toxins like dioxin
rayon pesticides and the list goes on
but when I added up 20 years of putting
these little toxic plugs and the most
absorbent part of my body I didn't feel
clean or sanitary I felt betrayed i
innovated box of hud because I believe
every woman deserves access to healthy
comfortable and convenient period care
that's why we spent the last year taking
feedback and testing prototypes from
diverse women we've made a few special
and important design tweaks that we
think you're gonna love this is box a
pod a patent-pending menstrual cup with
an innovative compact design its satiny
soft flexible and moldable
it folds and inserts like a tampon but
works better and lasts longer
it's not made of cotton fibers which
means rather than working against your
natural fluids it just slides right in
and those comfortably with your body a
reinforced Center gives you a foolproof
seal with every insertion no more leaks
are ruining your favorite pair of
underwear the bell-shaped curves of the
cup allow it to stay put and contour
with the natural movements and shape of
your body the unique pinch grips at the
base of the cup align with the suction
hose making the seal easy to break and
allowing the cup to glide right out
there's a stem at the base so you don't
have to worry about it getting lost in
there the base is rounded and the stem
is flexible it can be trimmed or removed
so there's never any poking down there
there's two sizes of box a pod to
accommodate your body and flow the cup
contains rather than absorbs your period
fluid collecting up to 5 times more than
a tampon giving you up to 12 hours of
leak free protection all Vox a pod cuffs
are made in the United States using only
100% FDA approved medical grade silicone
it eliminates the nasty bleaching and
chemical process box a pod is reusable
there's no Rapper's padding or plastic
applicator trash in the US alone 20
billion pads and tampons are thrown into
our landfills and waterways every year
with over one point eight billion people
menstruating globally you can do that
math not all women around the world have
access to safe period care it even
prevents some from getting their
education or going to work with every
purchase of octopod you fuel our social
mission to meet the period care needs of
a girl so she can stay in school we've
worked hard for the last two years
laying the groundwork to bring this
product to life
we've partnered with a product designer
that's been putting reputable brand
products into the market for over 26
years our patent is filed
manufacturing and distribution are lined
up to coordinate all stages of
production and logistics ensuring that
you not only get your box upon on time
but that it's made with integrity in
quality but to move to the next stage it
requires us to pay for expensive tooling
and capital to get to market if you were
to spend the next few years buying a box
of pads or tampons every month you would
easily spend $500 or more by backing
this Kickstarter campaign you can have a
product that actually makes managing
your period healthier and easier thank
you for backing this project every share
and every pledge helps we can't wait to
bring you box APOD looking for
superpowers introducing aura the
ultimate drone with gesture robotics
mind blowing technology simply put the
glove on and feel the power of having
aura right in your hand
no more joysticks and multi access
controls with aura you can fly your
drone following your hands command make
360 clips and show your skills flying
like a pro right out of the box
take up and land it with a simple button
clap controlling a drone has never been
so easy even for dad new aura you have
