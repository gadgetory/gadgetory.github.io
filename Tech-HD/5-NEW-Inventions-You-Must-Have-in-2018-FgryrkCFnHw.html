we've never found a travel pillow that
could offer us a wide range of sleeping
possibilities and look stylish enough to
be proud to wear that's why we created

first handcrafted memory foam travel
pillow that provides 360 degrees
sleeping possibilities during the

the curves and ships this is a technique
commonly used in the automotive industry
for its precision in achieving the
perfect form under the pillow case we've
chosen a hydrophilic memory foam with
cooling particles to eliminate both heat
and humidity our washable pillow case is
made of blended breathable spandex that
resists heat deodorization and dust
mites in its parts you know air super
lightweight and fits in the palm of your
hand
whether you're a frequent flyer or daily
commuter a camping enthusiast or like
cocktails by the pool you know air is
the perfect travel companion the

development states complete now we're
ready to launch globally to do this we
need to secure a minimum order quantity
and with your help we can do this
support our IndieGoGo campaign now and
get where you're going

I don't care how old you are the zero
blaster smoke ring launcher is awesome
and it's even more awesome if you have a
friend to do battle with I'll be right
back
the Zuo blaster fires harmless smoke
Ling's made from a water-based non-toxic
super fluid the vortex rings range from
two to four inches in diameter and can
fire up to twelve feet there's a ray gun
sound feature you can turn on and off as
well as a function to adjust the speed
at which it fires vapor rings timeout so
how does this thing actually work the
zero blaster creates an area of low
pressure and when that area has air flow
surrounding it the smoky vortex forms
okay cover me I'm going in introducing
the shirahama chef live collection
Japanese steel with a striking London
design sharp angular alluring this is
the knife collection you will want to
put on display hello I'm Freddie founder
of a drop Arabia where a small but
fast-growing company based in London
following the success of our last two
campaigns we're now back with a new
version of the Coriana called shiroyama
the white flower the floral pattern is
subtle yet sophisticated just like the
perfectly manicured Japanese garden so
how is she Roy Hanna different from
Corey Hannah
the Polish Damascus blade creates a
beautiful but light floral pattern the
smooth finish reduces microscopic
roughness this has the added benefit of
preventing dirt and moisture from
building up making the plate more
resistant to corrosion spine of the
knife has also been covered to further
protect the years 10 cutting organize a
dinner party at home and treat your
friends family or loved ones to a
delicious meal prepared using your
shiroi hana nights
who put the collection to the test with
Michelin star chef Paul Hood Paul is the
chef behind the Michelin star restaurant
the social eating house in Soho London
the look of the knife is very important
to us we look stunning
very unique yeah the handle of the knife
feels really comfortable in your hands
it feels like a bit of an extension of
the arm the sharpness of these really
good it went through the salmon really
nicely didn't rip it us and live - when
you first go to use it
yeah I'd recommend these nice to
everybody so what makes the shiroi hana
knives so good we're kept a high quality
aus ten cutting core usin the successful
Koriyama range produced by the HS Steel
Corporation in Japan the core is
hardened to 59 Rockwell the high
hardness enables the blade to retain
sharpness for longer so how sharp are
these knives we gave them to Japanese
chef and author of sushi at home Yukiko
me to test them out so this name is very
very sharp so you just need to go
through this
nice clean cuts
you don't need any strengths just like
you slice it lightly
but your new shiroi hana night you will
cut slice and dice with joy share this
joy with your friends family and loved
ones
