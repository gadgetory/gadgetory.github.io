in the bathroom are you brushing your
teeth you can always douse the brush in
liquid chemicals concentrated cleaning
powders or a myriad of cleaning sprays
but now there's a better way introducing
lumi the first-ever self sanitizing
toilet brush and base lumi uses UV light
technology to kill germs and fight
bacteria for you 3 UV lights are
situated on the inner circle that
provides surround lighting to reach
every bristle top-to-bottom the inside
of the base also has a specialized
coating that reflects the germ killing
wavelength of the UV light the smart
base recognizes when the brush has been
returned to storage and automatically
begins the cleaning cycle it's so easy
even a child can understand it UV light
is mutagenic direction molecular bonds
in microorganism all DNA producing
thymine dimers at kilometres hospitals
use this UV light technology to clean
rooms surgical instruments and even the
air now we're bringing that same
technology to your home the holder keeps
the brush out of sight when you're not
using it and allows the UV lights to
totally surround the brush killing all
the little nasties the smart base also
has moisture evaporating vents that
provide drainage to a hidden evaporation
pan so the brush can dry quickly
allowing the UV lights to work even more
effectively the Lummi brush is also a
step above the rest with antimicrobial
bristles that are super strong and a
reinforced high-density polyethylene
handle you'll find cleaning quick easy
and comfortable it comes with a
replaceable head so you can use your
