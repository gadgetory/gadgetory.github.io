Honeywell has been known as a trusted
reliable and innovative brand for
decades in the security space here in
over 150 million homes globally we're
also the market leader installing over
15 million systems annually we need to
provide simple elegant solution that our
consumers are excited to experience are
excited to interact with and excited to
bring as part of their daily lives as
Honeywell enters a brand new DIY space
with our smart home security system
we're making available security and
peace of mind to a segment of consumers
that have never had access to it before
we wanted to create a new kind of
experience in security one that's really
built around awareness in the home and
it's really built around our digital
first lifestyles we were thinking about
a busy mom she's working an extra shift
at the hospital how does she know that
everything's fine at home
Honeywell smart home security system is
different in a few ways one it's about
awareness first and what that means is
it's really about knowing what's
happening at home who's coming home
what's going on there while you're away
it is truly an all-in-one solution
we've got HD camera that night-vision
two-way audio we've got motion and sound
detection alerts we have Alexa building
we have facial detection through our app
beacon connected to all of the major
ecosystems keeping you safe is a core
job of this so it does it in a few ways
one is obviously if you set the system
to a way and someone opens your door and
will trigger no alarm when it detects
motion it'll make sounds that simulate
people are home and then thirdly it's
your eyes and ears in the home it starts
with the base station that has a camera
you combine that with a suite of sensors
and then the motion viewers which are
really unique because not only can they
detect motion but they also record
what's happening so you get a video clip
so if someone does come into your home
you can see livestream on your camera
someone's in there so smart home
security system was designed to be a
completely hands-free experience so when
you come in you just look at the base
station it recognizes you and your
family and it automatically switches
from a way to home motion viewers are
these cool little things so they're a
wireless battery-operated motion sensor
that has a video camera in it so anytime
there's any activity detected
you always can see what's happening from
what we've seen this is the first market
of a product of this kind
we've built Amazon Alexa right in and
over time we're looking forward to
offering a choice of voice assistance
its Siri Google or whatever's right for
your family we wanted to create
something that wouldn't lock a customer
in but would actually be an expansive
platform over time smart home security
suitable for the whole family anyone
who's got a phone can use it anyone who
can pick up the key fob can use it and
it knows when you're home and when
you're away so it switches modes
automatically if you want you can open
the app and make all sorts of settings
changes but basically come and go as you
please and the system works it's modular
its scalable it's adaptable it's a bit
like family life
most importantly it can be installed by
yourself and you can control all these
things now we're using one app or your
voice and in addition to that it's made
by a company that's been innovating for
over a hundred years and we feel like we
have a real shot at delivering the right
all-in-one solution for home IndieGoGo
is really exciting for us this is the
first time Honeywell has done anything
like it's a new experience for us we
hope that you're excited about what
we've shared with you today and we look
forward to working with you and learning
about how we can take a great product
and make it something that's amazing for
the future
