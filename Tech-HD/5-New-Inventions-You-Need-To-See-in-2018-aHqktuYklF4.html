yes lie awake at night and wonder why in
a world where cars can drive themselves
I still didn't have a pair of pantyhose
that could get me through the day so I
decided to do
thing about it actually genius we set
out to answer the call of a generation
bringing you the world's first pair of
indestructible sheer pantyhose that can
hold up to whatever life throws at you
like the velcro on this jacket this
diamond engagement ring this rugby
player and this three month old puppy
before surely genius used up two options
when it came to pantyhose thick
pantyhose that while they may last are
made for the north pole or sheer
pantyhose which you're lucky if you got
a couple wears out of say goodbye to
your clear nail polish our pantyhose
have been rigorously tested in our lab
and by women around the world to last up
to 50 wears and help you avoid those Oh
moments like when I break a nail taking
care of my two-year-old and I become a
velociraptor or when I'm at work my
pantyhose rip in the bathroom sometimes
I don't have time to shave and the
nylons get stuck in my whiskers it turns
out that designing the world's first
pair of sheer pantyhose that doesn't rip
or tear is no easy feat after testing
dozens of fibers that would tear as he
took them off the spool I turned to the
fibers used in products like climbing
equipment and bulletproof vests while
they were definitely strong there were a
few problems they were too thick they
didn't stretch and they weren't diable
the fibers were so strong they were
breaking the pantyhose machines
oh no the machine is she break again not
to mention there are some of the most
expensive fibers in the world think a
thousand times more expensive than nylon
so we set out to build a fiber that can
meet our needs and the needs of women
around the world our proprietary fiber
is up to ten times stronger than steel
lighter than water and bacteria
resistant so how do we figure out how to
dye it and make it stretch without
breaking the machines
let's just say we figured it out and
it's top secret
pic she wears in one pair of surely
genius pantyhose would take 25 pairs of
the other guy's pantyhose our pantyhose
stretch and move with you and come with
a comfortable Zig free waistband and
will deliver your surely genius
pantyhose in this stylish multi-use
non-disposable wash bag and you'll need
it because you'll be wearing your surely
genius pantyhose again and again and

money-back guarantee we're ready to go

manufacturing as soon as we hit our goal

make it happen surely genius
indestructible pantyhose truly
indestructible panic

genius pantyhose supporting our CEO from
