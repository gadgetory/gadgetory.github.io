the reasons why area is so popular are
clear it is extremely light extremely
powerful very compact and you can use it
on any existing bike the only downside
of a friction roller Drive is this it
can be quite noisy however the new
generation of Eddy will sound more like
this and that's not the result of our
sound engineer playing around the volume
control it's the result of a solid
one-year Austrian engineering process
that has left to 90% noise reduction
like in the previous version of Eddy
there's no friction in standby mode in
all mode you can choose between five
support levels once you pedal ready
start within half a second if you stop
pedaling Eddy stops automatically one
battery can last up to four hours in
constant use and can be exchanged or
charged easily another big step forward
of this wireless sensors not only
because they're much more sensitive but
to make the installation so easy no
matter which bike you're using
in case you still want help with the
installation we do have an extensive and
permanent growth support network we are
so proud of this new generation of
