change the whole notion of what a hand
sanitizer should be and we have created
life-changing products that will empower
people to be fearlessly as they interact
with the world studies show that over
80% of infectious diseases are
transmitted by touch so we created an
effective and convenient way to stay

existing hand sanitizers

designers engineers and cosmetic experts

technology and the highest quality
ingredients deliver the most unique and
pleasing sanitization experience touch

water savings our touchless dispenser
provides for a more sustainable and
economic sanitization system saving
almost two litres of water with every
use while delivering more than 1500
doses per cartridge for the on-the-go
urban lifestyle we've created the most

perfect travel mate and comes in eight
fabulous fragrances and it's designed to
avoid leaking or spilling in your bag or

this is cub and cub to go power missed
by touch land now we need your help to
fund us on our first Kickstarter
campaign to bring thousand products to
market please support us by trying our
wonderful products
the idea for a smart wallet came about
when one of our friends
he keeps living things then we found out
about the Bluetooth low-energy beacons
that started to come about on the market
and so we thought how about we make a
wallet with a Bluetooth low-energy that
is connected to a phone and and that way
you can't lose it having the experience
from the past
I decided actually to use crowdfunding
to raise money for this particular
project
we set ourselves a goal of $15,000 which
we thought will be large enough for us
to start this project and not big not
too big so we can't actually deliver on
it once the campaign started we saw that
there was a very large amount of people
who were really excited about that
product within a couple of days
we blew over our initial amount that we
wanted to raise we were very excited we
are over the moon media were asking us
about the project
everybody was were really interested
into how we how we wanna how we gonna do
it when we can deliver it we also need
to remember that we were just a team of
a few people we were never prepared for
this scale of a project
at this point we we are ready to deliver
a product that we are really father
you
we were lost it was close to midnight we
had all of our belongings on us and it
was starting to look like we'd be
spending the night on the streets of
Bogota on that night in Colombia Flynt
who was born when was the last time your
phone let you down did you need to call
a loved one or get an uber out of a
dodgy night spot or you like us stranded
without maps or a hotel address the
solution to this common problem isn't a
chunky power pack that's just sitting at
home when you need it most
the right solution needs to be
pocket-sized and versatile introducing
