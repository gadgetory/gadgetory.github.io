everyone and makes your workout a joy no
matter how often and how intense you
cycle we all know those dreaded problems
that find you when you least expect them
and when you are least prepared flat
tires two years ago we brought you the
milk it valve system which allows you to
measure and refill sealant in tubeless
tires without releasing the air and
receive overwhelming support from our
backers tubeless tires are a great
alternative to regular tires for many
reasons but we know how difficult they
can be to inflate after talking to our
supporters we realized that there was
one main problem remaining with Taurus
tires they don't have a compressor or
high end tubeless pump at home a one to
avoid having to go to the gas station or
a bike shop to inflate their tires we
decided it's time for our second product
and invented the milk it's booster we
built many booster prototypes in the
past year and they worked very
effectively now we've turned these early
versions into an out of the box solution
with a great design one of the main
advantages of the milk it booster is how
easy it is to use remove the valve core
inflate the booster press the booster on
the valve
done
with its lightweight and small size the
milky booster is an ideal companion to
bring along on your ride it can be used
with any kind of tubeless tire or valve
with or without the valve core installed
the booster works with any tubeless
valve but it works best with the milk it
valves which through their dual valve
system keep the air in the tire even
before you replace the valve core by
supporting our campaign you will help
financing the expensive manufacturing
tools and you'll be among the first to
receive the milky tubers booster and
you'll experience how easy it can be to
inflate that you was tire the milk it
booster is easier to handle more
efficient lighter and less expensive
than any product on the market and there
is one more thing the booster bottles
can be used as drinking bottles that you
carry in your backpack or in your bottle
cage with the additional drinking kit
you get two in one booster and drinking
system both in your backpack milk it we
keep making tubeless easy
think your kids are too young to learn
to code think again learning to code
prepares kids for the world we live in
today and it doesn't need to be
complicated introducing robopal the
world's first programmable transformer
robot via magnetic coding blocks robopal
turns complex coding languages into fun
and hands-on games it teaches kids the
concepts of programming in an easy and
creative way combined the magnetic
coding blocks to create commands for the
robot and transform it into anything
that you can imagine there are three
types of coding blocks that come with
robopal action blocks for specific
movements such as moving forward or
backward function blocks for sounds time
and accessories control and logic blocks
that creates more complicated coding
languages such as loop if or etc here is
how it works
choose and combine the magnetic coated
blocks to build a program connect the
blocks to the robot press Start to run
the program let's say we want to make
this robopal shake so we need to turn
left for 0.1 seconds and then right for
another 0.1 seconds and a repeat block
tells it to repeat the movement robopal
also has 10 USB ports with those
different accessories we can create
infinite possibilities with accessories
robopal can send a signal avoid
obstacles follow the tracks
since the edge of the table to prevent
falling off and will automatically stop
when obstacles are detected execute many
complex tasks compatible with Lego
robopal can be transformed to many
different objects it's also a great
choice for family time with 14 different
digital facial expressions and 15
different voices robopal is your kid's
best buddy
sharing the best moments while growing
up and taking care of your family
members robopal comes with manuals with
stories and fun tutorial videos that
teach kids different levels of
programming concepts robopal is not just
a toy it's a real robot for kids and
adults here's the best part
Robo pal will help you make new friends
what are you waiting for start building
your world with Robo pal
inspired by mountain goats and the
exceptional climbing ability clip ax is
a prosthetic leg designed specifically
for amputee rock climbers as unique
features augment human capabilities and
challenge the limitations of existing
prosthetic legs belong equities to climb
securely efficiently uncomfortably while
standard prosthetic legs are designed
for walking during adequate the needs of
climbers they lack the flexibility
articulation and small footprint
required for rock climbing
during my research and testing stage I
interviewed experienced - like climbers
to understand how their legs move and
how they stabilize their bodies on the
wall I also try out some blue foam
stilts to understand how he feels when
there's no sensory feedback coming from
feature these testings allow me to look
at the design challenges in a bigger
scope and give me a better idea of how
to redesign prosthetic legs to make him
more suitable for climbing when I
started brainstorming and sketching
different iterations on a design I was
inspired by both human anatomy and
nature especially mountain goats after a
few rounds of prototyping I was able to
integrate my lucid all comes into my
design finally came up with a final
prototype creepox
has four major features that help
amputee climbers to overcome the
disadvantages the first feature is a
small shoe with a pointy toe and a
textured feel the shoe is spa half the
size of an average human foot which
makes it easier for user to stand on
small surfaces climber can apply the
pointy toe to watch their foot and
perform heel strike with a textured heel
the bottom of the sole is inspired by
mountain goats whose structure under
pressure the coupe-like soul contracts
and pushes outward saving energy for
climbers the shoe and shin guard are
made of heart robber that provides
protection they are also detachable so
climbers can replace them easily
according to different climate
conditions
lastly khlifa comes with a pivoted joint
that provides proper ankle articulation
the ankle has internal spring that's
attached to elastic cord and ankle
pivots when a pressure is applied to the
tip of foot and the internal spring and
elastic core brings the foot right back
to its original position
the elasticity of the ankle provides
shops washing and saves energy
after finishing my first round finalized
prototype I was very fortunate to get in
contact with adaptive climbing I went to
one of their training sessions and
presented my work to several entities
climbers during our conversation I also
found out a few details I need to
include the pump such as how to attach
my design to an existing socket and how
to adjust height but these problems
helping solve in a current prosthetics
and only hard to integrate them into my
design my next step is to collaborate
application and infrastructure build a
custom working prototype flippa is
currently still concept hopefully it
will come to market one day and benefit
not just the NPC veterans but any
amputees out there who want to give
rock-climbing a try
