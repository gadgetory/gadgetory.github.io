what we want to do is bring this
physical experience of music the energy
the impact that you get at a concert or
club into the real world where you can
have it everywhere and anytime you want
bass is really the part of the music
that connects you to the music
physically in a club you get that big
energy from a big sound system if you
put on the music the next day and you
just have headphones on you're just
missing that part whatever music you're
listening to it adds a physical element
to it which is something that you're
totally missing normally in a home
listening or on-the-go environment
people are pushing the envelope of what
I can get out of those big systems with
the way that they make it music when we
put put the based on someone's arm and
we turn on the music and soon as the
beat kicks in they have this big smile
on their face because it really pulls
you into the music you listen to it but
you can also feel it in your body oh
nice it's just so intense this song is
going like more and more aggressive sort
of on a base and you wouldn't think that
you know the same pace and you know the
same intensity that the base that would
be able to match it but it is that's
pretty red so I got think I can feel the
kick drum which is nice and then likely
in the sustained bass notes commission I
think that's really the power of it is
the ability to get that you know tactile
physical immersion that you get with
like sub bass and yet in the end it was
just fun I didn't want to take it off
you know
the baselet has very high fidelity it
matches exactly the waveform of the base
that we're trying to reproduce for us
the main challenge was no technology
existed that could do this in such a
small size so we had to create our own
can differentiate between this melodic
baseline and hard kicks so even if the
music is a melody and a kick in between
you can feel the difference the drums
you can actually kind of feel like toms
and cake and stuff that I felt bit more
like those in the room with it inside
the baselet is amazing technology we've
built our own haptic engine which takes
up roughly half the space we've got the
other half which is battery to give a
really long play time and we've managed
to squeeze the electrons around the
battery and the haptic engine so there's
hardly any room for the electronics and
it was a tough job to get it into this
size the base layer is really designed
as an everyday companion you can hook it
up to a smartphone to a computer you can
hook it up to a laptop or a VR headset
you can really use it with anything that
you would use for for listening to music
for playing games or watching movies the
base that's designed to be really easy
to use you just plug and play basically
there's no app to load there's no
software to configure ideally in the
morning you leave the house you put it
on you put on your headphones when you
come you to war when you're at work
whenever you want to listen to music out
and about I think that's when the basic
comes in bass actually has a really
powerful energizing impact on you I
think it's going to be great when you
add about jogging or doing sports that
it really elevates you to kind of
activates you and keeps you going one of
the cool things about the basis is that
it hooks up to anything that has a
headphone outfit and so what I tried
right away is hooking up to a
synthesized and you play a bass line and
suddenly you have that physical impact
or bass you can feel the beats of the
music you're creating and if you're DJ
you can also use the baselet to get a
sense of how the music will feel on a
big sound system in a club as well as
for music lovers I'm really making the
basic for myself I want to use it
everyday and
we're already at this stage and I'm
really really happy with that music is
certainly the most important content in
people's lives so whatever chance I have
to make that experience better I'm gonna
going to use it i'm gonna jump in it I
wouldn't take it off to be honest
you
Oh
you
