capture your own funny moments although
tracking is critical

Carroll is an auto tracking device to
control econ that are always keep you in
a frame
all you need to do is put on the
infrared tag and leave the rest to taro

Mario's father could work
hi I'm Chad Rick I've been investing in
cryptocurrency for the last five years
the recent Bitcoin exchange hacks
reminds me it's no longer safe to store
my bitcoins in other people's platforms
so I started to try using Bitcoin
wallets to secure my digital assets
I have tried both hot and cool wallets
on the market and this is what I found
most of the cryptocurrency wallets were
designed way back when digital currency
was invented which means they are either
out-of-date user unfriendly or lacked
basic functionality many do not even
support iOS and most importantly they
are not as secure as they claim so
that's why I invented whoo food the
world's most secure cryptocurrency
hardware walk gufu includes a waterproof
cryptocurrency smart hardware wallet
that secures your private keys and a
mother box that charges your wallet
wirelessly while storing your signature
in case your hardware wallet gets lost
or stolen
that's cryptocurrency owners know your
private keys are unique and must be
secured at all times to prevent theft of
your currency no matter how unprotected
your computer or internet connection is
as long as your private key is safe your
digital assets are safe existing wallets
can't totally isolate the signing step
from the Bitcoin network even USB
connection hardware wallets can be
hacked if your computer is connected to
the Internet during the transaction gufu
on the other hand signs your transaction
completely offline to achieve that hoop
who sends the encrypted transaction data
via Bluetooth 4.0 which makes the
transaction virtually
the entire signing process only takes
about two seconds each wallet remembers
the unique Bluetooth MAC address that
only belongs to your cell phone you
first created your wallet with hufo so
your wallet can never be paired with any
other phones most wallets are still
using the old generation chips which has
been hacked many times
fufu uses a unique highly encrypted
security X chip to provide another level
of security to protect your transaction
ditch the complicated password wallets
khufu lets you access your wallet using
your highly secure yet simple and fast
fingerprint and face recognition
meanwhile the two-factor authentication
ensures only you can use the access and
in wallet app now let me show you how
whoo food works step 1
turn on your Bluetooth setting pair your
phone with your wallet step 2
login with your fingerprint step 3 put
in the address of the person receiving
your coins and the amount you would like
to send then press send step 4 now the
wallet signs a transaction in an
isolated environment and then sends the
transaction data back to blockchain
step 5 after the transaction being
approved by blockchain buffa will tell
you your transaction has successfully
gone through as soon as the transaction
completes the wallets Bluetooth
connection automatically terminates to
keep everything safe and the best thing
is your private keys are never held or
known by who foo or any other third
party Phu Phu is transparent backdoor
free and very easy to use it is a
digital currency wallet that supports
multi currency multiple crypto
currencies Bitcoin ethereum and litecoin
with who Fu's real-time crypto currency
price monitor you can invest more wisely
phoo phoo keeps your private key in the
hardware wallet and never exposes it the
mother box lets you recover your backup
private key even if your wallet is lost
or stolen the multiple levels of
security make it impossible for someone
to steal your digital currency
now you don't need to worry about your
digital currency disappear with gufu
your digital assets are totally safe
boop boop the world's most secure wallet
for crypto currencies
