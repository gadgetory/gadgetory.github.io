this little pooch here is 8 years old
and since she was born she's been a
retrieving nut I started by using tennis
racquets and then I went through a
couple tennis rackets and we used
baseball bats and anything we could
possibly hit a ball with so she could
retrieve it and leave us alone for a
couple minutes and then I came across
this product the hyper dog and it's been
fantastic now you can just sit back and
blow tennis balls it brings it back
every time and scoop them up with this
end piece here so when the ball does get
a little slimy you're not getting it on
your hands it's got great accuracy you
can pick wherever you want to shoot it
and the dog can just retrieve all day
without hitting tennis rackets and
baseball bats throwing your arm out

loves it it's hyper dog she sees the
hyper dog come out you like that talk
