are defined by climate maybe you are too
hot on a summer's day and wish you could
take all your clothes off or perhaps you
are too cold during winter and can't
even send a text because your hands are
too shaky from shivering or how about
having this dreaded night sweats and you
can't turn on the air-conditioner or a/c
because your wife has cold feet what is
one to do
introducing that aircon watch the aircon
watch is a new revolutionary product
that will allow you to get that
much-needed thermal satisfaction without
disturbing the soul you can warm
yourself up or cool yourself down even
if you are out in the scorching Sun or
in a frigid winter's night doing any
outdoor activity most times depends on
the temperature and the climate on the
other hand being inside all depends and
if your heater or air conditioner is on
and using up electricity the aircon
watch offers the convenience that you
need by freeing you from an energy
wasting air conditioner but never
limiting you to the outside temperature
and all within the form of a small watch
the human body has a natural body
temperature of 98.6 degrees fahrenheit
but depending on the weather and
external temperature our body responds
by sending a signal to the nervous
system whereby the brain receives the
signal which gives the sensation that we
are feeling at that exact moment but
what if we could change the signal that
our nervous system sends to the brain by
using the aircon watch to generate
pulses of heat or cold with this method
we can make our body start to feel more
aware of the temperatures and thus
stabilize our sensations imagine running
your wrist through a stream of icy or
warm water this is the feeling that you
will get from aircon watch the secret is
in the straps it contains a small device
that has within it our climate con
technology this tiny device will fit on
the inner wrist in an area where the
nerves are closer to the skin surface so
as to allow for maximum transfer of
temperature the watch can be used during
any temperature in the season or any
time zone
if you suffer from night sweats you can
now finally have a cozy night if you
like climbing or outdoor photography
aircon watch could be your best friend
but one of the reasons why we developed
this product was to help women during
menopause menopause often has hot
flashes which can be extremely annoying
to the extent where it becomes painful
but what if you could get some relief
from a small device that emits a
soothing cool temperature the aircon
watch has been tested with more than a
hundred people in using several
prototypes our experienced design team
has worked for more than two years in
research and development to improve
aircon watch and reach the design and
level that we are at today
global warming is gradually destroying
the Earth's entire ecosystem so why not
turn that a/c off and turn on the aircon
watch it most definitely will help keep
your pocket fuller and your body cooler

a Mellon University's national robotics
and engineering centers reconfigurable
wheel track wheels that reconfigure two
triangular tracks to instantly optimize
mobility over different types of terrain
our WTS can change from wheel to track
and back again within two seconds while
the vehicle is in motion
wheels permit fast travel on hard
surfaces while tracks perform better on
soft surfaces for instant improvements
to tactical mobility and maneuverability
on diverse terrains</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
