about the quick convert multi driver
you
it's such a simple idea and the perfect
marriage between existing cutting-edge
technology pun intended and an entirely
new application simply fasten a carbide
insert to the end of a comfortable
handle and voila you have woodpecker's
newest tool the mighty mini scraper this
tool excels at glue removal and is an
effective wood scraper that delivers a
finished quality cut in tight spaces
regular scrapers and sandpaper can't
reach our new mini scraper comes with a
solid carbide insert featuring the
convenience of a blade with four long
lasting sharp edges when an edge is
eventually dulled the problem is easily
cured by simply loosening the screw and
rotating the incertain 90 degrees
furthermore our standard inserts edges
are ground with a slight camber to help
prevent marring your wood surface the
same cambering practice many woodworkers
apply to their hand plane blades and
card scrapers an optional perfectly
square and straightedge insert is also
available
it's the insert to use for dead straight
scraping in 90-degree corners our mini
scrapers rugged carbide blade will pop
the toughest dry glue right off your
work and the mini scraper really shines
removing most glue from the inside
corners of cabinet assemblies and other
boxes when you find dreaded dried glue
in a tight corner our mini scraper will
remove it with ease you can scrape dry
wood using either a pushing or pulling
motion use the pushing motion with the
handle at low angle for an aggressive
bulldozer life cut
to produce a finish quality cut use the
pulling motion with a handle held at a
high angle like 60 degrees on harder
woods and about 40 degrees for softer
woods you can easily clean excess glue
on your scraper with a wet rag and get
this because carbide Steel's are free of
iron the blade won't rust nor will the
super tough polycarbonate handle so get
woodpeckers new mighty mini scraper a
remarkably handy addition to your
toolbox like all woodpeckers woodworking
tools woodpeckers new mighty mini
scraper is manufactured using state of
the art cnc machinery laser fabrication
equipment cutting edge quality control
systems and super precise engraving
machines all located along with our
experienced product engineers in our
growing shop just outside cleveland ohio
in the USA
it takes a lot of nuts to operate all
this stuff a lot of screws ladder bolts
last year I created an entirely new
bicycle multi-tool it's truly unique
perhaps not flexible enough to handle
all these sports travels like a multi
tool but functions like a shop tool
after we launched last year that was the
one thing that I heard hey these are
great tools but call me when they're
replaceable I just need more flexibility
well here it is
fix it sticks replaceable Edition offers
you endless possibilities it's like
choose your own adventures for tools you
need T wrenches you need 3-way wrenches
you need sockets you need screwdrivers
we got it and not just sorta got it like
us multi-tool we deliver a shop quality
experience in virtually any setting
the first product that we're launching
in this campaign is the replaceable
edition of fixed it sticks they're all
made in my hometown and assembled by me
in their garage the magnet is what we're
using are super strong to give a good
quality feel and all the sets go out
with a handmade recycled inner tube
pouch we're also including eight bits
total that are common to bicycles or
most any other sporting equipment in
your garage
the next product that we're hoping to
launch is called the fix-it sticks t way
wrench I'm excited about this product it
covers a lot of ground in the shop
I love going into bike shops and seeing
the wall tools that they have there it
does a lot of stuff but it also costs a
fortune with the fix-it sticks t way
wrench I really need our bits and you
can accomplish virtually any task on a
bike or whatever other sports equipment
you have in your garage you can get a
lot of access using the downstroke where
you can gain a ton of leverage by using
the short cross sections all the ends
are replaceable so it offers a ton of
flexibility so where we know well we're
still in the garage and you know what we
may never leave right now we're going to
launch these two products we have other
ideas but everything starts with these
we have a lot of very simple funding
options available for you and if you
back our project you'll be rewarded with
some of the most versatile tools on the
market today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
