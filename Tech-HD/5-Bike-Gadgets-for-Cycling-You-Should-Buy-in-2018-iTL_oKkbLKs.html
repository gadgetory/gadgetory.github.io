Astor the perfect bag for any commuter
as a commuter cyclist myself I decided
to take control of my own safety at
Lumos we spent months on research and
prototyping and are now production-ready
we have used world-class materials and
we have partnered with quality conscious
manufacturers to bring out the first set
of bags as a company we've been
developing variable Tec for cyclists for
the last 2 years and now bring to you
another fantastic product we need your
support to bring asta to life join us by
supporting our campaign thank you
you
the lamp we are introducing here we call
it radius f1 it's a front bicycle light
and actually it's a smart front bicycle
light one interesting and cool feature
as the Magna Charta we did add to the
system it is really easy to attach and
detach the magnet clip from the lamb
besides us it's really 100% water and
dust proof
yesterday's I know when I started the
project you know I look at the need of
the product and what heat the product
has to fulfill it's so true I think that
the form usually follows the function
another feature is our click turn lock
system with a simple 90 degree turn
you can attach or detach the lamp from
your bike what we think a big
enhancement is a smart light output
function I think that's the biggest
feature because it's a safety feature by
constantly measuring the writing speed
through and build and gyroscope Center
we are capable to adjust the light
output according to your riding speed if
you drive faster you got more light on
the street and if you drive slower you
have less light on the street when you
take a curve the lens starts flashing to
warn income traffic if you come to a red
light and have to stop the lamp also
starts flashing to warn other people on
the street so when it comes to battery
life we did at another smart feature
into our product it's a stop function
means you stop riding your bike the lens
they turn off and you prep your bike to
continue writing the light blue warning
maybe you'll get the piece of extra
energy out of your every light you need
to get home safely you did put some
other cool and unique features in our
product one of it is Bluetooth remote
control which is mounted on the handle
bar right next to your hand and you can
change the light mode of the lamp
without releasing your hand from the
handle bar which we think really adds to
the safety of public traffic with the
radius of one we are at the stage now
where we on the final process for
designing and tooling so in this stage
we decided to start crowdfunding to get
as much as possible feedback from our
potential customer and probably to add
their valuable idea and suggestions into
our product before we really kickoff the
product to the market that's where we
are now so we are in the national team
and creating beautiful and smart and
emotional products for the great
outdoors
you
alright guys as you can see there's
something in my bottom bracket here that
isn't usually there so I thought I'd do
a quick video showing you a multi-tool
that's from Italy
that turned up on my door that I thought
you guys should check out that I feel is
pretty cool and I think a lot of riders
are gonna dig so let's check this thing
out so this is the all-in multi-tool I'm
gonna go ahead and take it out of the
frame here to show you what it is there
you go so you can kind of see it there
so that is the all-in multi-tool out of
the bike hiding on you thought it was
just a black cap II put it back gone so
in the tool we have a 3 4 5 and 6 mm
allen key as well as a t25 torx and a
Phillips screwdriver all of which are
magnetized into the body of it so they
can't fall out they can't go anywhere
and you all you do is take it out turn
that sideways put it in and you're good
to go if we take a look at the top of
the tool here there's four holes these
are designed for putting in replacement
chain links on the trail or at least
that's what their website claims I don't
actually have one to try out but I would
assume based on how magnetic everything
else is on the tool that they would hold
on for dear life quite well the company
makes a couple bold claims as to why you
should buy their tool you know the main
one to me that sticks out versus Italian
craftsmanship and yada yada yada you're
never gonna forget your multi-tool it's
always going to be attached to your bike
via that magnet so you're not you know
if you're just going out with a water
bottle on the on the bike and you oh
 I need to do something and you just
wanted to go for a quick half hour or an
hour or whatever well this is going to
be in your bottom bracket taking up dead
space to be honest with you and having
the spot to put those Quick Links pretty
cool as well just to you know kind of
give yourself that SWAT like level of
advantage out on the trail you know
another thing that a lot of people are
talking about with this tool is how come
it doesn't have a chain
recon it well to me if I want to use
this tool it's gonna be something where
it's gonna be a quick repair on the
trail you know tighten up a stem tighten
up a seat post whatever that is and it's
gonna get you going nice and fast if I
bust a chain I think that you know I'm
gonna have the time to go into my pack
dig out whatever I need to to make that
change on the trail so this isn't
designed for those heavy level repairs
it's just designed for those quick easy
on-the-go repairs so you don't even have
to dig into your pack or conversely
carry one so like I said it's stored in
the bottom bracket so it fits a lot of
the race face Shimano and ceramic cranks
you literally once you put away your
used tool you literally just put it in
into the hole that's what she said I
know but look at the level of magnetism
it has here boom and that's hard to get
out to that's that's in there real good
so yeah exciting to try this out and
check them out online
all-in-one multi-tool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
