integrated for image sensor system all

resulting in shorter safety distance
between the camera and the object

we have chosen it's a pepper high
resolution hundred light
degree fish islands which provides
excellent image quality and outperforms
those spot camera resolutions a full
metal housing is used to improve heat
dissipation resulting in much longer
continuous recording there are two power
options an AC DC power adapter socket
and a detachable battery unit using 18
650 standard lithium ion rechargeable
battery cells image files are stored on
SD cards in addition to the four
individual HDMI ports there is an
Gigabit Ethernet port which allows not
only easy and fast image file transfer
but also life will possibility through
external solutions and since we provide
full set open a PR expert users we found
this extremely useful because they can
remotely control s1 through the Ethernet
we think professional we our cameras
should be more sophisticated than
traditional cameras we have developed a
special algorithm to coordinate auto
white balance and auto exposure of all
four sensors resulting in more
harmonized images
