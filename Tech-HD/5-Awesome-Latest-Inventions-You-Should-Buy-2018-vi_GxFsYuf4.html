meet the first helmet designed by former
SpaceX engineers and a super collapsible
form factor the helmet implements
next-generation materials and looks like
a baseball hat
my sister is riding her bike through the
intersection of Park and Diamond when
she was hit by a car
she spent the next four months in a coma
as two engineers we knew that if we put
our heads together we could do something
about this problem
how much aren't worn because they're
uncomfortable and inconvenient
people don't want to carry around huge
chunks of foam it became more important
now than ever that helmet that's
comfortable attractive portable and safe
make sure the helmet is as safe as
possible we've done thousands of impact
tests in our lap and not only does our
helmet meet all of the federal
regulations it surpasses that bike share
programs are growing at over 25% year
over year more Americans are taking a
bike to work than they ever have before
there's millions of people out there
that need a product like ours the
portability of being able to roll up the
helmet allows you to easily carry it
with you and best of all provide the
same or better protection as any
traditional helmet there's a really
broad future for Park and Diamond the
styles and options are limitless we're
positioned to protect as many people as
possible
with your support we'll be able to
protect millions of bike commuters every
day please go to park and diamond comm
and pre-order now for my entire
childhood I was always moving whether it
was skateboarding riding my bike or
playing with my friends I was always in
motion now as an adult I sit most of my
days sitting 8 9 sometimes 10 hours a
day this is one of the reasons why I
created the Casper board I needed to get
back to moving again the cat's reward is
the first active platform that double
does both the sitting footrest and a
standing balance board to promote
movement throughout the day the ball
housings on either side of the board
allow users to move the board freely in
any direction increasing their overall
activity throughout the day I feel like
by having my feet constantly moving it
keeps me thinking and keeps me focused
at work I'm able to move twist slide
roll whatever I want to do because I was
moving and blood was circulating and
everything I felt better throughout the
day
what's great about it is that it's easy
to adapt to a sitting or standing
position so whether I'm sitting at my
desk or using my standing desk it works
equally well my name is Cameron Klein
I'm the chief fitness officer for Casper
board lack of blood flow is one of the
biggest problems currently that people
are dealing with by sitting at their
desk all day lack of flexibility lack of
mobility all these things cause a chain
reaction and what ends up happening is
you see your health deteriorating and
sometimes you're not even really sure
why it's happening and if you're not
moving you're not being healthy and the
cow sort of allows you to add that to
your life the board easily converts to a
balanced board with a snap on
dome-shaped base which creates some
instability while standing activating
the core through small but regular
moving moving around a little bit more
just being able to stand kind of just
loosened up the body and I loved it my
cast board is a game changer I take it
with me everywhere I bring it into
meetings I have it at my desk for
someone that wants to at least try to be
more active this thing is amazing let's
keep the movement going with your help
we can launch Casper boards by the end
of the year
