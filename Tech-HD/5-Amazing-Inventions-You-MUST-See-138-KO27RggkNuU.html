easily notice creations that are crafted
with precision and perfection their
design connects intimately with our
feelings and body contour thus catering
for our desire and behavior among these
creations many are technological
innovations to our regret some of these
creations are fading out
one of them is MagSafe
after considerable time and effort in
research and development we resolved to
resurrect MagSafe a Dias design by Steve
Jobs but we don't stop there we adapt
magazine to the functionality of modern
gadgets
making it the only design on the market
that encapsulates three technologies
MagSafe USBC and thunderbolt three
this needs with only one connector and
one port it can provide superfast data
transfer and high-resolution video up
Italy captures the comfort brought by
magazine at the same time retaining the
benefits of us DC and Thunderbolt 3 for
all your USB C devices also on the team
is a renowned manufacturer whose
expertise was recognized in many other
successful Kickstarter projects such as
pebble time and Dropcam they help us
ensure quality and feasibility so why do
we call ourselves magazine maxi stands
for magic continue it is our aspiration
to bring back the magic of Steve Jobs
and to continue his dedication in
empathetic and human focused designs we
hope to take our next step with you
support us in breathing new life in
MagSafe claim your discounted price by
clicking back this project make your
pledge now and we will see you on the
other side
and
Oh
hey Kickstarter's two years ago you made
history by backing the splash drone the
first waterproof drone that can float
and take pictures and video underwater
and to the air today we're back on
Kickstarter to bring you the much more
advanced splash drone free auto and
fisherman edition the splash drone is
now modular and comes with a 4k
detachable camera and a stronger payload
release system to deliver your bait or
payload over water if you have a drone
you know what it feels like to fly over
water and if you still don't you've
probably seen video of the thousands of
drones that have crashed in the water to
never be seen again our goal is to
change the way you fly by removing the
fear of flying over water or even land
on it the new camera captures 4k video
at 25 frames per second and 14 megapixel
pictures
the gimbal has stronger motors for
better stable video underwater and in
the air
it also has a quick-release clip that
allows you to store your splash drone in
this redesigned compact travel case
we've also redesigned the flight
controller to make it more stable and
reposition the GPS to provide more
accurate location hold while still
giving you features that make flying
easier than ever
features like return to home at the flip
of a switch Waypoint navigation Follow
Me mode and tap to fly to a specific
location on the map all features that
can be accessed on the swell pro mobile
app available for Android and iOS
devices the splash drone fishermen
Edition now comes with a completely
redesigned payload release system that's
equipped with a high-resolution fixed
camera that allows you to see where
you're dropping your bait or fly vest by
redesigning the remote control from the
ground up we were able to integrate a
high-resolution video monitor with an
on-screen display that shows the health
of the splash drone and vibrates to
alert you when the battery's running low
the entire propulsion system has also
been re-engineered for more stable and
longer flights and the quick lock
propellers allow it to fly in up to 35
miles an hour today we're coming back to
Kickstarter and hope that you can help
us continue the dream of delivering the
best splash drone yet thanks
are you still shooting unsteady videos
with your phone capture smooth and
steady cinematic videos at a breeze with
free jet simply slide in your phone or
GoPro and turn it on and all the
creation is at your fingertips for many
stabilisers it is impossible to record
videos using the underslung position
without rotating the portrait mode read
yet is the only stabilizers they can
continue to record the video in this
position with it's easy to use control
panel you can easily switch between
photos and video mode front and rear
camera and zoom in and out free jet can
also charge your phone or even better
plug a power bank so you can charge
Ridgid and your phone simultaneously so
that you can use our apps to livestream
all day within the region app we built
an auto track function simply drag any
object on the screen and read yet we'll
take over create amazing slow motion and
time-lapse videos
shoot amazing panorama photos with regen
with a total of three different panorama
modes you can even shoot better photos
than any other stabilizer you had Ridge
yet is the most advanced stabilizer to
capture your life
you
the magpie is the smartest tracking
device in the world
it's a rechargeable very very cheap unit
with over a hundred countries available
support tracking
before starting magpie I worked on
several projects I built the car onto
Legos build my own jet propelled bicycle
I've also launched people into outer
space or under self-knowledge
someone showed me the video once I saw
it and once I met roll and you we have
to find a way to put something together
a primary driver for me is is moving
away from the world I'm creating
products and experiences for big
companies that don't necessarily add any
value to the world with my fire we
definitely want to build something that
actually improves people's lives
something that is always there always on
you don't have to even think about your
facility but whenever you need it it's
there for you I kept reading about
people going missing and you obviously
see if you walk around neighborhood
going missing
this is one of these tiny little
problems that seems to perpetuate in the
world and that essentially how we got to
magpie it's removing those moments of
anxiety and tension seamlessly with a
simple piece of technology Magn pliers
built to last
it's rechargeable has a long lasting
battery and it's waterproof and
dustproof it's based on GPS technology
which essentially unlocks the world
that's the main differentiator between
Bluetooth device which is 30 50 maybe
100 feet and something is powered by GPS
that sits on top of a cell Metro so the
Kickstarter really is the beginning of a
larger vision we want to bring on people
who can be part of the community to
evolve this product into what it could
be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
