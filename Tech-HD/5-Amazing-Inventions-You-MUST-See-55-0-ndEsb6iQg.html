everyday objects of our lives are
constantly evolving phones have become
handheld computers cars are smarter and
cleaner watches have turned into
personal assistants but what about our
shoes we spend most of our lives wearing
them but besides fashion designs they
have seen little evolution in the last
few decades we bend over to tie them to
untie them they come undone they get
stuck in our bike chain we leave the
laces tied all the time and damage our
shoes sure we have velcro shoes and
zippers but you still have to bend over
and they don't fit nearly as firmly as
good old laces at power lace we wanted
to figure out a way to create shoes that
fit firmly and comfortably without ever
having to lace or unlace them we decided
to think differently and we found a
solution we are proud to introduce the
p1 our new Auto lacing system allows for
efficient hands-free shoelace tying the
first time you wear them slide your foot
even adjust the tension once and you're
set you'll never have to bend over again
to take off the shoes use your other
foot to press down on the back lever
it's that simple it's a nice product
it's a very streamlined it's not bulky a
thin sole lot of companies have big
bulky Souls Kevlar lace on any products
and definite advantage been working in
the street for 25 years and see two
pairs of killers is broken power lace
shoes will simplify tasks of everyday
life allowing you to take advantage of a
snug shoe fit while on the go
in my 15 years in the footwear industry
I've never seen such a innovation they
are comfortable they are very stable too
so I think it's amazing our shoes are
made of the very best materials and
combined proven shoe design with our
innovative technology we have working
prototypes and have met with
manufacturers we are ready to start
production
our very first men's shoe the p1 will
soon be available in many different
colors help us make auto lacing shoes a
reality pre-order your pair today and
become a power laser
everyone knows that cleaning a whisk is
a pain whisk wiper makes whisking easy
insert the whisk and whisk wiper taking
a moment to line up the loops then whisk
away it keeps the loops up off the
counter and it even catches drips you
can rest the whisk on the edge of the
bowl or on the edge of the sink when
you're done instead of washing all of
that food and water down the drain
simply pull whisk wiper off and return
ninety five percent of the food to the
bowl but that's not all save every last
bit using this wiper to wipe out the
bowl it even gets square corners whisk
wiper is a real time-saver more hygienic
and makes whiskey easy
