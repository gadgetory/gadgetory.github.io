the tips the shortcuts what to pack
how to pack you know the airport the
right hotel you have the right tools
right attitude but one thing you can't
control or wrinkled clothes sure you can
pack your clothes nicely like a pro but
when you check-in one thing is certain
your clothes are wrinkled right when you
need good morning meet you in 20 minutes
sure but travel pros know how to use
steam from the shower to relax the
wrinkles but have you noticed it's hard
to find a good secure place to hang your
clothes near the shower steam and what
if you end up with the dreaded bald top
hanger they aren't useless out of the
closet hello road warriors my name is
Randy Blevins and I'm the creator of
steam clip I came up with the idea after
many years of traveling especially on
business would had to look my best but I
was short on time
steam clip is a multi tool designed to
steam away wrinkles simply hang steam
clip near the steam from your shower and
use it with all types of hotel hangers
the micro hook the regular hook and even
the dreaded ball top steam clip works
with them all and this is important it
works on all shower types to standard
shower curtain and rod small glass walls
or even thick walls with trim where you
simply flip steam clip upside down and
it still works with steam clip you know
you can steam Rickles and ditch the
dirty iron I know that space in your
carry-on is valuable real estate and
when traveling the struggle is real so
steam clip is also a multi-tool for
travel it's a bottle opener a thread and
tag cutter and even a smartphone stand
you can even use it to keep your jacket
or purse off the restroom floor in the
airport and much more save time steam
wrinkles be prepared in the hotel and on
the go
for decades our ideas have been bound by
the borders of the whiteboard locked
inside an office only to be erased and
lost forever

over introducing the think board X
powered by rocket book for the past four
years we've been converting surfaces of
all shapes and sizes into a creative
writing surface but why stop there

our team to visit rocket book labs to
blend think board with rocket book
technology we took the awesome and think
board and added the magic of rocket book
technology together we've combined the
ease of a peel-and-stick whiteboard with
the simplicity of the rocket book app

stick whiteboard built for the digital
age designed with the same special
coatings and adhesives found in our
premium films the think board X will
peel stick write and erase with the
quality you'd expect from a premium
grade whiteboard the think board X is
also powered by the rocket book app so
