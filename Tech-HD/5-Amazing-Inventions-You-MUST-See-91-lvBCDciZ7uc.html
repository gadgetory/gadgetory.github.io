energy lies around you in a forest in
the woods and all the wasted and find
you ever wish you could use the energy
instead of carrying uncomfortable gas
tanks or find ignite a bonfire they're
definitely charming but there's also
smoky and dangerous
now you can stop reading about it
because we made it real thank you so
wild is a revolutionary chemical which
because none with any kind of dry
biomass on you to some branches small
batteries or even a solar panel what
makes all the magic possible the
well-known technology names pyrolysis
but unlike traditional pyrolytic though
we found a way to make the process
simple stable smoke free and totally
also take a traditional fire it burns
strongly but a waste a lot of energy and
smoke of smoke itself has a lot of
energy what we do is transform all the
biomass into energy this way you get a
clean and reliable claimed wherever you
want and for free yes free energy I'm
talking about a powerful and
professional plane you can use to cook
for real and grill as a pro do you know
which is the best part of all this using
your stove you're not only saving the
environment all the waste produced by
the gas tanks or the production of
charcoal you're also avoiding the
production of any pollution responsible
for the greenhouse effect the wait
there's more what remains inside your
stove when the fire is gone is a
wonderful biochar an incredible active
charcoal that makes the ground better
and more force out we designed our stove
to be the best companion or their
outdoor adventure it is minimal this
compact and all the design features are
strictly linked to its operation we made
it in two sizes to let you choose
between portability and personal use or
base camp and a lot of power everything
is made in Italy using the best
materials to create a product that is
really gonna last forever thank you
stole Wild has been made to let you live
your adventures with a deeper context of
nature environment is our greatest
treasure in taking care of it is no
longer a privilege for an important duty
with ank you stole Wild you can do your
part in saving our planet by taking no
compromise

problems after a long day of shopping in
the mall can't remember where your last
part or when you've gone to a new
building and can't figure out which door
to exit to find your car so we came up
with a solution thanks to bluetooth
smart we've developed an embedded system
to detect exactly when you turn off the
engine this is yeah the vle smart
parking the app uses your car's battery
as the power supply so when you turn off
the engine the app detects it and
automatically pinpoints your car's
location on your smartphone and wicked

meter so you won't forget that you're
running out of time it also helps you

exelon the first fully autonomous
irrigation solution for your home this
is how it work the system keeps your
plants healthy by providing them the
exact amount of water they need and it
does it without any user intervention
our wireless water pressure sensors are
easily installed in your backyard near
some of your plans they report to the
valve switch the water pressure levels
in a soil of the relevant backyard
section the valance which connected to
the electronic irrigation valve
transmits all this data to our cloud
server which in turn calculates blend
and how much water each section of the
backyard needs the server replies with
commands to the valve switch for
execution starting and stopping
irrigation of each section of your
backyard this is how our system closes
the total autonomous loop of irrigation
using the most accurate data from your
plan
you can easily set up and monitor our
systems using iOS and Android
applications or web interface it took us
three mo development into investment
sounds to create the system for the
professional fireman the uniqueness of
the system is its ability to create a
water absorption profile for any plans
and to irrigate it economist who have
sunset all our success and experience in
agriculture into the excellent system
and made it fully autonomous for you it
means saving time and money while giving
the best care plan no more irrigating

psychologists call it the flow state if
my feeling of being completely absorbed
in your task work Phil's effortless time
passes quickly nothing can stop you but
in a world where we're more distracted

impossible introducing mindset the
world's first headphones specifically
designed to maximize your productivity

cuffs and crisp resonant sound we put
them on they create the perfect work
environment mindset actively cancels out
external noise unless you temporarily
mute incoming notifications but while
other headphones stop here my sec goes
one step further while you work de Jesus
is embedded in the headband read your
brain activity in real-time using his
brain computer interface mindset
recognizes when you're in a state of
concentration whenever you become
distracted my sight sends you a gentle
to bring you back to focus research
shows that takes 15 to 20 minutes to
refocus after becoming distracted with
mindset we'd reduce this to second
studies also show that were
significantly less productive once our
brain becomes fatigued mindset sensors
can detect these dips and attention and
will suggest the exact amount of rest
time your brain needs for optimum
recovery after just a few sessions
mindset can identify your peak working

attention deficit disorder Olympic
figure skaters are using it to improve
creativity and part of NASA's astronaut
training program it's widespread but not
accessible to you and me we want to
change this we have backgrounds in
biomedical engineering and neuroscience
research we're working with the
community of neuro tech experts to bring
this technology to life we're building a
development platform you'll get full
access to the data so that you can
integrate mindset to your own
applications and experiment we spent the
last four months in Shenzhen China
working closely with manufacturers on
dozens of prototypes we're partnering
with onkyo pioneers and high-end audio
technology to ensure that mindset sounds
incredible all the processes are in
place to ship a quality product on time
now we just require capital for tooling
and scale production a recent study
shows that over the course of our career
we wait 20,000 hours distracted Malcolm
Gladwell said that's enough to become a
master in anything
and mine sense our mission is to give
you those hours back join us and let's
make distractions a thing of the past
