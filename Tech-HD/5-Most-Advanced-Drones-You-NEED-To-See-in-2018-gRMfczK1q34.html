people were meant to soar born to climb
the second we put both feet on the
ground we lived up to the clouds way up
there
we will be afraid to go higher or go
farther when DJ I created the inspire
one it was for the ones who were ready
to fly the creators who refused to be
compromised by the ground the people who
simply said I will soar
3-axis stabilized 4k camera precision
flight controls unobstructed 360-degree
aerials the world's first professional
flying camera that anyone can fly DJI
inspire 1 soar with creativity
I know Kickstarter my name is David
O'Reilly I'm a big montane snowboarder
in action sports movie maker and I'm
really happy to kick start today EXO
plus the world's first autonomous drone
system that will follow you and film you
so you can get the most amazing aerial
footage anytime anywhere in my aerial
footage is really the key to give all
the perspective to action sports and in
the last few years I've really been
spending it so much energy in trying all
these kind of different tools you know
from power motors to helicopters to
drone you know we thought we could
conquer the world with them but it was a
lot more complicated you know we really
needed something light packable that was
working everywhere all the time
poke a lot to other athletes and other
filmmakers trainer we quickly realized
that such system didn't exist and
basically the only solution was to
innovate
today we are pretty excited to launch
our new drum technology
The Devil's you me and also our friends
to capture our best rides in a really
easy way
I what's up it's Matt whoa whoa just try
to these eggs Oprah's super easy to use
awesome project at the future hexa place
no pilot no cameraman and no headache to
get to this point we have been working
very hard over the past month with great
and values people engineers designers
and providers to create a product which
is fast enough and adapted for action
sports we are transforming how people
use drone in a safe and autonomous way
so you don't have to think on how the
shot is being captured or how to pirate
the door just focus on your moves today
our multi rotor will fly around 70
kilometres per hour and it will also
have an endurance of about 15 minutes
and forward flight is what we're looking
for in the application of the X applause
were not so much concerned about simple
hovering because hovering is boring we
want action sports
I'm really excited for these guys to
pull this off because it's going to
allow us to do more with less and get
next level aerial shots from some of
their most remote adventures where we
can't take a full RC heavy crew into
these spots and bring back more of a
story to share because it follows you
and you don't have to press any buttons
and get six shots nice always got my
back aerial filming it's gonna be a
game-changer super excited to see what
these guys do new squad rounds gonna be
insane
a kickstarter drone technology doesn't
mean to stay in the hands of only
professionals we want to make aerial
filming accessible to everyone we only
need fifty thousand dollars to launch
the first batch and we really hope that
you like this as much as we do and then
you're gonna back up the project and
help us to make it a huge success now
don't waste time get yours now and help
us to revolutionize moviemaking as we
know it
what you want let's have a bit of fun
my love if you feel like I do right now
don't say you're on the road to the
other side
and idea we believe that the capturing
process should happen seamlessly just
like the experience itself does PETA is
the world's first transformative drone
that appeals true versatility in a way
that you capture your experience whether
it's aerial and held or mounted PETA
transforms the your needs in a matter of
seconds the action cam module has three
screw holes for universal mounting
changing modes is quick and easy with
modular design that magnetically snaps
and twist to lock optimized for the
first time pilots across all ages PETA
is light and small to take with you
everywhere
add an extra bunk with our vision
recognition technology to target and
follow users capturing with Peeta is as
easy as throwing it with a click of a
button
our team has deployed a number of vision
recognition technologies across many
different sectors we have been working
days and nights for the last year and a
half to bring the same video processing
technologies to Peeta to create a small
yet powerful autonomous drone that
combines all the pros and previous
drones and action cameras we have
completed development and are now in
need of your help to move on to the
manufacturing stage to shed light on
Peeta please join us to make Peeta a
reality
