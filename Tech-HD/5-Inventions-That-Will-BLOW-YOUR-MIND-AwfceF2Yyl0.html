guv
oh how did that not go in
that's good ball didn't go in that
 hole this is some bull this game
everyone relax take a breath
I'm Jason qu the inventor of the Gen I
won the world's first intelligent golf
ball do you know that most amateurs miss
six putts within six feet per L
saving six strokes per round is gonna
save you a lot of money the Jedi one
works for all golfers at every skill
level we're not a training aid or
training experience for putting drop the
science cool the most important thing in
putting is initial direction or starting
the ball on its intended line without
seeing this metric in a simple way it
can't improve your putti we met with the
top aerospace engineers who work through
multiple engineering teams both with
golf and non golf experience and have
embedded and protected a nine axis
sensor into this ball the sensor
measures initial Direction speed impact
force and rotation that gives you
accurate information about your
direction and distance right on your
smartphone all you need is Bluetooth to
connect to your gen I one ball and the
putter sensor that comes along with your
kit to give you the cause and effect of
your stroke and ball once you get
connected you'll assess your skill level
to determine a fun and entertaining
custom routine that will improve your
putting skills while challenging you to
some cool drills and games you know you
cool I do
the Jedi one doesn't make any promises
except to improve your game on the green
and we all know that's where the real
green comes into play come on man I'm
still finishing my close-up we're
starting out with pudding because that's
we're gonna see instant results and the
putter is the only club that you use on
every hole you're gonna start lowering
your scores and filling your pockets
with cold hard cash don't worry we're
gonna launch the full game ball gen-i to
just in time for the holidays we're
passionate
Golf and making practicing fun but let's
not kid ourselves that's so much more
fun to win yogurt right we're making
golf accessible for everyone we're
connecting golf with gaming and
performance would play golf is card as
it is we're gonna make it easier
you
there are two verbs that describe what a
plane does there's flying and there's
lying
meet powerup darts a paper airplane
that's not just flying it's flying
this is shy a pilot industrial designer
and inventor shine loves everything
airborne four years ago he was
challenged by a friend to create a
smartphone controlled paper airplane
which I accepted the challenge and
created power up three the first ever
smartphone controlled paper airplane
then two years ago that same friend
challenged him to put a camera on the
plane so shy created power up fpv the
first ever smartphone controlled paper
airplane with a streaming camera shiz
friend looked at those creations and
said cool but you can't make a paper
plane that can do a loop and a barrel
roll and then stall turn then just I
stopped his Fred before he
hyperventilated and said challenge
accepted now after a year of prototyping
and testing it's here
power up Dart the first ever smartphone
control paper airplane that can do
aerobatics yes other planes can fly but
they can't loop or barrel roll or fly
vertically dart can it is incredible and
it is small just take a piece of paper
fold it into a plane that's the module
download the app and tell your friends
GeForce got nothing on you you're an
aerobatic pilot now powerup dark gets
its incredible aerobatic capability from
the high thrust-to-weight ratio and
unique shape of the plane despite being
so incredible why the dart is easy and
intuitive move the phone to any
direction and the wings will follow when
you start the plane goes to 70% of its
throttle so you can fly it like a
regular player but press the boost
button and you give the plane that extra
kick that transforms it into a flying
monster a small flying monster power-ups
Bluetooth module easily charges through
its microUSB port and the entire thing
is made of carbon fiber an island so
it's nearly indestructible
dart invites you to make many planes in
many shapes because every plane brings
with it new tricks and with them new
gasps for air try 5 10 50 planes then
fly them all together make a real shulte
arrange dogfights break every barrier
previously set by less incredible planes
and this little bugger is so cool it can
even fly around the office yeah you just
sent a love note through a smartphone
control paper airplane you have lived
powerup dart is ready for production so
if you want to fly aerobatics with the
most incredible all incredible planes
back power up dart and start flying
hi guys
Eric's lab here from Eagle of sniper
slingshots türk üm got my g7 arrow
slingshot right over yeah first time
opening it up just received it today so
I'm pretty chuffed with the with the
whole thing so anyways open up the box
and we find a little Chinese paper that
tells us how to use it that's the way
you pull the the sling that's the way it
fits up blah blah blah whatever yeah I
don't want to really care about that I
want to know
okay Picatinny flash rail awesome okay
for well size is too big for a laser
light so yeah you're probably gonna put
in just a flashlight uh but I think in
you if you want inside you see there's a
little felt there we go that's actually
pretty awesome because I don't see a lot
of guys actually do that to make sure
that your metal doesn't rusts onto the
metal and end up sticking so much that
you can't let it take the thing off so
that's a last point for me
and we got three slings which is pretty
damn awesome since I think I'm gonna go
through all of them pretty soon to try
and create a punishment taste for this
slingshot to see what it's capable of
and everything the mainly reason why I
bought this so obviously it's got the
arrow rest so when it caused some
grievous bodily harm to a archery bud
see what the penetration is like and
everything for you know hunting purposes
because uh planning on hopefully she's
going to shoot a warthog with this thing
and the main little number
g7 I got it in black as I'm not a big
fan of like what kinds of colors and
stuff sir made from magnesium core LA or
something like that
put it up there we're gonna have one
hand sir excuse me for that right so
that's what we got okay
and he's magnets a pretty damn decent as
well you just pull off this thing like
come yet what's up it's actually quite
awesome right so anyways this is what
you get in the box
this is uh actually feels quite dandy as
well see there's a screw here somewhere
in the base you can loosen the back
heels and actually if you really want to
take off the armrest but I thought you
want to do that in you here you can see
the Picatinny rail Eagle of sniper logo
there's your sights
oh and easy you see these sights if I do
this you'll see that this little singing
over here my arrow raced if it's gonna
start zooming out and it's gonna
basically pop through one of the one of
the eyes brighter were they coming up
yeah maybe yeah so that's pretty much
hate inside obviously this is going to
be this way around to make sure okay
right this is what I've got so far
next video I will definitely show us
what penetration value is on the on the
arrows and on the buds and everything
because I really would love to see what
the damage is I'm gonna do with a broad
it on this thing okay thanks
nearly four percent of the worldwide
population suffers from the disease that
use the sensitive medication that has to
be kept in the fridge everyone knows
someone and a friend a distant cousin
suffers from one of these diseases we're
talking about arthritis diabetes
multiple sclerosis Crohn's disease and
many more most people put their
medication in the fridge at home
this means that children also have
access to it is like in a box you can
keep your medication privately and away
from the kids I think it's pretty cool
with life in a box you can go to work
with a medication without having to put
it in the work fridge or everyone will
know that you are sick with writing a
box can still have a private life life
in the box is so small that I can take
it anywhere it also plugs in my car
cigarette lighter no more frozen Japan
pop in a box thank you everything b22
and 80 groups we are also developing
battery packs to give life in a box mod
12 our power we think that we can make
battery pack that will last 24 hours so
that you can better manage your
medication we have linked life in a box
to enough that will not only monitor the
temperature communication but will also
send you reminders when to take it
a life in a box we have put together an
amazing team the agent and full of ideas
we have talked to experts the patient's
doctors make an absolutely perfect
product we are now in our ninth
generation of working prototypes and we
need your help
go into production life in a box not
just a world's smallest French knife in
a box is freedom freedom live your life
and that your medication is always at
the right temperature we love life in a
box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
