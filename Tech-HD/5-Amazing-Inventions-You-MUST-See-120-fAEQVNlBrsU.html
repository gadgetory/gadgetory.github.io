hi I'm Charlie from the UK and I'm Chris
from Switzerland and we're the founders
of code tent working as product
designers we spend a lot of time
traveling and working on the road
outside of work we also leave active
outdoor lifestyle over the last 10 years
we've gone through a lot of different
backpacks and while many of them have
been great for specific purpose we've
been unable to find a bag that really
fits our every need after months of
planning testing and sampling we have
now created the co 10 backpack the
world's most versatile fully lockable
fully waterproof day pack the co 10
backpacks is made from 100% waterproof
TPU coated fabric with high-frequency
welded seams the core of the bag is fast
and easy to close and keeps out water
and moisture even in the toughest of
conditions we designed the pockets on
the co'tin with daily use in mind the
shoulder strap car pocket is designed to
hold your travel cards ski passes or any
other card that you use frequently the
main front pocket is water resistant and
is perfect for storing your phone wallet
keys and travel documents the backpack
is designed to deter against pickpockets
and opportunistic things the roll down
design makes it impossible for thieves
to accesses it when you're wearing the
bag and a hidden back pocket keeps your
valuables in a secure but easy to reach
position our unique locking system
allows you to secure the main
compartment of the bag and lock it to
almost any fixed object
okay Caltech everywhere so we wanted a
bag that's tech ready all of our
backpacks come with a lightweight
texture loop that attaches securely
inside the bag and can be removed when
you're working or you aren't taking your
text with you if you're storing the
backpack in your luggage compartment or
you're carrying other heavy bags our
smart strap system lets you hide the
shoulder straps inside the bag every
backpack comes with a laptop sleeves
travel wallet and free shipping if our
campaign is successful all products will
be shipped to you in late November or
early December in plenty of time for
Christmas thanks for watching our video

Kickstarter calm

tech you might remember us from a couple
of our other campaigns and because of
your overwhelming support we've been
able to push ourselves harder take you
further and create products that can go
with you anywhere we have made rugged
waterproof speakers and tough waterproof
power bags with the help from the
crowdfunding community but we can never
understand why no one created a rugged
version of a product that was clearly
designed for travel vacation and an
active lifestyle rugged waterproof
headphones our engineers and design team
have worked relentlessly to bring you
ultra durable waterproof and hands-down
the toughest wireless headphones ever
created the right length or rhinoceros

headphones are tough the rhinos are
ready to handle your busy lifestyle and
take on almost anything you can throw at
them the rhinos are ultra comfortable so
they are ready for your morning run

kayak adventure all while delivering

Wireless Stereo glory the Rhinos have
been designed to pass the IP x6
waterproofing standards so you won't
have to worry about taking that call in
the pool or hot tub because the Rhinos
could fall in and splash around the
Rhinos battery lasts for eight hours at
full volume on a single charge so you
can head bank to your favorite
audiobooks for an entire workday no more
fussing around and digging through your
bag for your phone or device the rhinos
have you covered with on your controls
so you can answer calls change tracks or
volume activate Siri and voice commands

conventional spokes reflectors heavy
bulky plastic they let you down when
they get dirty and look like this
if you're looking for something better
meat collector Lecter is a foil based
spokes reflector of a new generation it
combines zero weight design with
aerodynamic efficiency and high-grade
reflection Lecter will literally start
to glow when hit by headlight
we are passionate cyclists we simply
love our bikes it was our goal to create
a brand new type of reflector that we
would be thrilled to use on our own bike
now after a year of material sourcing
evaluation 3d modeling and testing under
real conditions vector has become the
ultimate component for your bike
it's almost weightless compared to all
other reflectors if aerodynamic
efficiency is unmatched
and due to the high resilience of its
composition flector is nearly
indestructible
