cnet.com and right now we are taking a
first look at the LG g2 now this super
phone is the latest flagship model that
LG has created what's so great about
this phone well first of all it's one of
the first phones actually the first
phone to globally become available with
the Qualcomm 800 processor its quad-core
it has two gigs of ram and it also has
its own dedicated graphics ram which is
pretty impressive I don't believe
there's a phone out there that has that
yet at least in the US or globally so
all the features on this device are a
5.2 inch LCD it's IPS it's 1080p
resolution it's big it's bright bold
it's pretty cool it's running Android
4.2 to jellybean it's not 4.3 hopefully
they'll update that in the future but
some of the other interesting things is
that it is very thin it's just over 8
millimeters thick so on back we've got
some interesting design features we've
got a volume control here we've got the
volume up volume down we also have a
button that will unlock the device and
lock it we have a 13 megapixel camera
here with flash it also has optical
image stabilization to reduce like shaky
hands that sort of thing and the actual
battery is embedded it's a 3000 milliamp
battery but it uses what LG calls is a
step design for the battery that helps
it keep its thin profile so what
interesting feature on the LG g2 is this
feature called knock on which lets you
tap the screen twice just to unlock the
phone and you can also knock it again to
tap and shut everything down which is
pretty cool now another thing here
that's really nice is you can just use
the volume key on the back here just by
holding this down and that'll
automatically fire up the camera so you
can quickly jump and take photos just a
pretty cool feature now holding the
volume up button will kick in the quick
memo feature like so and then you could
just jot down a quick note you know
whatever you want like that with your
finger
while you're on a call you can also save
those messages and attach them to call
notes so you can see it in the call log
for later retrieval so you don't miss
important information if you don't have
a pen and paper handy so that's pretty
cool feature so another really great
feature on the LG g2 is something called
slide aside essentially you can open up
up to three different applications push
them to the side of the screen and save
them for later use and retrieval another
really interesting feature on the LG g2
is that you can separate the interface
with profiles and have a guest mode so
right now we've set it up so you can
just draw AG here and boom that'll take
it to a guest mode and if you look at it
it looks very kid-friendly so this is
something you want to hand to your
toddlers and they won't mess with the
email or wipe your phone by accident or
start sending tweets in your name that's
something that will actually probably
come in pretty handy so right now we
don't have pricing on the LG g2 just yet
what we do know is that it will be
available on four major US carriers
that'll be Sprint t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon so that's pretty big news
hopefully we will see it by q3 q4 right
in time for the holiday season i'm brian
bennett for cnet com and this has been a
first look at the LG g2 be sure to check
back soon for a full review</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
