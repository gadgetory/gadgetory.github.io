right now we're taking a first look at
the new Sony SmartWatch 2 as with any
mobile gadget worthy of the coveted
SmartWatch title the SmartWatch 2 is
designed to function as a second screen
for your phone the idea here is to view
alerts and other phone notifications
right on your wrist when your handset
isn't well handy or is otherwise out of
reach in theory you'll be able to use a
product like the Sony SmartWatch 2 to
perform a sort of digital triage
ignoring low priority communication so
you won't miss what's really important
design-wise the Sony SmartWatch 2 is
actually pretty classy looking at least
as smartwatches go a glossy black slab
of glass metal and plastic to me the
device is square shape has strong
minimalist charm I honestly feel the
SmartWatch 2 is more attractive than for
instance the Samsung Galaxy gear the
gear in my opinion has a very wild super
sci-fi appearance which clashes with
more conservative business attire of
course both the gear in SmartWatch 2
feel luxurious next to the all plastic
Pebble watch 2 up the SmartWatch 2 style
you can replace its standard silicone
band with metal or leather ones from
Sony or swap in your own from other
watches the SmartWatch 2 is anything but
small though it's flat screen is big and
hard to ignore
measuring 1.6 inches the watch's colour
display does use transflective LCD
technology so it's easy to read both
indoors and outside that's a huge
improvement over the first Sony
SmartWatch which washed out completely
in sunlight also slick is that the
SmartWatch 2 is water-resistant enough
so to withstand splashes showers and
submersion at a depth of three feet for
up to 30 minutes just remember to close
the soft flap to seal its USB port so
what can you actually do with the
SmartWatch 2 strapped to your arm
actually more than you might think the
gadget links to Android smartphones via
a companion mobile app sorry iPhone
users you're not invited to this party
you then download and install additional
mini applications to enhance the
SmartWatch 2
abilities for instance a call handling
app lets you see who's dialing your
mobile number you can then choose to
reply with a pre-configured text message
or reject the call entirely if you
install the messaging app the SmartWatch
2 buzzes when you receive text Facebook
and Twitter apps allow you to see their
associated news feeds with the watch
vibrating when updates hit if that's too
much social media action you can have
the watch alert you when messages hit
your personal inbox or if you're
mentioned in someone else's post there's
a gmail app to which not only tells you
when emails roll in but also allows you
to read partial contents of the message
unfortunately you can't tweet the app to
provide heads-up for specific people or
groups another letdown is that the
generic email app for SmartWatch 2 only
supports Sony phones once find out more

I'm Brian Bennett for CNET and this has
