companion to its gear vr headset giving
you a simple way to create your own
immersive photos and videos and the
quality is actually some of the best
you'll find in the category like gear VR
though the cameras mobile app is only
officially supported for use with the
galaxy s6 and s7 including edge models
and the note 5 you don't need one of
these to use the camera in fact you can
get by just fine without it since you
can change settings and modes with a
little screen and it's three buttons but
without the app you lose a big chunk of
usability like being able to see what
you're shooting and download shots to
your device to trim up and share to
Facebook and YouTube to do more than
that Samsung includes a version of cyber
links 360 action director software that
gives you tools to combine clips and add
music effects and titles but it's
windows only for Mac users there are
ways around it but that pretty much
kills the simple part and really the
fact that it is simple is the best part
of the gear 360 even its splash and
water-resistant body is somewhat done in
by its lenses which can be replaced if
they get scratched if only samsung sold
replacements the camera isn't the
easiest to hold without its little
tripod either and the giant I look of it
does make it a little creepy still if
you meet the requirements and have $350
it's one of the better 360 options right
now
