has been refreshed for 2016 is now 11
percent thinner and 16 percent lighter
it also has more rounded edges and comes
in white as well as black the design
changes may not see major but anytime
you can shave some weight off an
e-reader and makes a difference and the
latest entry-level Kindle is actually
the second lightest Kindle at five point
seven ounces or 161 grams okay so it's
missing the integrated light found in
the step-up paperwhite voyage in Oasis
and its resolution isn't as crisp 167
pixels per inch compared to 300 pixels
per inch but it does have a touchscreen
and as if equipped with 4 gigabytes of
memory which enables you to store
thousands of e-books new on the features
front is Bluetooth audio for
accessibility so visually impaired
readers can hear voice view audio that's
automated reading of what's on the page
as well as navigation prompts and you
can listen to that on wireless
headphones or speakers sorry but you
can't listen to audible audiobooks or
music for that matter but I don't think
necessarily want to use your Kindle to
do that this is a Wi-Fi only reader by
that I mean there's no version that
bundles 3G cellular data service and
this baseball has ads on it or special
offers as Amazon calls them to get rid
of them you'll have to spend an extra
twenty dollars because of the integrated
light we generally steer readers toward
the paperwhite aside from the missing
light this is a perfectly good reader
for the money particularly if you can
pick it up during an Amazon flash sale
it gets discounted to $60 I'm David
karna and that's the thinner lighter
entry-level Kindle thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
