going to take a look at the Belkin Wemo
insight switch this is the latest
addition to belkin's Wemo smart product
line it's similar to another plug Belkin
sells but this one has an updated design
and has a new power consumption tracking
feature which is actually pretty useful
so the basic functionality this is
pretty much the same as the original
model you plug it in and then plug a
device into it and then set it up on
your smart phone and through your smart
phone you can then control power to that
device you can use the app to control
basic programming cues like set it on a
timer or set it to run on a certain day
of the week you can also extend the
functionality through IFFT which is the
if this then that protocol and it's
through if that the Wemo insight switch
actually becomes really useful with
certain if recipes you can use the
device to say turn off a device efforts
used a certain amount of power or after
it's drawn power to a certain dollar
amount it really then becomes pretty
handy for regulating say TV usage game
console usage or even just being a
little bit more aware of how much you're
spending based on your air conditioning
usage now it still is a few issues the
housing is still pretty big even though
it's about half as much as the original
so if you plug it into a power outlet it
might block an adjacent plug finally
setup is kind of annoying there's no say
hub to connect to your home Wi-Fi
network in fact it projects its own
little Wi-Fi network that you use to go
through it it's really just kind of
complicated and doesn't really work as
smoothly as it should
overall though this is a pretty useful
device it's a low risk entry point to
home automation it's only fifty nine
bucks so there's no big financial outlay
it actually has some interesting
programming features through IFFT and
its own software and it's really pretty
easy to recommend for anybody interested
in jumping into the smart home so how
much from this is the Belkin Wemo
insight switch
