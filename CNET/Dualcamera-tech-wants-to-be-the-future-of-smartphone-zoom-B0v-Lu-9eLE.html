today at core photonics camera
technology now this is a company that we
saw a couple of years ago what they're
doing is trying to combine two camera
units into a single smartphone component
in a bid to get you better zoom when
you're taking photos with your phone so
let's take a look at what's new so if
you look inside this little unit here
you can see there's actually two camera
sensors and what's going on here is that
though both sensors are bringing in
light from the subject that you're
looking at and then using some
complicated software those are combined
to try and give you a very very clear
image the idea is to bring you optical
zoom on a smartphone with no moving
parts which is quite a claim previously
when we saw it it could do three times
zoom now it can do five times we've saw
a little demonstration here and say it
was pretty impressive so over on the
left side of the screen here you can see
what's happening when just one of those
sensors is zoomed in on this
demonstration board here and then on the
right side you can see what happens when
both sensors are bringing their powers
to bear and it does look a lot sharper
now we put this to the test using one of
our own phones we used an iPhone 6s plus
and we zoomed in as well using the board
and I have to say that our test shots
came out as blurry as what you can see
on the left side of the screen we
weren't able to get the same zoom that
both sensors can get together companies
also found a very interesting way of
bouncing light off of a prism onto the
sensors one of those cameras which it
says cuts down on the size that the
actual unit needs to be and we're also
taking a look at some interesting
stabilization technology you can see
this gimbal here moving and when the
company turns on its stabilization
software the image on the screen becomes
a lot more steady so cool photonics says
that we can expect to see this
technology in actual smartphones
available to buy sometime this year so
fingers crossed we're looking forward to
giving it the full test end for much
