amazon has a robot army I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update for
the past 10 years the default search
engine on Firefox has been Google but in
December it's changing to yahoo Mozilla
the company behind the Firefox web
browser has made a five-year deal for
Yahoo to be the default in that little
search box on the right hand top corner
and with that deal Yahoo will support Do
Not Track technology for anyone
searching through firefox and that
honors preferences to not be tracked for
advertising purposes you can still
change your default search if you don't
like Yahoo but there will be people who
don't change the default and Yahoo will
obviously gain more search traffic from
this right now only ten percent of
searches are done on yahoo what you may
not realize is that firefox made most of
it's money from google a few years ago
it was estimated that google paid about
a hundred million dollars a year to be
the default on firefox but things are
changing Google may not want to play
nice with Firefox when it's trying to
grow the competing Chrome browser and
yahoo now led by a former Google
executive Marissa Meyer is making deals
for Yahoo to become a leader in search
once again this holiday shopping season
amazon is enlisting some robots to help
get the gifts out in time The Wall
Street Journal reports that several
Amazon warehouses have these large squat
shaped orange rolling robots that will
move shelves of products to the human
workers to save time so people don't
have to walk as much with these BOTS
Amazon's employees are expected to pick
and scan 300 items an hour up from 100
items without the bots Amazon keeps
trying new things to speed up delivery
you've heard about the drones but the
company's also testing the use of
taxicabs to deliver packages speed is
vital for Amazon to stay competitive
when you have retail stores offering
same-day delivery and also price
matching Amazon nothing makes a techie
cringe quite like a shattered smartphone
screen there's a chance that your next
phone may be just a little more
protected from cracking Corning the
maker of Gorilla Glass which is the
glass and most phones including iPhones
has created a new material that's about
twice as tough as the current edition
but don't get too excited here's what
the phone makers don't tell you when
Gorilla Glass gets stronger the phone
makers use an even thinner slice of the
glass so the phone is lighter but the
glass being thinner is no more
shatterproof than the previous edition I
hope that changes because I think people
rather have screens be stronger instead
of thinner that's your tech news update
but there's always more tech goodness at
cnet com in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
