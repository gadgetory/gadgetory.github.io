20:17 seemed like a real trash fire part
of that flaming pile of garbage was
thanks to hacks leaks and ransomware
these are our worst acts of 2017 at
least the worst ones we found out about
first up uber the ride-sharing company
had its fair share of controversy this
year but one of the most cringe-worthy
moments was in November of 2017 the
company admitted not only had data for
57 million users and drivers been stolen
but that it also paid 100 thousand bucks
to the hackers to delete the information
come on uber rule number one don't
negotiate with terrorists also how does
anyone know they didn't just take the
money and then not delete the data one
company that didn't pay ransom HBO it
was hit with a six million dollar ransom
demand after then unaired episodes and
scripts of its original shows were
posted online the hacker claimed to have
over one and a half terabytes of data
and threatened to post closely guarded
spoilers for shows like Game of Thrones
shortly after the initial info dump a
month's worth of emails from an HBO
executive were published and then a
couple weeks after that
HBO's Twitter and the Twitter accounts
of a couple of its shows were all hacked
by white hat group our mine in an
unrelated breach yikes equally as well
protected as Game of Thrones secrets the
NSA or was it back in October 2017 The
Wall Street Journal reported Russian
hackers had stolen information from an
NSA contractor running Kaspersky
software on their home computer if that
wasn't bad enough another embarrassing
incident in November of 2017 saw over a
hundred gigs of data from an Army
Intelligence project code-named red disk
completely exposed on a public Amazon
Web Services storage server what oddly
enough hackers stealing NSA secrets led
to the next InfoSec disaster
want to cry what started as a
vulnerability discovered by the NSA was
stolen and weaponized into one of the
largest cyber attacks in history over
300,000 computers across 150 countries
were affected and caused all kinds of
mayhem including hospitals going offline
and a Honda factory shutting down the
ransomware encrypted data on infected
computers and then de
andddd payment to restore access
fortunately even though a massive number
of machines were infected it looks like
only 338 victims
paid up there's only one hack left to
discuss and it was a complete and utter
disaster from start to finish that's
right
Equifax wins our worst hack of 2017 by a
landslide in early September the credit
reporting company announced as many as
one hundred and forty three million
people were victims of a massive theft
that included names Social Security
numbers birthdays and addresses if that
wasn't horrible enough for you the
company spent the next month tripping
over itself to try to paper over the
disaster multiple tweets directing
victims to a support page that was phony
actual support page ending up vulnerable
to hacking admitting it waited over a
month to reveal the breach after it
found out admitting it hadn't patched a
key computer system and so on was the
hacking equivalent of a trash fire the
size of Canada so that's it our picks
for worst acts of 2017 or is there
something you think should have made the
list
leave your thoughts down in the comments
for more on these and all the other
major hacks we saw this year hit up
