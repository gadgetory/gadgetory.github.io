latest
dual-band Wi-Fi router from asus and
might just be the best dual band Wi-Fi
router ever it has eight gigabit lan
port that doubled the amount normally
found in other routers you can even
agregate two of them into a single super
fast connection or use one of them as a
second one port in case you have a two
separate broadband connection at home
now as a Wi-Fi router this one you can
deliver up to 2167 megabit per second on
the hook frequency band and up
to 1,000 megabit per second on a 2.4
gigahertz frequency band now obviously
those are on paper in real world there
are no client of that speed existing yet
but in testing it did deliver quite fast
performance up to 700 megabits per
second and it had very good range to my
previous routers from Asus the RT AC
Elliott you has a robust easy and fun to
use interface and a slew of features
including the ability to keep your home
network safe online and a set up game
boost features designed specifically for
gamers
you can also martyr your home network in
real time and find out all kind of
things such as who is hogging all the
bandwidth and so on and when coupled
with an extra hard drive it can be quite
a powerful Ness over to basically this
is the best dual band Wi-Fi router that
money can buy and my money I mean 280
dollars in fact I found it a lot better
deal than this much more expensive and a
lot heavier rtic 5300 here which is
another story entirely
but to be cool though you should have
both which I do but that's only because
I don't know and this has been the first
look at this one right here at the RT 88
you four measures</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
