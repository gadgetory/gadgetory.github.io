and if you are a loyal sprint customer
or a die-hard fan of the original HTC
evo 4g I've got a real treat for you
this my friends is the all new HTC evo
4g LTE a phone a lot of android lovers
are excited about based on HTC's latest
flagship smartphone the 1x the HTC evo
4g LTE available on sprint for 199
offers the same cutting-edge components
but with even more design Flair and yes
it has a kickstand it's light years
ahead of the Evo's before it in a worthy
successor to the evo franchise first let
me say the design of the evo 4G LTE is
stunning fashioned from anodized
aluminum and sporting a black and silver
color scheme with flashy red accents the
evo 4G LTE is a real looker the phone
has a big bright 4.7 inch super lcd2
display with 1280 x 720 pixel HD
resolution the screen uses IPS
technology too so viewing angles are
nice and wide and even with its massive
display the 4g LTE is only 0.35 inch
thick thinner than the HTC One X in fact
software is state-of-the-art as well
with the phone running android for dough
ice cream sandwich and HTC's latest
version of its sense UI version for that
feels lighter and faster of course that
extra speed is also due to the Evo's 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Snapdragon s4 CPU
and one gigabyte of RAM above the screen
is a 1.3 megapixel front-facing camera
while below it are three Android Ice
Cream Sandwich buttons on the right is a
very slim volume bar that can be tricky
to locate since it blends in with the
black background there's a dedicated
camera button to which looks very slick
with its silver etched spiral pattern
too bad it doesn't wake the phone up and
launch the camera from standby on the
left is the evos microUSB port while on
the back is the 8 megapixel
camera with LED flash here you'll find a
revamped spring-loaded kickstand an
iconic Evo feature that can be used with
the phone resting either on its left or
right side just like the other HTC One
series phones including the One X the
evo features HTC image sense essentially
that means the device has a special
process or just for processing images
has very Swift shot to shot times and
comes with a wide selection of scene
modes special settings and filters my
favorite is the continuous shot mode for
birth shots the camcorder function also
captures video in full 1080p HD quality
and lets you snap stills while recording
the evo also features beats audio
processing technology and will
automatically recognize when you connect
beats branded headphones and launched a
matching equalizer audio profile unlike
the HTC One X the evo 4G LTE does have a
SD card slot for extra storage but the
battery isn't removable the evo 4G LTE s
major Achilles heel right now though is
it remains a 3g smartphone though the
phone will link to Sprint's 4G LTE
network it's not operational yet that's
a huge detractor from an otherwise
stellar device hopefully Sprint will
flip its LTE switch soon I'm Brian
