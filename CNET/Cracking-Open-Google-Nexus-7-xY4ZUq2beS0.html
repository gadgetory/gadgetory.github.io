about Google's Nexus 7 tablet is a
great-looking 7-inch display runs jelly
bean and sports a two-hundred-dollar
price tag but as I'm going to show you
today there's also a lot to like on the
inside I'm bill detwiler and this is
cracking open the first thing I really
like about the Nexus 7 is how easy it is
to open like the Kindle Fire and unlike
the iPad the back cover just pops right
off giving you easy access to the
tablets internal hardware now the
battery isn't soldered to the
motherboard and it's easily removed the
speaker assembly headphone jack and USB
connector can all be disconnected and
replaced even the camera upper
microphone motherboard and internal
frame aren't difficult to remove I only
have two real complaints about the
tablets construction first a sous used
two large pieces of what looks like
copper alloy shielding one covering part
of the motherboard and the cable for the
headphone jack and USB connector and one
covering the display connector you must
be careful not to tear these shields
when removing them second the display
and front glass panel are fused together
if one breaks you'll need to replace
them both so how does the nexus 7 stack
up against the other big $200 tablet out
there Amazon's Kindle Fire well there's
no doubt that Google's tablet has the
edge on Hardware it has a one point
three gigahertz quad-core NVIDIA Tegra 3
processor 1 gig of low voltage ddr3 RAM
and comes in either 8 or 16 gig models
the fire on the other hand has a dual
core 1 gigahertz TI omap processor 512
megs of ram and only comes in an eight
gig model given however that amazon will
likely release an updated fire later
this year and Apple may introduce a
smaller cheaper iPad the Nexus 7 may not
be the most powerful 7-inch tablet for
long despite all its positives
asus and Google did sacrifice a few
features to keep the Nexus 7's price so
low there's no rear camera no hdmi out
no cellular data option and no memory
card slot but given that you can buy an
eight gig model for 199 and a 16 gig
model for 249 you definitely get a lot
of bang for your buck now for more
information on the Nexus 7 including
performance and battery life benchmark

cnet review and to see more teardown
