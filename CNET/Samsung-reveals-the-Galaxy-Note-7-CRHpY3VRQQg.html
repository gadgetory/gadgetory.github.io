reversible USB type that you might have
seen on Google's Nexus 6p or Apple's

phone with Gorilla Glass 5 the maker of
Gorilla Glass Corning says this version
of Gorilla Glass survives up to 80% of
Falls made from 1.6 meters or bit over 5
feet for you imperial types that's good
because the note 7 also features a
curved screen of course the note 7
features a stylus in the last version of
the note the stylus could get jammed if
