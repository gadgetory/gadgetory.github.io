Voyager air from Corsair now this is a
purple drive with a built-in battery and
a Wi-Fi network so you can connect up to
five Wi-Fi devices to it such as laptop
tablet or smartphone and stream data
from it now the idea is not new because
on the market has been other devices
with the same features such as the G
connect from G tech or the Wallace Plus
form seeded now you can see the car is
similar but the courser here manages to
be quite different first its come in red
now it's important because it kind of
matches my t-shirt
now what make it's really different the
fact that it come with feature that the
other two individually doesn't have for
example the G connect here comes with a
network port but doesn't have a battery
on the inside and the Wallace plus here
come with a barrier inside actually very
good battery but no net report so this
is a device that come with everything
you asked for for mobile storage device
it comes with a built-in Wi-Fi network a
built-in network port and a built in
battery with up to seven hours of
battery life almost everything you can
ask for and of course it's also work as
a regular bus power purple drive when
connected to a computer using the
included USB 3.0 cable now the best view
of the voucher is of course as a mobile
media server with up to one terabyte of
storage space you can basically transfer
your entire library onto it and print on
the go and then you can stream photo
music document video to your tablet and
smartphone and what-have-you it comes
with a voucher a mobile app for Android
iOS and Kindle Fire devices to make the
streaming and matching is feature an
easy job I don't know about you but for
me this mean I can bring with me the
entire catalog of Michael Ball for my
money nothing is more effective than
what hissing when a man
women so romantic so sentimental and so
many good memories all right now back to
the Voyager on the front here you can
see it have two on/off switches one for
the power and the other for the Wi-Fi
signal I actually realized the fact that
the on and opposition are clearly marked
with other devices such as the Wallis
plus there's only one power button I
have to press and hold and hope that you
hold there long enough or press quick
enough for it to work as expected
another good thing about the Voyager air
is the fact that it comes with a car
charger and also a traveling pouch at
the cost of two hundred and twenty
dollars for one terabyte or a hundred
and eighty dollars for 500 gigabyte I
think the new device here is quite a
good buy but for more on that have to
check out the full review and do some
reading and when you're there make sure
you follow me on Twitter Facebook or
Google+ and that's because I am dumb no
and this has been the first look at the
Voyager air from Corsair and by the way
this is just a free t-shirt</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
