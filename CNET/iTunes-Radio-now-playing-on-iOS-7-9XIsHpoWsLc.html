this is a first look at iTunes radio
whether you've got yourself a new device
or you've upgraded an existing one you
should see iTunes radio built right into
iOS 7's music app iTunes radio is
similar to pandora in that it offers
programmed radio stations based on your
inputs but it also offers a few key
things that set it apart to pull up
iTunes radio just open your music app
and hit the radio tab here at the bottom
iTunes radios home screen shows you all
of the stations you've created plus a
nice curated list of featured stations
up top something that Pandora doesn't
have to create a station you can either
run a search to start or browse through
Apple's list of genres once you've made
your selections your station will
immediately start playing from the now
playing screen you get a few options you
can of course purchase the song that's
playing if you like your iTunes account
is obviously linked so it's pretty
simple or you can create a new station
based on the current song or artist
otherwise you can do things like add
variety to your station with this little
three-stage slider enable explicit
content share your station or of course
tell iTunes if you like or dislike a
song and the wish list here keeps track
of songs you want to purchase later
lastly iTunes radio also lets you edit
stations that you've already created
adding an additional song artist or
genre will help the service to really
hone in on what you like to hear iTunes
radio is available in the US on devices
running iOS 7 now for all the details
