messages like notifications and the
headline is always usage overage alert
okay so you get that and what's your
first thing like what do you think first
they only charge them right and you see
that you're like oh man overage alert
what else could it mean now you don't
mean that it means I've only done eighty
percent of my allotment and and inside
the email or the text whatever it is is
a link to add more minutes and then
spend more money that you don't need it
goes it goes hey Jeff you're eighty
percent through your voice minutes for
your cycle ending November twelfth guess
what today is November 12 guess what I'm
not going to use twenty percent of in
just you know 12 more hours when you
want to try though at this point this is
cruel use that the whole fat is not
screwing them there's got to be a better
way the better way is calling them up in
like getting them to convince me they
had more minutes to my plan recording it
and trying to do like a Ryan block thing
you could probably do that seems like a
waste of your time really yeah wasted my
time man so no I just I just leave me
and I know it's just like a robot
spitting that out but just lay off man
just leave me alone it's is gonna lead
to you ignoring the real ones at some
point right then you that's how they're
gonna get you right the one over I chase
you're really over ridiculous is that
I've yet to see one of those all right
well you don't like to live dangerously
like I do not yet constantly living on
the edge I structuring I'm us are
streaming stuff just to see this overage
warning it is weird though cuz I've
never even come close and I wonder i
really like know who if i was talking I
don't I don't get it it's all voice
minutes I have I only have like four
hundred you were using a voice minutes
that's the over East thing they were
talking about not data no no no where
near that hell cares about that I how
did you even do that how is it not even
just free well you how his voice just
not few are clearly on hold with
something for a long way dude I've had
to I don't stand for that I don't wait I
don't do that oh wait you don't Yammer
what are you doing on the phone nobody
uses the phone app I know like you got
it like look around there's actually a
payphone by where i live in it's just
like this freakish thing it's just like
homeless
people pee and poop in it well it's not
a full one you still couldn't really hey
whatever you wanna see how you can do
that i'll show you thanks up they what
my point my the big takeaway is that
voice minutes should be free like you
should have unlimited voice no matter
what free because all people care abouts
data screw the voice no one cares just
make calls on data so yeah what do you
bother him with i guess i don't know
alright i guess I'm the only one who
wants to complain about that today
thanks for making that an issue you're
welcome it's Wednesday November 12 404
time let's start show
like shut up verizon shut up leave me
alone if you read the news on verizon
18t right now you'd be saying that a lot
louder with a lot more swears just shut
up how about that AT&amp;amp;T I want to smack

the 44 show i'm jeff bakalar joined by
iyaz Akhtar hello armed aerial nunez

smart looking smart feeling smart
feeling very smart but looking good now
thank uh why do you wanna hit eighteen t
in the face of the brick oh they stopped
out rolling out fiber until the whole
net the net neutrality stuff is sussed
out instead of giving like awesome
speeds to these different places like
we're just gonna stop right now while
this is going on until all settled
images them I'm not defending them
mm-hmm but i guess like it does make
sense to sort of stop doing something
like that until this you know blows over
so they know maybe how their how to like
is it up their infrastructure me set up
the infrastructure at worse you sell it
off for lease it's not that big a deal
other than its basically a giant fu to
every consumer who would like like super
fast speeds at home like why do you have
to move to Kansas where Google is to get
fast speeds at a reasonable price nobody
has to move to Kansas I want that to be
known they might have to 30 I wouldn't
move to Kansas for the Internet I'm
getting 50 down 50 up here that's cool
Regan 50 up verizon the company i hate
different arm they're giving me good
internet they just won't leave me alone

just you got pic for winners that's all
i gotta do is it will talk about it
maybe this is like
asian not on the show for not that's
already over right though if you're
descending there's like a timeline that
only the tweets are good for you gotta
do we have like a log of the summer yeah
dude it's all been you know which are
rated sounds like fun um I think I got
some methods already out of Pixie so
what so what I'm live without it leading
to I'm glad like dr. evil over here what
ideas what that's leading to as we'll
announce the winners on friday and then
i'll ship them out friday as well that's
magnificent is the awesome USB package
of flux capacitors a correct are correct
for people and i have all the power you
have all the power right one point
twenty-one gigawatts this order feels
odd power switch you have the power of a
lightning bolt arm and then and then
next monday if the legal people get it
turned around quick enough we can start
actually having people enter the
freaking call of duty bundle which is
taking that's actually call me they
reconnect all again let's get that van
jazz time call a duty bundle it's about
freakin time we gotta get that as a
vanity URL sweet-ass time dot cnet.com
early we can get any vanity URL we want
we is anything is awesome it's great all
right let's uh let's get into the news
not a whole lot of news there's um just
like a new video streaming service that
we didn't talk about at all what videos
you heard about so we took the only
reason I bring it up the popped in my
head because a more Cuban heard of all
right Oh Joe right it's it's it's like a
couch or like Instagram for video right
that's eight seconds of video for
anything there's a video service I'm
like yes video like social service yeah
yeah and what I mean I I only looked at
it for a second have you checked it out
at all of course not I mean why would I
bother with this like enemy okay couch
didn't take off this Yippity I think
this has a better chance though over
vine that 6i because vine is super
produced like everyone's made his movies
with that right it's like stop motion
enemy everyone who takes a vine is like
been working on their vine all day it's
like all year one vine six seconds so
this Oh Joe suppose what not produced is
supposed to be just like well so if you
don't know Oh Cho is eight in spanish
espa√±ol right
so it's eight second videos and you can
fill more than eight seconds and ocho
the ocho will speed it up and have it
fit in that eighth second sort of
timetable keep audio keeps audio and you
can do audio commentary over it you can
do filters you can do uh and then and
then you can do this thing were like you
follow other ppl gramma done I can still
react to how dumb this is but going it's
not done because I've it's cool that you
can just like follow other ojo words
altars a challenge of CHO ins obviously
out just what in like stream their
videos oh like all you know Lupin right
so like let's say I subscribe to 40
people on uh Oh Joe I can enter like the
you know the laid-back mode wherever the
hell they're going to call it and you
just sit there and watch everyone's
thing over and over again it's kind of
like TV which is like eat with eight
second cuts that have nothing to do with
you that's that's like channel flipping
right no it's like watching mtv now I
guess right I have not looked MTV yeah
I'm not a mob scene on to this okay tell
I just wanted to get it out there it's
on I it's for iOS right now and androids
coming very soon I think it's a I think
it's a better idea than vine because
vine turned into this like annoying
hipster sort of six second you know I
don't know you have to like produce
everything make it be like some sort of
trick photography that's like pretty
much what happened to Twitter right
somebody figured out what's the best
uses for this I don't know what I chose
gonna turn into but it just seems like
this it almost sounds like sitting at
somebody's home and watching like a
slideshow so he's a voiceover of this
eighth second video i did it's like I I
have no interest in this uh yeah I don't
have an opinion you haven't checked it
out anyway we want you to check it out
and tell us what you think okay let's
get to the news we had prepared sorry I
threw your curveball there there's a
story about discovery channel what would
a discovery discover okay well there's
this bizarre special that they're going
to run on the seventh of December it's
called eaten alive there's a guy whose
name is Paul
Rosalie and his is one desire is to be
eaten alive by an anaconda okay and I
know he's gonna be wearing a special
snake a special suit that allows him not
to die while being ingested apparently
he's gonna be wearing some kind of like
pig's blood or something to make him
very attractive HD right sodium tasty is
gonna be laying out and hoping the
Anaconda just notes take some hole and
then I mean I can't imagine the
anacondas gonna like survive this ordeal
yet that's where the protesters Covenant
changed out or they're freaking out
there like this is ridiculous not
switching this is the dumbest I've
ever heard and Paul Rosalie should just
be put in jail now before he does
something real bad he's already done the
spin shot oh cool it's already happened
this thing is going to me it's gonna be
is gonna air on the seventh and here's
the petition to change that organ thing
it's got what 20 thousand supporters and
they want to have the air in avenal I've
stopped they want to boycott the
Discovery Channel's it's got a lot of
people going nuts but in the actual
petition in bold it did take that why
taking issue with the event yeah it once
again reinforces the negative
stereotypes of snakes okay which one
would think okay would be the opposite
of a discovery should be trying to do
well who the hell's doing PR for snakes
alright like why somebody taking the
throne and being like I got a stick on
for snakes I just think this is just a
stupid TV show it's stupid on so many
levels number one and what first off
what the f discovery channel like when
did you become this like ridiculous
tabloid nonsensical irrelevant per
channel between your shark documentaries
about on TV documentary I'd aren't even
doctor about Megalodon sharks that have
been gone from the surf for three
million years buncha assholes running
that network at this point it seems that
way right and now this guy this Paul
Rosalie would get decapitated and
survive shut up right eye I don't know
you'd get some get some bigger dreams I
get screen bigger I can see this dumb
idea coming out in a brainstorming
meeting right you got a bunch of people
sitting around you like hey what do you
want to do I want to get eaten by an
anaconda it's it's this next part that I
have trouble with this somebody the room
was like
that's a good idea we fact that I got
greenlit we should actually shoot this
oh how are we gonna make this happen I'm
gonna need a special suit Amerigo pro
inside there girl we're gonna design a
suit for this isn't like a guy who
survives bear attacks or guy wearing a
suit the protection from dogs is a guy
who intentionally wants to be eaten by
an anaconda makes me so mad what's only
happen the movies like what makes we do
juice it happened in to Harry Potter's
happened in anaconda anaconda which I
haven't watched as happened in nightmare
elm street or I think we warriors but
ice cube is in anaconda ok I love the
Caribbean Jennifer Lopez why on earth
did somebody say this okay and not just
that but we have this thing of the
protest the protest is they do have a
good spot like later on in the in the in
the actual petition pool no matter how
it ends this is animal cruelty from
start to finish so total sport make
total egg with that not just a bad PR
person they should have been like on be
big he seemingly started like on behalf
of the snake community which is not how
you you should be pitching this it
should be like hey doesn't sound like
this an econo is gonna come out the
other end okay how does he get out
without killing the thing how what are
they gonna do like in my head I'm like
okay so this this guy's inside the
anaconda and then you just like nip the
tips and just get him out you know
basically in his chip off the ends and
then I decide to shake them out we'll
see that's into thick like you would you
know like a bag and a product just like
get out of it get out of human so it's
so wait a second you're high tea is to
keep them in the tube of the snake the
rest of the body chopped off its
freaking tail right hop off its head
kind of like like like a pillowcase I'm
like Fran ago like a poke just like
out of it yeah I actually know he would
deserve that to get out of it maybe they
don't need to kill the Anaconda to do
that just hold anaconda upside down just
see if the guy will come out because
apparently you supposed to go in
headfirst too so we've got a wild vision
how's that work special suit its oxygen
soon every part of the suit real guess
he's gotta breathe to write the ideas
share that well it's not like it's a
fast process oh it's gonna take a
freaking while for this thing 203 a lot
of wipe dissolves in this radar you the
clock wipes this all watch on Ocho uh
there you go eight seconds you won't
have eight seconds of voiceover and I
don't recommend anybody actually do this
don't do this on a Joe but that's is
this gonna be mean and saying I'm upset
he survived now I don't want him to die
that's what I mean I think it's me i
think i think this because of this guy's
i'm gonna say jackassery that's what I'm
gonna say this is that's chicory schmuck
hurry sure well it's just such a stupid
idea he's like it is is tweet if you
know me I would never hurt a living
thing but you'll have to watch you don't
have to see how it goes down but i'm
just gonna force this anaconda to
regurgitate me get out of here Mordor
things if this is successful what do you
know it's gonna have a sequel he's like
if you know me you know how I always
have animals throw me right up you know
that you know how I roll you what an ass
all in hurt an animal I just wanted to
swallow me yeah normal you saw what I
did when that hippo Amy yeah I got out
real gingerly like there's so what I did
we're friends now there's the fake Paul
Rosalie account waiting ahead so you saw
what happened when i got when i was i
said i stuffed myself into that pigeon I
was tiny at the time I Shrunk myself
down after figuring this out i was in
this vision best tweet ever he leaves
office I if you know me I would fall
Rosalie thank God I don't know you we're
all better for not knowing that dude
imagine where other stupid I think you
know me when that Tiger pulled me apart
we wound up you know you know how we
were all inside of animals I wasn't
expecting much from this story is but I
think we got a lot out I think so I mean
this is salmon cannon almost man this is
that good so John Oliver will be
covering this totally momentarily okay
let's talk about samsung it's a strange
company man absolutely strange strange
coming people don't realize it they only
see like the consumer-facing end of it
or it's all galaxies and gears and all
that junk but there is a strange weird
source or behind that curtain okay so
we've got a rap video from Samsung about
corporate diversity normally you get
like stats and you get you know like a
really boring press release or something
with Samsung decided to actually do a
video you didn't play the music Jeff
yeah I'm gonna play some of this music
you upset the video going they'll be a
little bit off thing yeah we go one
scheme cuz you some to the rescue it
means you're freaking here yeah
everyone's just listen re all admit this
is hot it's forty percent of work forces
or a female keeping bursts affect the
next to me to work now what's the story
behind it's just about giving stats and
this guy who did it is a rapper which is
actual name a mad clown he's a green
wrapper and here tomorrow no you mad
clown thank God sounds like a mad clown
I mean the lyrics are very impressive
I'm you see in the video right now
amazing here we go once again sampling
to the rest view uh this is when the
weirder lines here okay so forty percent
or women you don't have to worry about
you don't have to worry after giving
birth sit back relax no need to work
it's all taken care of leave it to us
family friendly friendly company with
kindergarten that's just like a super
ass backwards way of saying we have
maternity option that's what it seemed
like what is this an odd thing this is
it all your woman well you know it's
okay sit back and relax um cuz that's
what Samsung does this is weird man a
release in these sort of pit like you
know HR rap videos we need HR evidence
again again it's all about like that
meeting where they're all like all the
important people are sitting down there
like this is how we're gonna do it we're
gonna get mad clown he's a friend yeah
and as we're gonna have him record this
this rap video and tell you know quarter
of a million people that work for this
company all about all about the ongoings
and he is rapping in English
so which which means it where the
audience or the will know so Sam
Samsung's got offices here yeah they
were offices everywhere so I'm just
curious are there more wraps that are in
different languages elsewhere today we
can only hope i'm hoping this like a
comedy we can only is gonna be a country
version is gonna be like this is this is
this rap version there's gotta be a scar
version you know there's a scholar
covers I don't get it so is this an
internal video like a like their HR
video or something like that oh yes is
no it is well this is they release this
they have a channel on YouTube call
samsung tomorrow right oh they want us
to see this so they yeah they've this is
probably stay they didn't want to keep
it public let's drive it it wasn't like
somebody with a go look at this thing
like those microsoft videos i got out
this was released and it even has the
tag on the top samsung TV tomorrow like
it's what's funny go down go back to
lyrics if you go down like the second to
last verse it's like a very strange i
guess they just couldn't transcribe it
well it just sort of says like we're
just letting our dreams come true
this is what is it there's this
 it's like make it shine let a
smile well well it does actually
have two captions so i guess thats i
respect that man that's mad real yo it's
mad real mad clown oh my clan you keep
it so real why are they I think spend
money on this don't matter there and
they lost some money right there are
they losing ground they had a really
crappy quarter and maybe this is why
they're like well you know you know what
that we had back or do we know what to
do we know what to do we're gonna get
mad clown like you mentioned her end
like they had like all these are like
all do he's just streamline the galaxy
line we just offer two phones instead of
30 and then med clowns names up there
you know that you know he's an option
he's always an option maybe like he's
like he's their ultimate plan B when
something goes wrong they're like mad
clown get out of your box samsung if
you're listening and you're not you are
uh I have one request and that request
is for you to bring mad clown to CES
2015 will have him on the 404 I promise
you
I'd love to me I wouldn't okay and
here's what i'll do i'll throw in i will
try to draw this stuff as fast as they
do in the video so when he's rapping I'm
gonna draw me try just like this okay
I'll draw stick figures we do is gonna
be rapping about the best 4k TVs and I
like just draw for Kay's yeah to be
freaking awesome it will pay mad clown
for his time numbers travel usual rate
of twenty dollars an hour these paid in
notes Thank Galaxy Notes only no that'd
be great though to have mad clown on the
stage right dis explain this is like
what did they do like hey sir I wonder
if he is he like a well-known talent out
there no is this like a bad idea look my
hip hop barometer sitting 10 feet away
intrusion if arias and heard of him guys
nothing yeah he's no one yeah I don't
know about who's big outside of the US
but I sure have never heard of him ever
did you know when he was just slightly
angry clown maybe and why change his
name ornery clown he was just donnery
that's a great west LA over this line
the day he seems like a man yeah bill of
you are it sounds like a medical sounds
like a freaking man um alright this is
we're gonna end things with a strange
story tell us about the tricycle as
opposed to the release normal stories
talk about yes a normal show the times
has your times has his piece about the
revival of adults tricycles right there
you you when you see a the revival you
act like there was once a renaissance
apparently there was when it first came
out in the 1800 a lot of people took
this women took to tricycles because
they didn't fall over is a lot easier to
ride at the time follow seriously you're
right i'm inventing stuff to fall
tricycle it very takes a lot of freakin
were you gonna have to try yeah you
gotta hit occur turn real real hard so
Emily Stokes wrote this as she used to
have a tricycle back when she was in
University no garden okay University
episode you may like when she had a
fisher-price no practical like when we
all have this is a fancy thing called up
Ashley which is a British company that
makes these bikes and trikes and it was
a big deal in the 1880s so she'd started
riding this thing around and she was
wondering hey I wonder what would happen
if I started riding this thing or
New York because it seems like it's just
prime for revival because apparently
emporiums burg its prime for the UK that
their people are moving towards
tricycles and she's because it's a
safety thing I don't know what the draw
is cuz iono they're not as fast as a
bike there and they're dis ungainly and
hard to move like Liam upstairs and
stupid you need two people to care the
damn thing you ever see one fold up not
yet not yet not yet that's the next
thing but the idea was she's like well
if it caught on in the UK maybe it'll
catch on in New York which she makes
this huge leap like no that's true
hipster started in London is that what
happened totally ok yeah you know that
no I mean they just called them assholes
over there I'm serious did they importa
them here yeah we call him hipsters they
call them asshole so switch who got pure
oh no I'm sorry dick it we got purim
dickhead from the UK that's wonderful
and so she started to write riding her
bike around New York got a lot of looks
um doesn't really explain how again this
would work but she says this this is a
quote from her article we'd all ride
tricycles if the world were better if
bike lanes were wider and if we weren't
in such a hurry trike slow you down then
take your mind off of other things in
fville asif ain't gonna fly man-- n do
you think if the bike lanes were wider
now we don't trikes no to definitely not
is thinking of this is simply what I do
not believe will take off on the island
of Manhattan perhaps in Brooklyn you
think it would work a little yeah I
cancion lends itself to this kind of
malarkey yeah but I don't look so some
hipster stuff turns into mainstream
stump or not the trikes I don't think
twice could ever look like I think
trikes are doomed like unicycle not
making fun of tricycles are cool
whatever I get the idea I have terrible
balance I could sure I could get on this
idea sure this is the idea of like
mountain bikes not for me you want to go
slow what I have like an area we can
like put your groceries and stuff I get
it gotcha but where the hell are you in
a parka thing what are you gonna do with
this and where on earth is there ever
been a person who looked cool on a
tricycle other than they can in the
shine and cool these people don't care
about looking cool know what they're
trying to do other than what the shining
kid on the shining is pretty cool in the
most like horror well yeah
you know I'm with you man it's it's a
strange it's a strange thing Arielle mr.
who had his bike stolen recently yes do
you think if you had a tricycle an adult
tricycle huh it would not have gotten
stolen due to the fact it is cumbersome
and ridiculous nobody would steal that
it's also very identify all you will you
will single-handedly thwart bike
pilfering that street is add a third
wheel on it I don't think this would
work anywhere to be honest totally
because the the biker community is so
like strong and how on bikes in general
they even hate city bikes you know
anything new entering their bike lane
they won't allow it said guarantee no
way scooter people and bike people
probably don't get along buy a scooter
people but on the razor's man know what
did I see way too many adults adults
I've seen I usually see the them when
they're chasing like a kid who's also on
this oh no you know I haven't seen
people commuting in in razors yeah no
yeah dude you re oh I've seen it I've
seen in a while though but I have seen
it really as the other two votes I seen
a lot in San Francisco yes san
Francisco's a lot by the fair embrace
the rage is real it's real so we would
need is uh as there are the tricycle
versions of scooters they have ones that
too in the back now Oh Who it simply
doesn't matter no I don't see I just
