franklin your guest host this week and
welcome to rumor has it the show where
we round up the week's biggest tech
rumors and vote on what sounds like
it'll actually happen and what's
probably BS and remember that you can
vote on all of the rumors in the pull in
the interactive player if you're
watching on Cena first up two of the
worst-kept tech secrets get possible
release dates according to display
search will see a new iPad Mini as early
as a third quarter of this year
featuring a 2048 x 1536 Retina display
not to be completely outdone word from
the same source says to expect the nexus
7 follow-up largely rumored to be
unveiled at Google i/o in May to feature
a 1920 x 1200 resolution screen which
equals a crazy PPI for a 7-inch tablet
you know what else is really crazy the
fact that I've been covering tablets for
like two years and have yet to burn out
that and the fact that you just got away
with saying crazy PP on camera in
appropriate next up a couple of days
after the insane launch of Samsung's
Galaxy s4 some leaked specs popped up
for the possible next google phone the
LG Nexus 5 seems like really good timing
or it seems like a troll but either way
the site android and me claims to have
received an unverified tip that Google
plans to release the Nexus 5 phone
around October and is currently
evaluating prototypes from multiple
manufacturers including one from LG
that's code name Megalodon mega mega
ladon Megalodon yeah the specs on
Megatron read like a fanboys wet dream
Snapdragon 800 CPU and a 16 megapixel
back camera that wait for it can shoot
4k video yeah if it actually shoots 4k
video then megaphone or whatever it's
called will cost like five thousand
dollars we haven't even seen many
prosumer cameras that can shoot 4k let
alone a phone yeah even though this is
based on a name of a prehistoric shark I
wouldn't hold my breath this rumor is
going to sink
this rumor will sleep with the fishes it
smells fishy next Panasonic a name
synonymous with quality plasma TVs may
be leaving plasma TVs japan-based
newspaper Nikkei says that plasma TVs
just don't sell as well as lcds and that
Panasonic is losing billions as a result
the company is apparently thinking of
dropping plasma TVs all together because
while it's making tons of high-quality
plasmas people just aren't buying them
it's like when people chose VHS /
Betamax or VHS / laserdisc or the
Gameboy over the atari lynx or the 2600
over in television or quadraphonic sound
or digital audio tapes the list goes on
and on but there is an important
takeaway here that we're constantly
choosing inferior technology throwing
into question our own self-worth as a
society that and the fact that I just
got through a list of underrated tech
without once mentioning the apple newton
Oh finally Apple seems to be in a bit of
a funk but Morgan Stanley analyst Katy
Huberty predicts that there will be a
comeback according to her the iphone 5s
will have a killer feature that will
raise the company back into our good
graces and we will have a million parade
celebrating the wonder that is Apple I
mean a really cool and useful feature
like Siri or maybe mean a feature that
once the novelty of it wears off no one
will ever use oh I see what you did
there what do you guys think will the
iphone 5s have a killer feature will it
just be a little better or faster than
iphone 5 what do you think this killer
feature could be don't forget to vote or
leave a comment and then we'll see what
the cnet council thinks the cnet council
is composed of five editors who cast
their votes anonymously their opinions
are not an endorsement by cnet or CBS
Interactive obviously because these are
rumors folks and the cnet councils
verdict is a very close no three editors
said that it won't have a killer feature
and two editors are holding out hope
that's our show everybody please share
your rumors that rumor has it at cnet
com or call us at 1 800 750 cnet and
tweet us and thanks to this week's
co-host Eric
