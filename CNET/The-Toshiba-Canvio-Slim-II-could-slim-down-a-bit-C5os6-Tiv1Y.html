Toshiba can vo sleep to portable drive
now I happen to know a thing or two
about slim and thin my hair for example
that Athene and my my arm right here
that is sleep that's that this slim to
drive here is not as slim as cracked up
to be because in fact I actually have
review other drive like a Seagate go
flicks slim right here that's a lot
slimmer as you can see here so if you're
looking for something ultra slim this is
not what you want and that is the bad
news the good news that is the only bad
news but the drive the rest is either
good or very good now first up this is a
USB 3.0 Drive and it comes with this
single cable right here which the only
thing you need to make it work in my
testing it was very fast offering up to
118 megabyte per second and that's very
fast because at that speed you can
finish a CD with up data in just seven
seconds or the whole DVD worth of data
some 4.7 gigabyte in exactly forty point
eight seconds and 4.8 second happen to
be the amount I can hold my breath like
this very impressive indeed and that's
more the dry is pre formatted in NTFS
file system for Windows which means when
apply to a Mac the Mac can read it but
not write to it
however on the drive here you'll find
the NTFS software driver and once
install it allows the Mac to also write
to the drive very smart there's also
software for backup password protection
and the whole suite of Pogoplug PC that
turn a computer into the online server
for data sharing and storage it's also
10 gigabyte of Pogoplug online storage
for you to grab free with this drive now
the drive here also what would you speed
2.0 port and it has a very nice way of
telling you what port you're using it
with as a light right here that turns on
when you plug in and flashes when
there's a data activities
if the color is white you're using it
with USB 2.0 the colors blue is USB 3.0
is very clear unless of course you can
apply in that case do what I do get 4.7
gigabyte there together and hold your
breath
remember forty point eight seconds
you know this is an external drive that
Tollywood is price of $100 for one
terabyte or $75 for 500 gigabyte for
more check out my in-depth with us said
calm I guarantee the review will not be
shower and that's because I'm down low
and this has been the first look at the
Cameo slim - poor bowdry from Toshiba</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
