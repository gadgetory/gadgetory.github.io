SSD from SanDisk so what's so extreme by
this one well first is extremely large
ok it's not huge but compared to this
Samsung t3 right here well you can see
the difference now the sand is here has
1.92 terabyte and this one here has to
tear by and take a look extremely large
the second is also extremely fast in my
testing you got to sustain real moon
copy speed up some 350 megabyte per
second now that's as fast as can be for
the solid-state drive on the inside the
drive here has a USB C port on the side
right here it comes with two cables one
of them is app you use PC cable right
here for newer devices and the other one
is a compatible PC cable here so that
the drive can work with all existing USB
ports now the extreme 900 has a little
casing with rubber edges that protect
the drive on the inside again sharks and
drop you also include security software
to protect the data against loss or
theft and it has a one more very special
feature that even more effective against
theft and loss that is the price now the
top capacity of 1.92 tear by here costs
some $800 and for something that
expensive your lady would make sure you
would not lose it or else
now you know this to drive here the
Xtreme 900 and the Samsung t3 are very
similar in terms of performance pricing
and feature but if you want something
that's also appear substantial and
ostentatious this end is here has a huge
advantage so if you drive a Humvee this
is the portable drive for you on the
other hand if you're extremely
good-looking sexy and especially modest
you have them both which I do less early
because you guessed it I'm dumb</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
