this one slots one from the top just
below the Impala it's the Malibu and it
goes head-to-head with serious
competition in fact the toughest in the
industry Accord Camry Fusion Sonata
Chevy says this guy is good enough to do
battle with all of those in 100
countries where they'll sell it let's
see if their confidence is well placed
and check the tech now Chevy will tell
you the new Malibu is picked up some
styling DNA from the Camaro I don't
really see it except for perhaps these
kind of powerful haunches over here
square lens tail lamps and it mimics
that with square pods for the speedo and
the tack inside more interestingly this
car looks a lot like the new Impala
check that one out oh and check out the
front it's got an automatic shutter on
the bottom air grille that will close
when the engine doesn't need the cooling
to improve aerodynamics the first thing
I see inside the cabin of this Malibu is
no cheap plastic crap they did a really
good job catching up with Ford and
Hyundai in particular with the exception
of GM's typical tendency to go over
heavy-handed on the chrome your center
console is rather Chevy Volt like but
doesn't have the touch-sensitive panel
these are all real buttons thankfully
I'm not a big fan of this touch
sensitive stuff when it comes to buttons
key though is an interesting example
this car is part of this new trend
toward feature radios this is an LCD
screen head unit you would think it's
got everything in it but there's
actually no navigation this is sort of a
basic interface whether you have nav or
not hit this little switch right here
and the whole thing flips up where your
connected phone can live back there nice
little light to see what's in there
unfortunately no power connector
wouldn't it be nice to have a 12-volt
outlet in there instead I can put a
charger down here and have a cable
string down across my center console No
thank you now playing is an interesting
shortcut I kind of like Oh they've got
that hardwired in here your energy
screen we'll get to later that shows you
what your powertrain is doing it's a big
part of this car story we have Bluetooth
hands-free of course standard as well as
streaming Bluetooth stereo audio on this
car here is Pandora put the Pandora app
on your phone and the Chevy MyLink
technology in here
brings the interface up on the cars -
and blanks it out on your smartphone and
of course we have the usual CD USB aux
Jack's over here there's that bluetooth
streaming I was talking about so it's a
well featured system but if you want to
add naff to this you pay about a
thousand dollars and you get an SD card
that plugs into a slot that we would
also have if we got that option and that
graphs in navigation otherwise you're
stuck with the standard OnStar
directions and connections I hate having
a conversation with someone to get my
directions although it probably works
better than the voice command in this
car
help I am sorry I did not catch that
it's crappy like in most cars and
nowhere near as good as in most
smartphones so auto industry
you still got to catch up one choice
only 6-speed Automatic right here plenty
of Chrome on the top and this little
rocker switch on the top is your
shiftable one when you put it back in
manual that will change your gears
otherwise leave it and drive no paddles
no slapstick nonsense as it shouldn't
have
check out this gauge the Eco gauge
inside the tach is also part of a new
trend that will show you when you're
either braking or accelerating too
aggressively both are toxic to your mpg
a message that most drivers have never
heard before but car makers are starting
to bubble that up with this kind of
gauge now we have an interesting story
in positioning here on this car this
Chevy Malibu eco has a 2.4 liter engine
with an electric motor assisting it what
does that sound like that's a hybrid
folks but you won't find a hybrid badge
anywhere on this Malibu
you see Chevy knows that hybrids are
getting into weird territory for most
car buyers so they don't call it that
but that's what it is 2.4 liter gas
engine 180 to total horsepower 172
foot-pounds of torque it's also got auto
start/stop technology when you come to a
stop at a lighter in traffic that adds
up to a total of 25 37 mpg or about 29
average
all the boy racer car magazines kind of
jump on this one saying you know doesn't
have enough performance I'm looking for
real-world performance in a car like
this around town on the freeway back in
the city and I find that it does a very
nice job on that and yeah I'm happy with
the start stop the start stop on this
car works almost imperceptibly which is
exactly what it should do and it's quick
off the throttle when you lift and
you're getting ready to use power again
it gets it gets the car back up and
running there will be a two and a half
liter non hybrid version of this car
coming as well as a 2.0 liter turbo I
understand
we'll check those out when they get here
but I would not hesitate to buy this
powertrain right now if this fits the
kind of car you're looking for
okay a 2013 Malibu eco the only
powertrain they're selling at first is
twenty six thousand base but it's nicely
equipped and it has that color touch
Chevy MyLink head-unit bass as well as a
lot of other nice features for about
thousand dollars you can add navigation
through an SD card because it's so cheap
I would do it if it was two grand I'd
say forget it and another thousand
dollars all a cart will get you a saloon
