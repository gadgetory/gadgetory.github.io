excited to welcome our next guest this
man is the chief creative officer at
barco escape he's also the resident
futurist at 20th Century Fox how do I
apply for that job yeah we're so excited
to have ten shillin was here with us we
might have some openings you never know
I'm interested you need an assistant
future right everybody third assistant
futures in fact we have a whole team of
people that are kind of on the on the
curve with us that are figuring things
out so this is the futurist so we'll
talk about that and then we'll talk
about barco because you have some really
exciting stuff happening a whiff to
start Trek beyond this weekend um so
let's talk a little bit about the the
title futurist because to me this seems
like a really cool sexy mysterious job
and I want to know what the day-to-day
entails because to me the idea of being
a futurist means you're sort of a think
tank about the future and you go listen
20th Century Fox I think the future is
going to have way more robots than this
so you need to put more robots into this
movie sort of um it's a little more
pedestrian than that I I often refer to
myself as a glorified lab rat um I'm a
guy who's constantly we have a bunch of
labs one of our labs is called the
bunker the VR bunker or it's like this
little staircase and I wanna live in the
bunker you can we rent it yeah is it
ready come over visit over to visit now
and when you talk about it it sounds
like we built the Batcave you know it's
like the most amazing place in the world
when you go to it there's a bunch of
technology inside a room a bunch of VR
and AR stuff a bunch of monitors a bunch
of future thinking stuff but it's just a
dark room we're really come from with
that but then we're sort of spread out
all over the lot we have a big theater
on the lot where we experiment with
stuff with the barco escape stuff we
have an area in the the tower you know
the not the Nakatomi tower is the Fox
innovation lab where are you alone Bruce
Willis over and over again to repay our
adjusted perfect so you're not it's not
that you are advising filmmakers about
what the future is going to be to put in
their movies it's that you are
developing technologies to expand and
improve
the ways we appreciate yeah they all
kind of dovetail together but but it's
more the second one it's more looking at
what is around the next corner like
what's around the bend here that may
become important relevant and
extraordinarily valuable for the
entertainment industry and what we've
done over the past few years since I've
kind of taken on this very odd and
interesting job is really driven Fox
into the forefront of the conversation
of being the studio that is the most
forward-thinking the most what I call
lean forward as opposed to lean backward
not afraid of taking risks not afraid of
figuring things out not afraid of seeing
what are the things that people are
working on in the dark corners that are
going to become things and interestingly
enough the timing of me joining fox when
I left this movie camera company read
when I retired from that and my one of
my friends at 20 Century Fox is the
president of post-production there who's
part of this little posse of pioneers as
in Ted Galliano said come and be the
futurist at the movie studio and just
you know you kind of have your eyes and
ears on a lot of things and you've
always been sort of on the forefront of
this stuff share helping build stuff and
start companies and figure things out
would you be willing to do that for the
movie studio and essentially help guide
us a little bit into what might be
relevant right what's and the timing was
really interesting because a lot of this
VR stuff started to happen right around
that time so I was very early on with
the oculus guys very own element the
valve team and HTC team and the Sony
team and the Samsung team and Microsoft
and haul ends and the small group called
odg that's doing next-gen a our stuff
that we're working on and that those are
just the highlights and there's drawings
more out there that were so excited but
all day long I just experiment and have
these various things on my face or in an
immersive cinema experience with barco
the first two movies we did with barco
escape or to fox movies the first two
major run of movies now we're really
successful and now of course we're on
the cusp of Star Trek beyond an escape
so let's talk a little bit about barco
escape because I think a lot of people
probably don't know that a it exists
because there's so few theaters that can
play barco escape content and then on
top of that you know what what you guys
have planned for it's a little bit like
I max where it's sort of a cinematic
experience you know just never going to
get it home and so it's one of those
things that you have to see sort of
appreciate but for those people out
there who are not familiar with bar
escape explain a little bit about what
that is and why it's so intense as a
film as a moviegoer to to see it so
you're right so the footprint is
relatively small it's a it's a new
format so those you know a generation
from now we'll be telling our kids and
our grandkids remember when they were
just like 30 or 40 theaters around the
world that you could see this in before
it became the thing right brand so
that's where we are now which is kind of
a romantic time to be involved in
something new and exciting but in terms
of what it is what what what you will
see when you go to a movie theater so
it's a three screen experience instead
of a one screen experience your of
course familiar with going to the movies
and the movie is essentially from when
movies have been created up until now a
hundred years have basically been
something like this some geometric form
whether was a small right to my face or
a really big box of fun of your face
sure which are very exotic and great and
you know I max is aware barcode does all
the underlying technology for but for
imax projection and so we're a big fan
of that and collaborate with them a lot
this is something even more different
and more special than that for an out of
the home experience so instead of the
movie just being in front of you it
actually surrounds your periphery and we
bring you into certain scenes of the
movie when it's appropriate to really
take advantage of this let's go all the
way and not just be watching a screen
but actually kind of inside the
experience so the film's actually have
to be shot with this in mind right not
necessarily in the case of Star Trek
it's actually because it's such a CGI
VFX heavy movie all of the most there's
some augmented stuff with cameras but
most of the material is actually created
in post-production vs mr. thing with all
the space battle scenes and all the epic
action scenes and all the stuff that you
know so all the things you expect when
you've seen a regular screening of the
movie imagine all those key moments when
it's not just this it's this is this
something that later on can be then
applied into a VR environment yeah that
you can then be looking around you later
on at home yes in fact it's very often
referred to barco escape is very often
referred to in the trade now that we
have a trade for this stuff as bricks
and mortar VR we know that you still
like to socialize we know that people
like this they like real connection and
they like to sit with their popcorn in
their candy and enjoy the experience and
VR is you know somewhat isolating
experience although we're working on
social is
right of course that's a bit of a
telling you one story but there's
actually another story there to where
your will become a very social thing
which is part of my facebook would be
interested in having VR around as a as a
technology sure but within the theater
environment this is sort of the most
immersive most VR like experience and we
know that with modern audiences once you
get a taste for something that what we
call breaks out of the rectangle well
that's in something you're going to put
on your face or some sort of glassware
or some sort of theme park style
experience you want more of that you say
I want something that separates from the
home experience I can get really good
big screen at home yeah I want something
different I want literally something
that's more like I went to a theme park
but I could go every friday night every
said Saturday afternoon every Sunday
morning with my family don't have to
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars
to get on a plane and go to orlando or
you know or Los Angeles from far away
but go to my local multiplex and have
this kind of immersive theme park style
experience in a movie it's interesting
that you mentioned that because I think
that's one of the things the movie
industry has struggled with I think a
little bit historically as televisions
have gotten bigger and cheaper and
higher def and we have seen more and
more streaming content come into homes
people go well why should I go to the
movies why it's I can get that on my
70-inch TV that I bought a Best Buy last
week for two grand you know um and I
think it's really interesting that
you're out you guys are always looking
for the the what's next of bringing
people into the theater not only as a
like you said a social experience
because that's always when I like to go
see movies where you go in on opening
weekend and people are cheering and
there I mean they're just having a great
time people who are really into that
movie are there to see it buzzed right
it's the buzz you get to experience that
the highs and lows of you know and with
everybody else a very collective social
experience really interesting um but
you're also kind of now having to not
only give movie overs that experience
but also the visual experience to go
with it and that make people say hey I
want to come back to this or I want to
do this more often because it's not
something I could get in my house I know
that you know going to see a Chris Nolan
movie in imax there are those moments
which yeah yeah van onto the screen is
that kind of the same experience here is
that there are certain scenes where I'll
just in develop you yes similar but way
more intense than just going from here
to here because they were just expanding
the square it spending
which by the way I love and it's part of
the information there's nothing wrong
about all these other experiences
instead of expanding vertically or you
go swing weight all around you right so
essentially a 180 view all around there
was a moment at comic-con a few years
ago where that was done in all age is
that this is similar similar and there
and they're doing that again you're
going to see some stuff around movies
because in areas other than a movie
theater other than a multiplex where you
can expand that vision and you have the
budget to expand that vision like a
theme park like a big convention like
comic-con this happens big trade shows
do this all the time like if you go to
the e3 gaming show you'll see they'll
set up fig.3 set up a bunch of barcode
projectors in the do this kind of thing
our mission was to take that to
everybody so not just people that work
in the industry or if you're lucky
enough to go to comic-con and be an all
age and weight eight hours to do that
experience right with your luck
unbelievable yeah I'm lucky to be
working in the industry and I can go and
do that stuff and I just I'm so
impressed with those people that are so
committed to that entertainment those
are core customers that want to see
Blanco sk sure they don't want a normal
experience right they want a special
experience right they wanted to go to
see it the best possible way and in the
most fun environment and what we're
doing is is expanding that footprint to
every city around the world is the plan
so we'll have we have a little over 30
theaters now for barco escape worldwide
so essentially what i like to say is if
you're a fan super fan you can get
likely anywhere in the united states now
you can get on a less than an hour
flight and find a barco escape or likely
drive less than an hour to a couple of
hours which people will easily do if you
live in any major population area give
or take you're going to find one with an
easy striking distance we have two in LA
we have a couple up in the bay area in
northern california we have one in palm
springs area we have a bunch in texas we
have one in Minnesota we have you know
and and all over the US if you go to a
website called ready to escape so ready
the number to escape okay just Google
barco escape it'll give you you'll see a
listing and then you can click and go to
your local theater and buy tickets and
it'll tell you which one because it'll
be the regular version the IMX version
the big screen digital version and then
the barcode escape approach is the end
goal to have the entire film shot like
this it's one of the goals so we're I
think it works better
as shorter moments I think it's project
a project just like any other sort of
creative entity there's no one right way
to skin the cat there's no one right
approach to it so with Star Trek what's
a little over 20 minutes those key
battle action scenes which totally lend
themselves and try not to give it anyway
but you know the big climax scene in
them I knew what happens there if so
imagine that visualize yeah just like we
were doing our final QC what's called QC
quality control screens last night at
three in the morning because these
things are coming in hot like finishing
up the last day with the team from bad
robot and it's just insane right when
that music kicks in I imagine if it's
are all around you it's no at 3 45 a.m.
last night I'd say they're like this is
the best there's only five hours like
I'm up at three four out two creations
of the producer this is worth it it was
awesome if you could retcon any movie in
tabarka escape what would you do whoo
well we're working with Jerry
Bruckheimer okay we've talked about
redoing Top Gun an escape route oh my
god that would be awesome we've been
talking to Michael Bay we've been
talking a lot of really big a level
filmmakers we've had them all into the
theater they've all seen stuff all the
major studios are interested you know
because they're Explorer it's so
immersive yeah I now as you said I mean
everyone's looking for that next thing
and it's really interesting to see sort
of barco taking the lead in terms of
saying hey guys like we've we have got
this locked down we're experimenting on
everything and we feel this is the way
for this is the really cool thing that
people want yeah sorry I said we would
tell you that we're not the ones that
know all the answers to any of this
right it's a creative process we take in
lockstep and hopefully fall one half a
step behind the creator's behind the
people in at bad robot in this case and
behind the people at Fox in the other
cases where we want to make sure that
the technology drives the story not the
other way around right it's sorry the
story drives the technology not the
technology driving the story shall and
its really really important and when you
see Star Trek you'll see how that works
the other thing that's really critical I
think is that we're taking this and
putting it in normal movie theaters all
around the world so there'll be 100 by
year's end and then we move to thousands
in a couple of years and it's just one
of those formats that you're like this
is the movie
see working as you're asking about
production and stuff we're working on
two new movies now one that's shooting
in South Africa called 24 hours to live
with Ethan Hawke in it in his big movie
they're shooting big action scenes and a
moving up in Canada called recall
there's a bunch of cinemas in canada
with cineplex theaters and imagine
theaters so canon has also got their
share to france or an experience yeah
totally yep so we're all over the
footprints quite large I can't wait to
see it and in person myself I guess
sounds really really cool and it's uh I
get to go see it this weekend yeah
you're initiating Marcus key tomorrow so
I'm very excited I can't wait to see it
well I know yeah Tetzel what's everybody
thank you so much for being here um
where can I you already said it's what's
the website again for ready to escape
remember chamber the number two or just
google barco escape you'll find it and
likely you're within striking distance
of getting to one of these theaters now
and for the next couple years are out
there'll be one in every day there'll be
more there'll be more you guys uh so
that is it for our interview thank you
so much for stopping by and we'll send
you our resumes for those assistants you
for this job is good be right back guys
with more tomorrow daily so stick around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
