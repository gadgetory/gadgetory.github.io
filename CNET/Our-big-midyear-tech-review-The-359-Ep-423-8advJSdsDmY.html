Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred Inge so we're
gonna have an extra extended episode of
359 one with breakdown 2018 so far it's
been such a hectic year already with so
many different headlines we just figured
why not break down the top ten stories
here so far in case you've been in a
coma and you just woke up and wanted to
know hey what are all the tech stories
going on this year we've got you covered
there you go in case you've never
watched the show before this would be a
good first episode to jump into know
we're actually a lot better usually I
promise
so while we get right into it in reverse
order from least to most important
number 10 rise of the notch copycat
zones
some of the LGG 7 talk about the 1 plus
6 they're just the slew of phones with
the knotch and that was a thing that
drove a lot of people crazy now we're
seeing so many I thought they should
have been number one this this is
probably the most important story of me
I feel like I feel bad for number 11 now
what this horrible choice rise of the
knotch
rise of the knotch I thought it was
really funny though cuz like when when
Apple first announced like the iPhone 10
everyone's like what does I hate that
thing it's like gross but then like
everyone started copying and I still
don't understand why I mean it just goes
oh hey it goes to show you how effective
Apple's branding is because they've
somehow convinced everyone that the
notch is something worth buying like
it's a it's a status symbol like oh you
were able to afford this really ugly
phone which it's like really I own as
well but it's like how crops are cool
now they actually are they like rocks
are rocks are truly cool again again
what do you mean they were we're all de
nice to know they were super popular
back in the day before they when they
stopped being cool and now they're cool
again yeah rocks are trendy now moxtra
trendy back and they before they went
public
what about like they were like fashion
trendy they were like dad trendy dad's
wait is that the same watch your mouth
dad cool
without yeah but I would say the notch
is like the equivalent of that like it's
it's like everyone fashioned cooler dad
cool I think that when it came out
people thought that it was dad cool but
now it's I don't I don't think it was
dad no I thought it was I think it came
when it came out it was fashion cool I
think the biggest loser in this scenario
is essential with their notch right
because they're not choose weight less
obnoxious they're not it's a little
small not judgmental it was not much
preferred that notch like that notch
made sense to me it's not unlike
unfortunately when you want to pack in
multiple cameras front face cameras and
sensors you've got a big notch like the
iPhone 10 notch
alright let's move on let's let's not
dwell on the knotch number 9 Samsung O's
Apple half a billion dollars
theoretically this is the conclusion to
this long-running legal battle but it's
a radical I don't think it's gonna end
was this over copying the knotch no
Samsung is that's the thing Samsung is
the one company not to go back to the
notch again but they're the one the one
big company that has refused to go
knotch can I just ask you one knotch
related question on top sure so you have
the iPhone 10 does it not bother the
hell out of you doesn't you actually
just start to like get used to the notch
you get a notch vision we're all right
next up number 8 bitcoins dramatic rise
and fall then you can you've been
covering they're closer than most of us
all saw it coming we all knew really how
much money this company to pay me in
Bitcoin and it was there were people in
the mainstream media in the established
media all like the bankers and
everything everybody they heard you know
you should be listening to but they're
too dad cool for you to bother we're all
saying this is a bubble it has no actual
value do not buy it when it hits close
to $20,000 and they were right it was it
was so obviously a bubble and so it's
just the mania has kind of died down a
bit what about what about dogecoin and
all those other coins they still exist
and they're probably gonna find like
some but the money I put there
safe right yeah yeah apparently they're
all like caving now okay but like though
it's volatile they go up they go down
I think Bitcoin will continue having
value to it and I don't know we'll see
but I think 20,000 may have been a
little rich well yet no at seven
thousand six thousand yeah Wow
it literally goes down as I say right
the moment I say it sorry sorry it's
already lost them thousand dogs so next
up a political one Trump took a little
while to get on the list but president
are present coming in and shockingly
helping ZTE Chinese company of all of
all things trying to save Chinese jobs
as opposed to American jobs okay so
you're the one that's been writing a lot
about this why would Trump want to do
something like this
so ZTE has spent a significant amount
and believe it's like half a billion on
components and products and services
from US companies guys like Qualcomm
like Texas Instruments Broadcom I'm not
to mention using Google services right a
lot of the the core parts of Android
well Android itself is also be open
things like Google Play there are
aspects of it that Google owns and
controls so when the commerce department
came and slapped us ban on ZTE
preventing any American business from
doing work or selling services to them
was basically a death sentence it's just
surprising that Trump who's just made
such a big big stink about American jobs
American companies stepped in and said
hey we need to save ZTE that's sort of
fun with saving but if I'm following
what you're saying
helping ZTE in effect helps us
coorporate that that has been the
argument I don't know that he made that
argument very effectively in public but
you certainly did so well done I mean
there's nowhere that there's still like
a major push from like the Congress to
like reenact this ban though and the
like citing a lot of security concerns
basically making the argument that like
by allowing CT to continue selling its
products in the u.s. that basically
opens up a channel for like Chinese
spies to use those devices to you know
spy it like just carry out like Chinese
operations
like on our network it's important oh
that mean they got in trouble for
selling products that contained us
technology to Iran and North Korea they
got they got hammered for that they got
they got they came to a settlement the
US for certain partners they failed to
enact all that line which is why they
situation right yeah it still seemed
pretty extreme to me that they would
their company could completely fail over
something like that but hey that's what
happened all right next up number six
Avengers couldn't get away with Avengers
was a huge cultural milestone people
everyone was talking about it sorry but
know I look good between Avengers and
Deadpool it seems like all the concerned
about comic book fatigue is overblown
hello Black Panther yeah exactly
I was the highest-grossing film of the
2018 so far I believe way more than
Avengers I think Avengers has already
surpassed it
okay you might be right love that yet to
whisper a check is the first time for
everything okay next seven four five
yeah any verse Laurel I know we had to
talk we have to talk about what did you
guys hear when Roger just said that what
did you hear by the way what war you're
responsible when you heard it I I wanted
I don't know if Brian's here for this
episode but I really enjoyed hearing his
take about this where he just got really
angry and he were just like it's just
it's just a trick with audio it's really
simple I don't know why everybody cares
about this so much still angry Wow way
tell me why you're that angry I mean it
was it's sort of a it's an illusion
right people were kind of freaking for
the audio equivalent of like is it a
rabbit or a duck it's just like this is
so stupid
that's my problem with it it's just some
silly stupid gimmick and I guess just I
don't want to tap my own back here to
her but I've worked on audio so long
that it was just like well this is
obvious what's going on here
and why did you tell us Brian he did yes
I wasn't that way I just like any time I
heard it which is like your father is
proud of you of what you're doing say oh
that's cool
sorry that's what was interesting I
think there was no no I heard the
opposite cause of disappointment there
was also another one that came out right
yes yields of Vianney versus world where
if you had it in your head that I'm
listening to it and it says this it
would say that and you're not really
I don't remember who's like powerplant
and Daisy yeah totally worked
and I thought that was more effective
one except that just because it came on
the heels of Yang vs. Laurel I love that
it's like somebody came up with a she's
gonna be awesome hell yeah oh this is
the next big thing and then it wasn't so
but thanks Dan for the tip next up a
little bit more serious note merger
mania still alive there were a lot of
deals last year this year we had 18 t
winning its case against the DOJ - by
Time Warner DOJ just approved the deal
between Disney and Fox and Sprint
t-mobile we're getting together so it's
like the adventures of companies yeah
it's just like I've become one company
that's not a good thing right well
neither was Avengers by well ventures
was great yeah I mean so wait why isn't
it a good thing uh fewer fewer potential
competitors means of these that are then
they could jack up the prices on
customers and surprise competition for
upstarts I mean it's it's basically why
we have anti monopoly laws but I guess
those don't really mean much no look the
government betwe least before this
previous administration under the under
Obama if it was a administration we had
the government which particularly with
wireless they were pretty adamant
against mergers between the four players
they wanted four national players
because it kept everyone honest kept
deals flowing kept prices lower
we'll see what-what Sprint t-mobile
looked like they made the argument like
they need to get together to build the
super 5g Network II which 5g by the way
I did not put in my top 10 list because
it's not here yet there's a lot of 5g
hype but it's really the same stuff
we've been hearing like it's coming and
it's amazing but we actually haven't
gotten it so if you're wondering 5 G's
not I thought number 5 would have been
5g yeah what the hell man yeah versus
Laurel man we were all talking about it
what if 5g came out but we were so busy
came out running out for a while just so
fast yeah Oh number three for night
that's the top of for night took over
everything took over the lives of most
children from what I understand like in
schools it's just basically that's all
they're doing I still have it into this
game I'm very excited to play it but I
haven't offered you're a huge floor 9
player um I'm not I've seen people play
it I've watched people play it I'm just
like this game really isn't for me I
mean you know I gotta give tip my hat to
them they made a free game and you know
are still able to make millions because
off everyone like hats and dances and
stuff like that's where most of their
money comes from but he games pretty fun
too I'm I'm not taking anything from it
I don't play it's not for me but I
played it a couple of times I put it on
my phone unfortunately for better worse
they incorporate everyone into the same
place so someone who's playing on the
computer can be playing against me
that's a real problem if I'm on my phone
because the controls are not that smooth
so you know a little shout-out to pub G
which came out with the Battle Royale
gameplay style I actually enjoy playing
that a little more because I don't die
as quickly it's also supposed to be like
more realistic right G was the bigger
deal last year and like that probably
would have been on your list had we been
doing this the same time last year we
did so sorry bub G number two net
neutrality laws and no more so the FCC
is finally official and the FCC had
rolled back the laws after many months
of
debates about fights that protests
gathered but gone there done
yeah when when are we gonna win when's
this tiered service gonna show up yeah
if you I'm eager to see if it's actually
gonna happen there are all these
concerns yes so this guy's gonna what
your what your what plan you're on if
you're on the podcast downloading a 3:59
plan yeah yeah or the social media plan
where that's how I get my all that that
that actual specific tearing would
actually happen I feel like there would
be enough of a consumer backlash that
how we wouldn't play well but I can see
subtle shifts over time it's the thing
that's these companies are smart they're
not gonna do anything drastic right away
you're gonna start to see changes over
time business models change some would
argue that they're they're good for
consumers the practices zero-rating for
instance gives you data free access
history that's some people would argue
that's a good thing but others would say
like this is also anti-competitive
because it puts you at gives you an
unfair advantage over everyone but there
is a chance of it coming back right so
they passed the vote in the Senate and
the Senate passed the congressional
review act
prom is it also still needs the house
and president Trump to sign off on it
and that seems really unlikely there are
gonna be lots of lawsuits that ties this
up we've got states like California
washed to New York I'll consider their
own net neutrality plan so this is a lot
this is a story that's long for a long
ways from ending there's still
definitely a lot of drama left a lot of
a lot of debate discussion yeah and then
lastly the the biggest store of the year
where'd you get more microphone for that
oh yeah there we go more notches no oh
no no no it's Facebook's Cambridge
Channel in the scandal of course how
could we not talk about that at the top
story of the first half of 2018 it was
bad it seemed like was there I don't
know as like because I pay attention or
a lot of privacy issues and like for me
this was one of those things like
finally like somebody's like this is
getting like the National like
tension that like I feel that it
deserves like Facebook for years have
been has been like harvesting data from
folks and I mean it's not just Facebook
I mean with the idea that like the
spotlight being on Facebook has also
brought a spotlight over like Google and
how much data they take which is
arguably much more than Facebook does
but I think you know this this does
suggest like much more awareness from
people now about like oh maybe I
shouldn't like upload this photo or
something like that because like
Facebook is gonna use that and make
money off of that by not selling info on
you but like by saying oh look there's a
dog in the photo this person probably
likes dog just put dog ads like direct
dog yeah it's towards them alright the
question though is is that actually
going to cause a shift in consumer
behavior or is it just a short-term bump
kind of like the hashtag delete uber
just gonna go back there was even a
short-term bump it seemed like they
didn't have any there was a zero
negative impact yeah you look at they're
like sure wasn't huge numbers exactly if
you look at the numbers like their users
yeah the bark was worse than the bite in
this scenario I think it's because well
unlike deleted uber like there's an
option there's not another option for
Facebook with ruber you do lyft you can
get a cab there are other options with
Facebook there are a few other places
that like contain all your information
in your social you could also just not
use Facebook you use Instagram Facebook
what whoa what's that come on there are
other alternative I mean like you do
have like Twitter and snapchat which are
like bigger they're publicly traded
companies they're not tiny or anything
they're not exist the same Twitter is
not a good alternative thing I mean
because either book is more personal to
your friends in your family either
it may not it's it's more public face
either way even like talking about
Twitter like if Twitter had the size
that Facebook did it would still be
taking your data so that's not like that
doesn't take away the issue at hand here
is that like your data is like literally
everywhere and and you know experts that
I've spoken to about this have basically
said like the only way that like your
data is ever gonna be private like
online is if there's like a monumental
shift in how the
works like I you choosing to pay for all
the content that you want that's why
Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg had
suggested like for us do not take data
on people
Facebook would have to be a paid
subscription model and it might be an
indication of like where the internet
would be headed but like that would be a
major shift in like how everyone
interacts with like what when they go
online
Alta Malay they don't wanna do that they
don't want our paychecks that's you hold
your growth immediately right and also
there's a lot of scrutiny like if I'm
paying for something all of a sudden
like I'm a lot less tolerant of issues
like this if I'm if I'm paying for you
know just you know what I just realized
what number eleven was that lost out to
knotch what GDP are we should totally
talk about that was part of the camera
gentle heart of games yeah okay I kind
of bundled them all together but that's
that's great your privacy stuff yeah
yeah I mean it was kind of coincidental
that like the gdpr stuff came around the
same time as because they had passed GDP
our last year like it was basically like
you have like a year or two but the
timing was kind of perfect right the
controversy lined up right when it took
effect
all right that was a magenta for a break
and we did it we solved the Internet
guys was number eleven GDP our well it
was number 11 with Huawei oh I'm glad we
left that off talking about knocking
that's right
