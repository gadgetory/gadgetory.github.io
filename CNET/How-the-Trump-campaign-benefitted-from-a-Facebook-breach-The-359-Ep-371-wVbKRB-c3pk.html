I'm Ben Fox urban I'm out for dang
Facebook is in trouble again
the company disclosed that user data
being used was being used by Cambridge
analytic a firm used by the Donald Trump
campaign to help target voters and now
the big question is how the data got
transferred from this I guess in
seemingly innocuous app to Cambridge
analytic Alfred you're here to break
this down what happened here yeah so you
know those quizzes that you always take
on Facebook that's like oh here's what
your personality is all of those quizzes
yes that's where all the data came from
so when you sign up for those quizzes
you're basically giving permission to
these apps like they can see your
profile they can see like your political
affiliation they can see who your
friends are and things like that
it happens it that's something that goes
across the board from all like
third-party apps that are on Facebook
and the idea is there they're an
agreement with Facebook like Facebook
allows them to exist on their website
but in return they can't use like these
this information for any like political
purposes or anything right now you can
still use for like advertising purposes
which is why they're they make money and
the app itself for the site was like
this is your digital life yeah yeah yeah
how long are they able to scrape your
data for like a week or is it you do the
yeah they pretty much have it and they
usually sell it to advertisers but in
this scenario they were able to keep it
and then somehow it got to Cambridge
analytical through through the the
person that developed this app and they
used it for political purposes when
Facebook found out they told them hey
you have to delete this and they said
they did and then you know on Friday
they made the announcement so actually
they didn't and that's why we're banning
them for this right so I mean look we
had a bunch of coverage over the weekend
I think the bigger question being asked
is Facebook is taking pains to kind of
blame this this app to trying to blame
Cambridge analytic huh but ultimately I
think a lot of the debate now is whether
or not Facebook is to blame for this
right I mean I would make the argument
that they are the fact that you know it
was designed in this way that you know
there's really no check for them to see
what they're using that day
for yeah first place it's kind of like
they're very optimistic about how people
are using data like taken off of
Facebook it's like okay just don't use
this for any like political purposes or
like they don't have any like safety
checks or something like that like and
it's just like do you really not think
that like oh somebody wants to find out
what like their personality color is
like why would they need to know like my
political affiliation traction data and
that was a big thing right it wasn't
just taking your data but all of your
friends yes total 50 million users were
affected yep all right so scary stuff
next up bloomberg has reported that
Apple is working on its own micro LED
display now micro LED we saw an example
of this at CES with Samsung with the
wall that giant 146 inch foot foot
television doesn't look so micro to me
what makes it so that's the thing the
tech the technology right now is it's
really difficult to shrink lul that
stuff it's actually why Samsung had this
giant wall they couldn't quite get it
down to phone size and so if Apple is
able to actually use this technology and
get it down to the size for a phone
that's actually a huge breakthrough and
it could mean that Apple would break its
dependence from suppliers like LG and
Samsung which already supply LCD screens
as well as OLED screens to iPhones now
from according to the report it's
important that you don't hold your
breath on this one yeah it's first
expected to show up in wearables and
unlikely to reach the iPhone in at least
three to five years yeah there's a lot
of challenges even ramp up production
for the iPhone I mean would take years
and and billions in investment having a
facility to actually make this stuff
mm-hmm
yeah and it's also important to remember
they did a huge investment in sapphire
yep potential displays like the display
covers and that never came to fruition
so it's interesting to hear that they're
doing this but there's no telling
whether it's actually gonna happen
alright for more of these stories check
us out at CNET I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben
Fox bourbon I'm Alfred Aang thanks for
listening and welcome back everybody I'm
gonna go ahead and start fishing through
the chat to get some more questions and
comments to keep the conversation going
in the meantime how it scary is this
Facebook stuff
every day every friggin day something
else stop taking quizzes on Facebook
stop using third party yet yeah exactly
I think the problem is that everybody
complained about those like BS
flashlight apps then all they did was
like scrape information yeah that's like
apps though like from the in-store
that's yeah yeah but that's like this is
this is one thing it's a flashlight and
then it's stealing all your information
or it's using it regularly the the fact
is is that those little quizzes like you
you you maybe you do them for five
minutes and the amount of information
that they're able to generate I would
say liken it to those flashlight apps
it's totally unnecessary usage of what
what it actually should be doing yeah
it's and and it's hard to like just
blame users for that's like say oh you
shouldn't have used like that app and
user and print I mean but no one reads a
fine print I still think a lot of this
fault like does fall on Facebook in the
way that you know they they wrote like
these rules that were like very
optimistic about it in a way where is
basically hey the optimistic was naive
maybe I would say a little bit of both
my religion like people people like
don't use this for political purpose or
don't like leaked this and then if it
does get leaked we really don't have
don't have a way to check if it does
yeah yeah and it's just it's just I
don't I don't understand this from
Facebook's perspect I mean that's that's
kind of like been their mo on a lot of
things when their platform gets abused
it's just we didn't think that it would
be used this way I think that's mean
you're seeing that that's the trend with
Facebook and really with mostly
companies it's like well just put out
this service first and we'll figure out
like what the consequences are later and
then we'll fix them we'll patch them
nobody will do anything bad with this oh
this part of Silicon Valley culture
right just go out and break things right
that's sort of the like we need a
disrupt we need to change things around
put out these new services we'll figure
out
the consequence the problem is that
these consequences are having massive
ramifications but politics with just the
way we live our lives right privacy I
agree with you on that it's also
important to recognize that Facebook it
like that's how they make money is
through advertising that's they generate
a lot of bad dollars by
Packaging our user data the data that's
that people readily give over to
Facebook and that in many ways isn't
going to change because that's that's
how then continued existed and that's
the thing that's why Facebook has been
very hesitant or actually just you know
complete in complete denial to call it a
breach they're basically saying this
isn't a breach these people willingly
gave up their information to like this
third party that makes them sound worse
yeah it's not a breach this they all did
everything legal technically we allow
all this stuff so yeah it's just it's
interesting that you know in something
like this what they're gonna get into
like the details on is semantics here or
where's like hey yeah that's not what it
was to be fair that mean the was at the
CTO Stamos they said that tweeted about
this he did delete I think he realized
later on well that just makes me sounds
yeah their marketing officer still his
tweets are still up something yeah yeah
do we have questions we can keep going
no let's go ahead and dive into the I
want a first and foremost thank
everybody for keeping it civil I know
politics is a hard thing to discuss
especially in the scenario like this
we're just trying to convey information
about the research that goes into some
of the data right that NASA that this is
something that was happening on Facebook
which everybody almost everybody uses
yeah so just thank you again for being
adults and being mature this is it's sex
here because its affiliated with Trump
but it's not necessarily about the
politics it's really about the fact that
our data was being used nice thing about
this though is that had Cambridge
analytic Oh made that quiz on their own
oh that like that yeah yeah none of it
would have been like illegal or like
stolen by any sense of it like the only
reason why in this scenario it's like so
scandalous I guess is because it was
like from this like group that had
nothing to do with Cambridge analytical
and they just gave it to them yeah how
do they put this quiz out on their own
they could have easily just harvested
this information themselves right
problem that's how easy it is to just
harvest the information and once it's in
someone else's hands I think you know
that I mean what would Alfred just
describing that is the bigger problem
yeah the fact that that could have
happened that can still happen
and that would be perfectly fine yeah
like you wouldn't get all this like big
buzz about it because like they wouldn't
have been suspended there wouldn't have
been like that many issues with it now
to be fair and Facebook's offense they
did close that loophole with the friends
data yes so it was back in 2015 I
believe they closed the loophole which
when you will you agree to like give up
your data like it's not taking your
friends did you do a quiz and they I
think my friends did but yes that's how
they were able to get fifty million
users just like it was maybe like
whatever cuz I'll be rolling on like 27
207 people but because of their networks
became 50 million scary right each one
of those the mind that that was okay
that that was considered to be fine
right and luckily they did close I mean
a lot of it is that they just I I mean
its Facebook didn't consider the
consequences they didn't consider the
ramifications until someone decided to
exploit it that's kind of that's the
bigger issue there the exploitation I
think is the most frightening part and
what is a seemingly an innocent Avenue
you know taking a silly quiz or
something like that right thing is
sacred anymore you know your grandma
playing candy crush is probably
compromised at this point so anyways we
want to go ahead and touch on the fact
that yes imagine Sagi is right they
misused of the data it's not truly a
data breach in this well it's a data
breach in a like you said in a broader
sense because the data was taken and
given without permission like they broke
rules and giving that data from whatever
yeah up to Cambridge analytics I would
classify it as a breach in the same way
that like people classify like Edward
Snowden's like data as a breach it
wasn't like he worked for them and he
like took it from them and like publicly
as I make it more of a breach of trust
no I think it is literally I think it's
literally a breach right like it's not
it's not like hackers were involved with
it was just handed over but it wasn't
intended for this other party yes I was
listening on NPR this morning senator
Amy Klobuchar a Democrat from Minnesota
made this point to where she's saying
like look if somebody breaks in your
house whether they use like a crowbar to
break in or if like the manager gives
them a key right to fill a breach it's
still like a breach of like somebody
getting in like in this scenario like
Facebook essentially gave camera general
look at the key well yeah yeah yeah he
essentially got a key in so it's not
really it's it would still be considered
a breach we have too much knowledge so
if you do one of these quizzes can you
remove it yes yes so I almost did a
story on something like this before with
the privacy policy stuff on like these
quizzes you can opt out of it but it's
like you know how like you have to opt
out of like Equifax like write a letter
to them saying like I choose now there's
like an address and everything that was
one of the ways that I saw it obviously
like there wasn't like a option this is
this was just for one quiz company that
I know it might be different for all of
them yeah that was before like you'd
have to write a letter and like buy a
Samantha B and put it on the envelope
they know how to I don't even know where
my life's always terrible alright let's
go ahead and take some comments and
questions from SH enjoy having or not
having to FAA is not the same issue here
is not the issue here users themselves
gave profile details to the breach
mechanics this is not a hack no there's
not a hash banging on the side yeah you
were definitely willing you willingly
gave up your data and whether or not you
actually knew how much data you were
giving up is and her friends data so
yeah two-factor authentication would
have helped in this particular scenario
because your dad was given to a party
and the breach is it with you no you
give me abrogated the breached came when
the data was handed over to another firm
that really had no business looking at
that data so in this case is ignorance
bliss no ignorant now we're not ignorant
so more and then not take these quizzes
one would wonder what it would look like
maybe just stop using Facebook like like
what a Facebook just did big disclaimers
on this kind of
stuff where they specific do though they
do report you take the boys it says it
says like you need to give permissions
to this this this this and this I
haven't done one of those quizzes in a
while I did one for might like a story
that I was looking at it tells you but
like in the same way that when you
download an app on like the Google Play
Store like you you probably skip the
program you just you just hit OK through
it yeah that's true
alright moving on from Michael Brown
we got why do you think people still use
products like Facebook despite constant
controversial news headlines that's a
great question I think cuz it's not
controversial for them specifically like
when they see all this stuff about it oh
this fake news spread on this or like
they put like this this like hoax like
conspiracy theory on the top trending
topics the idea is that's not what
they're coming like you know like they
might not see that on Facebook
themselves anyway so why would we care
about that and even if they did it's
just ok cool like I guess that sucks but
I I mean this doesn't affect how I use
Facebook yeah first look for a lot of
people it's still the best way to
connect with their family and friends
you know that's what I only ever wanted
it for was to touch base with the people
in my life I don't need it as a news
resource I trust the companies that have
credible back background credible
information credibility period that have
established themselves in the industry
as news outlets now anybody can tack on
news and put a blue checkmark next to
their name I know yeah maybe you have an
opinion and a platform and something
that you can say and should be entitled
to say does that mean you have any kind
of weight to it not in the slightest
I think people like when they see
headlines like these assign a lot more
personal responsibility on like people
on Facebook rather than Facebook itself
and the idea that you know if I see
something like that's like fake news or
a propaganda like campaign it was like
why not just block it like yourself but
I think you know the other side of this
argument is you know Facebook as a
company like this should be the ones
watching after this and not like me
having to do this you know Facebook and
Twitter of both like come out and and
said whenever people like call them out
on this they've always said you know we
have a great user base and they do a
great job reporting it to us and we see
it that way but I think I've always been
against that in a sense of why don't
they just have people watching out
themselves and blocking it themselves so
yeah I see like both sides of the
argument I see why people continue to
use it yeah and they're clearly able to
respond to scams and and problems like
that we're seeing that right now with
the crypto community where crypto
currencies they've just completely
removed ads from Facebook and also
Google the problem is there is that
cryptocurrency
companies and exchanges whether they're
legitimate or not I mean there are a lot
of scams but there are also a lot of
legitimate companies that are trying to
make that into a thing they're now all
just getting like thrown out together so
when they do make these blanket efforts
sometimes those can cause problems too I
just want to see more accountability
there's entirely too easy on every
platform out there to be invisible to be
a ghost the fact that no one is held
accountable for their actions is the
damaging thing here I think right I mean
I think we'd all like to see Zuckerberg
and you know page or you know any one of
these executives actually go up to
Congress and talk to them rather than
you know Heather yeah
I've said this on previous like podcasts
and every time a story like this happens
again I think it's gonna come sooner and
sooner but like the question of like
will we live to see the day that like
Facebook dies out look or goes the route
of like MySpace and Yahoo where it
doesn't die but it's there no one uses
it right yeah every time a story like
this happens I think more and more like
yeah like that'll probably happen like
pretty soon they're their business right
now is doing phenomenally well and if
anything they're continuing to get more
users so I think that if that were to
happen it would take a while the other
big one I don't think I haven't like in
the next like two three years but I
think I will live to see a day where it
does happen it would be interesting to
see the other thing that a lot of times
gets mentioned is the idea of regulation
- is that our regulators going to start
getting involved more to try to police
what actually goes on
I think we're never gonna see that right
we're seeing that now there's
increased interest with regulators
government whether it's here whether to
the EU to start cracking down these
companies right
they've kind of lost their their shine a
bit as darlings so folks just need to
start doing their homework stop treating
Facebook as a news resource the
water-cooler gossip you get at work
isn't news it's gossip we only have a
few minutes left so let's get through a
couple of really good questions from
Channing che is Facebook less safe than
other social media or is it just
targeted more I don't see how not using
Facebook will help that very much
that's a great question just like people
say oh well I got a Mac so I can't get a
virus no they just didn't make as many
viruses from X because there were more
PCs right I think it's kind of falling
along the same lines yeah I mean look
Twitter's just as bad not just Facebook
I mean yeah but there's less data on you
on Twitter like it doesn't have like
your likes on but in terms of like
influences whether you know the that's
that's why Russia targeted Twitter as
well right yeah so the me I feel like
it's just as toxic environment I don't
know what I mean I think in this
scenario though of like data mining and
like for political campaign purposes
right I think Facebook is a lot like
more potent than like Twitter okay
yeah like so much of your profile oh
 you should all jump on snapchat
yeah yeah actually yes any any social
media that really doesn't like last
forever is it yeah it's actually by
definition like much safer yeah that's
that's what a lot of you know like Gen Z
like kids are doing now that's why
they're moving on from like Facebook
that's why they have like finster grams
where it's like you don't know that's
really them right or anything like that
and like snapchat where like things
don't last that long we should go back
to myspace there's all these articles
like thank you might now about like oh
snapchat is dying and like snapchat is
irrelevant but it's like yeah to like
you and your friends like people who
write these articles sure but like among
like young kids like snapchat is still
like the go to like app like when they
had the the school walkout stuff yeah
all of that activity on social media was
going on on snapchat like if you look
like the heatmap stuff
for life mapped there was nothing on
that on like Instagram stories and like
people talk about Instagram stories like
killing snapchat like that's not true at
all for a specific generation yeah yes
that's very interesting because I think
I agree with you that I do see those
headlines whereas just talking about
snapchats irrelevance so yeah but yeah
that definitely provides a useful answer
yeah and I think what would be a better
social media it's the ones that delete
your information after why don't just
keep it for decades yeah I think like
younger generations are recognizing that
and they don't want to be a part of this
you know like massive like collection
network or anything like that and it's
just yeah the kids are cool it's none of
the kids man mmm all right we are just
at the end of it and I just kind of like
this this closing thought as phrased by
Mike Shaw and shared by several people
in the chat the root of the problem is
our data Google Facebook third-party
apps your grocery store loyalty card
they're all tracking you maybe we need
better laws so we can have control over
our own data anything that kind of goes
without saying how the hell we're going
to accomplish this there's just a well
go ahead sorry well yeah I was gonna say
the EU has been doing that with gdpr
it's not off the top of my head what it
stands for right now I'm very sorry
about that but the crux of it is more
about you know better data privacy where
the companies have to disclose breaches
within like a shorter time period you're
like they're and they're fine too like
heavily if they don't ya the EU has
already like set forward like laws on
that it's like going into action now
what all right yeah no good points all
around a great another great comment
from Michigan men what happens when
those small social media companies fail
in liquid L your data gets sold off
anyways these are all things that we're
going to have to constantly think of
there's just a great conversation
drumming up now we never got back to the
Apple it's fine this means this
important topic to talk it was and thank
you everybody that was a very good
mature interesting discussion yeah it
was nice to not see you go down the
typical political rabbit hole so that's
two as always to the 359 listeners and
yeah go we gotta go sorry
if you liked anything you saw or heard
