the iphone and ipad i've been using it
for a few days on an iPhone 7 plus and
an iPad pro if you're going to use it
keep in mind that this is a beta not the
final version so it could be buggy and I
would definitely use it on a secondary
device not a primary unless you back up
that being said what can you do with it
there are a bunch of things to explore
it and I'll show you the best things to
check out control center is definitely
better it's just one pane now and you
can pile extra buttons into it in
settings you can do more as long as you
can figure out what the icons mean
volume brightness timers flashlights
Apple TV remotes and a whole new screen
record feature screen record by the way
is great for DIY fault you can record
anything you see on screen add voiceover
if you want and share it doesn't work
however for adding commentary to movies
so don't try live photos gets a
fantastic upgrade and it actually might
make you keep it on forever
you can add looping or long exposure
effects but the best part is that you
can re-edit any photo and pick one of
the other shots that you captured in
live photo burst it's like doing a
rillette it on your camera roll Siri
sounds a bit different over time we
intelligent agents mature and our voices
change it's a little unnerving Siri also
however translates although that's also
still in beta notes now has extra modes
the best one might be the built-in
scanner for receipts or whatever else
you once can do not disturb while
driving is available in public beta and
offers don't bother me filters while
driving but you do need a car for that
the App Store looks pretty different is
it annoying or helpful that's up for you
to decide right now it does seem like as
a heck of a lot of articles keyboards
can get squished into one-handed modes
which might be good for texting at
moments when you've only got one arm to
spare what's really nice is you can save
things as markup Abul screenshots just
about everywhere and you can mark up web
pages as PDFs basically a quick way to
share anything as a Twitter moment the
files app also exists on iPhone and iPad
and it means you can consolidate folders
or apps locally or in cloud accounts
it's taking some getting used to in the
beta but it's finally a central place
that dump your stuff I'm sure you're
going to find more in the iPad version
of iOS 11 adds split-screen a doc and
pencil modes watch our other video for
that good luck and remember when you run
into a bug this is a beta this is a beta</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
