asking what the what the google doc is
that that i referenced in the preview
post for the show people demand google
docs people google doc news but that let
us do with Thea the crowd-sourced sci-fi
novel that we've been publishing for the
past couple of weeks here on Sina we've
talked about on the show since I mean
this is big enough so that feelings been
going on since last year in November is
when we threw a Google Doc online with
an outline of a sci-fi novel and we
asked everyone to help us crowdsource it
and then a few months later we did
actually have a semblance of a novel and
then Kelsey and I and a few other people
have spent the last few months editing
and endlessly editing the thing
providing feedback shaping my big
question on this is when it gets
optioned how are you gonna do writer
credits is the screenplay going to be
then crowd-sourced as well I thought I
thought so the way we did this you want
to get the gritty of it is we put the
google doc online and it's still
actually there and anyone can still go
edit it and play around with it that's
actually cnet com / crowd sci-fi that
takes you right to the google doc we're
talking about and that Google Doc is
over 100 pages that is all creative
commons meaning anyone could build upon
it take it and you know change something
else make crowd-sourced fanfiction I
don't care do whatever you want but it's
amazing to me about this is it was not
just completely filled with porn and you
know trolling and how did you how did
you avoid that there was I mean there
was a couple of instances but you know
sorry about that by the way I don't like
it is now I'm a batch was surprising to
me to actually is that yeah I mean there
may be one case of vandalism and then
there were a few scenes of like maybe so
erotica although they actually miss me
they weren't actually that bad they
didn't make they didn't make the final
call add my tentacle paragraph later
yeah but you know I don't know I mean
I'd like to compare it you know to like
a jigsaw puzzle where we just kind of
put this jigsaw puzzle out on a card
table at a party and then people kind of
like would stop and do a couple of
pieces or maybe do an entire like
section of the puzzle and over a couple
of months an actual narrative did emerge
and Kelsey you know it's been kind of
interesting when you asked hundreds of
people to write a book you end up with
obviously different writing voices and
different writing styles so we did have
to get a little creative to figure out a
way to kind of preserve the
crowd-sourced nature of it I didn't just
go in and like edit everything so that
it sounds like I wrote it because then
what would be the point of having
crowd-sourced it so it's worth checking
out it's a cnet com / crowd dash control
yeah we have ten installments up now I'm
also working on kind of a few lessons
learned posts a little behind the scenes
stuff and it was it was really like
interesting interesting process I don't
think it I don't know that we produced a
Pulitzer Prize winner but I mean it's a
co-created work with literally hundreds
of contributors behind it so it's was an
interesting experience and I think I'm
going to be figuring out what we learned
from it for all years in advance it
still take a long time to digest</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
