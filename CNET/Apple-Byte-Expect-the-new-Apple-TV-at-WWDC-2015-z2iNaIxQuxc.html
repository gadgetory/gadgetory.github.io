welcome to the apple bite you know the
drill for everything good and bad inside
the world of apple let's get to the show
and the big story this week comes from
BuzzFeed yes it really does and no it's
not 33 South Asian brides that totally
won their wedding although i did scroll
through that now BuzzFeed managing
editor John pets Kowski formerly from
all things D reports that a new Apple TV
device will be unveiled at the worldwide
developers conference Apple will also
announce a new software development kit
that will allow devs to bring apps to
the set-top box as well and a software
update will add an app store similar to
what exists on iOS devices now this is
not a big surprise we haven't seen an
apple TV update since 2012 we've heard
many of these developments for a while
and with Apple lowering the current
price to $69 it hinted at something
coming soon the BuzzFeed report also
claims the new Apple TV will come with a
new design and more storage than its
current 8 gigs to allow for apps the new
Apple TV could also include a series
control feature and support for Apple's
home automation platform home kid and
for you current Apple TV users a few new
channels have been added to the mix
including ted talks taste made for food
and travel and young hollywood for
entertainment news can you guys guess
which one I watched the most of these
three you can't i'll write a new apple
wireless keyboard that features
backlight keys and a power button
appeared briefly on the apple online
store in the czech republic and hungary
the images were removed shortly after
and it could have been a mistake or is
apple releasing a backlit wireless
keyboard in the future or maybe even for
a product like the rumor an ipad pro we
will find out also apple's released the
fifth yosemite beta to developers that
continues to polish the new Photos app
the iOS 8.3 beta has been in developers
hands for more than a week and a couple
of new features such as being able to
use Siri to call someone over
speakerphone is a new one and in the
password settings you can now set your
phone to allow you to download free apps
without it asking for a password anymore
alright let's change gears a little bit
and check out our app of the week
I know I know we haven't done one in a
while but this is my new favorite app
it's called momochi keyboard it's like
emoji with an m in the front but what
makes it special well check this out it
allows you to make your own gif
animation emojis using your own face now
you can make up to five or pay 199 to
unlock it for all the available slots
and you'll need to add it as a new
keyboard from your settings but it's
pretty clear if you send this you'll be
impressing the ladies this guy just
messaged me what do you think you he's
not even cute really what do you think
not cute at all hmm see works like a
charm I'll write in a quick Apple watch
update for those of you who want to try
one on in store customers will be able
to start booking a 15 minute appointment
to try on the watch starting april the
tenth and not before that walk-ins will
also be available on the 10th but i
really hope there isn't a line the night
before please don't do that people show
us that you have a life alright once in
a while we like to show you some
what-ifs on the show so check out this
apple drone concept from Eric please man
if the big a gets bored and the Apple
watch doesn't do it for them there are
always drones now his drone concept
would have four iSight cameras on each
of its four legs and the images could be
streamed to an iOS device and controller
let's just hope they aren't the 480p
resolution apple stuff into their new
macbook I'm just saying alright it's
time to announce our iPhone 6 and 6 plus
mophie juice pack winners we had easily
over twelve hundred entries and I ask
you the Apple biters for your Apple
watch thoughts well here you go Doris
dear on twitter says talk to the hand
has a new meeting with the Apple watch
Jamal wetter brun email this with the
Apple watch is wiggity wiggity wack I'd
NS is the ultimate positive fanboy who
called it the most beautiful and
life-changing creation in the history of
mankind yeah someone just wet himself
while James says the Apple watch is
cool but not really worth my time okay I
got that one congrats to all of our
winners I'll be in touch and a round of
applause for all of you it took a
valuable 10 seconds out of your day to
enter the contest okay yeah cut that yes
we got it i'll write a lot of you
through some big-time support at the
watch but it was still dominated by
people saying they weren't sold yet and
they'll maybe wait for the second gen
except for this honorable mention by the
retro gamer who said i think the apple
watch is just too square it's almost as
bad as your hair you know what you're a
jerk a jerk and you're getting a bad
apple got you alright that's going to do
it for this we show hit me up on the
twitter brian Tong or email me at the
apple byte at cnet com and i'll respond
