working on its own version of the Amazon
echo smart speaker and it goes by the
code named shirk at least that's
according to a report from recode citing
unnamed sources it's not the first time
we've heard whispers of Google working
on some sort of internet hub that can
respond to your voice it is possible
Google could upgrade its on hub wireless
router by adding voice recognition and
don't forget nest is now also part of
the Google family so this hub could be
under the nest brand it's no surprise
Google would be working on something
like this the Amazon echo has been a big
success it's estimated that Amazon could
have already sold three million of these
smart speakers and the echo family of
products does more than just play music
and answer trivia questions it's also a
hub to control other smart home gadgets
such as the lights or the thermostat the
echo answers to the name Alexa similar
to how Apple has Siri at Microsoft has
Cortana but there's no name for Google's
assistant it only awakens with the magic
words ok Google but Google really should
give us assist in a name maybe a G name
like Gwen or Gabby know how about
Gilbert Oh Gisele nah too sexy oh I got
it it obviously has to be Gozer but no
matter what it ends up being don't
expect Google to announce it at next
week's big Google i/o Developers
Conference this project will not likely
be ready for a debut next week but you
can count on Google talking about new
ways to use voice controls that's it for
now I'm Bridget Carey and you can stay
updated at cnet com / update</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
