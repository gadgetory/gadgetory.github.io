Roberts but you can call me Barbie is
there anything else you want to ask
Bobbie has had a 21st century makeover
in partnership with Mattel SAN
francisco-based toy talk created Hello
Barbie a doll that can have a
conversation and to remember details you
tell it like a favorite color I also
like literature
do you like Shakespeare Barbie this
high-tech Barbie has a built-in
microphone speaker and Wi-Fi chip and
that lets our servers understand what a
child says tell a Barbie and also has to
send down to the doll a party should
respond back with as well when you press
the belt buckle the doll is listening
sending the audio to toy talk servers
recognizing speech running through
natural language processing and
artificial intelligence engine choosing
what barbie should say back and
streaming back to device can be in the
order of 100 milliseconds hello Bobby is
armed with thousands of scripted
responses and won't answer inappropriate
questions if you're concerned about what
data is collected toy talk says parents
can always access and delete recorded
conversations through the website there
are no people with headphones on
listening to what children say our
servers process audio automatically much
like the way that Siri search in Google
Maps Cortana and Alexa all work in a
similar way other interactive toys have
raised security concerns the my friend
Kayla doll also converses with kids but
doesn't require a password to connect to
a smartphone she can be hacked to say
bad words or even play music while Kayla
has some conversation filters the doll
can access the web which may lead to
answers potentially unsuitable for kids
wow what an interesting question
Monica's family Winsky is a former White
House intern with whom United States
President Bill Clinton admitted to
having had what he called an
inappropriate relationship you can
expect more toys that will interact
converse and learn the company toys
dinosaur adjusts to a child's
personality by using the same artificial
intelligence as IBM's Watson even Google
may get into the game the company filed
a patent for an internet-connected teddy
bear that could react to voice commands
and help control other devices talking
to your toys is no longer child's play
