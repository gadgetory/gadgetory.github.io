with a clean sheet for their eyes series
of cars they weren't kidding about this
one when you attack a corner and get on
an attorney is just fun the i8 looks
drives and moves itself like almost
nothing else on the road the i8 is BMWs
first plug-in hybrid but as you can see
they didn't exactly go after the Prius
this car has concept car looks it's also
impressive with the construction
technologies used here aluminum and
plastic panels or what you see but you
don't see is a carbon-fiber reinforced
plastic passenger cell or what they call
in racing a tub makes the car incredibly
strong but also exceptionally light and
that's critical when you've only got a
three cylinder gas engine and a smallish
electric motor efficiency is important
here in the aim of performance inside
it's a 2+2 nominally the +2 parts a
little optimistic as you can say now the
first thing that grabs you about the
cabin of the i8 is not some amazing
futuristic interface notice most of this
switch gear is physical standard BMW
stuff you do have an instrument panel
that's all LCD and of course you got
your eye drive screen right here but
what does grab you is the very spacious
futurism of this it's low slung you sit
low the dash is low it feels very wide
it's a distinctive experience a lot of
cameras on this car you've got a rear
camera of course there's also a front
camera and it can be stitched together
with mirrors to give you an overview
camera over here is the button that's an
interesting way of enabling or disabling
kind of the perimeter curtain of driver
safety tech collision avoidance and you
can set exactly what systems are turned
on into what sensitivity media sources
on this car pretty much what you see in
other BMWs with the ability to have a
hard drive storage space external
devices plug in through USB and aux
you've also got a snap-in 4g adapter
available here we don't have that in our
car but notice a couple things in this
vehicle AM stands for morning and
CD stands for what you had to liquidate
to buy this car because it does not get
AM radio and it has no optical disc slot
now that's futurism whether you like it
or not now when you're in navigation
mode this is a little different other
BMWs it talks to the powertrain to best
put it in the right mode of electric gas
or combination thereof to get the best
efficiency out of your drive not just
the best time in short its distance okay
drive controls we know this sort of
spatula shape shifter on BMWs before
with the sport gate to the left
start/stop button below that a Z drive
to force it into electric if it has
sufficient battery no sport or Sport+
you really have comfort as your standard
eco as your reduced or retarded
performance when the shifters in sport
the whole car goes into sport mode and
that's reflected in the gauges as you
can see up under its carbon fiber and
aluminum knickers is a one and a half
liter turbo three cylinder gas engine in
the best that drives the rear wheels
only through a six-speed Automatic out
front is an electric motor and that does
the front wheels only through a
two-speed gearbox the two ends are only
connected by a software add it all up
and it sells all wheel drive but in a
very unusual way total horsepower 362
420 pound-feet of torque or on tap that
gets you to 60 in 4.2 seconds under the
right conditions you have 22 miles of
pure electric driving per charge and
that charge takes about two hours on a
240 outlet all said your mpg is 28 and
your mpg II in electric mode is 76 in
the green car world those with these
tepid numbers were it not for this cars
performance
some people have driven this car come
away a little disappointed I understand
that it's prowess I didn't come to it as
a supercar I thought it was gonna be a
new-age GT and in that respect fantastic
the car handles as wide low and flat as
it feels inside here they don't be
exhaust it's not at all wimpy like you
expect from a highly electrified vehicle
they've tuned in teaming counteract that
impression
ride quality is great that always
matters to me you're gonna buy a car you
gotta live with it and the shifts super
quick the only odd note I found in this
car is around town when you're not
really into it it'll sometimes fall in
its face as it tries to decide between
what blended mode of power it wants to
be in or if it should be an electric
only and sometimes you'll get this kind
of weird indecision I'm not a big fan of
cars on steroids so bear that in mind if
you are this may not be enough for you
but I find it's athletic without being
brutal Mads my car car and it's still
fun not sterile
okay the i8 is a hundred and thirty
seven thousand dollars worth of tomorrow
mpg is good for a car this fast but
people who buy these cars aren't
pinching pennies and while that
performance is exceptional as I pointed
out it doesn't come across as brutal or
extreme so what's missing that market
instead it balances both and lets you
own a piece of a very impressive
automakers future vision and big bet or
cars driven CNET style standing by now
