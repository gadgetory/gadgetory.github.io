show where we cover everything related
to alphabet Inc what's alphabet you ask
what's that you didn't ask because you
already know that alphabet owns lots of
other companies most notably Google
clever audience well done this is a
packed episode today's top stories
include a snazzy new Chromebook and new
info on way Mo's early rider program but
first we get to talk about a real
off-screen Android phone I'm your guide
is act heart let's head on over to
Android avenues VEVO introduced the
world to NatGeo average phone with the
necks the next is pretty much the same
as the vivo apex concept phone but the
next is coming to market there's a tiny
tiny chin at the very bottom of the
necks it's got a huge 6.5 9 inch Super
AMOLED screen the downside is it's only
1080p resolution under that big ol
screen is a fingerprint sensor inside is
a snapdragon 845 processor same as some
galaxy s 9 phones 8 gigabytes of ram 256
gigabytes of storage and let's talk
about that front-facing camera
it rises from the next just like the
apex the next is launching in China
other markets have not been confirmed
time to visit the chrome dome Samsung
has a brand new chrome book called the
Chromebook plus v2 500 bucks get you a
notebook with a screen that can flip all
the way around now why would you want to
do that because you're a maniac or you
just want to use your Chromebook as a
tablet the plus v2 can run Android apps
by the way one neat touch is the 13
megapixel camera on the keyboard base
when you have the v2 in tablet mode you
can take pictures like you would on a
regular tablet sure it still looks
ridiculous to use a tablet as a camera
but it is what it is the Chromebook plus
v2 has a couple of USB C port and a
micro SD card slot for expandable 'ti it
also houses a pen so you can mark up the
screen in a genius move Samsung included
a single USB a port on the same side as
a pen no I'm not being sarcastic for
once no need for a dongle to attach very
common items the Samsung Chromebook plus
v2 arrives on June 24th expect a full
review at some sites called cnet.com by
Josh I'm not made out of gold man next
up Windows way wait a minute we're doing
Windows stuff now on the show don't ask
me
you wrote it I did write it at CES Asia
while we showed off its Huawei cloud PC
service notebook italia got some video
of the feature in action
it gives huawei phones the ability to
access a virtual Windows 10 PC when the
huawei phone isn't a dock you can have a
more traditional desktop experience the
virtual Windows PC can access the
phone's local storage - we're not done
with Windows there have been murmurs of
the Google pixel book being able to
support an operating system other than
Chrome OS pointed out by the good people
at xda-developers new evidence found in
the pixel books firmware make reference
to the windows hardware certification
kit and the windows hardware lab kit
part of Microsoft's hardware
compatibility program is the hardware
lab kit so does this mean that we'll see
Windows on a pixel book
I asked Google a representative told me
as a hardware organization we don't
comment on rumors or speculation well
that cleared up nothing it's time to
visit the whammo garage Wayne will
published a blog post looking at its
early rider program after one year way
Moe was once known as Google's
self-driving car project it is now its
own company owned by alphabet in Arizona
Wayne was running a test that began way
back in April 2017 people signed up to
be early riders and they would be driven
around in a self-driving car so Wayne
will publish a blog post with an
infographic explaining how the test is
going I could let you read it in silence
but I never ever ever ever ever shut up
on the first day Weimer received around
6000 applicants to be early riders to
date over 20,000 people have applied 400
riders use the service daily around the
Phoenix area Wayne will also ranked in
the top 10 places early riders went to
we have a top 10 guy or top 5 guy or
something around here let's go to them
these are the top 10 most popular trips
taken by early writers number 10 is the
gym number nine is heed electronics
drawer number 8 the supermarket number 7
health salon or spa number 6 a retail
store number 5 a car repair shop number
4 the bar number 3 school number 2 is a
restaurant and the number one most
popular trip taken by early riders is to
work back to you alphabet boy hmm yes
thanks
countdown guy anyway way mo says it is
still taking applications so if you want
to be driven around by way Mo's minivans
now is your chance
last stop comment code this is a part of
the show where we shine a light on
comments made by the best audience in
the world - that one guy you know who
you are hero from the 90s asks will the
pixel come to t-mobile
well t-mobile will not sell pixels in
its stores but you can buy an unlocked
pixel from Google and bring it to
whatever carrier you want in the US
about the pixel threes design a luminary
Zehra says their ad campaign it's a
phone
Arvind Medina said that pixel with the
Snapdragon 710 will be an Android one
phone I don't see Google tainting the
pixel Brandon with mid-range hardware
that's a really great point the pixel
brand is Google's premium line so you
could be right maybe a lower end phone
would carry a different name that does
it for us if you've enjoyed your stay in

Maya's actor I'll see you online
okay you're still here awesome a rumor
popped up recently saying the note nine
would have a physical shutter button
based on a leaked phone case it turns
out that button was just a spot for a
lanyard to be attached to the case the
note nine is expected to be introduced
on August 9th but that is still not yet
official oh and YouTube music and
YouTube premium are available now by</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
