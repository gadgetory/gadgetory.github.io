and right now we're taking a first look
at the HTC 8xt priced at 9999 the 8xt is
available now on sprint and is the
carrier's first Windows Phone 8 handset
if the HTC 8xt looks familiar that's no
coincidence it's practically a splitting
image of the HTC windows phone 8x which
debuted on AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile and Verizon
last year in some respects that's a good
thing the 8 XC shares the same sleek
line slim profile and rounded edges of
the 8x the phone comes in a similar blue
color scheme as well on front of the 8x
t is a 4.3 inch LCD with a wxga
resolution that's far below the
sharpness of more expensive phones with
HD resolutions still while it won't
exactly blow your socks off the screen
is bright enough and colors sufficiently
vivid not to detract from video text and
other mobile content HTC also claims
that the 8xt features its boom sound
audio technology which first appeared on
its HTC One flagship in a nutshell there
are two stereo front firing speakers
each equipped with their own amp the
goal is to boost the volume of music
video and other audio above the display
is the 8xt s 1 point 6 megapixel front
camera for self portraits and video chat
running along the bottom of the screen
are typical windows phone controls for
back start and search there are no
physical keys on the 8x T's left edge
but you'll find a thin volume rocker and
dedicated camera button on the right
side up tops it's a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and a trim power key
around back is the 8 megapixel main
camera and LED flash they're both housed
in a metallic circle 2 which is one
difference from the Windows Phone 8x
while the 8x t's 1800 milliamp battery
is embedded you can remove the back
cover to get at the SIM card and micro
SD card slots running Windows Phone 8
the HTC 8xt uses Microsoft's much-touted
live tile you I where square and
rectangular application tiles actively
twinkle with alerts and other data in
real
I'm living on the vertically scrolling
home screen you can also move tiles
around resize them or delete them to
suit your tastes the HTC 8xt comes with
the standard windows phone camera app
but has the HTC camera application
pre-loaded as well it offers multiple
color filters plus they burst mode to
snap multiple shots in a row supporting
sprint's LTE network the HTC 8xt will
also connect to the carrier's 4G
infrastructure for fast data that is if
you're within sprint's LTE coverage area
I'm Brian Bennett for cnet.com and this
has been a first look at the HTC 8xt be
sure to check back soon for a full
