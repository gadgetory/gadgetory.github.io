in the sky I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update google has swallowed up
another company this time it acquired
Titan aerospace it's a startup that
makes solar powered flying drones that
can glide at high altitudes for up to
five years without needing to land or
refuel google has driverless cars and
now driverless aircraft so why does
Google need flying drones it's been
working on a way to bring internet
service to parts of the world that don't
have access and it began a program to
broadcast an internet signal via
balloons and these drones could be
folded into that same project if Google
can become an Internet service provider
that floats among the clouds offering
internet to billions of people without
access it could help connect the world a
little more and that's nice but at the
end of the day it does mean Google could
profit for more users Facebook is on the
same quest to grow users in areas
without internet access Facebook ones
try to buy Titan but instead but another
company that also makes solar powered
aircraft in the meantime Google may find
these drones more useful for updating
Google Maps and Google Earth there's
also been some buzz about google glass
the company opened up sales of the head
gear to anyone in the US just for
Tuesday but it's not like the price went
down it still costs fifteen hundred
dollars to get one in the early testing
phase it's not really meant for the
general population yet glass is the
first step to show what can be done with
wearable tech so what's next how about
smart contact lenses google has a patent
pending for a contact lens with a micro
camera and sensors embedded on the
surface and apparently you would control
this by blinking Google glass can be
socially awkward at times but with
contacts will all be I Rubby nerds with
fluttering eyes hold on I gotta I gotta
swipe to unlock well okay I joke but
smart contacts are not a far-out concept
google has been testing smart contacts
that can help diabetics by measuring the
glucose levels in tears with tiny chips
and sensors and the US military is
looking into dual focus contacts that
let you look at the
is near and far at the same time without
messing up your vision and in my last
update episode I talked about the
reports of Amazon working on a
smartphone well the tech blog BGR
published some leaked photos of a
prototype it looks like it's in this
blocky shell to mask the phone's true
design there are sensors on each corner
to track I've movements and the images
on the screen will adjust depending on
where you look on the screen to create a
neat 3d effect or at least that's what
we think that's your tech news update
you can get more details at cnet com
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
