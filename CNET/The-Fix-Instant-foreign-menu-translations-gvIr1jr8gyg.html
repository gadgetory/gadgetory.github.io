gonna be eating out a lot I mean that's
part of the fun right trying the local
flavor some exotic new delicacy but when
you're looking at a menu that's printed
entirely in a foreign language it can be
a little daunting fortunately whether
you're an iPhone user or Android their
apps out there that can help you
translate a menu in seconds all right
let's start with the language that I
know the least about Chinese for that
I've got an app called way go it's a new
app only on iOS a free version gives you
10 translations per day or you can
upgrade to a 699 version that gives you
unlimited translations that's what I've
got here let's put it to the test boot
up way go I see a little window here in
the app I need to Center the Chinese
characters now I can use a little zoom
slider here to get the text just right
in the box I can also expand the box by
dragging on it but I'm just gonna go
with one line of text make things easy
on and right underneath it I should see
a translation sliced duck sounds good
but let's see what else is on the menu
we've got pan fried cuttlefish and
bitter melon and fries that one now by
hitting the pause button I'm el to see
the translation and I can actually send
this to myself via email I can hit the
share button I can send it to other
people one option is not here is the
ability to save it to my camera roll
that would be nice all right so way go
here's what I like about it the
dictionary is built into the app and it
doesn't have to access the internet in
order to do the translation that's
pretty critical that means if you're in
a restaurant that doesn't have the
reception you're still going to be able
to do the translation on the downside
it's expensive it's 699 for the full
version the text has to be really clear
in order for the translation after work
also the translations aren't spot on
again something that's pretty common
with a lot of these apps but it gets you
in the ballpark next up I've got an app
called Word Lens now the great thing
about this app is out of work with both
Android and iOS it's free to download
but you're paying for 99 / language pack
and those languages don't include
Chinese you've got French German Italian
and Spanish that works for you
definitely worth checking this app out
let's see if it worked some magic on
this Frenchman so all I have to do with
this one is hold the camera over the
text and watch it magically translate
into the language that I want but the
really cool thing about this is that it
changes the text and replaces it so you
get to see the translation in the
context of the menu once the translation
looks right I'll hit the pause button
you go it's gonna hold that translation
in from there I can save to my camera
roll and I can also email it so that's
pretty cool feature so here's the good
in the bad with word lens now the
coolest thing about word lens is that it
looks like magic when you show this off
to people it's pretty amazing that it
can replace the words right in front of
you with your translation works with
Android and iOS that's a big upside
downside is 499 / language is still
pretty pricey and the translations
aren't the best I don't know if it's
just the many as I was choosing but
there's some pretty hilarious
translations here that I'm sure can't be
accurate or I really don't need to eat
at this restaurant alright finally let's
talk about the best free option out
there google translate this is another
one that's available for both iOS and
Android but the Android version has a
big advantage over iOS which is that it
lets you translate pictures you take so
let's give it a shot I'm going to really
throw it a curveball with the menu
written entirely in Greek let's see what
it can do get a nice and close and get a
good focus shot of the text and then
take the picture all right here it's
going to do a little scanning of the
text see if you can pick out the letters
that are in this picture alright and now
it's asked me to use my finger to
highlight the line that I want
translated there's a variety of
appetizers are here that's good how
about this one right here octopus I'll
probably stay away from that one what
about down here meatballs sure why not
the cool thing is you can just use your
finger to go line by line and figure out
what you want translated that's pretty
neat
the other cool thing is when you get
back to the main screen of google
translate it's gonna have record of
everything at recently translated for
you so i can look at the cucumber salad
the tomato soup the meatballs it's all
there and it's ready for me to reference
whenever I want so here's the good in
the bad with google translate good news
it's free even though the version for
iOS isn't as cool as the one for Android
that can take a picture it's free free
is free the other great thing about
google translate is the breadth of
languages it supports it goes everything
from arabic to zulu you have amazing
language support the bad news is that
iOS users don't get that cool camera
feature these silly an internet
connection do any of this translations
you didn't think that with wego and that
the translations are pretty rough but
really that same complaint can be made
with all these apps so there you go
three apps that will help you demystify
menus printed in languages you don't
understand now if you find yourself
ordering the head cheese or the jellied
chicken feet at least you'll know what
you're in for more tips like this head
