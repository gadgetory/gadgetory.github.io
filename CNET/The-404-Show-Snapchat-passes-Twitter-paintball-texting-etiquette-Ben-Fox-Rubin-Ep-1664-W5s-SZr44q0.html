it's four-four time i'm jeff bakalar got
Russ fresh dick across the table up
that's that's great how I say hello to
you all the time write what they rest
but oh that's my tagline easy laughing
uncontrollably and flanking us is mr.
Ben Fox Rubin back on the show welcome
in effect seal clap Thank resuming what
uh what's hello everybody yeah sounds
right so uh we'll get into a few things
right from the start here but first
things first that I want to lay on you
we got the next time Ben was on the show
he talked about oh yeah bay door alright
like selling your mom's clothes yes and
people like one right success with great
success people are like is she doing it
behind her back is he pocketing the
money like what is going on joee me too
okay so you got more questions about I
need to I need to provide more
information basic I don't know if you
need to provide more information but
maybe just like clear the air yeah I'm
not stealing my mom's clothes it'd be
more fun if you were yeah it would be
I'm fun or totally messed up both
totally you can have your cake and eat
it too she's such a nice mom she's like
look I was gonna give this away to
goodwill why don't you sell it it's a
very nice blouse see how much money can
make off of it oh you're good son yeah
so we got a lot of feedback about that i
just want clear the air and sort of
honor the story and let you know that
people care neri that's very sweet of
you and i was i I was I was new as I was
talking about that that I was putting
myself out on ya being like this is
probably gonna come off as creepy but
I'm gonna do it anyway and I love your
your fearlessness it was not
fearlessness there was great fear as I
was describing it all right either way
but I did it anyway either way it worked
out for the for the benefit of the show
so real quick we'll talk about this one
subject then we'll pop right into the
stories we have planned for the day last
week we had a very engaging conversation
about the etiquettes
when you meet someone do you give them
kiss on the cheek you hug them we're
just going for that casual never go
wrong handshake we got someone who
called in I want to play that and then
we're gonna ask Ben what he thinks about
all this let's play this voicemail hi
guys this is timmy girl kali from miami
i'm calling about the whole kiss
situation as justice said we are since i
am from a man we kiss everybody i didn't
know that but um it's a very delicate
situation it all depends on how you meet
the person and how you feel in the
greeting ok if it's a very friendly
greeting very a lot of smiles are going
on yes it's very nice friendly going I
guess a situation cuddly yeah but he's
kissing went out at one goal and we know
there's different kinds of crises
there's some in the cheek regardless of
the situation because I want to let go
or ease the tension ok at least on my
side yeah yes I'd I'm something yellow
that's what I do he says help them out a
lot Sharon attention where you kiss them
also where you hold the person as you're
going out the kiddies we didn't really
try reaching in the back of the arm are
you grabbing their hands arm even
sometimes you could do a combination
where you reach in the back of the hand
putting your hand on the waist that's
pedal essential option when you're you
know it come on you're sending your
sending messages yeah when you waste
grab I'd say touch the small of
someone's bad not doing that to a
grandma no no oh my god no so all right
that was our buddy from Miami thanks for
a very very helpful very helpful very
insightful he also went on to say like
yeah we don't kiss guys though raucous
guys right we're like I don't know about
you were like I kiss a couple guys I
kiss deeds kiss the guy oh it says good
it feels good to say I kiss of Judas
Kiss dudes in it it's ok yeah yeah
normal how do you feel about that whole
thing so I'm I'm probably a hugger I go
in I I hug just about everybody even
especially if it feels awkward right if
I'm having an awkward conversation with
somebody if this isn't going well in
like middle of the conversation
just going for a hug why not why not if
if anything it's the same thing with the
guy from Miami it'll at least help me
out Shirley's make me feel a little less
tense like all right you're kind of a
schmuck if you don't think you know if
you're not gonna calm down and you know
chill out after i'm gonna gave you a
weird bear hug right I'm gonna pull back
the curtain a bit cuz we this is the
second time we're meeting oh yeah okay
and you came in and I was sitting and I
I guess we shook hands I I like extended
my hand to you and you were a little
taken aback by it yeah yeah so should I
have stood up and hugged I have a weird
I have a really weird protocol there's a
bit of fun uncanny valley for me okay
when it comes to meeting people sure
first time you meet somebody very
obvious for a guy very obvious handshake
right right yeah second time now we're
kind of friends yeah do I give you a
high-five it's no longer a handshake so
high five would be the upgrade something
or nothing either a high five or nothing
maybe third time right I think it
depends and we're gonna hug it out it
depends on how well your first
interaction went right like that sets
the stage for the rest of your sort of
touching so I wasn't I wasn't up to
high-five caliber you would have had to
pull the brakes on my handshake and been
like no no we're high five it was it
felt too formal again I handshake okay
yeah that makes sense yes oh so that's
what you like that's what you were
sensing I was seating I was seated so
maybe that added some complexity to it
was like do I stand up and then like go
for a bite your backpack my degree tell
you what I'm a dad now sure I probably
should have just gone in and kissed you
I will know forehead forehead kisses is
very it's very paternalistic sure it
makes people feel very supported yet
very comforted yeah I can work my baby
so much yeah okay kisses like constantly
exactly like I it's the point where like
I'm just making out with it tricycle I
like I'm just got something great about
babies though you don't care yeah well
they'll just take all know any other
world that's all day right it's just so
funny like the constant like barrage of
like you know saliva to know you know I
have twins right yo so I'm just I come
home and I'm surrounded by flesh yeah
a lot of you have we have my
three-year-old we have the twins I my
wife you just everybody gets in there's
just like one group hug it happen like
what's times yeah sure so as every less
drugs as everyone who listens to this
show is well aware I am quickly turning
to mush the older my kid gets yes and
the freaking more adorable and awesome
he gets and now i'm at the point where
like oh man it's so cool the guy he
hears my voice I'm like hey dog comes
racing in so that's the cute Dylan like
oh that the got the funny looking guys
back yeah like he's back I'm gonna goes
so he crawls over and does his crawl and
he's just the whole time he's just like
dr. got the whole time like old is he
he's like 14 months very cute and he's
just and then the second he like gets
within eyesight the arms go up yeah
there's like you need to lift me we need
to share something that's is great yeah
it's great God you are I'm you're a
shame if I is like baby her she's not
even lifting yeah they're just like oh
yeah yeah okay you're getting it that's
like one of the first words that they
learn up simple she's left me up sit
yeah yeah my three-year-old she's she's
now at the point where I try to attack
her like I attacked the twins she's
she's grown up now she doesn't need it
anymore dad please yeah please dad yeah
yeah so so soak it all in while you can
I know that's that's the eyes i'm here
in a lot speaking of the kids uh are you
guys on snapchat now god yeah we have to
be i I keep meaning to its it's the
thing I think I've said this before that
makes me feel the oldest yeah because
it's the thing like the new tech I mean
it's not even that new but to technology
thing I just haven't wrapped my head
around so let me give you some advice
okay and I'm not saying this is coming
from like the correct place vomiting
rainbows that's all I know or whatever
it is it's a good start so snapchat is
actually a lot of fun sure and I think
once you I started doing it like six
months ago and the second i was able to
wrap my head around it and like be
active quote unquote successful with it
yeah it's a lot of fun the reason I
bring this up is because today this week
it came out that snapchat has roughly 10
more million 10 million more active
users monthly users than two
so really yeah which is like oh yeah 150
about 140 okay which should kind of an
during some of our way skewing away
younger yeah for sure which is which is
watching the tech world yeah yeah so
that one right is gold I mean no one who
uses snapchat has any money but i guess
like that they're still value when they
all get jobs I know out of them right
you not even jobs like in college like
those kids spend money in stupid way
they do they spend their parents money
right yeah but where's the work what's
the cachet wait how do you know that
you're important on snapchat you don't
get that verified cheque you know don't
have those like all wars there's
actually is a school year the score is
weird and it's some you know magic
algorithm behind the curtain sort of
thing of how that's calculated I don't
necessarily think that equates like
success necessarily blame your school
you can see it in your profile sort of
there's a spot where you can look at
your plow yeah okay I know what you're
talking you can ok but right it's just
not as obvious is that would our where
lies very dubious in vague okay arm but
i think you know once you really get
past the opening we were like
what how I you think yes for its delisle
like it's deliberately confusing maybe
that's a means is like enforce
exploration maybe and encourage that arm
but it's really good yeah it's really
good i have to disagree i I've tried to
get into it I really haven't been able
to meet got stein traded a few snaps see
that's not how you have to play okay
with stories stories is the way to go
that's like multiples those stories are
basically like snaps that you do that
last 24 hours and slowly run out of you
know the hourglass slowly runs out and
then they're gone forever then they're
gone forever now you could save your own
like you could like if you like the
thing you did you can save that right
move on with your life but no one can
see that if you save it right but uh no
no I thought I don't think you can save
other people's you can save your own but
okay if you just like a little detail
yeah but you with giant eyes and yeah I
don't know lightning striking hers but
what's nice is like now they let you
view
you all of the stories of people you
follow and you can kind of have like a
five-minute thing yeah uh where you just
watch it all and sort of consume what
all your friends and all the brand's you
follow yeah just described like your
most successful I don't know what it is
okay but while they are out of probably
Dillon were like he's yeah it was
amazing I'll we were blown bubbles out
on okay and one of the bubbles landed oh
no I'm sorry we're blowing bubbles on
that dinner and then he snot bubbles at
the same time like it was like a bubble
coming out of his nose and real bubbles
around it was pretty good yeah that's
pretty good it's not bad that's like
lightning in a bottle but again like I
still maintain that Twitter is the most
important social network no yeah I think
so what about Facebook no crazy these
books not important like no the
facebooks not changing the world and
they faced with the more subtle in how
much impact it has on you but I think
Facebook has way more impact on the
world and Twitter does I don't know
facebook has not overthrown any
government I think it was just right
that's kind of right but Facebook is
also essentially the news again it will
see comes from facebook simple facebook
is become the news for people yeah
where's Twitter sort of like the status
update or like real-time reporting right
which I think in my opinion has like
pivoted into a utility sort of situation
as opposed to Facebook where it's like
you're still kind of like socializing
you're having having a party have a good
time right is that make sense more yeah
I guess so it's more of a mix of
Facebook is more of a melange thing yeah
I I'm gonna I'm gonna get business
reporter II for a second here but ya
know that snapchat is still a privately
held company right but they're making
money right apparently but once they
actually do go public if they actually
do then they're gonna come out with
quarterly reports they're going to say
how many active users they have every
three months and you're gonna come out
with these damn stories every single
quarter that are gonna say snapchats
dead snapchats like winning everything
snapshot is going to run the world
different stuff like that so they get to
exist in this mysterious space right now
now where they still don't have to
provide a lot of magic Sakura voice
that's like it could could be the best
red could be the most amazing and and
they and it feeds into that too by the
fact that like everything about it is uh
what's the word ethereal is it's there
and then it's gone again so I they get
to be this cool little mystery social
network do you know what their value
that no not off the top of my head the
last I checked was like 16 billion or
something which may be more than Twitter
yeah it's gotta be more than Twitter
right yeah I don't know I don't know I
feel like Twitter still in this sort of
mode where it's like look we're not the
the Wall Street darling you wanted us to
be you know just let go you're stuck
with us yeah but which is the real
estate and said it's it you know what to
help twitter is performing you know
what's going on because it's all out
there right right right oh yeah it's
it's a much harder place to be in
position to be in yeah yeah I you know I
don't know uh I know people only want to
watch stuff right now I really like even
texting is kind of I feel like a thing
that just won't be around no you're
crazy well no I'm saying like oh you
know how I thinks now I voice text yeah
i do that i do I you know Siri do this
do you think whatever I do a walking
down the stairs yeah yeah so that's fine
boys I'm fine with that what are you
saying like people like it is very
obvious that the Internet is switching
to a video-based sort of thing like
right my deeds are not gonna be able to
read let's be honest i'll be able to
read they just may never like you know
compose anything you know what I'm even
worried is substantial yeah like to me
you know and and there's like people who
out there who think like the internet is
prime for a slowdown in terms of like
the use because there's just no more
texts as the text doesn't have to be as
important on the internet as video does
and we're there with right wait so how
does edge there how does that create a
slow down it just doesn't the need to
like get quicker isn't there do you mean
like yes the compression algorithms will
get better but like when it comes to
bandwidth like we're all right right now
yeah but the quality of video is only
getting that recess compression
technology and stuff yeah yeah you know
bandwidth will allow bandwidth already
allows for a really good-looking stuff
sure you know we need Pied Pipers what
saying maybe for a few asha jell-o
constantly you really like that yeah I
do the game of thrones thing and I why
that how it's working I you know I'm
kind of like hot and cold with that show
it's definitely funny yeah yeah I don't
think it's like the best written show on
the planet it's pretty good i find it
very entertaining I think they have a
really great diverse set of extremely
likable characters um but I don't know
every now and then I'm just like oh okay
well you know go wrong at the end of
this up you know the main character but
like the danger awkward we are dominated
bitch it's so so I bummed yeah but I
didn't know that I bumped into him at a
restaurant nearby num pang okay and um I
came up to him I was just like hey
Richard Hendricks how are you which I'm
sure actors that's what do that yeah
that was probably imagine most people
coming up to me like Jon Snow news don't
you die oh you dick so what did he do
was he like well he yeah he like was
trying to blow me off as quickly as
possible as it was like eating his bowl
of food yes like what you I don't do
values even know the other thing is not
like a restaurant it's a sandwich shop
the sandwich shop yeah and so I saw him
there and I like the show and I would ya
gonna come up and say hi to even like a
hey man I really like your work is
better than being like hey whatever like
character name hey mortared Hendrix's
here yeah go ahead in my card i was like
we'd love to talk to you Peter Venkman
and now that I'm telling the story
realize this was faux pas han faux pas
the carling number two days already
talked with us oh yeah if freakin
what's-his-face Tong did a video with it
oh yeah I probably bumped into a week
after that right he's like who is this
she go rid of the sea view is this idiot
that's funny that he was like right
after yeah uh guys really funny like
he's very talented and funny and you
don't really see well he's very
one-dimensional on that very one
dimensional in the show but he does like
crazy voices and characters in his stand
up and he was part of like a sketch team
right I think so any and he has a twitch
channel that he streams like nerd vicos
returnee in like new games yeah called I
think Middleditch on twitch huh you lost
me there the actor his name is bought
again Thomas Middleditch
and he get like a brief cameo in wolf of
Wall Street's been a bunch of stuff yeah
I feel like these obviously is big
absolutely this is this breakout and
we'll see a lot more of it yeah I think
hopefully an overhang I hopefully can
see more of you though he never called
obviously obviously he never I don't
know if you waited for you to leave
before he like threw that car by bihari
into a sandwich can I just put this
right here awesome good for you I like
that you told us that story yeah
entertaining myself oh yeah no this is
this is my life is it just a series of
embarrassing moment just faux pas after
faux pas I love what I do I love it um
all right let's talk about this story
that Russ put in the show notes here a
story of a real-life x-men yeah this is
an ex person or it's a man who has
mutant powers is all them whatever so
this is a real story yeah it's actually
a story it's the Guardian wrote about it
under a reputable establishment okay um
so this guy um and I don't have my
computer in front of me but his name is
Dean Karnazes I guess that's what that
looks like it spells yes and apparently
he's got this weird condition where okay
so if you go running obviously you get
sore after certain out of time your
muscles get tired and you get sore yeah
yeah it's a chemical right last tater
lakh lakh to take lactaid it's not like
I do something with that you're along
those line and the idea is it diffuses
the acid that your muscles build up so
it's sort of like negates it but
eventually it sort of catches up with
yeah you know the asset sort of takes
over and you get tired you can't move
anymore so this guy does not have that
situation his muscles don't get tired
his muscles muscles never get tired
because he's producing more of one and
not the other and so he can essentially
run non-stop he says in this interview
that he ran non-stop for like three days
without sleeping well he started up but
he started sleep running at one point
that's pretty cool but like physically
it does not um slow him down so he can
just do megaman
our time after mega marathon and it does
not impact them so long as you have the
stamina like the heart Brett's gonna say
it's not just a muscle right of course
but if you take muscles out of the
equation and it's just a like cardio
question and like that's sort of I mean
it'd be very easy and also all of his
muscles I'm sure are in great condition
because he could just keep going it's
like he's taking constant sorrow but
isn't but so I maybe a maybe I'm just
not understanding his condition well
enough yeah but like there's got so so
his body's not producing this chemical
or its producing one chemical faster
than the other so it's so it's perfect
it's essentially like a the perfect
ratio so you're telling me like we could
essentially evolved to this yeah well
that's why you're my sweet that's the
our next forty thousand years right well
it's story is that you have these rays
lead in an individual person who has a
crazy condition you know there's a lot
of stories about people who can't feel
pain which is obviously a very dangerous
condition we're getting into James Bond
territory but like that's the right I
mean essentially you are I mean but all
what's to stop us from um speeding that
process up right like you could program
a baby engineering yeah sure sure
absolutely and that's that's the next
big thing oh come on dew point by the
time we're grandparents okay I prot
there are the human genome print like
I'm telling you I don't like it I mean
we are already doing they will be done
by the way to make sure a baby will
never have cancer but we're already
doing stuff like that you realize not
just can't but like in the case of like
you know they know if a baby's gonna
have down syndrome for example and right
i mean that's that's like a 12 or one
that's been around but that's stuff
again that's been around for a while
here's my problem your stuff first of
all it's totally creepy and equality
plain phone maybe you will only be
available to rich people right but its
own so we're basically you know ensure
scientists are going to ensure that rich
people will officially be our betters
because clearly will be superhuman it's
called Lee Attica yeah movie about it oh
my god you're right it's true but
clearly the rich people are the best
people yes of course that's why they're
rich and that's why they're running make
America better
they're the best people are gonna make
America great we dug we always fall down
this rabble like why do respect people
with have a lot of money like yeah
they're not as the best I don't really
you don't because you're small you're
smarter than most people um so what I
want to know is like what else yeah like
so this is the only instance of this and
again this is actually a three year old
story you should he should procreate as
much as possible obviously where this
guy was gonna say like will this gene
can it be passed on like does he have
kids would write i don't i don't have
the latest update i literally just
realized just now that it's a three run
this whole time yes ran right past he
stopped long enough to be interviewed um
but like I find the stuff interesting
because okay so if this guy let's say he
had this ability like that he is such an
edge over like copy in competition right
but that's in he like stamina
competition his mutant ability is like
on guitar okay so what if some little my
fingernails grow real quick say made
from you're born where your arms are
just constantly the longest possible
arms and you want to play that way
different than this guy that's you know
it's a mutation it's just another
mutation some of them are diseases this
is I might be wrong about this but
apparently rachmaninoff had a very
specific disease in which his fingers
didn't stop growing and that's why he
composed like I did you stop growing but
it's not like his fingers you know but
like he had yet freakishly long well
your ears and nose never stop growing
that's right you ever see an old eat
like a real giant here it's got lobes
down to his shoulders bras it can't wait
for that yeah you just started looking
like Mel Brooks in Spaceballs you know
it's just like come on and out a lot of
these oh I cause a lot of health
problems later on obviously I mean look
at Andre the Giant obviously you
consider that a mutation or a disease or
whatever was but he was super giant and
died it what was he 35 who's young he's
young so I'll you know a lot of stuff
has problems but there will be instances
where a mutation is all upside and no
downside and those are potentially the
mutations that you know again 50 million
years down the road you could see it
impacting or we take that guy's blood
and do stuff with it and then now
everyone has it oh man
yeah I I think a lot about like how
we're just kind of gonna miss all that
like I don't I think we'll see sequent
be able to take advantage of some of it
uh basically saying cuz I want to like
start treating my body really bad I
think we'll have any concise like they
already have very basic cyber eyes now
and I think as we get older like if you
went blind in 50 years I'll bet you
would be able to get a cyber I do you in
50 years will be 84 right like come on
if I live that long oh you'll make a
date absolutely think so they're like
easily writings man he's like that's
disingenuous sounding what are you
talking about Jeff Julie forever dude
that was not intended to be sarcastic
alright alright no no I also work on ism
I mission right again try it again why
Ben I'm gonna live to I'm 84 years old
absolutely i'll see you then along for
the ride join in the crash that's not is
very interesting I like it I like
talking about weird stuff i think uh i
would love like an eye implant that lets
me sort of see a HUD like i think i
would be into that I mean they're
they're essentially their will they have
like I implants for blind people were
you see like a very low res it's like a
yeah it's just a matter of increasing
improving that technology right 10 years
from now like can you imagine where the
technology is gonna be I think it's
gonna be way more advanced like I won't
be really careful with that I think it
was dymond age God what movie what book
was that it was either diamond it was um
it was one of the books where if you do
have a cyber I yeah like a connected I
or whatever people could then you know

like I said just realized I gave been
all these games in how many hours you
put into DMC which is I started I got
into it I got into it I gotta get back
it's fun right it is mad fun yeah it is
a good game anyway Mirror's Edge
catalyst is again coming out on ps4 xbox
one and pc on tuesday yeah it's from
dice and EA it's the freerunning it's a
parkour garrison it's a horse person
parkour game so you're clean any I play
I played a bunch of it play it started
it last night so it's related to this
conversation so we're not going to talk
too much about the game but all you need
to know if you don't know a first person
parkour game you don't have any special
powers you're just like jumping over
stuff vaulting on stuff
hang on stuff etc so I started playing
it like two days ago I was actually
supposed to review it for polygon and I
played for about a half hour and then
wanted to throw up all over my lemon oh
yes oh my god and I do not have I've had
it a few times with VR which is normal I
think certain VR games making me a
little sick and and one of the game
called soma which may be a little sick
but everything I play all sorts of
first-person shooter games don't have
this problem all sorts of games don't
have this problem and this game I was
like super super ill what the hell's
going on with you so it's the game and
it's actually pretty common so I did
some google searching and the original
mirrors that just came out a few years
ago had the same problem a lot of people
were sick the problem is that one of the
ways you can counter motion sickness
with first-person games is that there's
a gun in front of you there's a big
theme balances you to focus on and it's
like a stable n point that tells your
body oh you're not really moving but
without the gun all you're seeing is I'm
moving like and you see hands in front
of you moving and it look I'm getting
sick just thinking well I think you're
just it's not just me though just queasy
you did I mean I have a queasy guy but
it is like I can't imagine you on a
roller coaster I don't get sick on
roller coasters weird they know how is
that possible no i get i get second cars
if i read so like every good at not
everybody I don't some people don't
maybe maybe that runner the runner can
you can read in the car my wife gets
sick yeah and I'm always just like
what's wrong with you wise like oh so
the reason I brought this up is because
I know why why so so you're you can't
play Mirza I can play for about a half
hour and then the real lifetripp you or
my vehicle that's it and I actually had
to do that for a live stream so this
video of me attempting to play the dry
heat Jackie like dear i know it's worth
it oh that's so do you guys know why we
get nauseous from motion sickness nikis
cuz you're weak now why do you miss
you've never gotten majestic does it
have something to do with like your
inner ear it does everything okay so why
would your inner ear cause you to get my
options let's talk this out think think
about it I like that melua door
something in the ear and if right
balance but why does that make you sick
why is it making nauseous I was after
your stomach um because it okay I'm
totally making up stuff pulling it
directly out of my butthole yep but I'm
gonna say that it's because for whatever
reason imbalance triggers a digestive
thing and you did not answer the
question at all that but that you just
repeated what restaurant I added the
digestive thing right yeah you'll need
somebody to work yeah I guess no but
like I'm trying to think if I ever got
motion sick this may be on a bed zone
once right okay on one very common sure
but that was it and that was only
because I was wasted yeah like I had
drank so much so you could have puked
from that oh well yeah yeah I'm saying
like just the dumbest thing ever not to
totally change I was I was on an
excursion for a cruise sure and they
they had us go swim with turtles okay
I'm swimming with turtles oh my god is
great wasted then they get you back on
the boat and the second you get back on
the boat then I go but up your gully
gonna just pour vodka down this is a
great is it is it because then you get
back on the cruise ship and I puked for
three hours yeah because I was just like
this nope that's not what's good anyway
and you have a guess guess for me Ben uh
why is it happen why does it get you
sick why like why would you need to why
is it why is the the motion sickness I'm
having I really don't know okay so the
interesting thing is basically so your
brain and your eyes are seeing hey I'm
moving they see movement in front of
them everything is telling them hey I'm
moving by your inner ear which senses
movement is saying nope I'm not moving
there's nothing going on it's completely
flat hmm and what that is your body then
thinks oh hey I'm poisoned because my
brain and my ear working two different
things wait a minute that takes a lot of
liberties with like how the human body
what body is pretty on that poison I'm
poison it's saying time something's
weird I'm poor I got poison things are
not communicating as they should I need
to puke this out that makes a lot better
i love the human body isn't that's the
totally
cool it's very cool i get it with like
alcohol when you're like your body's
like oh I'm poison but I need to get a
little poison but your body in the same
way that like allergies so that your
body is reacting the dumb things that it
shouldn't be allergic right and the way
it handles it is like by a variety of
reactions so it's a sneezing exactly
sits down and let's get this out at a
hundred miles an hour so that's no it's
not always one to one the best thing
your body could be doing but you know
you can't be picky well hopefully when
we start uh engineering the human body
right we can eliminate we should just
secrete Dramamine whenever we feel that
would stop the properties I just push
the right button on your I hood and a
little bit of that I'd hide a heads up
you say it okay you know you play a game
you see like this this your health and
the thing yes or that's a HUD ok yeah
got it a HUD HUD I'll be rabid I'll be
writing next time you guys'll wrong word
gave you a hug okay in the movie
cloverfield the main character was named
HUD he's a shot in first person whoa
that movie has layers that's very funny
then that is a deep ass movie as can't
believe that I'm a monster yeah uh you
guys so so so anyway you played the game
for a little bit you like it it's okay i
think it aside from the Buchan the game
is fine i think it doesn't really do a
whole lot more than what the first game
did so if you like the first game it's a
lot more of that there's like a few new
abilities and stuff but for the most
part space so you're not so so you
basically like told your guy piling
you're like I can't review the game it's
gonna make me sick yeah I told them
almost immediately I got the code and a
half hour Arthur who's our reviews
editor I was like I'm sorry Arthur this
game and it sucks because it's came in
so late so we're gonna call you did he
call you a nasty named after mm-hmm was
it like you was grumpy anybody he
understood like what are you gonna do
huh like what are you gonna do if you
all right please would you like me would
you be able to review that game if you
felt felt like I realize you've never
other what other I guess what other
types of excuses can a game reviewer
provide uh maybe it's like like I have a
like I'm ethically against shootings
do I mention I I think zombies free
range yeah so I've got another one who
color blindness yeah certain games I can
physically not play is your color blind
because I'm combats it because to me
that's a handicap whereas your motion
sickness is just funny make fun of me
tons of times my car no that's not fair
there's nothing you could do about that
ditto with the motion thing yeah you do
that is funny because you just like take
dramamine do something well they're
upset we've talked about is 600 our
glasses I could be wearing to fix my
color bias right no one sent them to me
yet oh we gotta get those going
just needs to send it to me I didn't
know that was a thing yeah I can XCOM
eyes yeah there they it's amazing how do
we get them as sponsors I don't know I
feel like I haven't heard about them
since we did that story so they're not
be a company anymore um all right let's
go from Mirror's Edge and pivot into the
great game of competitive paintball fan
have you ever gone paintball oh yeah
yeah yeahs play there's really many
times you're an expert not an expert I'm
actually really bad at it sure but yeah
I play paintball quite a bit the problem
for me is is that usually my glasses fog
up when I first couple seconds and then
somebody just shoot me in the back cher
quite and and that's very pain yeah
glasses are not really made for
paintball now it's terrible I've been
payable only like three three or four
times um I like paintball I'm not the
biggest fan of like paintball culture
it's a very intense is you gonna me
please show up and it's like you're on
the FOP like people are ready to go out
yeah like they are decked to the nines
and easy the guys and girls who are like
hardcore like you know they're very Navy
SEALs like that kind of resume a
little more I don't know I find that
like it's like you're let you've landed
on another planet like it's a very weird
experimental weird stuff in it um and
this is athletic and its strategic a
cool uh so you went for your bachelor
party that I just had this message thank
you and tell us how to come it was great
we had a really good time the place was
out in Long Island and I've only gone
once before and the place I went before
was just like hey you're in a forest and
whatever there's ropes determining where
the map ends here they had like
jit courses there was like a full-sized
crashed plane that's cool like fuselage
that you can go through tanks of like
old-timey whatever military vehicles
there was a full castle map so were you
Michael you can call him up to the
ramparts and like cover people do they
do like capture the flag stuff uh the
castle map did have a capture the flag
element most of it is just straight team
deathmatch yeah with a timer they call
it death match no I kept calling it that
and they looked at me a little weird but
like no one's gonna die here but just
paint yeah but it um it's very intense
it was my bachelor party so my brother
got me a smoke grenade oh no she goes
also spoken aids I was able to like her
and like that was cool um it was it was
super fun we went for five hours and
like flew by ya 85 degrees outside hot
Sun but I was like you totally just turn
that part of your brain off right and
and I'm still sore I've been five and
six days house or your feet it's not
your feet feeling hits your thighs and
come on put it from crowd yeah sure cuz
almost all the time you're like crouch
down right um and I've got I mean I
should hear why not look at that's
provides a welt yeah bruise that's not a
nice and even L ahead cuz that sometimes
bruises turn yellow after wired so looks
like somebody just painted last time I
went I got shot yet right below my wet
ends the worst place you well it's it
just it hurts the most you are exactly
and I had a bloody circle yeah like that
was sort of intercepted by my ring it
was crazy that's gross it's gross in
like when you get shot you know you
don't start bleeding right away and then
you start bleeding you're like oh damn
it what what is that and then you're
like oh my god it hurts it hurts a lot
yeah yeah well you're lying there is an
amazing comradery though because I what
we were at six people in total and you
guys didn't know we were together here
your own team yeah but we were playing
randoms and we were matched with random
so each of the games it was like ten on
ten so wait against maybe maybe some of
those like super hardcore people the
funny thing I've noticed about the super
hardcore people do their own thing not
only they're not always that good like
you'll see the people come in like full
tactical gear like they bought all the
stuff and no
like older guys sometimes because they
have a like a lot of disposable income
but they're not like the crazy ones you
have to watch for are like the dude in
flip-flops shorts and like a wife be a
no I just like sprint at you like a
madman in one hand to guns yeah by crazy
stuff so those are the ones you have to
watch I mean I like that people get
super into it but they tend not to be
the most intense guys to fight um I just
like there's a weird bonding that you
feel their brothers your brothers in
battle like it's like you finish a game
and like it goes well and like i'm using
cut by watching this guides back that
I've never ever met before yeah and then
it ends and you're like like doing the
like food you know the buddy like arm
bash thing yeah for this dude I've never
met before and I was just like very
that's cool it's much better than like
Gigi you suck my gaming week at the end
of a match in call duty so yeah I love
it I think the thing people don't
realize the most is like dude
paintballing will kick your ass what are
you in my physical standpoint yeah it
it's it's tough I mean you definitely to
work out you need to it's a workout it's
absolutely workout um and you get
bruised up and and sore as I said like
my my thighs don't you take that mask
off don't you dare take that well
they're there the place we went to was
like very careful of course they all are
yeah cuz it's like oh we don't want
people going blind right there goes
another customer ya know for sure you
don't know that one of the things that
we did I was at a bachelor party a
couple years ago and what we did at the
very end when we had like already
exhausted all the other stuff was we did
jousting matches Oh basically you had
one guy on one side of the course the
other guy on the other side of the
course they would run at each other
shooting and then the first guy was like
basically like a duel and the first guy
first guy to get shot loses sometimes
both get you it's the same time I was
where the awesome got shot like a
ricochet yeah so that's my biggest
problem with paintball and I guess
that's like the first issue plaguing
that scene is like how do we determine
you know who's in something lately shot
like I'm a prideful unlike I go by like
honor system and i will like call myself
out but a lot of people are just like
i'll keep going until the ref calls me
yeah gracias that's ya know because do
not know if I'm shot so I'm shot in a
place that you can't tell that I was
shot
okay I'll just keep going that's so dick
yeah I know I know it's ethically
questionable that is I I've done it
cheating I guess I'm like knitting
cheating it's like with the diving in
FIFA actually there's this one map I
played last summer uh I my brother's
bachelor party where my brother's to be
brother-in-law shot me on my own team
friendly fire style asian know like
because you didn't realize Shami in the
thigh and Here I am like in the middle
of like the woods looking around like
who the just shot me like I was
going on here and I'm you know you sort
of like raise your gun yeah in the air
like I'm out I'm out yeah and I'm like
what the hell is going on and then at
the end of the round the guy comes as
like I think I shot you yeah why don't
you say something I could have played
for 20 more minutes yeah yeah yeah man
paintballs not it's not all sunshine and
roses no it's very intense very intense
yeah I see you gotta be honest though
your shot get out that's how that's what
I say to mike sugar fighting I I better
i'm fine with untrustworthy I mean I'm
just gonna keep playing until like it's
very obvious I've do you have like 30
fresh wealthy the problem is is that
then you get lit up afterwards you get
hit like in the top of the head or
something it's very a and it can take 20
minutes before the next game so you
don't want to get out early right so I
get that instinct sure but it's like
it's come on its competition yeah
actually next bachelor party you go to
we went we went skeet shooting oh I've
never done that before yeah with like
shotguns is it was cool yeah it's for a
pigeon yeah that's cool that sounds
awesome um alright I I really enjoyed
the conversation we had last week about
the social etiquette stuff uh I test
Russ on the spot to come up with the
next subject for for that topic of
conversation that I can have with Ben so
what do you have ok this is a big deal
for me that Jeff's is skeptical that
this is a bad best and thats a generous
judge really caused a lot of interesting
social problems with people that I'm
very close to my fiance for one and
either close to her you're pretty
reasonably even you know that person you
know give or take ok you know their
middle nah so it's about um texting
specifically and about using periods in
texting it can apply to emails two
but for the just to focus it will talk
just talk about texting now when I am
texting with someone I'm very careful
about where I use periods in the text
specifically at the end of the text
because i feel like if you use periods
throughout and at the end it indicates
kind of a dour almost down either pissed
off about something or depressed or not
happy mentality that I have right I'll
give you an exact right wait so so
you're saying you use the periods mid
text I'll use it yeah so if I need to
end a thought in the middle / use a
period that's fine at the end though no
period no re i think i'm with you on
that unless i'm like pissed off at the
end right you do realize though that
makes absolutely no sense like why did
that happen sure why i know i am not
like because because using proper
punctuation should be something that we
should do sure but you establish that
like in the world of this sort of
munication i am what have you proper
punctuation is not really Thank chore
and it also brings on a different
connotation in to what texting has
become yeah you know I mean like same
thing goes with like Twitter like I
won't put a period at the end of a tweet
that I because I don't want it to mean
something I quite see ended to it has a
lot of weight to it periods mean a lot
now what yeah yeah but they didn't used
to meet you just read a magazine article
or newspaper article or book and they
would be there because they should be
there and that's how things work yeah so
how did they become cuz it was right up
with emotion they weren't instruments of
like conversation I know also the other
that just blew my mind did it you kind
of that deep no but listen like that
were feel weird but that doesn't like
like why did that happen I'm an exploit
so evolution of this is my theory yeah
the reason it's pregnant with emotion
good good description of it is because a
period is not necessary in texting or I
am or what have you right doesn't need
to be there so by putting the effort in
and saying I'm gonna put a period here
at the end indicates there's a reason
you're doing it a mad at you you're
already or whatever I'm feeling grumpy
or something like that
already it's already clear that the
sentence it's not like a normal sentence
in an article on in a magazine where
there needs to be a period to separate
the next sentence the text is over it's
clear that this is the message so i
remarried it's almost like double ending
the message in a very kind of abrupt
yeah yeah you're right curly right you
already pressed send exactly present is
essentially area yes yeah deeper than I
thought it was when we were talking
about this before the show I was I was a
little on the fence too i have to admit
russ is like I don't know that this is
gonna have the same significance as a
kiss on the cheek versus a kiss on the
elbow apparently but this goes way
island where I come from everybody
kisses on you so the really tricky thing
about this is that I feel like there's a
lot of people that don't even realize
that they're doing it so the
conversation doing what sending those
periods and sending those messages
exactly well its generational well I'm
not going through my thing it's not
though so I was talking to my fiance
about it cuz they're like I your fiance
is older no she's younger than me
actually but not dramatically so and the
she would do it and it was clear that
she was only doing it when she was upset
but she didn't realize that she was
doing that what's even weirder so I sat
next to her on the subway and scrolled
through text and ninety to ninety-five
percent of the text that ended with
periods were like I have a headache or
I'm feeling grumpy today cuz work was
really crappy crappy or the subways
delayed is actually a fascinating social
experiment that she was actually doing
it without even realized and I think
ever I think a lot of Illinois something
you want and I'll to here's another
product reading texts proof positive
yeah hex from my mother even she does
okay not that she is beneath me in terms
of technology or as a person but but she
does it she tell me she's on a cruise
right now she's telling me about it and
in no period periods mid text yeah but
at the end nothing nothing because I
have an anger like I I'm upset those are
tougher to find ok let me maybe stay
forever contentious relationship with no
I mean I really don't with people all
right I'm just looking at it's not even
being upset with you it just means the
person is upset about something
potential right and and if I do find a
period it's like a mistake you were like
I would imagine it was just accidentally
or like it meant to be a question mark
is there is there something about
capitalization that fits into this
construct in some ways I don't know how
to use capitals apps caps are still they
use like all caps sometimes all caps is
a little bit different right you know
sometimes if I'm like if I'm
constructing a tweet yeah I phone yeah I
just won't capitalize but but like if
I'm on a keyboard that's a little bit
different but this phone automatically
does that yeah phones are the particular
period but like if I'm doing a proper
noun in the middle of the word or even
middle a sentence yes I'm not gonna do
that and to me that that conveys a
certain level of whimsical pneus sure to
the 10 more gradual little cash sure
kind of thing totally my it's funny say
that though because that's changed for
me because the keyboard i use now is
predictive and a smarter keyboard and
caps the things that should be caps
automatically I don't have to hit like
right shift and for New Jersey like it
just does yeah I think I phone use them
yeah yeah so that's kind of going away
too but what about trunk doesn't know
how to write out trunk we're gonna crawl
gonna go with trunk okay tails trunk oh
it's see Jeff doesn't know what it's the
Tribune I online online content content
the worst the worst name ever can we
contribute to explain what that was a
tribune company which owns the Los
Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune
renamed themselves to sound cool and
jazzy I think this is just happen
yesterday just happened yesterday trunk
with a lowercase T that's not good and
its trunk incorporated so it's TR 0 and
C all lowercase int I NCBI is got past
and the logo is like a weird rainbow
logo okay it's really bad that's really
but like that so that was a case where I
was like do I mean do how do I
capitalized this when I was tweeting
about it in a snarky way yesterday huh
when I got a trunk three alien wars
that's not bad pretty good pretty and
this so I guess there's gonna lie how do
they been totally miss that it just
happened yesterday it was it was like
you're not very
honky tonk I know about the gorilla I
know but God everyone knows about
gorillas very sad was a long day said by
the way it was very funny Donald Trump
had his press conference on Tuesday and
because we're in the world that we live
today they asked him about the gorilla
did then he was like very sad very sad
you know that this happened I don't
remember exactly what happened but like
it was supposed to be like residential
right but oh my god for its they're like
let's talk about whatever you must go
let's just like throw every moment he'll
answer the question he loves it oh he
does this thing um so that's all that's
all I have to say I think it's probably
not just periods I'm sure there's a lot
of other things so if people can think
of things call in or right in and man it
I would love to hear them but I really
think there's a lot of a lot of subtext
that people do not realize that are in
that's in texting and emails that um you
know you just should think about yeah I
have to say also that I didn't realize
this at all until I write about it that
you're not really it's actually you're
sounding more pissed off than you
actually are if you are adding a period
yeah right text so I actually stopped
doing it because like I'm a reporter
obviously my intention is to be you know
do the punctuation garage right so I
actually stopped doing it because I was
sending the wrong message right now it's
amazing it's amazing how that can affect
and you know it's amazing that we all
decided it equally silently various like
conscious just like all subconsciously
agree to one but everyone's a while you
come on a person that like does it I
know I charge you this narrative yeah
and then you have to like look through
their ever like the evidence of previous
texts and whether that match yeah that's
weird yeah oh look man I had my doubts
but you you really pulled it all Lana
you really did a good job right you
brought it I'm gonna do more than shake
your hand now oh you guys came straight
I heard it he's gonna hug and kiss we're
gonna do that is like the arm bump
whatever whatever it wasn't paintball uh
well this has been great before we go I
want to just quickly bring up one of the
voicemails we got I feel like we would
be doing an injustice if we didn't
address this tech question as my Sarah
non tech podcast as we are someone
called and wants to know about a way to
get more reliable Wi-Fi in a bigger
house you know we're kind of in a
bubble here in the New York area being
in apartments and smaller living spaces
routers they do what they have to do we
don't really pay attention to like oh
you have to a two-story house that's how
can fill that up with Wi-Fi I don't
really have a definitive answer uh you
can buy routers that obviously boast
longer ranges but there was one product
that I never checked out and I don't
really know if it's good or not but
maybe this would help the person who
called in check out cnet review yes I
did we review it I think we must have
right it's called arrow and again maybe
we heard it I don't know euro gyro it
doesn't matter it's eer oh go to eer Oh
calm and it's all about blanketing your
entire home in reliable Wi-Fi I don't
think it's cheap now can't be cheap I'm
just looking at judging by this website
this is like a three-hundred-dollar
thing that's the least uh but check it
out because I remember when it might
have been a Kickstarter thing uh but but
check it out it's a system that you can
sort of why yeah so you can buy this Wow
okay that it it can be as much as 500
bucks for for three of these sort of
repeater router things or 350 for two of
them and you can get you can get cheaper
routers you know that that will repeat
that yeah yeah you can use them as
boosters and other errors in your how I
don't know this guy is doing that
already this could this is likely the
higher end solution on but Ben is right
and I do this in my parents house I have
to basically two routers that just act
one is the source and one is the bridge
repeater yep and that you can probably
do for under Georgia bucks look at that
you should answer that guy's quite I did
I essentials like think you know what I
would also say is like if you're near
what if you live near like a best buy or
something like that I don't go cheap
with a router because it makes a
difference in terms of range but so I go
out there by like a hundred fifty dollar
router and try it out for a day and see
if it makes a difference if it's if it's
not doing the trick return it by a two
hundred radder and see if that does it
and keep ramping yourself up and maybe
you'll get there just with one router
just keep spending money just keep
spending money in controllably and it is
what is best buy and
no go to see that calm story you sell
routers you know I got no but like we
are we are correct on our best buy link
