effects I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update amazon has a smartphone
that can show you images with 3d effects
store unlimited photos online and it has
smart scanning to help you buy things
faster and it's all for two hundred
dollars with a contract amazon is hoping
techy tricks and loyal customers are the
magic formula to get people to leave
their current smartphones for a fire
phone the fire phone comes out on july
25th and right now ATT is the only
carrier in the u.s. selling it here's a
quick breakdown of the phone's features
that 3d effect is something amazon calls
dynamic perspective where the image
changes as you move your phone sensors
on four corners track where your head is
and it moves in relation to you that 3d
effect can be found in maps and also
when you're browsing the web and
scrolling through text tilting the phone
will auto scroll a page or you can even
scroll through menus now if you put your
finger on the screen it'll stop the
scroll effect there's also something
called firefly which can recognize a
hundred million different items if you
point the camera at a package of soap
well you can get a link to buy that soap
on amazon it can also recognize music to
give you a link to buy a song Firefly
also identifies art books barcodes and
the audio from TV shows free unlimited
photo backups are a major perk but the
phone itself has some quality parts it
has a 4.7 inch screen and Gorilla Glass
is on both sides so it doesn't scratch
there's a quad-core processor dual
stereo speakers and the back sports a 13
megapixel camera the two-hundred-dollar
model gets you 32 gigs but there's also
a $300 model with double the storage and
that's with a contract so while amazon
created a new type of phone effect
facebook has been busy launching a new
type of app it's called slingshot and
it's for sending short-lived photos and
videos with friends but there's a catch
to these messages
can't see a photo or video right away
it's pixelated you can only unlock it
when you sling a photo back to that
friend so you're not really having a
conversation it's just friends slinging
photos and videos back and forth to
unlock messages and the cycle of
curiosity continues until someone just
stops caring so what's the point of all
this Facebook is hoping that it catches
on with the same crowd that uses
snapchat that's another app with
disappearing messages Facebook try to
copy snapchat once before with an app
called poke but that flopped that's your
tech news update but you can dive into
more details on the fire phone at cnet
com from our studios in New York I'm
