and right now we're taking a first look
at the samsung active odyssey this
affordable Windows Phone 8 handset is
now available on horizon for just 49 99
running Microsoft's latest mobile
software windows phone 8 the Samsung
ativ Odyssey is certainly a capable
device powered by a 1.5 gigahertz
dual-core Snapdragon s4 plus processor
the ativ Odyssey has plenty of power to
drive its OS with authority also on
board is one gigabyte of RAM and 8
gigabytes of internal storage you can
add more memory via the odyssey's
microSD card slot as well the 4 inch
AMOLED screen is on the small side and
offers a relatively low 800 x 480 pixel
resolution above the display is a 1.2
megapixel front-facing camera while
below it are three capacitive buttons
for primary windows phone functions on
the left side of the device is a thin
volume rocker and flap covering the
micro SD card slot sitting on the right
edge is a key for power and one to
engage the odyssey's camera system
pressing that dedicated shutter button
also kicks the phone into camera mode
even when the handset is in standby a
nice touch around back you'll find the
ativ Odyssey zamane 5 megapixel camera
and LED flash here too is a large curved
grill that contains the phone speaker
placed underneath the smooth plastic
back cover is the phone's removable 2100
milliamp battery actually the battery
cover as well as the odyssey's plastic
services feel slippery and dare I say
cheap frankly I prefer the metal or even
higher grade polycarbonate materials
used in other windows phones such as the
HTC 8x and Nokia Lumia 920 as a windows
phone 8 device the Samsung ativ Odyssey
features a clean and clearly arranged
home screen what Microsoft calls the
Start screen instead of widgets or app
icons like you'd find on Android or iOS
products the start screen consists of
square tiles which wink and flicker at
you with pertinent information updated
in real time for instance you can
quickly see the number of unread emails
sitting in your inbox any missed calls
or check the weather a decline
of course tapping a tile launches its
associated application you can also
remove resize and rearrange tiles to
suit your tastes the Samsung ativ
Odyssey connects to Verizon's 4G LTE
data network to and has tight
integration with numerous Microsoft
services such as office Xbox games and
music store front while the price is
nice the question remains just how much
of a deal this phone adds up to be sure
to check back soon for a full review I'm

been a first look at this Samsung ativ
Odyssey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
