like it was cracked out the center of a
meteorite but it could if you invested
in this the lossy sphere external hard
drive we're going to take a look at it
and some of the scenes other external
hard drive tech here at CES 2014 so this
bizarre sphere has one terabytes worth
of storage it's expensive though it
costs four hundred and ninety dollars
but it was handcrafted and silvered in
france so if that's the kind of thing
you value then maybe this is the hard
drive for you next up we have this it's
the little big disk too hard drive now
this is a thunderbolt hard drive it's
got one terabyte storage and it has two
thunderbolt ports there's no word on how
much this will cost exactly but with
that dual thunderbolt power expected to
be expensive next up is this is the last
seat cool bhutto which I'm told means
rollie pollie in French it's basically a
very fancy USB key it comes in 16 or 32
gigabyte options and it's going to cost
fifty dollars next up here's an
interesting one it's the receipt fuel
now this is basically an external hard
drive for tablets you download an app
like this and that lets you manage and
transfer files back and forth you can
stream video from the from the fuel to
your tablet and you can upload any kind
of file from your tablet to the fuel
it's got one terabyte of storage most
importantly though it's wireless which
is quite cool means you don't have to
faff around with very many cables it's
going to cost two hundred dollars the
little big disk two is going to be out
in the next couple of months the lessee
cool bhutto is out now and you can
expect the fuel and the sphere in the
next few weeks would you buy any of
these storage solutions let me know on
