cnet.com and welcome to road warrior
where we take a look at the hottest
gadgets for life on the go coming up
wireless speakers for your cell phone
the future of Toyota hybrids and one
annoying GPS interface device let's
start on a high note though the coolest
wireless mouse at CES the Mogo mouse x54
one of our backstage pass winners Doug
Platts shows it off sits in your PC card
slot this one is an X 54 sits in the
smart card slot so you see it fits right
in there and then you know this is a
mouse this is a mousey this is a fully
functional bluetooth laser mouse Doug
also noted that the new mogo mouse has a
trackpad in the middle as well slim and
functional next Nicoli has a portable
speaker and headset combo for your phone
that's great for the car kyocera
wireless portable speaker with a headset
included and the idea is that you use
the bluetooth headset to connect with
your phone and then if you want to use
that your cell phone as a speaker is
connected to this wireless speaker here
and you will automatically transform
this bluetooth headset into a portable
bluetooth speaker for your cell phone
Nicole said you can actually mount the
speaker in your car if you want let's
roll on over to the 2007 nissan maxima
now Brian tell us how you really feel
about this navigation input device
you've also got voice guidance ability
you can use your voice or you can use
this annoying little fiddly thing I
don't even call this this little knob is
it's kind of like a laptop joystick but
it's much more sensitive every time I
run into this I've hated it and Nissan
loves it you just give it the slightest
little touch and you tip over to one
direction or the other very devilishly
hard to use while underway just to be
fair Brian did like the way the bird's
eye view worked on the map system let's
cheer him up have a look at this
luscious Toyota f th s concept hybrid
it's sort of the future take on the
prius right Brian but very much unlike
the Prius this car has 400 horsepower to
the rear wheels and a retractable roof
panel leaves the pillars in place but
clears away all the sheet metal between
them nonetheless the driver never feels
exposed thanks to the rather extreme pod
of the drivers area and worst of all
it's a concept which means you won't see
something like this actually ship for
quite a long time if ever that's it for
this edition of road warrior I'm Tom
Merritt check back next time for more
gadgets to keep you armed and
dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
