I'm also the parent of a child who loves
the iPad we have one iPad in our house
and it's loaded up with all kinds of fun
and hopefully educational apps for him
but it's also loaded up with my Facebook
account my email and all kinds of stuff
I don't want him messing with now Apple
is kind enough to include some parental
restrictions on the iPad under the
general settings so that I can lock out
some features and limit the damage my
cake can do to my credit card and my
reputation those are great tools but
when you really want some peace of mind
there's guided access totally separate
from the parental controls you'll find
guided access by going to Settings
General accessibility and then scroll
down to guided access
I still see in the description and navy
and guided access allows you to
temporarily lock down the iPad to just
one single app the home button gets
disabled there's no multitasking your
kid is limited just to the app that you
choose for them to get started flip the
switch and tap set passcode to create a
four-digit passcode ideally one that
your kids not going to be able to guess
next find the app you want your kid to
use launch it and then once it's up and
running quickly tap the home button
three times now this is where it gets
kind of cool before iOS locks down the
app they also give you a chance to mark
out any areas on the screen that you
want to disable maybe it's an in-app
purchase button or a settings menu you
just circle it and make any adjustments
you also have an options button down
here at the bottom which gives you a
separate menu for disabling sleep-wake
buttons or volume buttons the touch
control and motion control by default
sleep and volume are disabled but touch
and motion are left on works fine for me
but if you want to put an episode of
Barney in front of your toddler without
them going to town on the playback
controls disabling touch might be the
way to go so when you're ready to lock
the app in press the start button at the
top right and if you disabled any areas
on the screen you'll find that those
areas are grayed out now you'll notice
that if you hit the home button
you'll just see a little banner
reminding you that you're in guided
access mode at this point you can hand
this thing over to your kid who will
probably groan about being stuck with a
phonics app now when it's time to pry
the iPad away and put it back to normal
all you have to do is triple click the
home button again enter that four digit
password that you created and you're
free again to use the iPad however you
wish or if your kid is ace their phonics
and you want to treat them to a little
game time just open up a new app triple
click and turn that guided access on
again so there you go that's how to take
any iOS device and temporarily lock it
down to a single app for more how-to

i'm donald bell for CNET giving kids
everywhere a new reason to hate their
parents</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
