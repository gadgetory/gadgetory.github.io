we've liked more than others the jawbone
up has always been one of them in the up
three was announced back in November we
were waiting for it when was it going to
arrive integrating heart rate tracking
into a little band it's finally here and
that's not it jawbone has also unveiled
another band the up two which is this
which looks a lot like the up three
that's on my wrists they're smaller they
are easier to charge and what else do
they offer well one has heart rate
tracking and one doesn't and that's the
big difference between these two the up
two is a replacement to the up 24 which
has bluetooth syncing basic fitness
tracking steps sleep walking and buzzes
to remind you of things just like
previous jawbone bands the new up tune
up 3 do not have displays they basically
look like regular wristbands they have
tiny icons that light up if you tap to
tell you about whether you're in sleep
mode or activity tracking mode the up 3
adds bioimpedance for its heart rate
monitoring which is different than
optical technology and the difference
there is that not only can it provide
heart rate tracking but it has galvanic
skin response ambient and skin
temperature and jawbone claims you may
be able to do stress reactions and other
types of input related health
measurements as time goes on interesting
kind of an unknown territory unless
you've used body media which used that
same technology in another wearable
these feel pretty light on my wrist the
clasp is a lot harder to attach than the
old band which was iconic but a lot of
people found a tended to break was a
little strange with the springiness and
came in several sizes it also had that
cap on the end which was really annoying
there's no more cap it's one size fits
all but you have to deal with attaching
that clasp and it's got a cool new
charger that's magnetic so you could
plug this right into the wall and have
it glom right on pretty easy to use both
of them last about a week
the jawbone up 2 and up 3 are going to
be available to order now the up 2 is
$100 the up 3 is 180 us only for the
moment Global eventually and there will
be an up for believe it or not coming
this summer that adds NFC style payments
from American Express kind of like Apple
pay but you gotta have an American
Express card and that one is $20 more
$200
that's the jawbone up landscape stay
tuned for more and full reviews at Cena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
