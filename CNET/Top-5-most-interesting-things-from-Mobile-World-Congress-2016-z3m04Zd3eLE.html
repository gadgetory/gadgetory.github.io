Mobile World Congress 2016 is history
here are the top five most interesting
things out of MWC 2016 in Barcelona
number five we are everything phones
aren't the only thing at the show vr was
all over Barcelona this year LG had a
new take on the VR headset with the LG
360 VR all the brains are in the phone
so the headset you wear are like glasses
pretty neat and concept also both
Samsung and LG is reduce new cameras to
take 360 degrees pictures there have
still pictures to look at if you have a
VR headset number 4 LG rolling but look
at this thing
it's a remote-controlled spherical robot
it's made by LG and it has a camera and
IR sensor mic and speakers it can even
project a laser in case you want your
pets to chase it around the house I've
had a softbox Robo fence maybe the next
version of this thing will have an
autonomous mode at number 3 Sony's
concepts
sony has some of the more interesting
concepts on display check out the Xperia
projector it would project the screen on
any flat surface you can then interact
with that screen using your voice
gestures and touch I'm not sure if the
projector will ever see the light of day
but a product and selling that will
definitely launch the Xperia ear
it's a bluetooth earbud that connects to
your phone that can handle voices
essentially Sony's trying to put a
personal assistant in your ear that
sounds kind of weird now that I hear it
out loud at number two the Samsung
Galaxy s7 and the s7 edge okay so
visually the s7 and s7 edge aren't
radical departures from the galaxy s6
lines but Samsung made some revisions
that are great both the s7 and the s7
edge have microSD card slots and are
water-resistant so you can expand the
store then chuck it into a pool
what's that don't do that okay so it's
probably not advisable to do that
whatever
Samsung also packed in some interesting
facts inside of the s7 its water cool to
keep the sister from overheating
you can record gameplay on the actual
phone before we get to number one
there's something that was flat-out
insane from MWC 2016 check out this
stage from Samsung's unpacked event
where it unveiled its new gadgets it's
like a scene out of an alien invasion
movie on to number one the most
interesting thing of the show is the LG
g5 how do you stand out in a world when
almost every phone looks alike you add
an expansion ports the LG g5 has a
removable battery you can access by
pulling on the phone's chin and that's
also how you add accessories to the g5 a
camera attachment brings a shutter
button and a dial to zoom into pictures
there's also an audio attachment that up
samples audio this could be big or not
but it's definitely interesting that
does it for us for more top 5 like this
