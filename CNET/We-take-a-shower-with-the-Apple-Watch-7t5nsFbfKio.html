my dope board shorts but what we are
here for is to talk about the Apple

yes it's water-resistant so we're going
to not waterproof but water-resistant so
we're going to take a little shower with
it and do a few things to show you how
water-resistant is Apple measures it at
it's rated ipx7 so what that really
means for you is that you can put it
under water like three feet down for
about 30 minutes but really the advice
is not to put it under water for
prolonged periods of time so before we
start this shameless video here you
always got to come acquit because the
