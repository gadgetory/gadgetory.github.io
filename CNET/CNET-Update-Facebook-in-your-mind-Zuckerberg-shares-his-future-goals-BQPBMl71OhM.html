telepathically i'm raja carry this is
your seen that update Mark Zuckerberg
the founder of Facebook discussed his
vision for the future during a Q&amp;amp;A on
his profile page he believes computers
will be so advanced that you'll be able
to send thoughts to other friends but
until we evolve to create virtual
reality with our minds we'll have to
settle for headsets like the oculus rift
you see Facebook owns oculus so it comes
as no surprise that Zuckerberg says the
next major computing and communication
platform will be virtual reality he sees
a world where we are using VR glasses on
a regular basis he also says he's
focused on developing artificial
intelligence at Facebook so the system
can better understand the meaning of
your posts that way you can see more
related topics and advertisements and if
a computer can tell what's in a photo it
could describe the photo to a blind user
he wrote that Facebook is trying to
build an AI that has better vision or
hearing since that humans to understand
context so when he says it can listen
better he means it can translate speech
to text between any language no need to
look to the future if there are some
Facebook changes happening right now for
starters there's a new logo you'll
notice the lowercase a in facebook lost
its little hook Facebook's creative
director says this logo is more friendly
and approachable and apparently it's
also more mobile-friendly because the
thinner letters are easier to read on a
smartphone screen well hook or no hook
on the a facebook wants you to feel good
about using it to send money to friends
the person-to-person payments feature in
messenger is now available to everyone
in the US the money transfers between
checking accounts assuming both people
have given their checking account info
to Facebook the payments industry is
quickly evolving Apple pay has increased
the awareness of mobile payments but in
the United Kingdom tap to pay technology
is quite common some banking entities
are coming up with new ways to pay with
smart bracelets instead of going with
Apple pay the UK's barclaycard revealed
a new wristband key fob and sticker this
week for British shoppers with the beep
a band you can flick your wrist to pay
it terminals it works with any visa or
mastercard in the UK and mastercard is
also testing out payment wristbands but
it doesn't end there mastercard is also
testing a way for you to pay by taking a
selfie according to a CNN Money report
when you buy something online you can
use your phone to snap a photo of your
face to verify it's really you for
security it's just a test now so if it
doesn't work MasterCard won't lose face
that's it for this tech news update but
there's always more at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
