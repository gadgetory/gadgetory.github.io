camera I'm gonna go meet Fredrik Lindsey
and Ally zone they'll go on a little
photo walk around San Francisco and then
download and process their pictures so
we can see how the Lytro fairs in the
real world
hi I'm Fredrik I'm a professional
photographer host of this week in photo
and I'm looking forward to playing with
the light truck hi I'm Lindsay I work as
an environmental consultant and I am a
recreational photographer
point-and-shoot is my thing
hi I'm Riley so I'm a tech lover and I'm
a new but okay guys spreader - Lindsey
Ally's on it's your Lytro photo walk day
I have here three Lytro cameras have any
of you used these before never so the
deal with these cameras is that in
theory you do not need to focus because
they get all the available light and
they create an image that you can
manipulate later so here's one for you
yeah one for you and basically all
you're gonna do today is take a walk
down the imbue tafolla San Francisco
Embarcadero take some photos and then
meet me back at scene it to download
your photos and play with the software
cool enjoy the day have a great
afternoon guys all right thank you this
is actually it's kind of cool it's got a
good weight to it here's the power
button on the bottom there is a power
button there's a power button okay I'm
on I have a screen oh this is zoom right
here oh look at that will just kind of
fall okay I think I got it let's go guys
I know I'm gonna lose this let's see if
I can get the bridge
right here
I'm having trouble navigating around the
screen I like the idea of the simplicity
of this thing but I just feel like if my
hands were even a little bit bigger than
and I also kind of don't like the fact
that if you go back to a photo that you
just took it's all blurry at first at
least that's how it's showing me until
you tap on something to focus it I
didn't know that but then yeah for then
like I don't know it was a blurry photo
exactly no I deleted one because I
thought it was blurry thank you how do
we know that that's what's in focus or
not let's stop around like the floor or
something it was really blurry and then
I gonna type on the F train just try to
focus on that but the screen is so small
that I can't really know if it's
focusing on the train itself or anything
around it and if i zoom in it's just all
pixelated welcome back good oh well I
can't wait to see what you got let's go
let's get to the fun part now the the
downloading yes
come on in have a seat you'll see that
we have computers set up with USB cables
so basically just do as you would
normally do if you just got done taking
a bunch of photos okay I don't have to
do anything good points for that yes I
wonder if this would work if you're
let's say if I'm on Facebook on my iPad
it's a good thing that they have so much
stuff to geek out about cuz from my
experience this whole syncing and
downloading thing can take a while okay
so it says backup complete
I'm clicking done not very good I guess
I took less if you have a faster
computer now it's importing so it backed
up now it's importing okay 2.3 gigahertz
Intel Core i7 with 8 gigs of RAM yeah
and it's still thought the fan is right
and there's nothing else running on this
movement yeah it's doing some math in
here and we have 1 2 3 4 5 pictures out
of 40 if something really cool is
happening in front of you and you take
pictures it's too tiny on the screen for
you to figure out if you took a good
picture to capture that first time
you've seen it's not about taking you
know a picture with your eyes closed I
wouldn't even say there's a point you
this is right now it's kind of pointy
pray personally the software's too slow
for me this one so this is me again
forcing the issue so these rings there
so the front is sharp let's see if this
could get this 20 in look it's funny
isn't sharp if I go way back here
that's it sharp so that is dramatic so
that's in focus now when I click on the
guy in the background
he's a focus so for macro photography on
this
No so if you have it inside that's
that's a good point
and I don't know what the speed is of it
like how is it in low-light yeah this is
becoming a little bit of a photography
clinic so I think I'm gonna go ahead and
rescue them and get their thoughts on
the software and the downloading process
hey everyone what part is going slowly
the downloading the processing
processing the picture has been very
slow are you happy with the images that
you can see so far uh no let me clarify
I'm not happy with the images because it
seems clear that this would perform
better when you're doing close-up type
shots not everyone's gonna be shooting
pictures of grains of rice and want to
get the bowl in the background you know
so most of the pictures I took are
pretty wide you know like landscapes and
everything's really grainy and when I go
in and I try to focus on let's say a
span of the bridge or a seagull or
something it's not dramatic enough to
notice speaking of someone who would
like to take a picture of a grain of
rice and that's generally inside and it
doesn't have a flash on it so I don't
know if the quality would be good well
design-wise I had a comment on the lens
cap I expected it to turn on when I took
the wings cap off you know like it's
just a switch okay how come I come I why
is there a physical button on here if
you have a magnetic lens cap every time
I put that thing in my bag the lens cap
falls off and then it's at the bottom of
the purse and it you know it's not the
magnets numbers yeah yeah three times
while we walk back to Sina and I have to
go back and pick it up while we were
awaiting yes and yours fell off on the
way in the door alright so now we've
been talking for what like 10 15 minutes
we gotten from so none of you feel like
you would buy this camera at all
I would so it's $399 yeah yeah it's kind
of a high-priced threshold for something
that does something very specific
exactly doesn't do it as well as I would
have liked it to perform yeah personally
I wouldn't be spend $400 on it it seems
more of like an expensive toy that a
photographer would have around or a
geeky person's like you know really
excited for it other than that my
favorite thing about it was the color
okay well it sounds like we have a
pretty good verdict on the light rope
thanks guys thanks for all your thoughts
for the electro photowalk yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
