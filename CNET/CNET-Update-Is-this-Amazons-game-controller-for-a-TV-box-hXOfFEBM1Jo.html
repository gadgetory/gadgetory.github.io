there be whales on vine I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your scene that update
get ready for Amazon to come out with a
system that can stream shows and games
because there is now evidence of an
Amazon bluetooth gaming controller
digital media tech blogger Dave zetts
published these photos of the controller
at his blog you can see it has tons of
controls there are shoulder buttons
triggers there's this center button that
maybe could take you to a menu of other
android games in amazon's game circle
store information suggests that this new
system will arrive sometime in march or
april i hope you're sitting down for
this next story because what I'm about
to say may cause sudden revulsion and i
rolling in apple's app store on itunes
there is now a section dedicated to apps
for taking selfies this sharing selfie
section includes all sorts of programs
to add effects and edit your photos like
face tomb and there are apps for sharing
selfies like the popular snapchat the
selfie app section is probably popular
in makati city in the philippines which
is the selfie capital of the world
according to Time magazine time built a
database of all the photos marked with a
hashtag of selfie and it listed which
cities have the highest concentration of
selfies Manhattan and Miami where the
second and third most selfie asst cities
if you think selfies are stale there's
always wailing people are posting videos
on vine of them acting like a whale by
diving backward with their whole body
like a whale breaching the surface of
the ocean I even did my own research to
better understand this phenomenon
planking and Tebowing may have been hot
before but the trendy challenges get
more complex with videos along with
wailing videos you'll start to see 15
second commercials in Facebook's
newsfeed the network is adding 15 second
video ads that will automatically play
in your feed a company would have to pay
anywhere between 1 million
2.5 million dollars a day for one of
these commercials so you'll likely see
them associated with companies that have
deep pockets just like the videos that
your friends post the ads will play on
mute until you tap to expand and hear
the sound and if you're looking for a
new addictive app check out a game
called threes it's popular on iOS but it
just recently hit the google play store
and it cost two dollars this casual
puzzle game will suck you in as you try
to pair matching numbers beginning with
threes that's your tech news update but
you can get more details at cnet com /
update from our studios in New York I'm
