del Conte and it's time to get loaded
facebook founder mark zuckerberg wrote
an open letter in the washington post
today about privacy facebook has been
under fire for complicated and
ever-changing privacy policies lately
zuckerberg letter was sort of an apology
he promised that privacy settings would
change and simplify in the upcoming
weeks 80 will raise early termination
fees for smartphone users starting june
first this applies to anyone with a
smartphone who wants to break a two-year
contract early the fee will be three
hundred and twenty-five dollars instead
of $175 customers with non smartphones
will have the feed lowered from one 75
to 150 this stinks but keep in mind it's
prorated so the rate does go down the
closer you are to the end of the
contract Google is now offering an
encrypted search option this is the beta
service that will scramble all of your
searches and protect them from
interception if you want to give it a
try type in HTTPS / / WWE google com in
your browser as opposed to just the HTTP
or flat-out just google com and if
you're still searching for answers from
last night's lost finale be careful
about doing that online there's a lost
virus on the loose if you click it it
will ask you to download malware called
my security engine the virus itself
isn't new just the way it finds you
those are all your headlines for today I
will see you this afternoon with more
thank you for watching i'm natali del
conte with Cena TV and you've just been
loaded
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
