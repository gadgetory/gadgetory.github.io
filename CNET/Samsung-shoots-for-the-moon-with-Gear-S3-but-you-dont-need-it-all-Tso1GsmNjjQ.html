the Samsung gear s 3 is the most feature
packed risk gadget around that doesn't
mean it's the best like last year's gear
s2 the s3 has a clever rotating bezel
wheel that lets you find apps the s3 is
water and dust resistant has GPS tracks
Fitness and heart rate as a speakerphone
can make payments anywhere with samsung
pay including at normal credit card
terminals that aren't tapped to pay
enabled and it even as optional LTE to
turn into a standalone phone sounds
amazing right but the everyday feeling
of the gear s3 leans towards the
slightly clunky it's really big it looks
good on my wrist but it's not for
everyone
and Samsung's Tizen based software an
app store means that its apps supply is
pretty limited a new Spotify app is the
star streaming over Wi-Fi or LTE but it
can't download tracks to the watch gear
S three pairs of Android or Samsung
phones and even iPhones thanks to a new
gear s3 app but on iOS the connection
was buggy although it does allow a lot
of functions fitness tracking via SL and
even a limited selection of app
downloads not Spotify though it doesn't
come together into a package I found
easy to use but if you want
bleeding-edge ideas on your wrist
gear s3 might be your answer just before
warned with Android wear - and new
Google watches on the immediate horizon
you might want to wait this one out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
