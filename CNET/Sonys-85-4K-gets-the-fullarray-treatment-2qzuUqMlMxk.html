checking out Sony's flagship TV right
next to me is the
xvr X 1954 cave TV this TV has two big
things going for it for starters it's a
full array local dimming LED which means
that individual zones it can be turned
off and on to control the picture and
get higher quality color and brightness
another thing is that Sony is using its
extended dynamic range technology which
essentially means that you can get
blacker blacks and wider whites because
remember LCDs have the wider whites and
plasmas are the kings of the blacks so
with this technology Sony can get a
little bit closer to those standards of
course 4k and all this technology might
go to waste without 4k content
well Sony is partnering with some
content creators to get 4k to their TVs
however until then the TV has the
built-in x-reality pro engine which is
just a fancy way of saying that it can
up convert older content lower quality
content into what might be closer to 4k
it looks good but don't expect any
miracles
now you can't ignore how good this TV
looks it does use Sony's traditional
design however you won't see any edges
on this TV you'll also see a new stand
which also doubles as a cord controller
so instead of having your cords hanging
out from the dock you can actually fish
the cords
stand for a cleaner look the XBR x9 50
comes in two sizes 85 and 65 we don't
have pricing yet but I bet you it'll be
expensive and it comes out in spring at
2014 Percy calm I'm Sharon Vaknin at CES</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
