welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
let's get to the show and there's a
whole lot more to that mysterious Apple
minivan story from last week
BusinessWeek reports that an Apple
employee recently contacted them about
Apple's vehicle development at the
company and claims apples project is too
exciting to pass up and it will give
Tesla a run for its money
now those are big words especially with
what Tesla has been able to do so far
because that Tesla s is so smooth now a
few years back before apple's carplay
platform even existed I was all about
Apple doing a car down the road get it
down the road okay but it now sounds
like it could really be happening the
Business Week source also said Tesla
employees were jumping ship to work with
Apple but that conflicts with earlier
reports that Tesla has hired at least
150 former Apple employees and Tesla CEO
Elon Musk said Apple has hired very few
people despite offering $250,000 signing
bonuses and a 60 percent salary increase
now LinkedIn also shows that Apple has
about 50 employees who previously worked
at Tesla with most specializing in
mechanics manufacturing and robotics now
we still don't know exactly what Apple
is working on is it an actual car or is
it some new iPhone 2 car experience but
we'll keep track of this story see what
I did there again okay I'll stop now
Apple CEO Tim Cook recently spoke at the
annual goldman sachs technology
conference and surprise he spoke more
about the Apple watch that he cannot
live without Cook said there are several
things that are called smart watches but
I'm not sure you could name any well
actually there's the pebble steel the
Moto 360 the LG G watch R and more then
cook added there hasn't been one that
changed the way people live their lives
at Apple that's our objective we want to
change the way you live your life see
Apple is really trying to hype this
thing up I'm still not that high on it
and I'll save my judgment after I really
try it
but Cooke added that apps will make the
Apple watch as essential as the iPhone
which is true because you need an iPhone
to even use the app all right we missed
it because of the timing of our show but
Apple released the first version of
photos for OS 10 for developers I've had
a hands-on with it and it's a whole lot
cleaner interface compared to iPhoto if
you're someone who uses iCloud photo
sharing its integrated right into the
app and you'll love that there are more
photo editing tools that will cover the
basis for most users except for people
that use higher-end products like Adobe
Lightroom or Photoshop sharing your
photos has been cleaned up in you can
still order books and prints overall
it's really a big improvement over
iPhoto it also takes away a lot of
features from aperture and follows
really somewhere in between the two the
final version of photos for OS 10 will
be available sometime in spring of 2015
and when it launches aperture will be
removed from the App Store as well
all right Apple has already made claims
that Apple pay is responsible for two of
every three dollars spent on contactless
payments and called 2015 the year of
Apple pay well Apple pay is moving to
the skies as JetBlue will be the first
airline to accept Apple pay on select
flights next week passengers will be
able to use their iPhone 6 and 6-plus
to buy food drinks and even upgrade to
premium seats if they want to
now JetBlue flight attendants will be
equipped with this iPad Mini outfitted
with a special case that will accept
both credit cards and Apple pay as forms
of payment now we've all heard the
phrase just because you can doesn't mean
you should actually some people have
written the Apple byte with something
like that we have one more thing to
clean
well a lot of people were thinking just
that after HTC threw down the hammer on
Apple and Samsung with our own rap video
called hold the crown get it
H T C now this is with rapper Doc G and
an ACC employee named David Bruce now I
want to let you know that what you're
watching is real so let's roll some of
the video for you your smartphone scared
they don't wanna clash with a titin they
saw that m8 debut they became
enlightened where I'm from you don't
ever get respectful fightin if you see
wanna miss the best you know what this
isn't bad apple bad this is bad
all right guys you can email us at the
Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me at
Brian Kong and I'll respond during the
commercial breaks of empire because that
show is fire extreme thanks for watching
we'll catch y'all next time for another
bite of the Apple get now if you see
cannot be beat let me see it now you see
I say it loud
