had seen it here to give you a first
look at the ZTE render this is a new
phone for US cellular now I gotta tell
you I heard about this phone I opened up
this phone got out of the box and used
it and it was just a huge disappointment
now there's nothing wrong with actually
the physical device it sort of works
well it's easy to use but sad trombone
this is a windows phone 7 device and
it's coming out at late October 2012
just before Windows Phone 8 becomes
available so I just can't understand why
Microsoft and CTE and US cellular
putting this phone out when it's already
going to be obsolete in less than a week
or even less than a couple weeks now
remember the windows phone 7 devices
cannot upgrade to Windows 8 you have to
buy a whole new device this is
upgradable to windows seven point eight
but that's hardly Carly consolation for
a phone that's really going to be
obsolete so I got to tell you I like
Windows Phone I like it a lot I'm
excited about Windows Phone 8 but this
phone just isn't cutting it for Windows
Phone experience and another thing is it
is eighty dollars with a contract now if
you're gonna have a phone that's going
to be pretty much outdated moment you
buy it it should really be free with
contract or eighty dollars prepaid so
pricing is not right and not for what
you get inside but I will concentrate on
a couple good points for a moment it
does have a nice design it is
comfortable it is easy to use has a good
construction typical Windows Phone
design with the interface you have the
tiles you go to the main menu you can go
back you can you can customize the tiles
in the front you can remove them you can
add some you can move them around here
on the back have a little bit of a
pattern it's only visible when you see
in certain light you have the camera
lens you have a flash up on the top
there's 3.5 millimeter headset jack
there's a volume rocker on this side
just below or just above the camera
shutter over on this side there's the
microUSB port that is for the charger
and for a sinking cable now inside the
phone doesn't have a whole lot it does
have a five megapixel camera wasn't too
impressed the photo quality outside and
a lot of light we're good inside with a
flash and at night not so good at all
but so wish those were a little better
does have a
1 gigahertz processor which was
defective oh but you know when i used it
i found that things were a little slow
the phone I most of the time took a
couple seconds to wake up when it was
when I was ped put it to sleep a lot of
applications opened a little slower than
I'd like the phone is stuck on 3G so
that's getting kind of old is where
we're seeing LTE from most carriers now
a lot of things will take slower than
you used to if you're used to 4G or even
hspa+ so websites open slower seen its
full side and really graphics heavy
intensive sites opened in about a minute
so that is a long time that one nice
thing is the phone does not have a lot
of bloatware which is good with this
phone not a lot just your bear bait you
just your bare features is what you'd
expect of course if you want to buy
applications you can go to the Windows
Store of course like other Windows Phone
stirs up the People Hub so that
interacts with Facebook and if you like
other social media services to integrate
them into one area so when people call
you can see their facebook photo you can
see their status some time there is
navigator service of course we have the
xbox live integration the zune players
so all the other Microsoft servers you'd
expect or on this phone I believe in
starter smartphones think windows phone
does need to bleed down at all market
segments whether you're whether you're a
bargain shop or whether you're willing
to spend a lot of money but really this
phone is an egg it's going to be
obsolete very soon too expensive for
being an obsolete phone it is easy to
use but if you're looking to go to
Windows Phone just wait for those
windows phone 8 devices seriously I'm
