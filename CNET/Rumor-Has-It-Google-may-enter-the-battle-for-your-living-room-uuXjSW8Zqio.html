has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors and don't
forget that you can vote on what you
think about the rumors too in the
interactive player if you're watching on
cnet now if you're sick of hearing about
apple rumors you're in luck I've got a
couple for you today and neither has
anything to do with the company that you
love to hate or love to love so first up
here's a rumor that's still kind of in
the rumor phase Facebook is testing out
chat rooms according to TechCrunch who
cited a person familiar with the matter
Facebook confirmed that it actually is
testing this out but the company's
chatty lips were sealed about any other
details the new feature which is
codenamed host chat lets people set up
chat rooms that their friends can join
without an invitation kind of
reminiscent of the old AOL chat room it
would work by allowing you to set up a
chat room which would then be broadcast
on your newsfeed there may even be an
option to let friends in there invite
other friends and in one fell swoop
it'll be like the 90s all over again not
needing an invitation is the key
differentiator between this service and
say Google Hangouts but whether we want
to return to the days of age sex
location is a good question up next the
war rages on between Apple and Google
this week the wall street journal
reported that google is working on an
android based gaming console and a
SmartWatch soon after everyone in the
universe rushed to point out that this
was probably in response to iOS 7
introducing third-party gaming
controller standards and looming i watch
that everybody is obsessed with
speculating about the report also
mentioned that Google would be updating
the Nexus Q media streamer but since
that product totally bombed and was
super expensive it seems like there's no
place for the Nexus Q to go but up also
nobody cares about the Nexus Q as for
the gaming console no specs were given
in the report but you can imagine that
Google is eyeing the android-based oya
game console that's now currently
selling for ninety-nine dollars now look
I'm as addicted to candy crush as the
next person but come on is yet another
game console and an already
oversaturated market something that we
really need what do you guys think is
Google trying too hard to enter a
flooded market what would you want to
see in a gaming console don't forget to
vote and leave a comment and ask the
cnet council whether it thinks that
Google is working on a game console of
its own the scene that council is
composed of five editors who cast their
votes anonymously their opinions are not
an endorsement by cnet or CBS
Interactive obviously because these are
rumors folks and the cnet councils
verdict is no they don't think that
Google is building a game console one
editor though who thinks that they are
working on a console said that he thinks
that since it's one of the areas in
which Google doesn't have a presence he
can't imagine them letting it stay that
way for much longer that's our show
everybody please share your rumors at
rumor has it at cnet com or call us at 1
800 750 cnet and tweet us have a happy
fourth of july and tune in next week for
more tech rumors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
