I'm Bridget Carey and this is your CNET
update Facebook is testing out a way for
you to go shopping while scrolling
through your newsfeed some
advertisements will have a Buy button
and with a click you can purchase the
item in the ad the whole transaction
your credit card info shipping address
everything it's all handled inside
Facebook the network says it won't share
your credit card info with other
advertisers you may not see the Buy
button all the time it's just a test
right now offer to some small and
medium-sized businesses in the US this
is not the first time Facebook has
dabbled an online shopping remember when
you could buy actual physical gifts like
teddy bears and chocolates and mail it
to your friends that wasn't very
successful so Facebook gifts are now
just digital gift cards and there were
Facebook credits a currency just for
spending money on Facebook but that has
been discontinued Twitter also is
starting to get into the social shopping
game last year it launched a partnership
with American Express so card holders
could get discounts by tweeting special
hashtags Amazon started letting you shop
on Twitter if someone tweets out a link
to an Amazon product you can reply with
a hashtag Amazon cart to add that item
to your shopping cart Starbucks even let
you tweet a cup of coffee well a tweet
just actually sends someone a $5 gift
card and as silly as it may sound
Twitter is just getting warmed up the
network acquired cards spring that's the
company that links up credit cards with
applications for mobile shopping so as
social media companies try to become
Amazon Amazon is trying to take on
Easter Amazon has officially launched
the Kindle unlimited service where for
$10 a month you can get unlimited access
to 600,000 ebooks and thousands of
audible audiobooks and you can get them
from any mobile device it's kind of like
a Netflix for books and that's exactly
what the company oyster offers oyster is
also a $10 a month for unlimited book
service the company Scribd also offers
all you can read for $9 a month but what
matters most is quality of content
because not every
Celer will be found on these services
because not all publishers work with
them just like the early days of Netflix
it takes time to get quality titles and
I should note that this Kindle unlimited
service is different from what Prime
members have which is called Kindle
lending library that just gives Prime
members one free book at a time on their
Kindle but you know there is another
service out there
that can get you free e-book rentals
it's called the public library
that's your tech news update you can get
more details on these stories and
cnet.com and you can stay updated by
subscribing to the podcast or following

York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
