welcome to the Apple bite it's the start
of a brand new year and the crew and
staff here is gearing up for CES 2013 in
Las Vegas but I thought this would be
the perfect time to give you my
predictions of what you can expect to
see or not see from Apple in 2013 so
let's just knock out the no-brainers
that even my momma could tell me
in 2013 we will see the next Apple TV
yep
you've all been waiting for it I haven't
been too high on it before and we even
predicted in last year's show that it
would come out in 2013 but honestly I'm
getting a little intrigued now an Apple
really has to hit it out of the park and
start thinking different again it's
crucial because you can bet we'll see
everyone else's best bets at the
next-gen Smart TV at CES 2013 we'll also
finally see the next-gen Mac Pro's from
the beg a heard uh now Tim Cook went on
the record and said they'll be coming
sometime later this year Desktop pros
have been waiting over two years even I
couldn't wait that long and decided to
go with the new iMac so Apple do it
right and let's also make sure you get
apps like Final Cut curl up to snuff as
well and the third gimme the iPad Mini
will get a Retina display
no Sherlock and they should have had it
on the first one
alright guys let's get to things I think
we won't see in 2013 everyone is going
googoo gaga for retina displays on
everything even if there's a lot of non
apple devices with higher res screens
but I still think we won't see any for
the iMac line or large displays yet
because of the costs although I'll throw
out this one exception Apple might do
something bold and give their pro
customers a Retina display Thunderbolt
option for 2013 and start there and does
Apple even care about the 17 inch
MacBook Pro anymore well it will find
out there's been rumors about Apple
changing over to arm-based processors
for desktops but we still won't see that
transition happened this year and I
might be wrong with this one but what
the predictions show without risks Apple
hasn't shown that it really cares about
NFC chip technology it's clunky in
real-world use and still hasn't taken
off with a bunch of groups competing for
different standards I'm going to say we
won't see a dedicated NFC chip on
Apple's next-gen phones this year and
then let's get to the crazy out there
prediction that might make you never
watch this show again this one's for fun
so don't go telling your friends this is
real but I'm saying Apple will have two
different size phones in 2013 I still
think the current iPhone 5 screen is a
little too small and a lot of women want
it bigger because it still fits in their
purse so we're saying Apple will come
out with a larger screen phone and keep
the current size as another option
and honestly we already know what the
iPhone 20 is going to look like now
during our predictions and
prognostications we feel it's important
to bring a real expert in the field so
we'd like to bring back our future
telling friend well hello there Brian
hey no show Tongass it's good to see you
again man well I can't say the same
nostra Tongass well MacBook Airs gonna
retina display this year what yes yes of
course they will please challenge me
next time next question will I be able
to trust apples and apps again remember
the last genie I dated or she was so hot
but she broke my heart use Google Maps
next question why is it my iTunes booty
less working on the ladies Nora Tanya
says less boys to men and more Bieber
hey hey mr. Thomas should I click this
male enhancement link well yes click
away they don't call me Nostradamus for
nothing
Nostradamus well Brian finally pay
attention to me in 2013 is he crazy
he hasn't had the magic left robbed in a
very very long time
alright thanks no siree Tongass that's
gonna do for this we show keep sending
us your emails to the Apple bite at

you guys next time for another bite of
the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
