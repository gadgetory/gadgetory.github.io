eventually collect scratches and the
Apple watch is no exception
eventually with enough scratches your
watch could start to look a little dull
so if you want to restore that mirrored
brand-new finish you'll have to polish
it you'll need a microfiber cloth some
polishing solution and gloves start by
prepping the watch so go ahead and
remove the straps by pressing the button
adjacent to them like this then clean
the watch so it's ready for polishing
all you need is that microfiber cloth
and a little elbow grease if you go to
the hardware store you'll find polishing
solutions that come in all kinds of
forms for instance you have polishing
creams like this one from opti gloss or
this one from mas you also have pre
soaked cotton from never dull and pre
soaked cloths from Cape Cod because the
Apple watch has so many nooks and
crannies and buttons and sensitive areas
like the heart rate monitor the best
option here is the pre soaked cloth this
will give you more control and it'll get
the job done faster to protect my hands
I'll put on some gloves I don't want any
of those chemicals seeping into my skin
now I'll grab the polishing cloth which
is conveniently already soaked with
polishing cream and there are a lot of
scratches on this side so that's where
I'll be focusing right now and just go
back and forth as you're polishing
you'll notice that the cloth will start
to look black that's because the
polishing cream is actually removing
micro layers of the stainless steel to
remove the scratches now I have a couple
of seemingly deep scratches here so give
it another run through
now it's time to buff it out so what's
left on the stainless steel here is the
residue from the polishing cream grab
your microfiber cloth and go over that
same area until the residue is gone and
you've restored that mirror finish if
you did it all right you should be
looking at a shiny Apple watch with a
mirrored finish close to what it looked
like when you pulled it out of the box
