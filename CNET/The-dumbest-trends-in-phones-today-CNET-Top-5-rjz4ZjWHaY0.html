trends we're seeing these days mobile
phones and chains unlocked in their
lifespan they got smaller and smaller
and then smarter and smarter but some
dumbness has crept in let's get to it
and number five our manufacturer
specific assistance can we get a roll
call of all the different assistance
Siri Cortana Google assistant Alexa
Bixby HTC Sense companion dancer Prancer
and Rudolf I get that every phone maker
wants to make their device stand out
they want to say our assistant is so
smart buy from us because we have it but
the problem is not every phone maker is
great at making smart assistants Google
and Amazon seem to have the best ones
did you hear the rumor that LG may have
a dedicated button for its own assistant
in the g7 maybe the resources these
companies are wasting should be
dedicated to something else
number four thinness for thinness sake
the thickness of a phone used to be
dictated by practicality you know make
the case as thin as it can be while
holding all the components within the
body then camera bumps happen
Apple Samsung Google and others are
guilty of this there's nothing like
putting your phone down on a surface and
having the camera assembly touching that
surface and the phone doesn't lay flat
thankfully some companies have figured
out how to shrink their cameras to fit
within the body what an idea that brings
us to the number three dumb phone trend
glass backs hey I like the look of a
glass back they also allow for wireless
charging the problem is they're slippery
fragile and pricey to replace way too
many manufacturers have moved to the
glass pack Apple Samsung LG I know that
plastic can feel cheap but is generally
more durable as a backing maybe one day
when we get Gorilla Glass 72 with
self-healing abilities all glass
everything will be a good idea but we're
not there yet so stop it on to number
two notches these don't look good
anywhere essential Apple will always
disappearing not all slightly different
all fully dumped for some reason this
trend caught on and everyone has jumped
on board one day people will look back
on notched phones and realize they are
the mullet of the mobile world
before we get to number one it hasn't
been all bad let's highlight three of
the smartest trends number three
standardized wireless charging I've been
waiting for wireless charging to take
off from the first time I saw it at my
first CES over a decade ago at number
two USB see a nice standardized
reversible charging and data port array
for this on phones and the number one
huge screens of smaller bodies great and
the number-one dumbest phone trend is
killing the headphone jack that's a
feature nobody wanted
do we want thinner phones with screens
that take up the entire front of the
device with wireless charging with good
Virtual Assistants yes every other trend
on this list is trying to serve the
customer no matter how poorly executed
these phone features are trying to give
us things that we want taking out the
headphone jack in favor of dongles or
Bluetooth is the wrong way to go in my
rage against dumbness did I miss a trend
let me know somewhere in the comments
Twitter on the subway Amaya's act hard
I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
