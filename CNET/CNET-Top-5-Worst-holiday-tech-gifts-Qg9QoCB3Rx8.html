giant list of holiday tech gifts for
every personality in every budget but we
wouldn't be telling the whole story if
we didn't also point out a few tech
gifts you should absolutely avoid I'm
Donnell Bell and in today's top five
I'll be counting down the worst tech
gifts of 2013 starting things off at
number five a DVD player for the non
techie it's understandable why it would
be perplexed that the nerd in your life
owns a hundred DVDs and yet no DVD
player the truth is they own actually at
least two DVD players that they never
use one in their laptop and one of their
game console either way that DVD
collection is really just for show what
they haven't already ripped they can
probably stream or download a dozen
different ways maybe you need a DVD
player but believe me they don't go
blu-ray if you have to at number four
the Nintendo Wii U we waited a long time
for this dud Nintendo has already
slashed the price down to three hundred
dollars and I'm willing to bet it'll be
on fire sale by the time the holidays
roll around but trust me there are only
two game consoles anyone wants this year
and the Wii U isn't one of them sorry
guys coming in at number three fitness
trackers this is a controversial one
because I'm sure our buying guide
includes at least a few of these from
the fuel band to the Fitbit there are
tons of great new ways to measure and
motivate your body my point is you
should buy them only for yourself you
send a message when you buy one of these
for someone else and it can easily sound
like hey tubs how about you take a
minute to walk off that eggnog even if
they ask for one they're not thinking of
the guilt they're gonna feel when they
hide that thing in the sock drawer after
a few months just avoid that whole
situation number two should also be
avoided the Chromebook pixel I don't
care how much you love Google 13 hundred
dollars for a glorified web browser
makes no sense seriously what were they
thinking you can get a MacBook Air for
less than this and what's worse the
handful of people who really did pay for
these presuming they actually exist had
to just watch Samsung and HP released
Chrome
books for around 250 dollars the good
news is I don't think anyone's buying
those either and now my pick for the
number one worst holiday tech gift
blackberry anything blackberry the Z 30
the q5 the q10 they're all attached to a
company that is collapsing and being
sold for parts maybe buy them a
blackberry t-shirt if they're feeling
sentimental but buying blackberry
hardware at this point isn't really a
gift it's like a small corporate bailout
alright hopefully I've steered some of
you in the right direction when it comes
to holiday tech shopping or at least
pointed out the roadkill more top fives
like this including the best phones the
best TVs and the best tablets head over
