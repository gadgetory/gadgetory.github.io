convinced the Apple is deliberately
slowing down your phone to get you to
buy a new one well maybe it's a
conspiracy or maybe there's a simple fix
I'm Donald Bell and I'm gonna show you
some easy fixes to three common issues
in iOS 7 let's start with slow phone
syndrome your apps are opening slowly
the screen is lagging it's like your
phone is drunk in most cases the problem
here is that your phone is running out
of storage the best way to get a handle
on this to go into settings general then
usage and you'll get a rundown how much
storage is left on your phone and what's
taking up all that space and if you've
never looked at this page I guarantee
you you were in for a shock
the things clogging up your phone are
never what you expect for me it was
podcasts without meaning to I had a
year's worth of old hour-long podcast
taking up room on my iPhone now I have
it set to only keep the latest episode
photos are another usual culprit so just
sync them over to your computer and kick
them off your phone if you see any other
apps or games you no longer use just
head back to the home screen give them a
long press and tap the X to delete them
you can always download them again at no
cost now sometimes the phone is fine but
your wireless connection is freaking out
it won't connect to Wi-Fi or you have
one bar of service an area that's
usually fine here are two ways to shake
some sense into your wireless connection
first try turning on airplane mode for
30 seconds and give your antennas a rest
you can quickly just do this by swiping
up from the bottom and tapping the
airplane button and then tapping it
again to get back on line now if your
phone is still not connecting to a
wireless network go to Settings General
reset and then reset network settings of
course once that's done you'll need to
enter your Wi-Fi login and password
again to reconnect finally what do you
do if the whole phone just freezes full
lockup the touch screen won't work the
buttons do nothing here's where you can
invoke the iPhone Vulcan nerve pinch
hold down the sleep button and the home
button at the same time until the phone
resets and you see the Apple logo you'll
see your lockscreen after a minute and
you should be back in business so there
you go three fixes to some very common
iPhone
