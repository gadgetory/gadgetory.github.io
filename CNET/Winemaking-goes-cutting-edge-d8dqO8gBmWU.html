fermentation dome it looks more like a
supervillains lair it's 18 stories
underground built into the side of a
mountain and controlled by a
supercomputer named Felix but instead of
world domination the purpose of this
place is to make wine
you've essentially taken the process of
winemaking and instead of having it be
all on one floor like most wineries
we've brought it in vertically inside a
dome so each level is a different moment
in the winemaking very top is grape
sorting that drops down a hatch into
fermentation that's what all of this
projection is showing us at the Felix
system that my brother created and then
from there we go down to press down to
tanks into barrels and eventually we'll
go down even further down below us to
filtration
Florencia and her brother Christian Paul
Maas oversee their families super smart
vineyard and winery in California's Napa
Valley it's so massive it took seven
years to excavate and build since the
complex was completed in 2007 the team
has been building technology into the
age-old process of winemaking they built
a computer named Hal and replaced it two
years ago with Felix outside a system
called vigor attracts the vineyards
helped by analyzing aerial imagery we
take this little Cessna aircraft with a
very specialized multispectral camera on
its belly and we fly every Monday and
Thursday so we take pictures of the
vineyard and in we use certain forms of
infrared light which helps us understand
how vigorous the plants are
when harvest season really kicks off in
late September this is where the action
is sensors in the tanks measure
temperature sugar and alcohol levels
winemakers use that data to decide how
they want to tweak the wine as it passes
through the critical fermentation
process from the tanks the wine is
barreled and aged and eventually blended
and bottled periodically florenzi and
Christian sit down with their winemakers
to check on how each wine is progressing
oh my god seems gonna be so much fun to
blend away with a few taps they pull up
data on the wine in their glasses this
is the lower 6 16 16 see they can tell
me everything from which parcel of land
the grapes are grown on to how much
water and Sun they got and of course a
near minute-to-minute accounting of the
Felix assisted fermentation process we
are trying to focus in on the details of
the craft because the basics have been
tried and tested for in a hundreds of
years so we are working every year on a
refinement and at this point with
sophistication of technology and other
industries know that refinement is
getting into some smart technology we're
mixing smart tech and winemaking result
in the perfect blend we'll find out next
year when the first vintage produced
with the help of Felix is released
