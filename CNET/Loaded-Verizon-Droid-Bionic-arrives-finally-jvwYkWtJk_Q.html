Wilson Tang on cnet com and it's time to
get loaded droid fans have finally
something to celebrate verizon has
finally released the motorola droid
bionic the phone was announced nine
months ago at CES and at the time the
phone was held as a breakthrough super
phone though many new Android
smartphones have beat it to the punch
the new droid bionic includes an updated
sleek new design since January it
features a huge 4.3 qhd display
dual-core processors and Verizon's 4G
LTE support the biotic will cost 299
dollars with a two-year contract and you
can find out more by heading on over to
CNN com for the full review streaming
media boxes like the Apple TV or Roku
box are popular these days among tech
enthusiasts Sony is updating its net
boxes with the new SP and 200 yes we
know catchy name as you would expect it
has support from netflix hulu plus an
amazon instant video as well as DN LA
but differentiates itself with 3d
compatibility details are scarce though
about what you can watch on the new
device which is expected out in October
no price has been announced a new report
claims that Apple is working on a new
update to its popular logic pro audio
editing software suite but this time
around the new logic will not make the
same mistakes as the overwhelmingly
negative launch of Final Cut Pro 10
Apple said to be making similar changes
to the suite by getting rid of some apps
while integrating others Logic Pro 10 is
expected to be available through the mac
app store but there's no official word
on price or availability the patent wars
between essentially every single major
player in the smartphone industry is
heating up even more HTC has filed
another lawsuit against apple this time
with nine patents that it just acquired
from google last week the patent
transfers marked the biggest show of
support yet from google to its android
partners who have been hammered by apple
lawsuits Google itself may enter the
legal wars with its pending purchase of
Motorola Mobility adobe has entered the
photo sharing app craze with its new
carousel program carousel does
everything you would expect including
uploading storing and siccing
photos all from your iOS devices Plus
that also lets you create galleries and
that affects non-destructively to
pictures so if you decide that that
faded sepia effect is so last week you
can update it easily to a lomo graphic
look but unlike other popular
photo-sharing services like Instagram
Adobe carousel doesn't come cheap the
first 30 days are free but after that
you'll be charged sixty dollars a year
or six dollars a month those are your
headlines for today I'm Wilson tank for
