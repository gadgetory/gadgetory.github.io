tour from the show floor at e3 the
nintendo DS goes 3d how to use ebay like
a pro and SoundHound sniffs out the name
of that song that's stuck in your head
it's all coming up right now
hey everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the cnet tech review the show where
we rundown the hottest videos of the
week and tell you which are good which
are bad and offer some tech wisdom in
the form of the bottom lines let's start
with the good another Electronic
Entertainment Expo has come and gone at
this year's e3 show Microsoft tried to
connect with Xbox fans Nintendo put 3d
gaming in players hands and sony ps3
gamers were on the move of course cnet
was there to cover at all here's Bryant
on with his report from the show floor
from way downtown Los Angeles for cnet
TV I'm gym kit rose saying NBA Jam is
back boom shakalaka
brian song here with CNN com on the show
floor to e3 2010 we saw a lot of themes
here this year we saw 3d gaming most
controlling is here and here to stay and
retro gaming is making a comeback
we're here inside Nintendo's booth and
you can see behind me everyone is
getting their hands on the Nintendo 3ds
now we really can't show you the screen
because it doesn't do justice and you
won't be able to see how good it looks
but there's a reason there are huge
lines here to get their hands on this
little new toy I know you guys can't see
what I'm playing but i'm playing with
the 3d version of intent dogs and this
dog is very cute now 3d is not only
going to be on a little handheld the
sony ps3 has pushed it hard with
Killzone 3
we're here inside of Sony's PlayStation
booth and another theme that we've seen
here that is HUGE is motion based gaming
so here in my hand I got the PlayStation
Move if you guys want your ultimate pics
of 3d gaming and motion gaming well this
is the place to be put on my shades cuz
this game time if you like motion
control gaming but you don't want to
controller check out Microsoft's Kinect
where your body is the controller now
we've all heard the same what's old is
now new and that same thing holds true
with gaming with classics coming back
like Mortal Kombat and NBA jam we had a
game so many years ago in NBA jam that
was truly like the most raucous
horsepower high-energy octane game ever
made and if you look back at it it's one
step removed really from the early pong
and art re kind of things I think there
was something magic about the 90s and
people playing video games you know a
lot of people were probably in you know
high school grade school or something
like that and so seeing old games with
the new presentation with a hardware and
the technology that we have today
there's something nostalgic about that
so is a combination of nostalgia and you
know the new so I think it's a great
combination so at e3 2010 we saw a lot
of great new announcements for hardware
we saw a lot of great games I'm just
gonna enjoy the show floor let's hope I
can make it out of here alive
don't worry I'm told BT made it out just
fine of course I haven't seen him in a
couple of days but anyway for even more
of our extensive III coverage including
more highlights from the big 3 game
makers press conferences head over to
cnet TV com or just stick around until a
little later in the show of course with
all those new games coming out you might
want to consider getting rid of some of
your old ones want to sell them on ebay
tell them how Josh hey I'm Josh
Lowensohn for cnet and today I'm going
to show you how to sell things on eBay
eBay is a great place to pawn off
potentially high value items like cell
phones or game consoles especially if
you don't feel like doing the whole face
to face thing on craigslist as an
example I'm going to use a mobile phone
to get started you need an account on
eBay which is free after signing up
click on the cell link at the top of the
screen then the big blue start selling
button ebay will then ask you some key
words about your phone or device all you
have to do here is type in phone or
whatever you're selling then hit the big
search button on this next screen I'm
going to pick cell phones and
smartphones and hit the big blue
continue button again then I'm going to
type in the brand or model of my phone
to see if it's an ebays database once
you've found the model of your phone or
gadget just select it and you'll be
taken to the most important page of all
the one where you tell buyers about your
item and how much you're selling it for
to get a good idea of what kind of price
is set do a search to see what other
similar items have sold for it's also
worth setting a reserve price at or a
little bit below the number so you can
make sure it won't sell for less than
you're willing to part with choosing
this option will cost you anywhere from
two dollars to one percent of your
reserve price if it's over two hundred
dollars a few things that help in the
way of attracting prospective buyers is
to take some photos of your item in all
likelihood ebay already has a stock
photo from the manufacturer but a
picture of your device or whatever
accessories you're selling with can go a
long way towards making your buyers more
confident just keep in mind ebay charges
15 cents for each additional photo
beyond the first one so use them
sparingly you'll also want to be dead
honest about your items
description if there are any problems
with the device things like scratches
cracks water damage or a dying battery
should be stated upfront otherwise you
could end up with negative feedback and
an angry buyer another thing to keep in
mind is that you'll need a paypal
account if you intend to do an
electronic payment this is the best
route if you want to get paid
immediately signing up for paypal is
free but they do take a cut of a payment
if you're on a premier or business
account which is required to take credit
card transactions though if your buyer
is also a paypal user it will be free on
both ends as for when to set your
auction end time the longer you have it
on the site the better the chances are
someone will see it and add it to their
watch list you'd also be wise to time it
to end in the late afternoon or early
evening on a weekday since that's when
the most bidding activity happens once
it's up you just have to sit there and
wait it out don't be scared of nobody
bids on it in the first few days as most
of the action happens in the last few
hours and when it's all said and done be
sure to ship it out in a timely manner
you can use these instructions to sell
just about anything on the site though
the one downside is that eBay can charge
some pretty steep fees on top of what
you paid to list your item if your item
doesn't sell in an auction you don't pay
a thing but if it does ebay takes nine
percent of the final value up to fifty
dollars i'm josh lowensohn this has been
a how-to on how to sell your stuff on
ebay good luck selling those old gadgets
and now that you know some of the tricks
the power sellers use I bet you can
figure out how to use them to be a
better buyer to moving on in the good
one of my first favorite iphone apps was
Shazam you just hold your phone up hit
tag now and boom you've got the name of
the song and the artist who sings it
most of the time anyway well with this
new app called soundhound you don't even
need to be listening to a song to ideate
seriously take a look ever hear a song
playing that you've just gotta have or
got a tune stuck in your head that you
can't place sound town is an app for
iphone and android that can ID those
songs I'm Jessica dual-core from cnet
download.com taking a look at SoundHound
like other apps SoundHound can identify
a recorded song as it plays after just a
few seconds but unlike its biggest rival
SoundHound can also tag music that you
sing hum type or speak into the phone
after searching you'll see a plethora of
information about the artist or song
including the artist bio related songs
and videos and an opportunity to buy the
song or share a link to the song via
email or Twitter one of the apps best
features is providing a list of lyrics
if they're available if they're not
soundhound will link you to a Google
search for the song's lyrics the iphone
version of SoundHound is much more
advanced than the android version when
you buy a song it will pop you right
into the itunes library for easy
ordering soundhound on android whisks
you to the amazon.com music store online
that could change when Google releases
its own music store as early as this
fall soundhound on iphone also has the
added bonus of hooking into your running
ipod and providing an artist bio song
information and all the other goodies
including song lyrics for songs that you
already own we hope that sound hound
will soon add the android media player
in tunes android app there are two
versions of sound hound for both Android
and iPhone the free version cuts off
tagging after five songs per month when
you record sing or hum into the app but
there's no cap to searching with your
voice or by text these apps are also ad
supported the premium versions called
SoundHound infinity costs a one-time fee
of 499 and give you unlimited
song IDs and no ads I'm Jessica's all
court and you've been looking at sound
home for Android and iPhone yeah I'm
gonna have to bribe our producer Jamie
to get a clip of Jessica sing in that
video see on youtube Jessica alright we
have one more good thing for you today a
desktop computer awesome right actually
this little Dell is a pretty good
bargain but you better act fast hi I'm
rich brown senior editor for cnet com
today we're going to take a look at the
dell studio XPS 7100 so this is a
mid-range performance PC and this
particular config has a fixed price it's
1149 at least until the end of july and
for that price you get an excellent deal
in a mid-tower gaming system it comes
with a blu-ray drive wireless networking
a six core AMD chip as well as a very
fast radeon HD 5870 graphics card it's
not quite as fast as some other pcs in
its price ranges in terms of application
performance but for gaming it's one of
the best deals we've seen all year until
makes a distinction with this system
from its other intel-based studio XPS
models with the dark grey front panel
now the front you get a media card
reader up top there's a blu-ray drive
here this door slides down and you get a
couple of USB jacks and a top here you
get a little device tray with a couple
USB ports and analog audio inputs as
well you can see the graphics card has
got two DVI video outputs as well as
hdmi and displayport because it's a
radeon card you can do up to three
displays at one time off of the single
card there's also a couple of wireless
antenna Jack's here for wireless
networking and on the motherboard you've
got a digital audio output a SATA port a
couple USBS ethernet as well as 7.1
analog audio jacks now missing our
firewire as well as USB 3.0 which is
sort of a newer faster data input that
we expect will become common probably by
the end of the year maybe into next year
so it's not crucial that it's on this
system there aren't that many devices
out there that support USB 3 and
firewire is actually getting a little
bit long in the tooth still we've seen
other desktops that offer the whole
gamut of inputs so there might be a few
other inputs
you could add for the most part Dells
covered in spaces so it's a little
crowded inside the XPS 7100 there's a
dual-slot graphics card right here
that's the radeon 5870 and you can see
dell is a nice thick bracket to keep the
card in place and shipping that's a nice
touch but it also sort of blocks this
extra hard drive bay so Dell is expanded
typical design and added a second drive
slot here behind the drug the hard drive
you see right here that's great we're
glad that you can add a second drive we
would still probably prefer if dealt
face the drives outwards or like we've
seen in some newer pcs through the front
so item drives in through the front of
the case makes hot swapping upgrading
changing drives really simple and we're
hoping that becomes a standard as well
there's a six core cpu here from AMD and
for expansion slots there's the graphics
card wireless card and then there's one
standard pci slot down here on the
bottom that's it there's no second
graphics card slot a really room for
upgrading is pretty limited you can see
the memory slots are all taken as well
so if you want an upgrade foundation
this might not be the config for you
that said it's still a pretty great deal
concerning get blu ray wireless as well
as a super-fast with 3d card for under
1,200 bucks so Delson is the price fez
configuration will stay until the end of
july at that price and with this
specific feature set this is an
outstanding system the price changes you
might want to do some more comparison to
see how it stacks up to other pcs in the
market but for now for any gamer looking
for a mid-range performance PC we
absolutely recommend the system sign
rich brown this is the dell studio XPS
7100
that's so nice of Tracy's dad from flash
forward to stop by and review that for
us right Hey look so much alike Oh fine
I know nobody watched that show now it's
cancelled but I liked it and they do
look alike all right let's take a break
while I try to find a new favorite TV
show but don't go anywhere the bad stuff
is just around the corner when we come
back
welcome back to the cnet tech review
your weekly digest of all things good
and bad from cnet TV now let's go back
to e3 for some of the bad during
Microsoft's Xbox 360 press conference on
Monday they spend a lot of time showing
off all the cool things that you can do
with Kinect unfortunately they were
using Microsoft engineers for many of
the demos let's take a look as Laura
runs us through something called video
kinect now with the net the same magic
that allows you to control your xbox 360
with your voice also allows you to
communicate with people you care about
this is video kinect and here to help me
show it to you is laura one of the
engineers we're building social
experiences on xbox live hey Laura hey
Mark what I love about kinect is that
it's not just about video games the
sensor also lets me video chat with my
friends and family and the microphone
lets me do that without a headset so let
me show you an example of what video
kinect will look like here are my
friends some of them are an xbox live
and some are on windows live messenger
and here on this page are a bunch of my
relatives my parents my brother and his
wife and my twin sister Kristen Kristen
lives in texas and i live in seattle the
video chat is a great way to keep in
touch we sent kristin is sensor so that
you can help me demo this today so let's
call her up
hey Kristin how's it going hey pretty
good and busy with work I can see you're
busy too yeah i'm here at e3 everyone
say hi to Kristen hey everybody so we
finally get to show everyone what you've
been working on yeah I'm pretty excited
about that so here's a few things that
you haven't seen yet one thing we can do
is watch stuff together you see those
topics at the bottom of your screen yeah
I can select one of them and we can
watch a video together
chosen few hey that's the last airbender
wasn't there a video game about that
yeah there was my coworkers played it
just to boost their gamerscore maybe you
should do the same thing what's my
gamerscore is one hundred percent legit
Yeah right okay well this video is great
what we're going to move on now another
cool thing that connect can do is track
you as you move around you should give
that a try okay Wow hey that's pretty
cool it's following me so how does not
work so here's a slightly geeky answer
connect tracks your skeleton as you knew
so they can follow you and keep you in
the shot it happens automatically so
don't have to adjust the camera myself
nope we're trying to keep it simple
there's one more thing I want to show
you ready yeah so to do that I got it in
the video chat so you should say goodbye
to everyone alright bye everybody thanks
for helping us out today y'all ready
Xbox in chat hey Clark oh my goodness
that was so painful and also how do we
know that that's her twin sister and not
just the same girl in a wig although I
do have to give the folks playing kinect
sports a few extra points for enthusiasm
oh those crazy kids those crazy awkward
kids all right next up is a brand new 3d
TV from Panasonic wait now wasn't this
actually our best of CES award winner
from this year hmm well let's watch
there must be a reason it's in the bag
this week hi I'm David Katz mark from
cnet and I'm sitting next to the
panasonic tc-p 50v t25 this is a 50 inch
flat panel plasma TV the smallest in
Panasonic's flagship VT 25 sirree
there's also a 54 58 and 65-inch member
of the series as well as a 50 inch model
to best buy exclusive that has a silver
bezel called the VT 20 otherwise it's
basically identical in fact all these
are basically identical which is why
this review will apply to all sizes this
is a Panasonic's 3d TV for 2010 it's a
plasma model and has some advantages
over some LCD based 3d TVs we've tested
we'll get to that in a little bit but
first 3d TV in general you do require
specialized 3d content blu-ray discs for
the highest quality there's also some
channels on directv and a lot more
coming soon but for now content is
pretty limited you also need to use 3d
glasses to view the 3d content on its TV
the Panasonic comes with one pair of
those glasses the additional pairs cost
$150 right now although we do expect
them to drop in price but of course it
does cost a lot of money to outfit your
entire family for 3d viewing again we'll
talk about a little bit about the 3d
performance in a bit but first this is a
fully functional 2d TV and of styling on
it is a pretty slick this VT 25 series
has the bronze bezel it's slightly
different from the standard glossy black
you'll find it's also got a little bit
of silver above and below and course
some silver accents on the swivel stand
here and all in all we really like the
appearance of this TV aside from 3d the
main features on this flagship TV
include panasonic viera cast which is a
IPTV solution that includes a netflix
amazon video
on demand twitter fox sports are coming
soon Netflix won't be available until
july this year and a lot of the other
content is sparser than some of the
other internet connected TVs around we
do like the fact that you can adjust
some of the arrangements within the
VIERA CAST menu which is a new feature
for 2010 there's also the ability to
hook up a keyboard so if you like to
Twitter from your TV you'll like that
feature flagship model Panasonic did
equip the VT 2025 with a good selection
of picture adjustments in the custom
setting when you go into custom you can
play with the pro settings which
involves a lot of color temperature
adjustments a full color management
system gamma and a few others the THX
mode on this TV which we did find was
the best overall isn't all that
adjustable however of course it does
start out pretty good so it's not really
a big issue there's also a few 3d
settings on this TV but it's not as
extensive and adjustment selections you
can find on samsung's 3d TVs which also
include a up conversion system to
convert 2d to 3d again Panasonic doesn't
include that system in this model
connectivity on the VT 25 is fairly
extensive around back to find a 3 HDMI
inputs to component video inputs a pc
input there's also this rs-232 port here
only on the VT 25 not on the VT 20
series that's used for connection to
custom installation systems side panel
has a fourth HDMI input an issue an SD
card slot and a couple of USB jacks one
of those is nice if you buy the optional
Wi-Fi dongle which is useful for you
don't want to connect ethernet cable to
the back of the TV the Wi-Fi dongle does
cost a hundred bucks though when we took
the Panasonic into the lab we were very
impressed by its 3d and its 2d picture
quality will start with 3d though
compared to the Samsung which is the
only owner when we've tested the
panasonic with superior in terms of
reducing crosstalk which are these sort
of ghostly doubled images that you can
see sometimes in certain material a lot
more crosstalk on the samsung than we
saw in the panasonic both exhibited
excellent detail and give you a really
good stereoscopic 3d effect of course
smaller screen size and a couple of
other issues are different from the
theater but in general it's very
satisfying illusion but the real story
here is the 2d picture quality at least
until 3d becomes a lot more common 2d on
the Stevie's among the best we've ever
tested it starts with the excellent
black level performance when you turn
down the lights and watch a relatively
dark seen those blacks are really inky
and really help improve the pop and
overall saturation the entire picture
speaking of saturation the color on this
he is very good not quite as good as
some of the very best models we tested
but in THX mode color accuracy gets
really good skin tones and again plenty
of saturation and pop we did find some
issues with the 1080p 24 it does have
excellent cadence which does take
advantage of the film based blu rays and
dvds but on the other hand we did see
some slight false contouring artifacts
but again we did prefer to use the 1080p
24 mode on this TV which is labeled 96
hurts we also appreciated the standard
picture quality advantages of plasma
which include very good off angle and
picture uniformity panasonic also
improved the anti-glare screen on this
model so it does preserve black levels
as well as reduce reflections better
than previous panasonic plasmas that's a
quick look at the panasonic tc-p VT 20 /
25 series and I'm David Katz Meyer oh
yeah now I remember one pair of 3d
glasses am I really going to spend 3
grand on a TV so I can sit and watch it
all by myself I don't think so which
brings us to this week's bottom line
as we saw in Brian's video earlier 3d
gaming is coming whether you like it or
not now Nintendo skipped adding 3d to
the wii this year instead giving us the
new 3d s Brian got his hands on one long
enough to give us this first look this
is Nintendo 3d yeah right Tonya Messina
calm and this in my hand is a first look
at the Nintendo 3ds now you guys can't
see this but this it's awesome a look at
this doesn't require any 3d glasses
whatsoever you're looking at a 3.5 inch
widescreen 3d panel on the top again no
glasses required you also get a few
different controls you have this analog
stick over here on the left side you'll
get the standard d-pad and the controls
you see the standard camera here at the
top on top of the screen but if we flip
it around to the back you'll actually
notice two additional cameras that will
allow you to take 3d pictures of
yourself and then watch them here on the
3ds also you have here on this far
left-hand side you have a slider that
actually lets you turn either the three
function on or off and even change the
depth of the 3d now this is just a
little gameplay sample we can't actually
play any games on this unit they're just
showing a video sample but a head on
this looks pretty amazing in something
that we just haven't seen before there's
no pricing on the 3ds we don't know when
it'll be released yet but there you have
it this this is awesome stuff is going
to change things a little bit I'm Brian
Thomas netcom with your first look at
the Nintendo 3ds
the bottom line this week that's how you
do 3d no glasses year me Panasonic and
that is our show for this week everyone
tune in next week when we will continue
iphone 4 madness as the new phone goes
on sale I hope our pre order went
through until then don't be afraid to
check out more great seen that video at
seen at tv.com see you next time and
