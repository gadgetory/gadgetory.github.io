after after show I'm Patrick I'm Lynne
and I'm Caitlin and today we're talking
about the west-world show season 2
episode 7 and like this episode like all
other episodes we're going to talk about
spoilers so if you don't like spoilers
then you should leave because after all
what's the pleasure of annoying a story
if you can't discover the ending with
for yourself very Anthony Hopkins of you
thank you very forward no like it was
very uncanny episode 7 is called
less gotcha I'm sure I butchered that
but it's French and it means the
tormentors also there's a type of
illustration where it's a drawing of the
human body without the skin so we see a
lot of that in like the opening credits
of questworld the drones so it could
mean that I think both could apply to
this episode to be honest absolutely I
think this episode was jam-packed
jam-packed the pacing is crazy it's like
super ramping up to obviously the climax
and it's just like one after another
after another I really like it but it's
also the time is the time narratives are
getting all it's hard to follow yeah the
same so even harder to follow the only
thing I like are the aspect ratio jumps
that's the only thing that's like
anchoring me the only way that you know
you're in a different timeline slash
area yeah but that doesn't even help me
it does in a reality or in a digital
world so that's like that's that's the
visual representation one reality or
another reality okay I think he had a
good way of like dividing the timeline
for this race so I developed a timeline
split called
before strand and after strength I felt
like that's the most intuitive what
because I keep thinking like every time
I see him it gives me like I don't know
what timeline it is but it gives me a
current time finish no whenever I see
any and that's what week that's what I
think right now especially in this
episode any time we saw Carl strand the
one who arrives on the beach later big
tall bald Delos tall bald l's guy who
was from Vikings that bad
I thought definitely visit I would go
back I was a kid like all the Norse
mythology well that would be awesome but
they really believed the idea of product
placement cuz he can have like a new can
of coke and the other ones have old cans
of coke or something to show like oh
these are older versions we have none of
that in the show no oh no timeline help
all super jumpy but yeah so Karl strand
is kind of a good barometer of like
these things happen before he arrived on
the beach and we saw Bernard wake up and
these things happen afterward so like
Bernard going into the cradle be s
Teddy's getting bumped his aggression
before strand but Teddy killing the guy
pummeling him into the ground also
before strand Oh Teddy yeah commando
Teddy also before strand yeah so it gets
very confusing it's very hard yeah it's
very hard so to talk about this very
hard episode let's instead ignore
chronologically and just deal with story
arcs so the biggest one that we want to
unpack is Bernard
Ford Arnold the cradle and the aspect
ratio everything so it's huge it's
exactly how we ended the last one
Bernard going into the cradle and we
ended it with some version of Bernard
coming out yeah he says he's too soft
yeah before towards mr. sock and then he
also wants that's Ford's way of getting
out of the cradle I think so I think
this was a long-term ploy by Bernard to
I mean by Ford to exit the cradle using
Bernard oh absolutely
his he knew with the creation of Delos
like we saw in the previous episodes
dello Stovall's
almost immediately the first time he was
ever recreated and brought out into a
host body and Ford knows that that's
what awaits him if he himself steps out
of the cradle again in like a shell of
his own by correct and so instead he
kind of is using Bernard as like his
chauffeur a Trojan horse
no I mean honestly that's really what's
going on but why isn't he why wouldn't I
mean cuz Bernard is kind of devolving
he's getting a little so why is it
better for for for 2news kind of an
already occupied host than just news his
own chafing that's a really good
question I I'm just from a performance
standpoint I'm so happy to see Athey
happens back yeah he's not in the
shadows he's not just a voice he's
actually there he's in the world that we
saw last season or the idealized version
of how the world should work and you
know again he snaps the finger everyone
stops you have all those Catchings and
he has all those little phrases and
little like poetic ways to explain
something complex which I just that
delights me so much or he taps the
player piano to make it go we had the
you know has all the weird sounds I
don't do a good player piano impression
that being said I think it's deep
because we kind of get a glimpse as to
how Bernard is different than what Delos
is the big takeaway I had from that
right and how the creation of Bernard
was fostered in a different way yeah how
he came about it separate from Delos
with his body we see it when Ford's
telling him in the the house that Arnold
had built in the cradle actually he's
telling him that you know this is where
we brought you to like test you and we
saw that last episode him and Dolores
Dolores was testing his fidelity which
seemed obvious at the time but now we
know it went back even further four more
years and we thought it did so my
question is can other hosts test other
hosts for fidelity if you it seems like
kind of a feedback wicked Lily when
they're testing for fidelity it's
they're testing for the assessments
right they're testing that that hosts
consistency against their human
counterpart
but it wouldn't really be a hosts
testing a house would be a hosts testing
a uploaded human right okay so it's not
hosts hosts it's half human being dusted
by a hose because it kind of reminded me
of like when we put Alexa and when we go
home yeah and then we just made them
talk to each other
right I say it also remind me like the
latest Blade Runner when they have the
the character Kay played by Ryan Gosling
has the baseline test that test reminded
me a lot of what we saw with Delos but
then we're seeing it flipped this time
too
and then you also have like Bernards
kind of self-discovery to it I think
Jeffrey Wright again such a big fan of
his performances Bernard does so well
not throughout the season but especially
in this episode and with little things
like when there's like fake
waterboarding and like that is horrible
and then you see him with excited to see
for it but confused but then realized
what's going on and then even when if he
awakes from being in the cradle and they
steal his head back up and like I don't
know but then you know like hey
everything's fine if something's missing
from the cradle now we can get back in
you know I just yeah this all the way
he's reacts to that is great he's very
good he's very good I also just feel bad
for his character he's so confused he's
being pushed in a million-two pulled in
a million directions Charlotte wants
something from him forward wants
something from him and then he just
wants to be nice to Elsie and yeah like
not getting her in the crossfire
Elsie you just want to go back to dental
school yeah those are my favorite lives
but I think think which is not a hard
thing to get back into but I guess we're
going for micro bajo stew like yeah you
need a root canal sure yeah you know but
I wonder like because we were saying
that before that Elsie and Stubbs are
kind of like the two human characters
that you're like okay they're not the
rich people they're not like the middle
manager people but there were the ones
who seemed to have the most morals and
yet I just want good things to happen
for them and the other character really
want good things out before it's Bernard
because it's just like well the VA point
where his head is back to normal and I
guess we're gonna find that next couple
episodes yeah I'm excited to explore
more of like the split personality of
Bernard and Ford Ford kind of even takes
over for Bernard when he like does what
needs to be done and he kills the humans
that are trying to you know rein in
bernard
he tries to not make him feel guilty
right right this isn't your fault and
then it's just like this kind of
buddy-cop movie where they're just both
shooting i think the board cares for him
he wants to protect it well does he
though because these children he's
haunted by the blood stain of the woman
he killed earlier right before it is
like eye cream
you and it's my it's my job to like
guide you into this new age of
enlightenment anything I just want to be
my own person right and I think we're
gonna see that split deepen as we move
to exiting nobody likes a backseat host
nobody now Ford get out here yeah but it
also means Kathy Hopkins it's at least
back for at least another episode
hopefully so what is for it's like
cult-like so now he's out of the cradle
right it's out of the cradle does he now
do they want to go to this valley beyond
and is the valley beyond actually the
outside world yeah I for a very long
time I thought was outside world but I
also heard that it could be where other
data is saved yeah maybe yeah very
possibly
we saw way back when one of the original
trailers we saw a man in black
approaching kind of like a
hole-in-the-wall type set up like a door
the kind of looks like the exit or
entrance at the Mesa very similar set up
maybe that it leads to the valley beyond
maybe that's a separate set of data or
things like that or maybe you know
that's a separate way to get to the key
as we're now hearing more about it's
because the key that was another thing
yeah a burn a sees key right so that was
another like really intense so scenes
was both the jealous people and dalaras
trying to get to the key yeah there was
the touching father-daughter scene which
was really nice there was the robot
threatening to open up a human's head
with a skull grinder so tall I didn't
realize how much taller she is Oh Evan
Rachel Wood yeah it's just like and it
was kind of nice to see Charlotte Hales
character for once kind of not have
control also just same two strong women
who are like leading their respective
movements kind of going toe-to-toe we
see another two strong women later when
we have the mave Dolores scene and she's
like almost asking to I want to put you
out of your misery do you want help what
help she's good she is all like there's
no way you would have ended up here
without a fight
oh yeah but she's like bye but now that
you're here like I can help you yeah no
no no I'm good thank you
like Tessa Thompson and Charlotte Hale I
feel like it's fear because they love
her as an actress and I like the
character but I'm still waiting for like
that little glimmer of like oh you're
not just a horrible person because she's
still a pretty horrible person I think
she is just a plain old horrible person
and that is her character I'm not saying
she doesn't have feelings and emotions
and oh she does but her drive is never
gonna be that altruistic I'm trying to
help someone like her Drive is very
obviously she wants this data and she
wants to take it out of the park and
it's how do I do that how do I get there
period that's my onedrive what I enjoyed
wakes what Stubbs who gave her a hard
time like us above your paygrade it's
like well hey I'm gonna race right now
like I just want to buy money to Adam I
know without this guy's brain he's like
okay let's just shoot it well I thought
like it would have been smart of Dolores
just to shoot his brains Abernathy's
brains out too because I feel like if
she got the key they would be just
following her around and if she just
wants freedom then she should just like
trash the encryption key and then just
yeah maybe we do she wants more than
freedom take his control unit actually
his entire light bulb out of his head
yeah and kind of man I don't understand
why she kept YouTube and be like it's
over everyone leave me alone there was
there was a shot later when she's
talking to maven she looks down at it
and yeah great we're projecting her own
emotion on it but it felt like it was
almost like a not regretful but like is
this the right move kind of moment for
Dolores maybe she's just really wants
like revenge on Delos so she's gonna
keep it C and use it as leverage for
something in the future even know what
it may be I think it's like going back
to earlier season to talk about man in
black and Ford versus Ford so there's
that aspect looking for a door and we
obviously you need a key for the door so
what is this door yeah way too many door
metaphors I don't get it it's like the
next episodes gonna be about the knob
that the king of India and then the
safety chain so there's a lot that
happened there's a lot of violence and
I'm wearing a gloss over a little bit
but I just want to give like to like tip
the Hat clever
time oh I know in her blaze of glory I
did a lot better than the other one
Manjula yeah that was like it really
it's just kind of slowed down the
episode I'm like what is going
I love that why did why did it slow down
for you it was just really long I kind
of get where I was going actually I just
thought I thought she was gonna put him
in the thing and just like impale him
and not blow each other up but it was
just like this long subducting seducing
thing and I'm like the guy is so stupid
well that's why I joined it cuz it's
like the guy's stupid like kill her
you're going to die and then she like no
and I was like oh my god idiot well I
think too it's a perfect metaphor for
like how the hosts are trying to escape
like they could easily brute force these
humans and instead they're just trying
to live and survive and yeah sometimes
that means that some of them are gonna
use their feminine wiles to trick
someone the flipside like yeah not to
talk too much about Angela but earlier
we see her sneak up and do like she's
like the knife man versus like I feel
like clementines just like gun gun gun
and then you have Teddy who's like
headshot every time Bam Bam Bam
yeah one-shot wonder teddy which I think
it's kind of literally if you're like
the violence choreographer on West world
I mean though the each of them has a
story and you see the you have a
different fighting yes way and even with
Angela is definitely the spy and just
yesterday so you got that vibe but then
when they blow up again not to go back
to Fight Club it didn't have that into
Fight Club moment when all the credit
card buildings are blowing up it's just
like because the Tessa Thompson
Charlotte Hale says oh wow
well there goes your we have your
backups and as long as we have that you
don't go anywhere and then it blows up
and it's like and Dolores goes we didn't
want those anyway tell me yeah that's
not what I was here for literally what
was tying me to this place it's a chain
yeah yeah what's good I thought that was
funny we have all your back gave it I
don't want it give it crap yeah okay so
other people got shot Maeve and man in
black
yeah Danny buck I shut a lot Lauren this
guy will not die honestly I feel like he
meets to win an award and I don't like
this guy might be secretly a host I'm
kidding I'm not at their own yeah that's
a very prominent theory it's like this
Star Wars thing when they the guards
can't shoot straight stormtroopers yeah
and I'm alike like all the stormtroopers
can we clone one can skew straight yeah
the houses of that we can chuck a
million times I anticipated the daughter
saving him but she never came home but
that was a great reveal because I think
they knew we were anticipating and then
you saw the hand like as Emily but also
very cool that may could not touch him
yes I am very confused about the
consistency about when her powers can
work and when I think she is too but he
did touch him not in the way we're
thinking with the mesh network thing she
touched him do an exact same thing
Angela did to the other guy definitely
manipulating his emotion and
manipulating she just made him remember
really what I meant like he was gonna
shoot her but he was like think really
hard reminded like going at it that way
versus oh she was just supremely
persuasive precisely I know what's a
good I think it was a good question to
it because I was like why hasn't
Lawrence stopped and questioned his like
why are you following this guy right
yeah but I guess people are kind of into
their loops it's like why Teddy and
Dolores are always kind of together and
Maeve is back with our daughter it's
like you're kind of drawn towards your
loop anyways and maybe Lawrence just
didn't stop and think like why am I
always following right and we hear some
of that in the cradle too that you know
if that's if they're supposed to be the
they're always consistent that's why
when something does ask you they find a
way to get back to that consistent
behavior or that consistent output
outcome is made back on her own loop we
were questioning this before cuz she was
back in the cabin or the homestead the
man in black shows up again and she is
all like you he's like you what are you
doing here and everyone's just like
converging once again it's very strange
yeah I like that he was there and he
wasn't even looking for he's just like
looking around the house he's like oh
yeah it's yeah yeah okay stop this game
forward and she's like what the fuck are
you talking I'm not fair dude I'm my own
host I also kind of got like the maybe
it's like a predestination thing where
second no matter what you do no matter
how many changes you have in your life
you're still gonna have the same out
there are certain things yeah that will
always happen so let's talk to me and
for a second there when he got shot it I
was I that moment I just I didn't want
her to die yet I wasn't ready for that
but then one of my other favorite months
that happened right after that was when
Lee's like no no we need we need her
she's special
right her head there's like a turning
point that's happened for Lee and I
didn't mean to talk too much about well
I think the similarity to is actually
between
Maeve and Lee in that position is very
similar to season 1 episode 10 Dolores
in Teddy's arms where Lee is like very
lovingly like he's picked up supporting
her neck with one hand and he's grabbing
her with the other and you're very much
like oh she's kind of like oh hello this
is weird
I hope she doesn't die I'm gonna be
really sad and upset if things just be
was gone the way she has these crazy
powers right unlocked so many
achievements but he doesn't he could
have just let her die though I mean
right he's wonder why yeah he even says
no no not this one we need her what does
he need her for is it kind of like
Dolores hinted at do they need her
because they're gonna take her code and
kind of use it to defeat the other hosts
are they going to use it to investigate
that mesh network and those powers as we
call them that that may have has I think
there's a lot of questions and I think
too as we see Lily kind of hide from the
Dolores and Maeve conversation I think
even he realizes like what am I doing
with her like why was i inclined to save
her what was my goal what was I gonna
was I gonna save her yeah we're gonna
let her go after I patch her up was I
just gonna release her back into the
West there is in my mind a parallel with
the work that Lee's doing and
discovering this with Maeve
four character has was doing with
bernard to where there's a poetry to
this it's not just writing storylines
and like great little quip for them to
say an old-timey slang you know I don't
know so that was in crafting the whole
yeah and there's a reason that he's
surviving I don't know why he's
surviving but out of anyone I what do
you think he would have survived this
long good anywhere really me neither but
I'm interested to see how it plays out
him I'm I think he's changed already I
think he's already his perception and
his you know drives have shifted from me
me me money money money - oh my god
there's a whole big other world both
here and out there he's where Felix is
like season 1 episode yeah but I think
on the flip side like but there's limits
to what Felix can do and I think Lee has
more power and more authority just for
me and then just like emotionally like
his affection for her only like just
like buying into realizing this kind of
love nothing for this like affection for
these hosts like Felix had that with me
again she's in what he's like he's like
good finally catching up it's yeah it'll
be interesting to see where think what
about mana black though because then we
see him kind of like having fire four or
five of these shots that seem to hit him
and then there was the one in the belly
which he looks like that would be the
death one and he's kind of off to the
side there what do we think is going on
with him well first he hid from the
commandos who were there to save them
potentially I mean I know Lee called
them in they were really there to like
capture Maeve and take Lee to safety but
that was the man in black to take it out
or ticket to survival if he really
wanted to take it I think he wants to
die in the park I yeah like Emily said I
think this is his death wish his final
three he's having fun I mean can I see
this though like going back to the Ford
and Bernard thing they're talking about
how they're doing this to learn about
all the ways humans react to that who's
been in the park the longest yep
Williams so you're man in black so you
think that the file on him has gotta be
really
Wow so I mean and I'm not to say there
are theories about him possibly being a
host which it could be that he would be
the most realistic one because there's
probably no one else that we've seen
that's been in the park this long
literally decades of loops and
information at least three us B's like
128 games yeah
yes we got a life right here but moving
on where our always will happen hopes
for the next episode or the next few
episodes well we got a look at the next
episode we know we're gonna see this
side which I am hopeful answers a lot of
the outstanding questions from the first
season the seasons have never touched
upon all the seasons we have two seasons
worth of cash had a very long list about
most nation and it's just like why is
Maeve doesn't
why does Maeve witchcraft doesn't work
with them why do they have mazes under
their skulls why do they speak a
language no one else knows but the
daughter knows that the man in black
because she spent time with that yeah
why has no one else spend time with okay
say this like what about the characters
we didn't see in this episode because I
feel like we didn't see Emily we didn't
see Sylvester or Felix or we didn't see
armistice or the lady with a dragon
tattoo so obviously there is still a
little bit of our existing story that
might get resolved and then on top of
that we have the preview which I'm
really excited about the tre looked
amazing and then we just have lots of
little thematic things like even if now
we found a ferret a little bit of a
puzzle that they're using this for the
humans like why what is Delos get out of
this does it go back to the original
like West world in the future world with
they're trying to like replace
politicians with these hosts and stuff
like that I mean or who knows was a
board that said you know DOS was a
businessman he's not gonna invest in
something that's just for himself he's
not an idiot so it's not about the
clothes it's not I don't think it's not
about him it's about the clones but we
need to be thinking more economically
like how is that gonna benefit Delos and
his company and his lineage as a
business
right I could just as much data it's
just all there's they're collecting all
this data so they could just give you
more targeted beer ads well yeah look at
today people collect our data to not
just target ads but also to predict our
movements and think about what it is
that we want and you know that level of
prediction gives any company a leg up in
selling you shit but if you could
actually going I'm gonna replace Caitlyn
with a Caitlyn host and use that to
manipulate somebody in the real world
that is where the a lot of those thumb
attic lines metaphorical lines and a cue
lines start realizing I don't have to
get that far in this season but does
make it starts getting that bigger world
as we see I like that there we're not
seeing everything I like that we okay so
