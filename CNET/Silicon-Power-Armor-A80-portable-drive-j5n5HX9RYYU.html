desk right here it's small and wobbly
and I like coffee and that's why I'm
happy to show you this this is the
silicon power armor AAT portable drive
now the best thing about this is were
proof on the side here you can see that
it has a wireless single USB port it has
the rubber lid on it to keep wear out
and thus - I actually try this one I put
it in the kitchen sink overnight and it
survived it the second special thing
about the drive is if you look closely
as the port right here is the a female
port now unlike other USP device the IAT
use a email to email cable now the
downside is is hard to fight this cable
if you lose it the upside can use either
and to the drive of the computer without
having to fumble which one is which to
make up for that is come with a second
cable right here on the side now this
cable carry design make the drive even
more portable and compact and you don't
have to worry about the whereabouts of
the cable now apart from the fact that
it's waterproof they'll to three feet
it's also drop proof from up to four
feet high
also Mara was most important to
performance is one of the fastest USB
3.0 drive ever reviewed now this dry is
one terabyte and it's caused around
hundred thirty-five dollars there are
also small capacity that is cheaper once
again my name is dongho and this has
been the first look at the rugged
waterproof armor a 80 purple drive from
silicon power
