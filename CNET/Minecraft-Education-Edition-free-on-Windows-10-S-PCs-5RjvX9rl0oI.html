code org have passed over 50 million
play sessions with students and
educators around the world so it makes
sense that one of the top requests that
my team hears is a growing urgency from
educators and from school leaders to
inject technology into their curriculum
specifically computer science and coding
so that's why today I'm proud to
announce code builder for minecraft
education edition code builder is a new
minecraft extension that lets players
build move around and create in
Minecraft by writing code let me show
you how it works
you're going to write code today to
search for water on Mars let's start
with the Mars exploration world from
Simon's class we're going to enter right
into the world and you can see the
habitats they built and their
interpretation of a Martian landscape
once we go inside minecraft you can
start code builder just by typing slash
code with that you can connect a popular
learn to code packages like tinker and
scratch X from MIT or you can even add
your own service today you're going to
use tinker which has custom blocks and
commands that are connected to Minecraft
now back in minecraft you're going to
see your agent or sidekick appears to
execute the code that you write students
really love the agent it's a great way
for them to get started make that
experience even more personal in tinker
you drag-and-drop blocks of code to
create a tunnel program that moves the
agent and digs down to discover what's
beneath the surface in this example
we're going to use the agent to dig a
tunnel outside so that we're safe from
the elements on Mars but minecraft
players out there can imagine dozens of
uses for programming the agent like
mining all night or building a lip back
to your farm while you work on your
house so here the agents gone to work
running code digging down and
identifying the resources that are
underground if you're more experienced
it's more experienced you can even
switch from blocks to JavaScript and run
code without the agent to go even faster
using code builder students will be able
to create some really cool stuff and
like my own experience with Super Mario
Brothers they'll be learning as they
play</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
