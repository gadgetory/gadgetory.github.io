bright to exist
I don't mean that doesn't do anything
actually the 260 dollar new bright
touchpoint from Silicon Valley startup
loosest technologies controls your
lights with a press it also monitors
their energy you can also use the system
to check the weather or the temperature
humidity inside you can use it to
monitor the security of your place while
you're away you can also use it as an
intercom if you have multiple devices
here's what I mean for each of those
functions you can find a cheaper device
that does them better for lighting it
allows remote functionality but you
can't group or rename lights in the app
it lets you dim lights and set scenes
and it works with alexa but you can do
all of that and much more with the
cheaper Lutron light switches and since
new bright doesn't have physical buttons
and doesn't respond to voice commands
itself if you're in the same room as the
light it almost always be faster to just
flip a switch beyond the basics if you
want weather info check your smartphone
if you want a security device you can
find dozens of connected cameras with
many more features and options for
customization new bright won't show you
a live feed and you can't use the
intercom feature from a phone to a
device so if you want that you have to
spend at least $500 on multiple units I
like what new brights aiming for here it
tries to combine a lot of functionality
into a single device to make it easier
for your whole family to control the
smart home but the multi user
functionality isn't well implemented you
won't be able to invite family members
with long email addresses and you can
get locked out of joining an existing
home if you already have a new bright
account so for what it can do new bright
is a couple of years late to the party
yes it's still a somewhat unique combo
but in practice it's an old tablet
slapped onto a mediocre smart switch if
you want to control your home from a
animal the wink relay does more for less</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
