you know and think about decent but
they're kind of sluggish that they don't
belong in stylish cars and if they
aren't worth the money let's see if they
hit all three of those as we drive the
2014 535 d X Drive and check attack
now inside our five series diesel not a
lot of changes to the cabin technology
let's take a quick tour though of the
latest I Drive in case you haven't seen
it this is the new controller it's going
to draw your eye right away notice it's
very large it's got a nice set of home
run buttons if you will which I always
appreciate and this is a touchpad so you
can write letters on it to spell things
out like navigation destinations or you
can also use it just to drag and drop
around the map and move through things
without having to use this horrible old
interface that BMW used to force you
into which is still the air but you can
now ignore it now all that's driving a
really wide screen in the dashes is the
latest layout of I drive if you haven't
seen it in a couple of years this will
look new but it's not all that fresh
it's a nicely done situation you've got
a nice wide screen to give you a lot of
breathing room which is nice for
navigation in particular and mapping
now here's BMWs app strategy in this car
at some of the connected Drive menu and
then you can go to BMW online for your
first little dose built-in 3G radio in
the car here are variety of information
services including online search with
Google then down here you've got this
little bucket for applications and
you've got a very small but interesting
subset you can choose from I've put them
all in here now you have a fuel price
search you have pictures of where you're
going these panorama images are
obviously sent in by users for various
destinations and locations and then you
can also go to standard Google
Streetview for where you are or where
you're going send to mail is lowering
you send destinations back and forth
wiki local is interesting for looking
for things of note in your local area I
mean none of these are critical that you
have to have in your car but they do all
come back to the core of driving I find
these more interesting than Facebook and
Twitter to be honest and of course
you've got the ubiquitous Yelp ratings
in here also voice commands voice
commands exit as you can see you can't
use voice command with Yelp your only
choice is to say exit by voice that's a
little bit disappointing not all these
apps connect to the voice system in the
car just the BMW services it's kind of a
hodgepodge in practice I find using
voice command better on this car than
writing in a navigation address because
you got to go bucket by bucket when you
write you can go one throw when you talk
to 35
Second Street San Francisco California
did you mean 235 second Street San
Francisco yes I did use sexy beast now
beyond the cabinet infotainment three
things in here that our cabin driving
tech are very telling and very
interesting on a diesel first of all
down here you've got the rocker switch
for comfort and eco but also Sport and
Sport Plus you don't normally associate
those kind of settings with a diesel
sedan look at the tachometer we don't
redline til 5800 that's also not a level
you typically associate with a diesel
and then go to this menu here called
sport displays under your vehicle set up
and look at that power and torque meters
all of these tell you that BMW is
swinging toward a performance drivers
diesel and not one that just lumbers
along trying to sit fuel will get on the
road minute see how well they do it
first onto the hood here's evidence that
BMW hates you and wants you to die they
put two of these hooks under the hood
every time I get in here I bang my head
on one one day it's gonna go through my
skull and pull my brain out that won't
be pretty
now the rest of what's in here easy
three litre inline-six
turbo diesel with common rail direct
injection this is kind of your modern
state-of-the-art diesel engine good
numbers 255 horse but even better 413
foot-pounds of torque lose this over 2
ton car to 60 in 5 point 8 seconds not
bad that's a big point while delivering
26:37 MPG now we have an 8-speed
automatic all these models do but
all-wheel drive is option we have an X
Drive you can get it also rear-wheel
drive and the turbo on this is a single
turbo don't be misled by this twin power
turbo its twin power not twin turbos but
it's got variable geometry so it can act
as a low-end turbo or then we curve
itself to act as a high rpm turbo
depending on the engine mode let's go
for a ride the first thing you notice in
this 535 D is the nature and volume of
the D solenoid well controlled and as
long as you've got the audio system on
at all at almost any level you simply
don't hear it mostly at idle is a little
bit of clatter there but then once it
starts to spool up just sounds like a
gas engine which is nice and important
for the marketplace
after that you realize this is a nice
combination of diesel grunt I mean lots
of it but it also breeds nicely higher
up in the RPM so you can actually run up
and down through the gears which is not
quite so satisfying in most Diesel's but
in this one it actually is and it pulls
like a bastard I mean really great power
because it's a combination of grunt and
it's got Headroom so good that I wish it
had a manual I mean this car would
actually be a great sport torker if you
had a manual gearbox you could really
have some fun with this car as it is not
bad
now I must say the suspension doesn't
deliver on what the drivetrain can
promise very confident good driving cars
but this one unless you were to get the
adaptive suspend
we don't have it's not that interesting
on that front that's a lot of pole right
there running through the paddles
looking at the sport gauges there on the
dash putting this thing in sport or
Sport+ these are all things that are a
foreign language in diesel land but BMWs
done a nice translation I mean it's too
bad this car is relatively pricey as
we'll see in a bit because it was more
accessible this would change a lot of
minds about diesels in everyday
enjoyable driving ok pricing our 535 D X
Drive with the all-wheel drive is
basically a $60,000 proposition delivery
but we still have a long way to go to
get to seen that style so pour yourself
a drink sit down and listen up we have
an M Sport package with a bit of a body
kit some 19-inch M wheels and a
nice-looking M steering wheel 3100 bucks
there are two driver assistance packages
the first one for 1800 is how you get a
rear camera I find that insulting along
with a head-up display and parking sonar
driver assistance plus for 1900 makes
lane departure and blind spot tech
active there's a stop-and-go adaptive
cruise package which will do stop-and-go
tech in traffic also brings in surround
cameras 1200 bucks
night vision with pedestrian detection
is 2600 but it also requires the cold
weather package I don't like that kind
of tying the lighting package for 1900
gets you LED headlights and automatic
high beams if you want adaptive
suspension that's the dynamic handling
package for 3500 Harmon Kardon surround
sound
875 I'll pass on the Bank and Olufsen
for 4500
and a slick BMW iPad holder for the back
of the front seat those are 190 bucks
I throw in one of those for sure now
we're talking the low 74 thousands but
overall does the 535 d add up
it delivers a seven MPG average
improvement over the 535i
but costs about fifteen hundred bucks
more when both are totaled up CNET style
at current mid grade gas versus diesel
prices in the u.s. that means it'll take
close to three years to earn back the
diesel premium that's right about the
time you'll be ready to trade it in so
strictly speaking the D is a challenging
argument unless you're a contrarian or a
torque jump</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
