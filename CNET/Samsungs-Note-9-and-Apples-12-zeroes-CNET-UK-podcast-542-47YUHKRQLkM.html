Galaxy Note 9 and Apple has hit a
trillion dollars in its valuation that's
right a trillion a trillion dollars yes
that's all coming up and more on the
scene at UK podcast episode 542 for
Saturday the 11th of August hello and
welcome to the show and joining me this
week is a drew stern hi drew hi Andy
you're feeling great on you amazing
absolutely turf not fully healthy not
full of cold and flu not in the
slightest
you feeling good your your voice doesn't
sound but no you're not you're not gonna
be sneezing and I'm living my best life
that's good I'm glad that you've waited
till we have the hottest summer in a
long time to have a cold
oh yeah but it's a common misconception
that a call there's actually related to
temperature all right captain
I know about the body the human the
human body for unrelated issues I'm no
good it's totally unrelated issue that's
fine I mean I can would it would it help
if I wiped wine to in sympathy and then
at least it's both of those yeah I know
i mighta my you something else usually
my shirt sleeve all my jeans or
something I'm that's gonna be soaked we
are gonna kick off we're talking about
the Galaxy Note 9 and we talked about
this quite a lot in the last podcast you
weren't on it but trust me that we did
but this week Samsung has actually
officially taken the curtains off now I
say this week the podcast is going out
on Saturday which is when you will all
be actually seeing it the launch event
is on the Thursday but we're recording
this on a Wednesday morning so
officially right now it hasn't come out
but so you the listener slash watcher
know more about this than we do well no
we don't know there no more and we've
had our briefings with Samsung so we
know about the phone we will usually
hear about these things in advance so we
can prepare our content to go live at
the point where it becomes official as
pretty much how the entire until we
works gonna covertly talk about stuff
we're not allowed to know even though we
are going to be talking about everything
about the phone now
but it's fine because as I say this is
going to miss will be on Saturday and
it's it will be out and it's public
knowledge then so there's a little
little behind the scene it's like
streaking in your bedroom it's exactly
like which I do all the time and I
broadcast it because odd anyway I mean
we could be talking out this and putting
this out now because it's being one of
those launches where it's been leaked
all over the place and in fact Samsung
itself leaked its own phone with this
whole advertising spread about the phone
showing it called it the Galaxy Note
nine so even before it was announced
we know that it's called the note 9 we
know that it looks basically identical
to the previous note which we expected
anyway I'm not a lot of not a lot of big
changes there which will come unto so it
there's no surprises for this even even
before we've had the launch there's
there are no surprises which is pretty
typical with a lot of phones but for it
to come like for a big high-profile leak
from Samsung themselves is a little bit
silly I don't quite know what happens
there but I'm gonna talk you through
some of the major specs of the phone
room and I'm gonna see if any of these
excite you I can see you have got an
iPhone oh I do yeah although it looks
like an iPhone 7 7 you know great so the
note 9 is gonna have a six point four
inch he's going to let that you're gonna
let that one slide my little job at your
phone yeah yeah all right that's fine
yeah you are ill normally you'd have hit
back with no let me tell you why it's
still great but no I honestly I don't
care
and no my phone is is is as up-to-date
as I need it to be and the hardware
differences are not enough for me to
make the jump and as long as the iOS is
up-to-date
well you know that's actually the point
that were going to come onto shortly so
gonna take you through some of these
specs six point four inch screen 2560
1440 resolution so it's big screen high
resolution as you'd expect for Note
series it's got dual rear camera both
have got optical image stabilization and
it's got the dual aperture main camera
that we've seen on the galaxy s 9 which
is kind of I've used it and it's it's
fine it doesn't make a huge difference
in low like and at their point is always
a bit slow like master of photography
it's a more
the better cameras for low-light the
best is still Hawaii p20 Pro that thing
I took out and I'm genuinely astounded
at what that phone can do in low-light
so if that's your thing you still need
to be looking at faraway for this it's
got an 8 megapixel front camera a big
four thousand milliamp battery which has
got their safety check so it doesn't
explode milliamp-hour
milliamp an hour battery Snapdragon 805
so top specs all around huge mat storage
and RAM fingerprint reader on the back
and it's ip68 water and dust resistant
including the S Pen and it also has a
headphone jack which is which is good
Samsung has stuck with sticking the
headphone jack on the s9 whereas most of
its Android rivals and of course Apple
have ditched that jack some interesting
things though with it it's got water and
like a combination of water and carbon
fiber cooling within the phone which is
which is which is pretty neat okay and
that's largely for water cooling water
cooling apparently now unless I'm sort
of getting this wrong and this may be
one of those things that kind of after
we have the launch people are gonna be
commenting with like what are you
talking about this complex is not what
it is but as I understand it right now
as at the point of recording there is a
was sort of inter and carbon-fibre
cooling system within the phone to cool
it for very intense things ie gaming do
they refer to as water cooling or liquid
cooling well at the moment I've got the
word water now presumably liquid of some
kind but I don't I don't know okay
certainly what that liquid is because I
know obviously when you have like when
you have liquid cooled desktop PCs it's
typically not water it's a type of
coolant like similar to what you would
have in a car or something you know some
water doesn't actually transmit heat
very well very well
so what are cooled engines on a car for
example require radiator the radiator
actually facilitates the heat
evaporating and the water just
transports it if you were actually in a
limited size like that I would imagine
any fans with no fans i imagine that
they're using a some kind of of gel or
liquid that yeah can move away yeah but
you do require movement
of that liquid for it to make sense
which indicates a pump arts yeah yeah so
I'd like to hear more about this yeah
I'd like to know more at the moment
unfortunately you know as we said we are
recording miss early so it's gonna eat
it means that there are some of these
details that I I don't have a lot more
information on but that is interesting
and it's really designed for for keeping
it cool for really intense things which
includes gaming and which is important
for this phone because this is going to
be the first Android phone which will
have fortnight launching on it now
fortnight drew you probably are aware of
is the world's most popular game at the
moment it's an absolute sensation there
are it is insanely popular the big
battle royale game and so far that
hasn't been on Android and I believe it
is on iOS as is player unknown
battlegrounds but it's going to be
launching exclusively with some of
Samsung's most recent phones including
the s9 I believe and the and the note 9
of course exclusively from the 9th of
August which which means it's out now so
if you do have a galaxy s 9s time plus s
eight and a seven do go and have a look
in the samsung game store because I
believe that is where you'll find
fortnight's so that's kind of that's
kind of neat that they've done this this
tie-in to try and get a little bit of
excitement around it and but I am your
eye I'm very interesting know how this
cooling system well yeah and whether
actually does work because I think that
is one of the issues they had with the
battery on the note 7 is that it
basically it tried to charge too quickly
and expanded and got too hot there are
all kinds of different reasons why they
gave for it so I think maybe this is
part of that that you can really kind of
ramp up with that power because often in
gaming PC's you will have water cooling
in order to do what's called
overclocking of your processor where it
goes more it puts out more power than
it's normally supposed to but in doing
so it gets extremely hot so you need to
really really really cool it by using
liquid and lots and lots of fans and
sometimes huge box of ice but only if
you're kind of weird so some of the
other cool other cool features which we
talked about last time and
that we've now got confirmed the s-pen
that's a little stylus that comes in in
the note does is now sort of Bluetooth
compatible and it you can actually use
it for their various things including
you can control like PowerPoint slides
if you're using your note professionally
because again something are really
targeting this phone as like a very
high-end professional tools there's lots
of talk about its compatibility with
well this with contracting PowerPoint
and the whole decks system where you can
plug it this phone into an HDMI monitor
and use it as a use it as a
fully-fledged desktop PC if you want to
you can also use the s-pen to use your
camera so if you want to set your camera
up on a tripod or you don't use it for
taking a selfie you can click the the
pen and use that to take the photo which
could be kind of neat I mean for me it's
probably not something I would use very
often if at all it's it's not you know
it's not a dissimilar function to you
how I can use my Apple watch to take a
photo using my iPhone if I want to put
my iPhone on a tripod but never I don't
think no I don't think I've ever used it
I think I used it once when I the only
time I used it was actually to see the
image on the phone on my watch when I
was using my phone to record video of me
on a phone mount inside a car so I was
pointing at me but because of the angle
that when I was mounting the phone I
couldn't see how it was framed I
couldn't see whether I was a shot or not
so I basically I used the screen on my
watch to see he's off I use my I used
the screen of my watch to see how he was
being framed so I could do it that way
but obviously you can't do that with the
s-pen you can just use it to take the
picture so whether that is important or
not I don't know but what I kind of want
to get from you and even from me is like
do you think this is in any way exciting
this phone in general honestly I think
there's a bit of a dual aiming of
purpose because on the one side if
they're saying oh I know you've got this
little pen that you can use as you're
advancing your PowerPoint presentation
and plug into an HDMI monitor so on that
really big business meeting that you've
got coming up yeah we can you this will
plug in seamlessly and it will look cool
and you'll feel cool
yeah efficiency yeah also fortnight yeah
which is
it is a completely different audience
serious for those business people who
have got out of that big business I need
to go and take an emergency food and
then one is why did you have to factor
that it moves wanted to go off and relax
somewhere no I needed to could
understand where you play pub G and
[Laughter]
listening to if you look at that he's
been listening to literally everything
I've just said including go and have an
emergency poo okay thank you upper watch
I don't think that Cirie's going to have
a very unbiased opinion about the note
no I think it may say no have you
considered the iPhone yeah no my only
thought on that is that if you had a big
business meeting then maybe you're
really nervous and I'm like kind of
everything's up in the air and you
probably don't feel like having one
before the meeting because you're too
nervous but then afterwards everything
just comes floating out and that is
where you'd want to sit down for a good
45 minutes and play for night so maybe
other sort of a snapshot into your
mentality then is an actual campaign for
fighting this I'd like to think that I
am the everyman drew and I would do that
then surely lots of other people would
so that's but I completely agree you
know that is that is you know the case
but then it's not just the note that's
getting for tonight exclusively it is
the other no but Samsung phone you're
talking about having an advanced cooling
system just specifically designed to
cope with things like gaming it could
also be fair and firm like CAD
applications and things like that which
people do use you know yeah but and
that's kind of one of the one of the
benefits from the stylus that you can
sort of do quite advanced things if
you're on business on building sites and
you need to sort of use these quite
demanding applications that you can that
you can do that and and again like would
take up a lot of processing power and
particularly if you are using the note
as a desktop PC plugged in using the
deck system you've got a mouse and
keyboard attached and you are doing
sometimes quite demanding work on that
because the apps that you can get now
for your phone or desktop class and so
you kind of going to need to have
desktop that's processing and therefore
cooling so I think it is gonna be
interesting to see what you can use this
phone for but the thing that that I
think is going to be difficult for
Samsung with this phone is that it
looks identical to the previous one
everything which is not necessarily bad
because the last phone was good-looking
and stuff but it's there's been no
physical change and that was the case
with the s9 looking the same as the s8
and sales of the s9 have been something
themselves had described them as slow
and in fact Samsung has lost quite a
significant market share in the mobile
world because of those slow sales like
people just haven't been that interested
and analysts have been saying that that
is that the reason we people haven't
been that excited about these phones is
because there is no major upgrade
there's no reason for people who have
got the SI and even the s7 to be
thinking ok I'm going to upgrade and get
this this new phone there's no visual
change to be excited about yeah there's
a bit of a yeah the camera with its dual
aperture thing was pretty much the the
main upgrade and even that isn't that
big a deal
yeah it had a slow-motion camera but
there are other phones that have got
that including like Sony's phone which
even does a high-res higher resolution
so there's no big exciting feature for
people to latch on to and to think that
is now the phone I want to get and isn't
that the same how Apple's done it in
alternate years where we've had the the
model and then the s where it's very
superficial if any changes to the
exterior whatsoever and it's alternate
years where you see a big design leap
forward it does tend to be that's right
and and Samsung and Apple have been abs
of criticized on some years for
repeating design language too often and
therefore not seeing like a interesting
thing but but analysts have and missus
analyst speaking not just me they do
often see Apple as its own beast within
you know within the industry in that it
is one of those companies that can kind
of chernow minor upgrades or something
and it will still sell extremely well
and the iPhone X has sold extremely well
despite its very high price and other
companies have tried to put high prices
and phones and they haven't they've been
criticized very widely for being too
expensive and the arguments are well
apples phones are expensive doesn't
really work because
Apple can do that and and that is what
the what the market has shown so it's
it's I the argument from from these
analysts and from the market generally
it has really been that well actually no
Samson can't really get away with kind
of repeating the same thing too many
years in a row you know one year and
then the next fine but the note hasn't
really seen as a big a big change and
it's it's largely just sort of here's
some new tech great tech and you know
this tech is all the best tech you can
pretty much get in a phone yeah but it's
not really it's there's not one thing
that's making anyone go oh yes that is
the interesting thing I want that's the
thing that's gonna make me I don't think
having using your S Pen to be able to
move through PowerPoint slides is
completely not easy to you just once
maybe no it's not an exciting feature if
you are a professional who does
PowerPoint presentations I guarantee you
you've already got that down you've got
your work that you like to use and
you're gonna stick to it you're not
gonna change it just because you've got
a new phone because you don't want to go
into that first meeting be using it for
the first time yeah you'd have to take a
home and practice and why change it if
you've already got something that you're
you can rely on so it is it is a novel
absolutely and it is a bit and I also
suspect that some of those people I mean
maybe some things in their research
research and they know people do want
this but I don't know really how many
people are doing powerpoints directly
from their phone powerpoints are so 2007
yeah but it is interesting to see kind
of how something is playing than now and
it's gonna be very interesting to see
what it does with the next s phone the
s10 or whatever it goes for and would
expect to be around a February time
because it was this week or last week
the Apple hit evaluation of a trillion
dollars so apples is going quick-fire
how many zeros in a trillion well I did
because I've got it here and I counted
them and I can to them before we came on
to speed because you go how many zeros
in a trillion go
yeah it's 12 it's a ridiculous number
it's a million millions isn't it's a
million millions yeah absolutely bonkers
amount of money and but basically what
happens
or stock hit 207 dollars and five cents
a share and that's because and it had
four billion eight hundred twenty-nine
million nine hundred six thousand shares
so each each of those shares had to hit
two hundred and seven dollars to be
worth a trillion dollars overall which
did happen it close on Thursday the last
Thursday's trading session closed at two
hundred seven dollars and thirty nine
cents which makes it the first US public
company to hit that level which is a big
deal
Tim Cook said in a memo to Apple
employees equal the valuation a
significant milestone that added that it
wasn't the most important measure of the
company's success financial returns are
simply the result of Apple's innovation
putting our products and customers first
and always staying true to our values
and went on to talk about Steve saying
that Steve founded
Steve founded Apple on the belief that
the power of human creativity can solve
even the biggest challenges and that the
people who are crazy enough to think
they can change the world are the ones
who do which is just quite nice which
Steve is he talking about
will Steve Jobs where's to Steve's he
started Apple I'm assuming he meant
Steve Jobs so I think we can all assume
he meant Steve Jobs he may well have
said Steve Jobs I'm being facetious yes
yeah sure he did so that that's
interesting that you know Apple has had
its success with the iPhone X being so
expensive and it's expected to announce
3 new iPhones in this September will
have a possibility of a considerably
larger version of the iPhone X and
another probably iPad yes on another
that's significantly less expensive so
they've tried that before though it has
that ever really worked and five slight
with the 5c
yeah the cheaper plastic ones you know I
don't know I mean they don't have a new
5c at the moment so you'd guess it no it
didn't work but man I saw a lot of those
things out in a while like I did see
they seemed to sell as far as I could
see from my own eyes
incredibly well I mean Apple doesn't
give that specific figures on how well
things are selling so in fact they
didn't continue that trend of lower
priced models seems to suggest that it
wasn't as successful well I mean they've
sort of replaced it with the iPhone se
which is the basically is the iPhone 5
the regular 5 the metal one but with
updated specs and we do have you know so
we and they have continued to update the
iPhone se so that is there if you want
an affordable iPhone you go for the SE
that's what you get for de Bourgh yeah
it's affordable compared to the other
ones it's certainly when you come to
pend over $1000 and everything else
everything else yeah but it's yeah and
that's a good thing it's also the phone
I often tell people to go for when they
say oh yeah I really want an iPhone but
want a smaller one I don't want
something that's so big because it is
still this exactly the same footprint as
the iPhone 5 which are which is now when
you hold it feels really small any small
yeah fours and fives now at the time
felt like oh this is a good size getting
there you look to you know oh man yeah I
miss that extra inch yeah it's it's
bonkers and particularly I mean that's
the case with what's gonna be within
note 9 cuz that's six point four inches
I remember when the first note launched
and how big was Galaxy Note size well I
shouldn't know you'd think I know that
up top of my head yeah these the first
notes Galaxy Note series blah blah blah
galaxy notes the first one 5.3 inch yeah
which is smaller than almost every
flagship phone at the moment yeah and at
the time that was laughably huge and
people made videos with like people
using them and public transport holding
to their head looking like idioms really
exactly yeah were these massive massive
phones and and now we've got six point
four inch things and it's and that seems
normal like we don't really bat an
eyelid at this I mean yeah okay fine
it's still a big phone and so here we've
got the pixel to excel and that is again
it's a big phone but it doesn't look
silly anymore in the way it once did
it's weird how trends for that kind of
thing change I mean I remember when
phones were getting smaller and smaller
smaller smaller to the point where
they're all over them yeah because the
screens didn't need to have much
functionality this was before most of
them are even color anyway they weren't
certainly weren't used for imaging or
multi multi MMS is so you could make
them small small was cool
small it's functional yeah and then when
you start getting sportful ones
obviously bigger actually has a use as a
practicality definitely and now it's
pretty much what size do you want
because you can tile in exactly the kind
of size that you want in a phone if you
want one that's that size yeah and most
of even the companies if you want a
particular phone they do tend to offer
two versions with Samsung you got the s9
yes time plus iphone you've got eight
eight plus and then ten if you want if
you want that's Kwame P 20 pro or P 20
you know I think you know pixel pixel
and pics like cell yeah so I think
pretty much across the board any brand
you want there is that choice which is
good I mean you still had you still got
a smaller phone you've got the seven not
even platter so now and that is fine
that's fine for you I've got the larger
Apple watch the 7 iPhone and iPad Mini a
regular iPad and iPad pro I feel like
I've got enough ranges of screens from
my Apple devices I didn't need the
slightly larger phone to go between my
iPhone and my iPad Mini you're
responsible for quite a significant
chunk of that one trillion dollar budget
line on you if you've got all the hosts
I would hate to think how much money
I've passed to the Apple corporate do
you have you the home pod I do not know
so actually because I would want to
mention because I've recently got I
guess I had the home Bob when it first
came out and they I've recently got a
second one because when they learnt
updated iOS to include airplay too you
can have a stereo pair and it's amazing
like it really it sounds so good having
because the sound from the home pod
already is really considering its it's
you know it's the size of I don't know
what's that what's that size 10 inches
so 12 inches is that you know tall it's
not very big it's a small speaker it
puts out one hell of a good sound yeah
you put it on the floor in your living
room it gives really good amazing bass
go how much does that cost us I throw
individuate and two of them sticks your
11770 700 quid yeah for 700 quid what
can you get in terms of amp and speakers
that you could plug into like an Amazon
echo not that much I wouldn't think you
can get so you could get a pretty
serious speakers and a good amp take
optical out from
yeah but then yeah but you talking about
everything's got to be in the UK and now
optical an you gotta get right cables
and you gotta do this you gotta connect
to this and will it become possible with
this thing and all that stuff that kind
of yeah when you have the Apple thing
you know I've just got two plugged in
and then I just airplay from my phone
and it puts it to both and I've got one
in one corner with my living room and
one in the other corner both on the
floor so that because I'm it's hardwood
floor so the base fires into the floor
and just below no no no I'm regretful
okay
my name is above me a noisy as hell and
I hate them absolutely they do my head
in just want to get that there and guess
they watch stop it just stop there's a
very passive-aggressive you can knock on
the door as this is a whole other issue
we're getting into but yeah the sound is
great from these two speakers and
obviously then you kind of have the
multi room if you want but I like having
them in one room and just solve really
sort of pumping up that sound it I mean
do you not see those being some irony in
spending a lot of money on high quality
speakers and then streaming order to
audio to them over Bluetooth well this
airplay and was ear place so it's deep
but it's over the Wi-Fi it's over CD
quality is it you know the quality that
you can get across it because it's not
bluetooth I guess you're right it's also
I think recent Bluetooth like they they
are I don't know exactly what bitrate
you can it can put out but it's it's
pretty much up there with I mean you
know fine if you're talking audiophile
levels where you've got 200 pound of
foot cabling and you're using it at like
mastered level lossless quality then
probably into a pair of 20 grand
speakers then fine maybe you can tell
the difference but I think from for
$0.99 to be all home audio needs I don't
think you can tell any difference i
bluetooth is really good I mean you use
bluetooth headphones there I do yeah if
I use that let's maybe given that for
more money there and I don't like that
the air pods but only because they don't
stay in my ear that I think is the
number one complaint people have about
them because there's no variant in what
size they are they either do or they
don't and if they fit in your ear
they're they're great yes and if they
don't well then they're terrible and
it's battery which is a shame because
they'd be the ideal headphones for
jogging as they're so small and light
but I I mean I when I don't know I don't
charge now
even even a brisk walk which I do a lot
of they fell out and I had not diesel
but I had a different pair which I won't
name but and they also didn't have a
very good fit and they one of them fell
out and then went down a drain so
because they are individual and I was I
was really worried about that with the
with the air pods and I was quite proud
of this I got the first batch that came
to the UK yeah so before it before
anyone else did I got the the first six
I got in there early and touchwood I've
never fallen out of my ears and I've got
the same pair that I've had since they
first launched what eighteen months ago
I'm fishing around my pockets because I
use there we go
the jaybird freedoms which I've talked
about the podcast before I won't go into
I had a pair of J boats which I loved
yeah these are really really good I love
the sand on these things and although I
have managed to tangle them hideously in
my pocket see that already is a reason
for the year but it's easy and they just
hang round my neck like that they're so
easy so simple so lightweight but sound
is decent I get about five six hours of
battery life and they charge in about
half an hour forty minutes maybe or so
and because they've they are connected
by the cable they can hang around my
neck and if one falls out
it just goes here didn't fall to the
ground which I wouldn't one like so
thanks for running I wouldn't want to
use anything that isn't connected by a
neck band to some degree no I completely
agree but I I don't know whether whoever
have modelled the ears that they built
the ear pods on has remarkably similar
ears to me because they say perfectly
flush down my face they say it's snug
without being too tight and they never
fall out but I know loads of people I
you see them sometimes on the tube where
people they have them almost sticking
out like this yeah yeah Rams the
masonite side their skull I'm gonna
spend all this money on these headphones
I'm gonna use them I don't care if it
looks silly if it hurts well you can get
and there are companies now that offer
like mouldings that you can put on them
that that's only if they're too small
for your ear if they're already too big
to fit in your ear mouldings not gonna
help you get it you know although maybe
there's ones that you know they have
like if if you have a moulding that also
had like a flange tip so that that's no
it's proud they've been designed to sit
inside your ear in a certain way because
now they're going to be sat flush out
and it's one of those rumoured when they
update them for the next the next pair
that they will have
molded any tips rather than just the
standard but molded to who's you well
maybe maybe it'll be maybe it'll be
changeable that doesn't sound very Apple
does it and we have got a little bit off
topic as we're talking about Apple
generally but but it goes to show how
many different products they put out
there they're all kind of tie into not
only a an ecosystem that people like to
stick with him but also a lifestyle
there that people like live up to that
goes beyond the quality of the product
really is it's more of a fashion
statement than anything a totally yes
yeah and they tap into that more than
any other technology absolutely yeah
there is there is a there is a certain
feel that people have about sort of
having like the latest iPhone out in
public and using it on the tube and
having the air pods end and beat the
people don't have its the before latest
Huawei from yeah and which is a shame
because hallways but p20 Pro is
brilliant it's a great great great phone
but no one would really care about
seeing it apart from its cool color
scheme but if you've got it in a case
and no one no one's going to look at
that phone and go oh what's that's
really interesting what have you got
there
yeah third-party shops that carriers or
foreign shops aren't going to have
posters of that phone outside when they
can have posters of the latest iPhone
and the deals that go along with yeah
you know it doesn't bring boots in the
door yeah yes the s9 is is the closest
that you'll get to that but even then
Samsung has as we said it found that the
sales have really slowed of his phone
he's taking a market share here and it's
going to need to do something pretty
interesting because I think how the note
cells will be interesting to see because
it hasn't really done much of an upgrade
it's it is if you've got a no AIDS
absolutely there's no reason to upgrade
if you've got a note 7 send it back
because you should have done already I
think they've I think they have actually
get out of the house yeah now run from
it yeah just hurl it into the nearest
river you can't fly with it you can't
take it again but like just owning one
feels like an offensive act put them out
I think they brick them so I think like
I don't I think if you've got them I
don't know if you can still use them let
me know if that is different if there's
anyone who listen to the podcast who
does still have the note 7 and you're
using it let us know and yeah more
importantly let us know why
because you could have sent it back and
had a replacement so you don't you don't
fly as much as I try not to ever fly I
fly a huge amount but you may or may not
be aware of this the paranoia about that
phonon flight yes so long that is the
only time I've ever heard a specific
piece of hardware name checked all right
if you have this phone yeah take it out
do not fly we fly with this phone yeah
yeah just
they're not even paranoid just the
concern and the the the bad press that
that got I mean I don't know how much
for that echoes through time and how
much people are just shying away from
something I'm amazed they didn't
discontinue the lines name and very
least I actually am as well and but I
think they handled it very well is
intermittent into detail but Samsung did
a good job of managing that situation
they were very very transparent about
how widespread the problem was they
talked they talked openly about how they
were trying to combat this how they were
doing the reason to finding exactly
what's going on because they didn't know
what first like we didn't know what had
happened they were trying to contact the
people who had had these fires to get
their handsets to study them to see what
it is it happened because until they
kind of break them down and do the
post-mortems
they can't find out what part has gone
wrong it's not like they know in advance
they don't make the phone and go oh yeah
it's probably gonna catch fire for this
reason but thought it will put it out
anyway because you know something can't
afford to make those sorts of like risks
so it needs to kind of work out what it
is that's happened and it turned out
that it was like the issue with fast
charge into battery but it handled it
well it did the recalls did everything
that it should I think as a result it
sort of mitigated the overall damage to
the Samsung brand name and the no brand
name yeah but the note that the Samsung
brand name was important for them to
make sure that that the brand name
wasn't tainted but they could have just
changed the name of the line I mean did
they still feel they had so much
goodwill prior to the note 7 we're
keeping it was a good idea I mean it's
not even that it's that good a name I
think I think the other thing is what
would be the point because everyone
knows that whatever phone it is is just
the replacement of the No
and would immediately be discussed in
all the media as here's the replacement
to the note line though that would have
lasted one cycle of I think this we're
still talking about it now even though
it was too generous we are but I think
general but a lot of the a lot of a
discussion probably won't be and I think
maybe the next generation of a note Ted
probably won't be talked about at all
because they're now AIT's been fine 109
presumably will be fine so we'll see how
it goes but we are talking about mobile
alerts which is good because it's very
mobile focus show this week and because
the other thing that's happened is that
Android pi it's a new version of Android
Android version 9 pi is officially
rolling out two devices now starting of
course with Google's own line of pixel
phones which is why I have the pixel to
excel here because I have been trying to
update this one at the moment it's got
so many cuz I haven't turned this on
basically since it came out because we
did a couple of camera tests and I
didn't review this phone so I haven't
really had to use it so it's got to do
all these other updates first so right
now I can't say for certain whether it's
on my pixel excel but I have this
morning texted two of my friends who
have pixels and their first gen pixels
both of whom confirmed that the update
is available for them on their UK
handset so presumably then it has gone
out and if you do have a pixel phone in
the UK or pixel to then do have a look
because it will be out but it does have
a bunch of updates which I want to kind
of talk about some of the more important
updates on it and the first thing is it
has this apparently much better
adaptive battery feature that you that
learns the apps that you use over time
to prioritize resources for them so it
knows that you know if you if you always
are going in and out of Gmail and
whatsapp but those are the things that
you will need to prioritize sort of
having like push email art and all this
sort stuff the apps that you hardly ever
use basically will ignore them until you
open them so it's trying to really
cleverly use background tasks for you
you know the processing power and
therefore battery life which is
something that they've talked about
before and other phones have apparently
you've had similar features and a while
had a feature that apparently does
similar things but none of them have
really seemed to make that bigger deal
largely because with every generation
they put in more demanding processors
more demands on the battery so overall
if that smart software makes any
difference its negated by more
power-hungry other things so overall we
still have smartphones which every
single one if you use them normally you
will have to charge every night because
that's just how you use a smartphone you
might get into the next morning you may
be able to sort of if you go out on a
Saturday night and stay at your mates
and you don't charge your phone you may
have enough power to listen to music on
your bus ride home but then you'll need
to put it on charge yeah but that's
pretty much it so that's I'm gonna look
forward to seeing how that really works
so dynamically switching off things like
background refresh on the apps that it
deems that you haven't been using as
much as but but the whole point of
something with back on refresh is that
it provides don't necessarily background
refresh it right it's more just about
how it's using and again you know that
we could probably talk for hours about
like you know if we got the technical
detail on this it's not it's not
stopping things like you know if you've
got I don't know you use a messaging
service like the viber which maybe
you've got two people you talk to on it
but you only ever use whatsapp until
you've you've opened viber once in the
last month and so it will deem that low
priority I think the idea is that you
will still get push notifications if
something happens but it's it changed
the interval like the monitoring
interval quite possibly or I don't know
how exactly it will do that but Google
will probably be able to do a lot more
but that's the kind of the idea behind
it and things like I don't know maybe
like Auto updates on games out I don't
know like it's one of those things that
we kind of need to use it a lot now it's
out to really kind of get a handle on
how that works and where that makes much
difference but some of the things we've
got navigation gestures so instead of
having on Android you have the home
button and then you have a back button
and you have a multitasking button that
is now a just one dot like a little pill
shape dot and you sort of you can swipe
left to go back you can swipe right to
open your mouth
asking you can swipe down or up I think
to to go home a little bit similar to
I'm how we've got with the iPhone 10
with no home button so you've got a
swipe to use gestures to get around that
will be optional if you do want to have
your usual things that you can put those
on notifications will have the ability
to show images in the notification
previews instead of just text or which
hopefully will make your notification
just that bit more useful although that
is a feature that developers will have
to build into their own apps so you may
not see it straight away and there's a
proper Do Not Disturb tool that can
block calls and notifications and even
stop the screen lighting up at all while
you've got it on so if you really want
to kind of have some phone downtime then
you can do that the software has a new
look overall generally so like rounded
corners and notifications quick settings
panel that's changed there's a better
text selecting box that when you try and
select text it will actually give a
magnification box which we've had on iOS
it's finally something that we've got on
on Android we've also got vertical
stacking about previews when you're
going to the multitasking wheel against
like iPhone and various changes like
their settings menu and we've got things
like actions where when you see the apps
in the app tray if it's a certain action
that you always do you will see that
suggested underneath so you can
automatically launch into that action so
say it's composed message or maybe
compose message or even I think one of
the examples that we've written about if
you want to open slack and go to a
certain messaging channel straightaway
that you can automatically go into that
channel and and and new things like
different new way of doing like
screenshots it'll automatically allow
you to edit them on the go so it's again
you know we're not talking huge upgrades
if there's no particular tool or
particular thing but overhauls the
interfaces lots of just neat little
tweaks and they're up there are plenty
of other behind-the-scenes query system
of the particular ones that I've picked
out but I think just makes it that bit
neater to use I already am a big fan of
Android I do use on my second phone
as well as he's my iPhone and I think
it's much better these days than it was
even just a couple of years ago they've
made some good tweaks it makes it a much
nicer tool to use and it's much easier
to use Buggles efforts to make stock
Android very user-friendly I think have
been great and so when I've suggested to
people who when have asked about ok I
got someone who's not very tech friendly
maybe he's an older relative that
actually some of any phone was running
stock Android is often a really good one
to go for because it is much more
stripped back and easy to use but of
course then you've still got the case
there manufacturers themselves are
putting quite complicated skins over the
top I think the worst one for me is
still Sony they do a lot to Android and
it makes it a bit clunky to use any mean
also means that they probably their
phones probably won't get Android 9pi
for a while because they've got to do
somewhere to work to it in order to make
it roll out Sampson often does quite a
lot too but Annie and it was the worst
offender for making their phones
insanely so completely where so much
bloat West so much s note s voice s
things all this stuff I think it was the
s Galaxy s5 which was the worst offender
for this and we really slammed it
Iceland in particular for just being so
insanely complicated that every you
expect a tool to be here and it's not
it's hidden away in some submenu
somewhere else and it's a nightmare to
get around everything takes about five
or six more clicks and it should do they
really kind of learned from that and
made - made big efforts to simplify the
experience I think that so much is
dripping down to raw Android which by no
means how they've gone to raw Android
it's still there's a lot of things that
are very customizable and there are they
had the phone that has a lot of tools
you know they have all the different
ways of doing it and they've got those
you know particularly on the note line
as well you've got so many other
features you've got the note panel for
that you could sort of pull in on the
right-hand side of a screen with the
with the with the face dots and all this
that way you can automatically have
favorite contacts saved so you can
quickly do things I guess you can
appreciate the extra additions to the
raw Android platform when they are
Hardware specific and optimize the tools
that the physical tools that you have
here
yeah rather than just bloating out with
default brand based software yeah
absolutely you know if there if there's
got a particular hardware thing then
then that makes the use of that tool
than fine but did not used to be the
case with Samsung they are solve using
things a little bit more important there
but I think this is interesting when you
obviously as we talked about you are
quite an Apple user I'm not gonna say
fanboy because I think that generally
you are I'm agnostic
I've I've switched back and forth in the
past and I just happened to have stuck
with iOS for the last five or six years
is there anything that would make you
switch honestly talking about kind of
like the walled garden like once you're
in and you're using the cooperation
between hardware devices so without even
really noticing how I rely on the fact
that my notes sync across my devices and
then yeah I can find every device from
every other device you've got quite a
lot of smart home stuff too yeah so is
that that's linked with um so I don't
use home care as much I it's kind of a
loose Association so I use I used just a
built-in app so I have I think of about
50 Philips hue bulbs around my home not
50 now yeah I just go home or for the
garden they expensive yeah it's pretty
pricey and that can be controlled
through my Amazon echo as well so I can
post commands that that's happened to
that so it's kind of a loose Association
of do you say echo or nobody's Alexa
Alexa we've judged it dry mouth mode and
then everything sort of goes like I've
read I've changed it so I can say I can
say echo in the night and it turns out
father oh yeah it just makes it feel a
little bit more human the so yeah I
don't obviously Appledore do every kind
of smart device so they don't do like a
smart home doorbell so I've got that
that ties in to different devices so
there's there's a couple of different
smart networks that are
used but everything does play together
relatively nicely an apple if Apple did
versions of those products I'd maybe
consider them but at the moment the the
as far as my phone is concerned because
there's so much excuse me
because there's so much ties into your
day-to-day work and communication having
that sync with like my photos syncing
with my other iOS devices yeah I can get
my my photos I take on my iPhone up here
on my on my Mac seamlessly I wouldn't
now want to take one of my devices out
of that so that's the same reason that I
wouldn't consider a Windows laptop it's
same reason I wouldn't at moment
consider an Android phone I mean that
and that's part of this big steel trap
that you find yourself in yeah
absolutely because you that you're not
stuck within it but leaving it on one of
those fronts would be so inconvenient
you'd have to change all your devices at
once which would be prohibitively
expensive so every time you update one
it just seems like they yes there is a
great Andrew alternative available but
even though it might not have all the
latest little features and not that the
best hardware it just it would make such
a big part of what I do on a day to day
basis too difficult and and slightly
more tricky that it's just easier for me
to stick in this yeah I think that's the
case for a lot of people once you bought
warn you and you buy the other and you
know then like I've got Apple TV so I
want to you know an Apple watch which I
like having I like having an Apple watch
I don't use a lot of things but
notifications is great and so I don't
really want to I can't really switch out
yeah I'm a second phone in is always an
Android phone and is usually something
that I'm like reviewing or long-term
testings at the moment I'm using the s9
+ still and so I'm making sure I'm
always using Android phones but they are
off today on my second phone they're not
the phone that I absolutely rely on all
the time and I think I probably case for
a lot of people but definitely is
something that I am interested in
hearing about and so if you do have a
particular allegiance and for a
particular reason other than you've just
spent a lot of money on iOS apps then
we'll be good to hear about and another
thing of course is that you invest
in terms of how to spend exactly
although the apps like I've spent
hundreds and hundreds of pounds I
particularly lot of the games yeah I'm
playing on like my iPad when I spend
like 15 quid every time Square Enix
launches a new Final Fantasy on iOS and
I immediately buy it despite the fact
that I bought it ten times on different
platforms before that still waiting on
Final Fantasy 8 though still no sign of
they've done seven they've done nine
which a great games no question but
Final Fantasy a is I think my favorite
final fantasy game and they still
haven't brought that out so I'm furious
they need to do that anyway that's
another I've never played a Final
Fantasy game and that's where we end so
I can go and kill drew because I'm not a
nerd
well that is time to wrap up do let us
know if you have any thoughts on any
other topics today on your thoughts on
the galaxy no 9 whether you think that
Samsung has done enough to stay ahead of
the competition and whether you think
Apple's valuation of a trillion dollars
is if it's really earns it I would say I
mean it's got it so you must advance it
it's it has that value because people
are willing to pay that money for shares
yeah true what do you tell about what
you're up to
well as all I mean up as always we're on
the the core affection channels and if
in fact you're listening to this as a
podcast I recommend that you listen to
our new core fiction podcast if you are
yeah of course if you are interested in
the world of cars and specifically
anything that's fast expensive exciting
or it's just you know playing fun
wherever you get your podcast to search
for car fiction for the love of cars
podcast audio or video is audio podcast
that goes out every week on iTunes
stitcher Google wherever you get your
podcast from ever having me as a guest
on yours that's fine
no add you on mine many times yep but I
would argue that probably know more
about technology than you do about cars
I know how to drive cars
yes it's or thought of I so I sort of
know how to drive cars okay
well as soon as you form an opinion
about the new
Milan red hypercar out of Austria or
anything like that let me know and we'll
have music is that is that a thing yes
it's I'm thinking of a poor 17 Cayman
GTS s afternoon yep
so there's a lovely car there you go is
it yeah very nice it's red yeah it's got
black rims on it do you know what engine
it has it's got a four-cylinder it does
yeah something some things no I don't I
don't know what engine it's got so no
boxer engine isn't it yeah if you do
know a little bit more especially not
definitely put it though specifically
put that one in mine I'm definitely like
no but I recommend that if you're if
you're interested in cars then there the
car fiction for the love of cars podcast
is a brilliant place to go and that is
where in fact I'm gonna be trying to
record one for this sadly the last
week's episode was that was a brilliant
one with some conversation about tits
and other birds of course okay thank you
for that I'm assuming you've got other
videos instead of coming up you just
been out you just got someone on the DBS
yes there's a great one coming out on
the by the time that you are listening
or watching to this the BMW i8 roadster
which are Henry cachepot was out driving
which is as you are aware we've driven
the coupe a version together on earth on
a trip is a BMW supercar hybrids that is
great and it looks amazing as a roadster
which is a great feature on there and
there's a yeah fare a few other things
are there but that would be probably the
one I'd recommend to check out cool and
then I mean I'm next week I will be
heading off to Gamescom the European
gaming conference to find out what's
going on there and actually I mean III
is the big deal
so we kind of keeping our keeping our
ear to the ground for some of the more
exciting launches against come so do you
keep your eye on that and following that
then will there will be a fir which
should be an exciting time for tech
launches and then the end of September
we'll be doing Paris Motor Show so
plenty also known as the beginning of
October beginning of October well the
end of September is the Vino time
we're literally going in October I was
there I thought we went okay go
rocktober first I need an assistant to
sort out my schedules yes so keep your
eyes on CNET for that you can email a
podcast with seen at UK podcast at CBS i
com you can follow me on Twitter and
Instagram with at battery HQ and it can
be the thing we've Drew with at Drew
Stern sternness belt ste a are you've
learned yeah it's it's in people if you
had to guess it no one would guess it
right it's a weird spelling that's
probably how I'd spell it yeah but
that's because you've known me for like
ten years yes my name is that is part of
it
thanks very much true and we will
hopefully be back with episode in two
weeks time but which will probably be
our pre e first show or briefer pre
first show which I won't be here for but
hopefully I can hand the reins over to
rich and Katie who will be able to take
you through everything you need to know
about the upcoming tech show and an
Andrew I think it's time to end so thank
you so much for joining us and we will
see you all next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
