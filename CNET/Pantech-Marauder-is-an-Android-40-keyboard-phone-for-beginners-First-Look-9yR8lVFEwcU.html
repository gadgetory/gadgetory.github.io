bringing you guys the pantech Marauder
from Verizon the Marauder is an Android
4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich handset that has
a 3.8 inch touchscreen a 5 megapixel
rear facing camera and a VGA
front-facing camera it's powered by a
1.2 gigahertz dual-core processor and a
1.6 a ampere-hour battery which roughly
translates to eight hours of reported
talktime in addition it runs on
Verizon's 4G LTE network now the phone
is aimed at first-time smartphone users
it has two UI options one is called
starter mode designed for beginners it
gives you four homescreen pages a more
streamlined design and a simplified app
drawer when you start getting the hang
of the phone or you're already familiar
with Android you can graduate to
standard mode which gives you five
homescreen pages mix all your apps
readily available and it includes more
options with its lockscreen the phone
also has a five row sliding keyboard
while I like the generous size of each
key the buttons are fairly flushed with
the surface of the phone which may make
it hard for some people to type the
device is also heavy it weighs a
whopping six point oh seven ounces or
more than a third of a pound if you're
interested the phone was initially going
for fifty dollars after you sign a
two-year contract and send in a mail-in
rebate however with online and promo
discounts we've seen it being offered
for free from Verizon again I'm Lin for
CNET bringing you guys the pantech
Marauder
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
