welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
lots of good stuff this week including
Apple's rumored smart speaker but let's
start off with the latest from Apple's
recent earnings results and don't fall
asleep it's actually important
all right Apple posted a quarterly
revenue of 52 point nine billion dollars
and a net quarterly profit of 11 billion
apple sold fewer iPhones this quarter
fifty point eight million compared to 51
point two million units a year earlier
but iPhone revenue bumped up one percent
to thirty three point two billion from
last year because of the demand for its
pricier iPhone 7 plus you know the one
that can take pictures like this oh
that's so cute and cuddly now in fact
the iPhones overall average selling
price across all models was 655 dollars
up from six hundred and forty two
dollars a year ago so those rumors of a
starting price of one thousand dollars
for the next iPhone 8 that won't scare
Apple at all and yes we know the seven
plus with 256 gigs already costs nine
hundred and sixty nine dollars in the US
before tax it's only the fourth time
ever iPhone sales have dropped and Tim
Cook even chimed in during the earnings
call to say Apple was seeing a pause in
purchases of the iPhone that could be
attributed to earlier and much more
frequent reports about future iPhones
have you heard of a weekly show that
covers iPhone rumors almost every week
guilty as charged
now Mac unit sales rose slightly to 4.2
million compared to 4.0 3 million and
iPads continue to decline dropping the
eight point nine two million units
compared to ten point two five a year
ago that would mark the 13th quarter in
a row with declining iPad sales we call
that major shrinkage now we still
haven't heard anything about new iPads
and they're way past their normal spring
announcement which lines us up for WWDC
but we could see something entirely new
at Apple's developer conference KGI
reports Apple will likely announce an
echo like speaker with our own Siri and
it will be Apple's first home AI product
and will go on sale in the second half
of the
the report says the device will feature
excellent sound with seven tweeters and
a subwoofer will be positioned as a more
premium product than the echo which also
means a premium Apple price tag Apple
leaker Sonny Dixon added that Apple
marketed as a siri airplay device that
will carry some form of beats technology
he also says it will take design cues
from the Mac Pro and have a concave top
with controls and a mesh speaker can't
innovate any more my ass oh I had to
just throw that one in there because you
know it will look similar to a product
they haven't updated in three plus years
going on for now earlier reports from
CNET also claimed their echo like
speaker might include a built-in camera
that would make it self-aware and detect
who's in the room with facial
recognition and guess who already has a
smart speaker with a built-in camera
that's Amazon's echo look although right
now it's being used more to take
pictures of your OOTD
that's outfit of the day for the grown
up Apple by ders so if you have an echo
right now would you swap it out for an
Apple Smart speaker it will definitely
have the benefit of the ecosystem but
Apple is super controlling about its
partners it only gave a handful of
specific apps Siri integration and how
long has there been around they're just
too controlling
while Amazon opened up their platform
for everyone and now has over 10,000
skills that's not in Apple's DNA to be
like that
but we'll see how they can bring
something more compelling beyond just
being a part of the ecosystem but we all
know people are going to buy it now
merriam-webster even used Apple fanboys
to help describe a new word they just
added to the dictionary that word is
sheeple defined as people who are docile
compliant or easily influenced people
likened to sheep now goes on to use a
sentence as an example of how to use the
word apples debuted a battery case for
the juice sucking iPhone an ungainly
lumpy case that sheeple will happily
shell out $99 for really merriam-webster
now that's a bad apple
I'm sorry really I couldn't help myself
there you know bad get it all right if
you want a chance to sit down with Apple
CEO Tim Cook charity buzz is back at it
again this time it's more than coffee
it's a lunch meeting with Tim Cook
inside Apple's brand-new Park now the
auction has already reached its
estimated value of $100,000 but past
auctions with cook hit as high as six
hundred and ten thousand in 2013 or as
low as two hundred thousand in 2015 see
somebody overpaid in 2013 the auction
lasts until May 16th now you also all
know how much I love my iPad pro so
let's check out my app of the week and
this week it's Marvel's color your own
for the iPhone and iPad now if you're a
fan of adult coloring books like this
and not the dirty ones and you love
comics you're going to love this there
are a few pages that you can color for
free from classic comics but if you want
to get access to the entire collection
of content it's a subscription service
now I get it Marvel can't just give us
everything but a subscription service
for $39.99 a year and that's 58 percent
off alright I'll just start off with the
free ones in I wanted to share a few of
them with you here so here's my Doctor
Strange I like to bring out the detail
in his face in this one and then here's
my Rey Vereen it's my take on Wolverine
but with like rave colors so you see his
claws all like you know like pink and
green is super cool Yeah right
that's horrible Aurel okay let's get to
some of your feedback and I think I
really lit a fire under the eye works
and pages community because I was
hammered on Twitter and email with
plenty of Apple byte nation that uses
pages John Towell says there are many
more than two folks out there who adore
Pages chips t95 on twitter writes I use
I work and listen to Apple byte extra
crunchy take that sad Apple away okay I
just erased it now David James then
responded to chips t95 and says I also
use pages find them there are now four
of you who use pages I'm kidding with
you all all right that's going to do it
for this week you can email us at the
Alpha byte at Cena comm or tweet me a
bryan song thanks much for watching
we'll catch y'all next time for
bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
