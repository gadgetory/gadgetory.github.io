iPhone without apples help should we be
concerned I'm Bridget Carey this is your
scene at update apples brawl with the
FBI is now on hold the FBI says it may
not need apples help to gain access to a
locked iphone used by San Bernardino
shooter Syed Farook Apple and the FBI
were scheduled to attend a court hearing
Tuesday regarding the matter but it has
been called off in a strange last-minute
twist the US Department of Justice asked
to cancel the hearing because an outside
party advised the FBI that there may be
a way to hack into the iphone without
getting Apple involved and now the cord
is allowing the FBI some time to try out
this method and it will need to give a
status report in two weeks on april
fifth if the hack did not work the
hearings likely going to be rescheduled
this heated battle comes down to one
core concept can the government order a
company to build software to break the
security of its own product in order to
help with an investigation Apple has
been outspoken in its refusal to create
such a software just the other day Apple
CEO Tim Cook address the matter again
before the unveiling of the new iPhone
se in the iPad pro we did not expect to
be in this position at odds with our own
government but we believe strongly that
we have a responsibility to help you
protect your data and protect your
privacy we owe it to our customers and
we owe it to our country during a
conference call with reporters on Monday
evening Apple attorney said the FBI has
not told Apple how its trying to hack
into the iphone so Apple is still not at
a great situation if there is a way to
break into an iPhone will the FBI ever
tell Apple so the flaw can be patched
well don't count on it other security
agencies use flaws to their advantage
for surveillance but who is to say a
hacker can't take advantage of the same
trick when the government wants to
exploit hacks we should be asking what
is it doing to also guard the security
of its citizens
now before I end there is an important
alert for anyone who owns a Kindle
e-reader after Tuesday candles that are
not updated to the latest software
update over Wi-Fi will lose the ability
to connect to the internet now this is
for Kendall's made from 2012 and earlier
but if you're locked out and you didn't
upgrade all is not lost you can manually
download and install the update yourself
by connecting the Kindle to the computer
that does it for this tech news roundup
