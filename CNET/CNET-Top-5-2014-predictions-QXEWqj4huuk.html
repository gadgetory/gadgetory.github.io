maybe it's just me but 2014 sounds like
a very futuristic year full of lasers
and robots and flying cars so with that
in mind today I'm counting down my list
of 2014 tech predictions starting off at
number five more Google products I
figure they didn't build a giant barge
in San Francisco just to show off Google
glass and a few Chromebooks it got off
to a bad start with the nexus q let's
they redeem themselves when that
chromecast became a mega-hit i don't
think they're going to stop now while
Apple is sitting back and playing it
safe expect to see the real unique
products coming from the google
mothership ID number for a smart
appliance boom now here's a trend that
trickled in 2013 but is expected to go
mainstream any day now hand in hand with
this idea of the Internet of Things our
smart phones and smart TVs are expanding
out to include the smart thermostat and
the smart smoke detector smart power
strips just smart and all the stuff we
even have a whole new division here at
cnet reviews just handling appliances
now to keep up with all the innovation
coming in at number 3 more doom and
gloom for the PC market you think about
all the trouble Microsoft went to in
2013 launching windows 8 and working
with dozens of vendors to create
competitive interesting laptops and
all-in-one computers and yet the pc
market couldn't pull out of his nose
dive unless microsoft has windows 9 up
its sleeve there are no cards left to
play and the best the pc industry can
hope for in 2014 is to just hit bottom
at number two bigger phones yes even
bigger phones you may have thought or
wished that the 6-inch Nokia Lumia 1520
was the extreme end of this phablet
ification of cell phones but there is no
sign of it stopping yet this is also a
year for a major refresh of the iphone
so I suspect even Apple will bump up the
screen size just to fit in finally my
number one prediction for 2014 4 k goes
mainstream now the first run of 4k
resolution televisions came out the
here to the delight of practically no
one because for the most part they were
too expensive the content wasn't there
and telling the difference between 1080p
and 4k was nearly impossible but just
like 3d TV the fact that we don't really
want it doesn't really matter 4k is
going to come built into your next TV
whether you like it or not in 2014 the
4k prices will come down and the hype is
going to go through the roof so there
you go those are my best predictions for
the tech trends that will define 2014
now for a look back at the most
important products and trends that
define 2013 check out the scene at 100
