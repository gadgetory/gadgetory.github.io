what Facebook knows about you or more
like what it thinks it knows about you
but you can take some action right now
to limit what is being shared to outside
groups and control how this company
labels you to advertisers I've been on
Facebook since 2005 so it has a ton of
data on me and I think I'm pretty good
about privacy but that's still 13 years
worth of friends and photos and comments
and likes and pokes so let's dive into
my settings here and see what they have
on me you should do this too
go into Facebook settings up in the top
right click the arrow now click settings
now go on over to the left to the ads
section this whole area is where
Facebook lists all the labels it puts on
you for advertisers and there's a lot
here let's start by going over to your
information and click on over to your
categories all right so facebook says
i'm a new parent of a toddler okay
birthday in June and they've labeled me
politically and oh here I guess my
multicultural affinity is
african-american maybe because of who I
interact with or who my friends are
the other details here are so weird it
tracks how much you travel it can't even
get specific to how long ago you
traveled I can tell you not everything
here is correct and it's bizarre to read
this
okay let's scroll back up to the heart
under your interest there's even more
surprises in here you can poke around
here under sports I have no idea why it
thinks I'm into the Toronto Maple
keep clicking around let's see there's a
category for people okay I don't know
why it thinks I like David Schwimmer
I mean who likes Ross and I wasn't even
that into France and why what is Tom
from MySpace here okay here come more
little X's no no and no this is layers
of crazy but it matters because
Facebook's algorithms use these labels
to decide what you see in your feed
it's a sad truth but we're living in a
time where our information could be
misused to manipulate us and these
labels can shape your worldview and what
information is served up for you here's
another area that can cause trouble the
apps that connect with your Facebook
profile you're gonna find this list in
settings under apps okay this is
embarrassing I have a hundred and thirty
apps I need to clean this up because I
don't even need all these apps tapping
into my profile I don't even remember
you see in some of these oh boy all
right you can edit how much info each
app can access or just click X to remove
access completely
remove and delete all activities thank
you but it doesn't end there
my friends apps can even share
information about me just check out this
setting below on the same page it's
called apps others use click edit to
open here you can see what info about
you is being shared to the apps your
friends use no I ain't having none of
that so I made sure I uncheck everything
in this list and if you want to go all
the way on the privacy train ride you're
gonna need to stop using Facebook to
sign into websites go to this section
above called apps websites and plugins
and be sure to turn the platform off
disabled well I don't know about you but
this was eye-opening the bottom line is
if you don't want to delete Facebook
just be smarter with what you share this
is your information protect yourself
online because you can't trust a company
to do it for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
