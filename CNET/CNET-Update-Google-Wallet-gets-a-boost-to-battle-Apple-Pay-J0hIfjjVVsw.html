expanding I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update Google Wallet is
getting a boost with a new partnership
Google announced its mobile payment app
will be pre-installed on Android phones
sold by all four major u.s. wireless
carriers Google Wallet has been out
since 2011 but limitations hindered its
success Sprint has been the only carrier
to officially support Google Wallet for
mobile payments other wireless carriers
teamed up against Google to support
another payment system called soft card
but guess what that also didn't catch on
with consumers Google announced that it
acquired soft card technology and this
partnership means Google Wallet will get
more love and exposure from Verizon AT&amp;amp;T
and t-mobile by expanding wallet google
has a better chance to compete with
Apple pay and Samsung is also throwing
its hat into the ring last week
Samsung acquired Luke pay to be
integrated into its own payment offering
we may learn more about Samsung's mobile
payment plans next week at the Mobile
World Congress trade show taking place
in Barcelona Spain the Samsung Galaxy s6
will be unveiled on Sunday and t-mobile
is giving folks and early promotional
tees with this image and the corny
phrase six appeal well as you can see
from the image the screen on the galaxy
s6 will wrap over the side just like the
Galaxy Note edge Samsung also has a
teaser video for the s6 then hence the
phone has a curved metal design Galaxy S
models are known for having plastic
casing but these days the competition is
all about the metal but before we see
Samsung's latest design HTC is going to
first show off its new flagship Android
one phone on Sunday most likely called
the one m9 there are reports that HTC
may reveal two phones this render comes
from Evan Blass a leaker with a
reputation for being right as for LG the
company isn't even waiting for Mobile
World Congress to start LG just
announced four new mid-range smartphones
the magnus spirit leon and joy the
magnet and the spirit are the better of
the four and they're going to have
slightly curved screens and round
Bax and they're gonna have android 5.0
lollipop installed each of these budget
phones includes some of LG's new
software tricks like gesture shot that's
when you start a selfie photo timer just
by making a fist in front of the camera
expect smartwatches and wearables to be
another big part of the mobile showcase
LG will have on display the new LG watch
urbane it's a circular SmartWatch and a
metal body with leather straps
it'll be battling Apple watch when it
comes to a high-end fashion an HTC may
also show off its first SmartWatch

both iOS and Android phones
