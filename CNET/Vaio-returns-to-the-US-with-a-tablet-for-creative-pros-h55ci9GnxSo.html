computer brand the vaio is back and here
it is a 12 point 3 inch tablet designed
to compete with Microsoft Surface pro
and the iPad pro from Apple i'm sean
hollister with cnet now i'm going to
show you what it looks like right
instead of trying to bring a value
centric computer to market what you have
here is a tablet designed for content
creators one that tries to cram the full
power of a computer like the macbook pro
into a tablet with a detachable keyboard
stylus and infinitely adjustable
kickstand inside the durable aluminum
and impact resistant glass frame lives
of 47 wat core i7 Haswell processor up
to 16 gigabytes of memory and a terabyte
of solid-state storage and 3 fans to
cool it all down the three fans actually
are designed to cancel out the noise
from one another so that the fans don't
bother you while you work since the
keyboard doesn't actually physically
attached the tablet except with a couple
of magnets you can place the tablet on
one side of a desk and the keyboard on
the other using the stylists say in your
right hand to draw on something and the
keyboard on the left to navigate the
stylist has 1024 levels of pressure
sensitivity and vaio also claims they've
reduced the parallax gap so that when
you press down on the screen the line
you draw is far closer to where the tip
of your pen actually lands BIOS also
paid special attention to the hinge
inside this kickstand not only does the
spring-loaded mechanism resist your
stylist as you push down but you can
also lift it up with a single finger
thanks to the differing amount of
tension not only is this screen a high
resolution 2560 by 1704 display wide
viewing angles thanks to the IPS
technology it's also got a ninety-five
percent Adobe RGB color gamut the screen
also has a 32 aspect ratio like
Microsoft Surface line of computers
which vaio says is better for content
creators and photographers speaking of
those folks I think they're really going
to enjoy the array of ports on the left
side of this machine in addition to your
standard pair of USB 3.0 fourths there's
a
full-size SD card slot so you can
transfer photos right off your camera
and a pair of mini displayport and HDMI
ports that allow you to connect a pair
of 4k displays simultaneously via also
says the machine can do color matching
between the internal display of the
tablet and the external monitors the
vaio z canvas will start at 2199 you can
look for a review right here on cnet i'm
sean hollister you've been looking at
the vaio z campus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
