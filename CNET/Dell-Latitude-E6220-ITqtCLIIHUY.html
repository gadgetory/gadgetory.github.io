what you're about to see is probably not
a laptop for you
that being said we'll explain why it's
the Dell Latitude e62 20 now what would
you guess would be the price of a laptop
like this 12.5 inch screen Core i5
processor 128 gig SSD it starts at over
$1600 now wait a second what why is it
that expensive
after all you get a MacBook Air with 256
gigabyte SSD storage for $15.99 what
does this bring to the table well it
does meet some certain of milspec
standards and it is made with a try
metal chassis design even though it
looks incredibly old-school it uses
magnesium and brushed aluminum to
complete the chassis look and it's got a
sealed screen area all providing some
dust protection spill resistant keyboard
but let's get down to the truth $1600
plus is too much to pay this
configuration came in at $2,000 this is
meant for businesses though I mean it's
got V Pro TPM if you don't know what
those are then you don't need them
they're meant for people with IT
departments and they're meant for
encrypted security features and the
average user is not going to use those
even small businesses are not going to
use those features and when you nickel
and dimed all the extra features on this
Dell Latitude it can climb basically as
high as you want to pay from Gobi
Wireless to WiMAX to any other bells and
whistles you want to pack on to this
performance wise this really just
matches your average mid-range core i5
laptop in fact the HPD m4 with beats
that we just reviewed performed about as
fast
now for a 12.5 inch screen laptop that's
pretty good however we've got ultrabooks
everywhere thin laptops that are pretty
fast and perform well and come in around
$1000 and hey a lot of businesses are
accepting those as your laptop in fact
MacBook Airs are becoming a business
favorite so why go with this we can't
really say why unless you really like
the idea of a thicker laptop that's
maybe a little bit more rugged and you
got a lot of money to pay
i'm scott stein and as they look at the
dell
latitude e62 20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
