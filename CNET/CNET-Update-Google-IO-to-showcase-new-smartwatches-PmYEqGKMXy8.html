news I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update this will be a big week for
Google News the google i/o developers
conference kicks off wednesday morning
in San Francisco and Google is expected
to show off new software and some new
gadgets smartwatches will be a big focus
of the presentation Cena has learned
that Samsung is going to show off its
first android wear SmartWatch Android
wear is the operating system that google
made especially for small wearable
screens motorola and LG are both coming
out with smart watches that use Android
wear and both of those models could also
be shown off at the conference and
speaking of wearable tech you can bet
we'll hear more about google glass and
when a more affordable version will be
available for consumers the headgear
accessory is now available to buy
outside of the US for the first time but
it's still in its early Explorer phase
so the price remains high it's 1,000
pounds in the UK and 1800 australian
dollars if you want to buy the prototype
in the u.s. it'll cost you fifteen
hundred dollars plus tax and if you want
to give your glass more style designer
frames are now available from Diane von
Furstenberg there are five frames to
choose from with eight shades frames
cost 225 dollars with sunglass shades an
extra one hundred and twenty dollars but
in every design there's no hiding the
fact that you still have a camera and
screen attached to the side of your face
so if you're going to be a geek at least
you can be a chic geek along with
wearable gadgets expect health to be
another hot topic it should come as no
surprise everyone's talking about health
tracking these days forbes reports that
Google will launch some sort of
comprehensive health data app called
google fit it will collect data from all
sorts of popular fitness tracking
devices and apps and this would compete
against apple's health kit this is a new
app that will be in iOS 8 later this
year and it's also going to be a hub
that pulls in your health data from
different devices and there's another
aspect of
Google that's growing fast but we may
not hear much about it on Wednesday
google now owns Dropcam it's the
do-it-yourself home security
web-connected camera the purchase was
done by nest that's a company Google
bought earlier this year nest makes the
smart home thermostat and protect smoke
detector nest labs spend five hundred
and fifty five million dollars to bring
Dropcam into the family and that gives
google a new edge in the smart home
that's your tech news update you can

our studios in New York I'm Bridget
