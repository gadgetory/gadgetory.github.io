google issues for everything google you
can think of Google's flagship pixel
phone has continued to exceed
expectations and even made up seven and
a half percent of activations on verizon
last month but it really needs to strike
deals with other carriers so it's
perceived as more than just a verizon
phone even if it works with all the
other carriers now according to Morgan
Stanley the pixel is on track to sell
three million phones this year with two
billion dollars in revenue and 526
million more in 2017 with a revenue of
roughly 3.8 billion great overall
reviews the Samsung Note 7s debacle and
a 30 million dollar per week advertising
budget are also probably helping you
know a little bit as well now pixel
phone owners would like to play nice
with their iPhone friends but it appears
there's an image bug with screen shots
only sent from an iphone 7 plus to a
pixel or pixel XL via SMS MMS or
hangouts now you can see an example of
this distortion Google staff is aware of
the issue but no word on a software fix
just yet and since we're talking about
software the consumer release of Android
new get seven point one point one is
scheduled to roll out on December the
sixth this software update will bring
the same software with all of nougats
bells and whistles on pixel phones to
the Nexus 5x 6p pixel see and Nexus 9
that will be around six hundred fifty
megabytes and will release alongside of
a December security update also one of
the standout features from the pixel is
the artificial intelligence they've
started to build on the phone now two
recent postings are showing us how far
google has come and really where they
are going now with google translate they
have built a new system called google
neural machine translation or gmt for
short that allows you to translate
between different languages it has never
learned now it takes millions of
examples that are plugged into the
system and can then translate to
languages it has never been taught and
you know what that's pretty sweet
especially for travel but another report
from New Scientist reveals that google's
deepmind project can lip-read TV shows
better than a pro in partnership with
Oxford University the system was trained
using over five
thousand hours of video from six
different BBC TV programs now by only
looking at a speaker's lips the system
accurately identified entire phrases
like this one we have to look at whether
it works for the UK or not yeah that's
exactly what I thought she said now
compared to a professional lip reader
the pro annotated just 12 point four
percent of words without any errors and
then you can see where this is going the
AI annotated forty six point eight
percent of all words correctly are you
afraid yet like just wait until those
robots from the future can start
understanding us by reading our lips and
here's a great example that we as humans
have a long way to go I say kick a big
key I mean there's a snake over there as
you snake over there and you know I
don't know if it did a guy but I don't
want to be that close to me I got a
squirt got a squirt I got a squirt gonna
squirt go to squirt you should be out
there playing accordion like I said we
have a long ways and just in time for
the holiday season google search and
maps are getting real-time feedback with
how busy a location is that you want to
go to they added the popular x feature
last year but now you'll be able to see
a real time readout of how busy it is at
the moment and you can see how long
people stay at that location on average
plus business hours are now available as
well that's helpful because it
constantly is changing during this time
of the year and all these tweaks just
make our lives a little easier and you
know what that's a good goal alright
that's going to do it for this week you
can email me at Google issues at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong thanks so
much for watching we'll catch y'all next
time for some more of that Google
licious
