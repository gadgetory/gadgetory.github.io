a phone that turns into a tablet we're
running into a real problem as a society
we want phones with really big screens
however our pockets aren't getting any
larger that might not be a problem in
the future according to the Korea Herald
Samsung is working on a phone with a
flexible display that folds open into a
7-inch tablet the report goes on to say
the flexible phone / tablet combo would
ship more than 10 thousand units in the
third quarter of 2017 so what are the
odds of this report being true I'd say
pretty good and here's why Samsung
demonstrated a flexible high-resolution
display way back at CES 2013 that's also
where they showed up the edge concept
that was adopted by the Galaxy Note and
the Galaxy S series on top of that
Samsung demoed a television that could
go from flat to curved that product
never made it to market then there's a
Samsung concept video from 2013 in it a
tablet is folded in half to become a
more pocketable phone this video
probably gives us the best idea of how
sampson would design such a device
additionally an executive from samsung
Display said the company would launch a
flexible display for smartphones that
could be folded in half that statement
dates back to 2014 as well a Bloomberg
report from June of last year said
Samsung could unveil a flexible phone /
tablet hybrid as early as February 2017
which would line up real nicely with the
biggest mobile show in the world
Mobile World Congress so what I'm saying
is Samsung is definitely working on the
technology that timing is still
something to be worked out for more
