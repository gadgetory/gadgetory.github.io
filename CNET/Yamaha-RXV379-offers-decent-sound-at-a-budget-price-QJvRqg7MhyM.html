inexpensive receiver meant you are
buying a box of loose bolts with no
features that could actually break your
speakers then hopefully this Yamaha
receiver can help change your mind at
280 dollars Street the Yamaha rxv 379
isn't cheap but it's at the low end of
the scale and offers a lot of usable
features for the price first of all
there's Bluetooth so you can listen to
the music on your phone and then there's
compatibility with the next TV standards
including 4k support with encryption
technology hdcp 2.2 while this is not as
much of an issue right now it will offer
some degree of future proofing this is a
5.1 channel receiver which offers most
surround standards including Dolby true
HD and DTS master audio it also has 4
HDMI inputs with 4k pass-through the
design is fairly minimalist but I do
love that instead of the terrible input
selection knob or the Wheel of Fortune
you might call it because you don't know
what you're going to get next it does
have dedicated shortcuts on the front
sound quality is where this receiver is
at and with a decent set of home cinema
speakers you can get cinema like sound
in your home music quality is also
surprisingly good even with bluetooth
for most home set ups a $300 receiver is
probably all you'll need and for the
money the Yamaha rxv it's 379 others
pretty much all that you'll need
especially if you have an Apple TV or
other streaming box in your system
