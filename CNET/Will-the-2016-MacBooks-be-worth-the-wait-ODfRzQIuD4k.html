macbooks coming in 2016 so far we expect
a major refresh with the Intel
processors they're more powerful than
more efficient and just to give you an
idea intel skylake brings you ten to
twenty percent better cpu performance
then you're talking about 50% gains in
gaming and thirty percent better battery
life so whatever you guys do do not buy
a macbook right now wait for skylight
it's worth it now the macbook the
macbook air and the retina MacBook Pros
they haven't been refreshed in about a
year so really they are primed for an
update now didja times has reported that
a 12-inch MacBook and the 13-inch
MacBook Pro might be coming sometime in
March at Apple's rumored announcement
but then also a new retina macbook
15-inch could be seen as early as WWDC
in June now I think it's still a little
early to say these are coming in March
until skylake processor list just came
out so if you add that all up really
give it three to four months in June
WWDC is really when they expect the CD
single come out alright here's another
rumor according to the economic daily
news the macbook air line will come with
a 13-inch model and a 15-inch model
they'll be redesigned with all new
internal components again this is a
rumor but it's what we've heard so
here's the takeaways expect the macbooks
to get a big boost in performance thanks
to Sky lake then also we really haven't
seen a new design for the macbook air or
the macbook pros and the ultra slim
macbook that real skinny one that was
really a hint of things to come again we
might see stuff in March but really it's
gonna be more like June and this is what
we know right now about the new macbooks
in 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
