already things are getting weird I'm
Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
here at the 2016 International Consumer
Electronic Show the press is getting
some early peeks at products and news
before the show floor opens at the Las
Vegas Convention Center companies are
still putting the finishing touches on
their boots here you see Intel's booth
with these massive glowing body statues
all around it appears there's a big
focus around health tech and how gadgets
can better you as a human being it's a
trend racine repeated by a few companies
this year and yes that means more things
you can strap to your body garmin
unveiled a pair of smart glasses called
the Vera vision it's similar to Google
glass but it's for bikers it clips onto
your existing sunglasses and a color
screen hangs over your right eye to show
you performance data and turn-by-turn
directions it ships in march and costs
four hundred dollars the garmin heads
that does make sense for bicyclists but
not only tech T's so far seems as useful
Samsung's Korean flickr account
published images of some large
appliances debuting and there's a four
door fridge with a giant touchscreen
taking up an entire door it's called a
family hub refrigerator CES can feel
like a car show with concepts like this
and actually CES is becoming more of an
actual car show a California company
called Faraday future showed off a
radical concept electric vehicle called
the FF 0 1 it looks like some sort of
battery-powered Batmobile it's a 1000
horsepower all-wheel drive hyper car and
one driver sits snug in the center of
this cockpit you slide your smartphone
into a slot on the steering wheel so the
car can configure to your settings oh
and did I mention it's a self-driving
car that can also self drive on a
racetrack but let's go back to tech for
the home if you need help in the kitchen
you can cook with the smarty pants for
three hundred dollars you tell the app
what ingredients you're throwing in the
pan and then sensors calculate the
calories and other nutritional data and
it records the time temperature and
weight of your ingredients so it can
create a recipe that you
share it won't help your food taste
better so that part is still up to you
but if your leg could use some better
smells there's the sensor wink it's an
alarm clock that wakes you by diffusing
15 different scents like coffee mint or
the smell of money now I hope you also
like the smell of spending money because
it costs around a hundred dollars and
the scent pods are five dollars each and
each last one month not your tech news
update so stay tuned all week long for a
continuing CES coverage coming to you
from the cnet stage at the Las Vegas
Convention Center I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
