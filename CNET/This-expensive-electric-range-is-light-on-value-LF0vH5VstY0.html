at appliance it's here looking at
another range this time Kenmore's elite
electric model four one three one three
so starting out I really like the look
of this range it has sleek stainless
steel sort of slide and look although it
is a free-standing model I like that it
has burner knobs instead of a larger
display because sometimes that makes it
more difficult to navigate when you have
a bunch of different buttons this model
also comes with a 4.6 cubic foot
capacity oven and a thermometer probe so
you can cook meat to temperature
performance is pretty good too for the
most part especially the large burner
boil test that's a 5 quart pot of water
so not a massive stockpot like you'd use
for pasta but still pretty big and it
took in the 9 minute range that's really
good and it came in second to the
Samsung induction model we tested that
got less than eight minutes so induction
is known for having a really speedy boil
so the fact that this one got just a
little bit worse than that is a really
really great score on the other hand it
didn't do all that well with the small
burner 3 quart pot boil test and
actually got second to last in this test
taking significantly longer than most of
the electric models we've tested moving
down to the oven it did really well on
the broil test it got in the 14 minute
range which is really great second to
best out of all the electric models we
tested but it does have a small oven a
lot of the models we've tested have at
least a 5 cubic foot capacity oven and
this one at 4.6 would really limit
having say three racks cooking at the
same time it's also 2,600 bucks which
isn't cheap for a range we've seen
models ranging from around 400 up to
3500 for the more premium induction
models so this one is definitely
definitely a high-end range so sum it
all up this model has good performance
good design features and usability but
it's really really expensive and I think
you can find something for Less that
does roughly the same thing thanks for
watching this review of ken wars elite
electric range model number four one
