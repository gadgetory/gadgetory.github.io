broad-shouldered look to it then they
bring on this next generation and it's
like steroidal everything's gotten more
in every direction
visually though it's basically the same
size car nothing short of a rolls-royce
looks bigger on the road this is an SRT
8 that means a big v8 motor handling
package big foots and as much Detroit as
you can put on four wheels you've got
this very glitzy kind of big massive
rolling kind of design in here come of
this patek philippe gage layout with a
nicely done color helper screen but
that's really at odds to my eye with the
playschool Garmin navigation system now
this is the biggest screen in the
business right now with the exception of
some really high end cars 8.4 inch LCD I
absolutely love the touch response this
is one of the Great's in terms of crisp
throttle response on the screen look at
that and that same clarity mostly goes
for things like climate control nice big
buttons pretty easy to figure out
without the manual then there's player
and radio they break up media under
those two tabs player means anything
that isn't radio so you go to the source
button here and you've got of course
your optical disk SD card not real
popular USB that'll take thumb drives or
iPod iPhone auxilary of course is your
failsafe backup and bluetooth streaming
under radio standard stuff am/fm
satellite radio no HD radio here Sirius
brings in your traffic and weather
information which brings us to this
screen here's our Sirius travel link
which has all those features so you've
got a fairly rich telematics system here
without having a full live Google search
which the best cars in the business have
right now but this is one teardown if
you will how did you notice this SRT
performance you can turn on various sets
of virtual gauges that are reading off
the OBD port that all cars have but few
cars surface now on the phone screen of
course Bluetooth hands-free and
phonebook download and all that notice
that you've got a static fixed set of
functions down here kind of like your
taskbar in Windows but that's good
layout of information I kind of always
know where to look for my functions
they're basically always here most of
the time Oh check it out just got a text
message I can read that if I'm not
moving
or since it's a car it probably will be
I could have it read to me hey can you
spot me five keys on credit dog and I
can reply with some canned messages now
the gearbox is a little bit antiquated
5-speed automatic you've got a slap gate
back here for down shifts and up shifts
or you go to the cast aluminum paddles
which though they're mounted on the
wheel at least they're dedicated one for
downshift one for up shifts all right
below those are these weird little
Chrysler little rocker switches on the
back of the wheel they're totally hidden
but there's a bump in the middle of each
one that lets you change selection this
one on the right is up-and-down for
volume the one on the left is
up-and-down for track or selection I
don't think you ever need to take your
hands off this wheel address United
States 235 second Street San Francisco
California did you say to one
would you like to begin that yes that's
damn impressive I rattled off the street
address without saying individual digits
gave it city gave it state it parsed it
all out and did it with no errors it's
not always perfect but it's one of the
best I've ever seen
now of course a big part of the srt8
story is the eighth and that lives in
here this big bastard a six point four
liter aluminum v8 it doesn't the old
fashioned way no turbo no blower it's
just big 390 cubic inches what they
really ought to call it that just sounds
bigger to me four hundred and seventy
horse 470 foot-pounds of torque
gets this big guy up to 60 in about 4.9
to be a little bit faster
the downside is you're gonna get 14 23
mpg and that's on a good day when you're
not paying attention to the pedal on the
right get into it more and who knows in
fact this guy gets hit with $1,000 gas
guzzler tax which I almost never see
anymore let's go see if it's worth
this placement normally aspirated engine
has to do well is half power ready all
the time there's absolutely no excuse
especially at this price of like 48,000
and this mpg of on you wanna look
average seven point one this is a car
that has to deliver power all the time
or the point is missed and this one does
whether you're in stop-and-go whether
you're getting on a freeway whether
you're hammering it wide open and want
to go that much faster the power is
always there the ride quality is firm
all the time even when I'm not in sport
mode it's got a ride that is definitely
telling you you're riding in a big car
with super low-profile tires and a lot
of weight on the hoof and of course in a
lot of other cars you'd hear me grouse
about this being a five-speed Automatic
missing one two three even four gears
compared to other cars today but with
this kind of cubic inches it doesn't
matter it just overcomes whatever gear
you're in the srt8 is a fifty thousand
dollar 300 before you add the dubious
$2,000 speakers or blind spot and
adaptive cruise tech that seems to gild
the lily on a car like this instead buy
it for what it is a really fast
steamroller with a downtown style all
its own</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
