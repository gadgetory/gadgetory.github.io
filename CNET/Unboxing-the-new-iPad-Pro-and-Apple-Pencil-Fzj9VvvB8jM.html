bezels it's the new iPad pro and I'm
here to unbox it I don't just have the
new iPad pro though I also have a bunch
of the new accessories so here's the
iPad pro 12 point 9 inch also I have the
new smart Keyboard folio I also have the
new pencil and I even have a dongle the
USB C digital AV multi port adapter
because you're gonna need dongles let's
take a look at these and unbox them
one-by-one let's start of course with
the iPad pro now the iPad pro comes in
11 inch and 12 point 9 inch versions
this year the 11 inch is the same size
as a 10.5 last year the 12 point 9 is
smaller than last year's 12 point 9 it
comes in silver and Space Gray I have
the Space Gray it starts at 999 which is
a bunch for 64 but no my model cost
significantly more this is the one
terabyte version with cellular which
comes to 1899 that is an awfully
expensive iPad let's see what's inside
the box so similar packaging to before
and that's the iPad it just kind of
feels like a slab sitting on top wrapped
up it no longer has chamfered side so
it's almost like one piece of a macbook
pro it has a flat rectangular feel
all right well there is the iPad pro it
feels pretty light when you hold it it's
it's actually kind of one handable here
and you can see the new magnetic
connector on the side there is a camera
bump on this iPad nearly as good as we
find on the iPhone 10 are but we'll see
when we test it volume buttons on the
side power button on the top no home
button that's because there's face ID
right here if you turn on you can see
once it fully lights up but there's no
notch on this the face ID camera fully
fits into the bezel on the side
it's an LCD screen this must be similar
display technology to what's in the
iPhone 10 R let's put that aside while
it starts up inside here you know the
design by Apple in California
information which we couldn't go through
in a second I don't think they're gonna
be surprises here fine print some
information just use a similar gesture
language to the iPhone 10 now here's
something new the charger is different
that's because the iPad pro now uses USB
C so instead of lightning what you have
here is a USBC cable USB C ends on both
sides so
there's that should also work with other
USB accessories that you have and this
is a USB C charge brick not lightning so
it should charge faster I'll have to see
how it works it's definitely a different
design than has ever come with any iOS
device so there it is a little wider
than the 5 watt though it might be a bit
of a plug outlet Devourer if you want
something that fits more compactly let's
put that over there
let's take a look at the iPad pro which
is ready to go into general set up we're
not gonna take you through the whole
installation right now but you can just
see that there's no more notch it really
has a it really perfectly framed then
bezel around the sides you probably will
have no idea where face ID is it's up
here face it he also works both in
landscape and portrait now so we're
gonna do a lot of testing with that but
really feels like something like like a
detached part of a macbook pro like the
like the top part of it so let's put all
this aside and let's take a look at some
of the accessories iPad over here and
let's Reeboks
part of the boxing on the iPad pro
now the pencil you're probably pretty
curious about pencil is new this time so
if you have a previous pencil you cannot
use it on the new iPad pro this is
inductive charging magnetic it attaches
to the side of the iPad there's no
jutting out of the iPad anymore and it
doesn't use usb see this cost 129 so
it's more expensive than the previous
pencils let's check it out I have my
handy blade that I'll use to cut up in
the sealed packaging let's
all right take the plastic off of this
there we go
and let's check out the new pencil you
can use the older tips from previous
pencils so that's good news if you have
a couple of those lying around here's
the pencil nestled inside also wrapped
in plastic that's a little bit smaller
than the previous pencil also notably it
has one flat side which means it's not
going to be as easy to roll off a table
that's also where it attaches to the
iPad
there is also capacitive touch on the
bottom part so you could to tap touch
and set up certain actions when you use
the iPad pro if you want to see how it
attaches let's try this out it attaches
to one part of the iPad not that one not
that one there so just magnetically
snaps on stays there feels pretty solid
also inside the box let's see what else
comes in here previously there they
included some some spare tips do they
still include a spare tip I don't see
one unless it's hiding inside this
documentation tells ya I do unscrew the
tip well that's what you get with Apple
pencil so what's nice is that you don't
have to worry about losing the cap this
time it's all self-contained but it is
annoying they have to get a new one I
really wish that they had found some way
to have the to work with all the models
all right
so let's put that over here and let's
move on to the smart Keyboard folio now
apples had its own attachable keyboards
using its smart magnetic connector on
the back the keyboard folio is much more
like what Blodgett tech makes and other
companies there's many more lap friendly
it doesn't have a trackpad though unlike
what you can get on the surface or where
you can get on pixel slate so it's a
little disappointing also the price is
high this is $1.99 for this keyboard now
I mean keyboard cases do get expensive
for the iPad but this is a step higher
in price than what Apple's previous
smart keyboard was however this also
offers back protection so it's a lot
more like what Logitech is offered in
the past with its folio cases there are
two different angles magnetically so
let's let's check this out
take off the plastic wrap by the way the
version of this for the 11 inch is a
little less expensive that over there
and let's open this up
this is studded with magnets so
according to Apple this should attach
very seamlessly to the iPad lock into
place feel like it'll it'll stay there
move around too much but it might move
if you keep jostling the iPad let's take
off the plastic this has like a a soft
rubberized feel to it this has a little
divider in here which probably also has
the the guide on what to do there's no
need to charge this again this charges
up via the smart connector on the back
of the iPad pro let's move this off to
the side and take a look at this and
start start assembling our iPad pro
accessory package here so you open this
up it's pretty basic so just opens up
flat that's it it has a bit of an
origami folding thing here to help it
get to the right angle if you put the
iPad into it and see how that feels
well iPad upside down so nothing
happened but if you get the right way
yeah just magnetically just snapped into
place
that felt pretty satisfying and if you
want to attach it you have to detach
here and have that move into that
setting or that setting
turning it around if you want to attach
your pencil ups right on top all
self-contained
if you want to fold it back up again you
do that pencil stays on the outside so
make sure you just don't knock it loose
against anything camera fits right in
there kind of like a iPhone case design
it feels very solid very clean so that's
the that's the keyboard folio which is
200 with the Apple pencil which is 129
with the high-end head pro which is 1899
does a chunk of change for a for a
high-end iPad but there's more I said
there's a dongle so let's unbox that
dongle dongle unboxing this will happen
to you too if you get one of these
because the USB C port which by the way
is over here does work with a variety of
accessories not with storage though SD
card reader yes it will be able to
charge things maybe your Nintendo switch
and your iPhone if you have the right
cord and it will also work to export
video to displays but mirrored so kind
of like what the iPad did before but if
you want to split it and have it work
with other USB cables you're gonna need
a dongle Apple's USB C digital AV multi
port adapter is $70 so that's a lot that
has HDMI USB and another USB see if your
a macbook owner you are familiar with
dongles like these so at least maybe you
could use your collective dongles in
your dongle collection how many times
can i say dongle in one unboxing video
so here it is this is not new but I just
have it so let's unbox it and just know
your head before if you've had the
Lightning connected one there have been
also similar types of dongles so you're
just gonna have to get a new one with
USB C USB C there are the ports let's
move this off to the side and then
you're gonna plug that in there not the
most elegant solution but when you need
it I guess you've got it
so that's the iPad pro unboxed now it's
time to use it and have fun with it and
keep in mind the iPad pro is launching
alongside new Macs and so the iPad is
still a product that's part of the line
but not exactly dovetailing with the
rest of the Mac line is this a step up
we'll see stay tuned for the full review
I'm Scott Stein with the new iPad pro
