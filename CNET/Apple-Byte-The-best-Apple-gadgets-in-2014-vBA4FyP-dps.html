this special episode of the apple byte
as we're wrapping up right before the
holiday season now I'm lucky enough to
get a play around with a lot of tech
toys and gadgets and I don't take it for
granted but what do I actually love and
use so I figured why not share the love
with you the Apple biter so I'm doing
the Apple bites first ever these are a
few of my favorite things yeah it has a
nice ring to it doesn't it all right
well I paid for these products myself
and I asked these companies to hook you
up the loyal apple byte nation so
everything you see here is something
that you can have a chance to win at the
end of our show so let's get to it
because sing with me these are a few of
my favorite things mmm now if there was
a game I played the most in 2014 it was
threes it doesn't look like anything
special but it's one of the most clever
games that actually uses your brain and
I don't do that much now you move tiles
around and swipe them together to create
threes then build bigger numbers that
are multiples of threes to get the high
score with the ultimate goal let's go in
a big tile like a 384 or higher and
trust me everything is better in threes
oh yeah now the second thing on my list
took me by surprise it's the canoe
airframe plus I've tried so many crappy
car holders over the years that don't
work or are too cheap I saw this one at
the apple store in I decided to give it
a try now it's become my favorite car
mount I've ever had it attaches your AC
grill with a sturdy fit it can smoothly
rotate 360 degrees your phone ends up
being at the perfect eye level it fits
everything up to an iphone 6 plus and
other big screen phones and I never
thought I'd love a car mount but I
actually love this one and you know what
Mitch um maybe you can sing it this time
yeah no no here why don't you try I'll
sing it with you ready let's go the
these are a beautiful no no no no let's
do it right okay here's the music okay
so good now next up I know not all of
you have an iphone 6 yet and i'm waiting
for mophie to release the iphone 6
versions of their juice packs but these
are the best extra battery cases that
you can find on the market so we have
two super thin mophie juice pack airs
and two mophie space packs that include
an additional 32 gigs of storage on top
of being a battery pack Wow and don't
worry Santa Tong isn't done yet now I'm
traveling a hole at a whole lot between
the North Pole and our office in San
Francisco so what do I use the most my
slingbox it's connected to my cable at
home I can control my DVR watch my
recorded shows and most importantly
watch every single Golden State Warriors
victory and laugh at every single Los
Angeles Lakers loss but I still love you
cope now one of the best investments
I've ever made was getting a slingbox
and if you've been a good boy or girl
you could get one too and you know why
sing it for me ladies these are a few of
my favorite things that was nice and
finally traveling on planes and trains
and everywhere else the headphones i use
to knock out the sound are the bose
quietcomfort 25s I never thought $300
headphones were actually worth it until
i got these way back since the original
ones they're the best noise cancelling
headphones i've ever had for traveling
that really put you in your own world
especially when you're watching a movie
by yourself oh I know so let's wrap it
all up here you know we have a song just
for you
on the Apple bites most favorite things
btz gave to me one slingbox m15 canoe
airframe pluses one Bose QuietComfort 25
to choose pack airs and toothpaste packs
from mophie and three game quotes for a
game called threes I know how good was
that so how can any of you win these
these are legit prizes so you're going
to have to work at this so send me a
picture of yourself or a quick video
clip of you taking a bite out of the
Apple a real Apple any way you like you
guys can get creative but i'll pick all
my favorite winners and then feature
them on a future show once we come back
from CES 2015 in january and i'm just
gonna pick whoever i like to give
whatever I like so send me your
submissions via email to the apple byte
at cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
and if you try to kill me with tunas by
using your pets or your kids you need to
make sure you're in it too I actually
started thinking all my viewers were
either animals or two year old kids for
a while but you know what I got smarter
thanks so much for watching and we'll
catch you all next time for another bite
of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
