words and good at Scrabble but can you
beat a robot I'm gonna try right now and
play a Scrabble robot and I am joined
with a little bit of help by Will
Anderson North American Scrabble
champion we're gonna do this we're gonna
beat this row but what do you say well
we I think we can do it let's do it okay
I have some confidence here okay so what
this is doing let's start off you think
about strategy as our first word I want
to kind of explain a little bit about
the robot as well so this is using image
technology it's basically like kind of
work out what letters you're putting
down and the best combination and the
maximum letters and numbers that we can
kind of get from the robot point of view
that's what it's doing but we have to
use our brains okay let's think about
first word what are we gonna put down we
go seven letters right we've got some
high point letters here and we got to
try to put those on the good squares on
the board like the double letter score I
think we have a couple options that I
see to do it we can just play fatty or
we could play
we could play traif as well but let's
just go with the normal word that I
think we all know and I think it's yeah
I think we want to play I actually
played non-fat against the robot in my
first game nice you sticking with the
theme okay Fatiha I like this one like
this one alright let's see it lets see
it okay so now we've got our word down
on the board we played I would we're
gonna go to the tablet over here press
finished alright now I've submitted our
word it says the new word is fatty 30
points well done well done alright now
the robot is gonna stop putting down
some tiles Oh see the letters your
opponent has in this game you can but
it's you know honor system it's cheating
a little bit outside of you seeing it
but I've noticed look at some high score
numbers there there's a cue in there
there's a B this is low and there's a C
as well this is looking good for the
robot oh my okay what do you think is
gonna play it's gonna play probably qat
cat Oh cat it's always the one win every
time I play it
if you play Scrabble long enough you'll
see that word over and over again and
here it comes
here we go cat oh this is my bringing me
back to my days of words with friends
playing this this was the high score
this is the one that everyone would be
like what is this but it is cat qat
nicely done all right let's get some
more let's get some more letters from us
we're gonna get some more Alex yeah
let's just steal some from the robot
let's do this
one more one more oh okay so I see we
could do something like we could do
we've got some I'm just looking at some
words we could be strategy it really is
that Y or the F oh I wish we had an end
we could do something with the Y I mean
we don't have a year it's hard to do
something with a Q without the year
who's gonna be really tough to use so
yeah I'm definitely looking at the Y the
FS one of those nights I say let's do
something on the way let's do something
on the Y let's do let's do I'm gonna
stay with the Y the pressures on oh no I
thought we had a different let yeah okay
baby go oh no I know I'm here I'm here
I got it I got it I got it yeah I got it
I got it no it's resetting I took too
long that is that is that standard rules
is that it's not I mean typically you
have a little more time but the robot is
very fast so it holds you to a very high
standard I guess my goodness oh my gosh
okay so what's happening is when you
actually do complete the game what it
does is the robot it gives you a little
pencil shopping a gift that is see he
says keep your mind shop with a pencil
sharpener I love it it's so much fun
playing it but hey I didn't think that's
a that's not a rule the time limit hey
you cheating robot you're cheating I
think
next time okay so we're gonna reset the
robot because I know you're gonna
challenge it next but I want it I want
to talk a little bit about like strategy
when you play a robot like how do you
have to kind of think in a different way
too if you're playing a human well the
first thing is that the robot knows the
entire dictionary perfectly it takes
human beings years to get to anywhere
close to that point so that's thing
number one where it has an advantage
over 99.9% of human beings and then
obviously it plays really fast it knows
what word it's going to play instantly
so if you dally at all you I mean that's
you know typically in a tournament you
get 25 minutes to allocate however you
want I think in this game we had like a
minute and a half or something per turn
I don't even know what it was well good
luck in your challenge with the robot
I'm so excited to see what you do thanks
so much for watching guys we're gonna
throw to a break but stay tuned we've
got heaps more CES coverage coming up
really really soon live from CNET</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
