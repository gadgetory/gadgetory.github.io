the first time the brand new 13-inch
MacBook Pro it is incredibly thin just
point 75 inches thin let's put that side
by side with the previous generation you
can see there's a huge difference its
twenty percent thinner a full one-fifth
thinner but even more impressive it
weighs just over three and a half pounds
that's almost a full pound lighter than
the previous generation it also makes it
our lightest macbook pro ever and here
it is on the side the Cal thin that is
beautiful thin base thin display and all
the IOR pro customers need on the
left-hand side is magsafe 2 to
Thunderbolt ports a USB 3 port headphone
and dual microphones on the right-hand
side as with the 15-inch we removed the
optical drive and now have room for an
SD card reader HDMI video out and a
second USB 3 port here it is on the
other side equally beautiful for both
sides best of all it has a retina
display that is display where the pixels
are so small that a normal working
distance your I can't discern them and
everything on it looks absolutely
gorgeous it measures 13.3 inches on the
diagonal for pixels it's an amazing 2560
by 1600 that is four times the number of
pixels of the previous generation and if
you've done the math I'm sure some of
you have that's four million ninety six
thousand pixels that makes it the
world's second highest resolution
notebook computer yes our 15-inch is the
first but think about that this 13 inch
notebook has more pixels than any
competitive 15 or even 17 inch notebook
it is amazing looked at another way many
of us have HD TVs now 1920 x 1080 and
here is the new 13-inch macbook pro
alongside it showing the same image but
let's overlap those images
you can see the 13-inch MacBook Pros
Retina Display displays almost twice as
many pixels almost two million more
pixels than an HDTV it is a stunning
display and many other ways as well it
has rich color deep blacks twenty-nine
percent higher contrast ratio and
customers really appreciate this a
seventy-five percent reduction and
reflection or glare it's an IPS panel so
it is a very wide viewing angle and up
to full brightness it's 300 nets a very
bright display so this is an amazing
display and your applications look
fantastic on you so reading email the
text is so beautiful you can't see the
pixels surfing the web can be like a
fine print magazine using I work
applications like keynote your slides
look absolutely gorgeous I life
applications are great too when you use
iMovie the small thumbnails of video or
even stunning and sharp and specially
pearl applications like our aperture
photo application for pros you now have
access to 4 million pixels for native
photo resolution there's never been a
small notebook that gave pro
photographers this kind of technology
and capability and if you're looking for
more apps that all support our new
retina displays just go to our mac app
store you're going to find plenty more
there now there's productivity apps like
evernote an omni graffle there's
creative applications like pixelmator
and sketchbook pro and even games like
civilization 5 and real racing 2 it's a
lot of great software now to support the
retina display so that alone is an
amazing new feature on the new macbook
pro but there's a lot more there's an
FaceTime HD camera with 720p do
recording dual microphones stereo
speakers that sound even better than the
previous generation despite it being a
thinner notebook there's a beautiful
backlit keyboard and a glass multi-touch
trackpad I think the most exciting part
about this computer is actually but you
can't see it's on the inside so let's
take the bottom off and get a deep look
inside it everything about the new mac
Pro has been re-engineered from scratch
first the large dark areas around the
track pad those are the batteries we use
a symmetric lithium-ion battery
technology this allows us to get the
maximum battery life on such a small
design let me highlight some of the
features it's pretty incredible you have
intel dual core i5 or i7 Ivy Bridge
processors intel HD graphics 4000 much
faster graphics Wi-Fi Bluetooth standard
8 gigabytes of memory up to 768
gigabytes of flash it's all flash base
for storage and of course now up to 7
hours of battery life in such a thin
light product it is a fantastic computer
and it ships with OS 10 mountain lion
and mountain lion has many great
features that take advantage of this
technology and are perfect for our
notebook users for example built-in
voice dictation so anyway you can type
you can also speak and with dual
microphones that works even better of
course over Wi-Fi we have airplay so if
you have the Apple TV hooked up to your
TV set you can put your photos your
movies your presentations up there for
everyone to see documents in the cloud
so you can work on your I work documents
and your MacBook Pro and access them
wherever you are in your iPad or even
your iPhone I'm probably the coolest
feature power nap with power nap while
your notebook is asleep it can
automatically update your contacts your
calendar your email your photo stream
download software updates even back up
to a time capsule so this is a great new
MacBook Pro and it starts the 2.5
gigahertz dual-core i5 8 gigs of memory
in 128 gigabytes of flash for just 1699</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
