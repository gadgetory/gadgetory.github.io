a look at the brand new Dell XPS 14 now
that XPS brands from Dell has been
around for a couple of years seems to
look different every year although the
concept is always the same kind of a
high-end premium laptop that mixes
productivity with cool design I think
the latest generation of the XPS is
probably the best yet it started out
earlier in 2012 with the XPS 13 which we
jokingly called the Dell Book Air
because it looks so much like a 13-inch
MacBook Air down to the aluminum body
and the tapered design the XPS 14
there's also the 15-inch model actually
looks a little bit more like a MacBook
Pro it still got the aluminum body but
it's not tape but it's more slab like
like a macbook pro is now in this case
we've got a 14 inch display that's 1600
by 900 that's what I like to see in a
premium midsize laptop the 1366 by 768
is a little chintzy once you get up to
you know $9.99 a thousand dollars more
than that and some laptops have 1920 by
1080 displays on a 14 or 15 inch screen
I think that's just too much this is
just right
you also get Dells keyboard which will
find on XPS and Inspiron and other
models but it works well even across the
less expensive and more expensive ones
it's backlit which I always like but
only on the XPS do you get the big all
in one click pad it's kind of like
apples a big no button touch pad on the
Mac books on the Inspiron models to get
the separate left right mouse buttons a
little old-fashioned I found this worked
just about as good as any Windows
version of this I've seen the two
fingers scrolling was actually really
responsive if you go into the the menu
settings for the touchpad you can
actually turn on what they call inertial
scrolling which is that sort of a little
after touch the scroll that Apple has
didn't work as good here I would even
leave that off
you do get Intel's latest generation of
Core iSeries processors all the way up
to a core i7 which is what we have in
here and discrete graphics which is the
president considering this is considered
in ultrabook which is that sort of Intel
super thin laptop category you don't get
an optical drive however and it is
perfectly thin but I gotta tell you for
a 14-inch Ultrabook this thing is
insanely heavy even though it doesn't
have an optical drive it's 4.7 pounds
which which is more
then Apple's new 15 inch retina MacBook
Pro which is probably the closest sort
of high-end mid-sized power ball and of
course it's more it weighs a lot more
than the dell inspiron 14 that we just
reviewed that also has a next-gen Intel
Core I series processor and discrete
graphics so you can get a lot of the
same stuff in the lighter package for a
few hundred dollars less although I'm
not going to lie and tell you that that
system is as well built or nicely
designed as this one is I'm Dan Ackerman
and that is the Dell XPS 14</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
