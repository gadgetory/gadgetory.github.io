Bridget Carey on sina com and it's time
to get loaded Facebook has filed to
become a public stock with the security
Exchange Commission and it seeks to rake
in five billion dollars the
eight-year-old company is projected to
be worth somewhere around 75 to 100
billion dollars but it's still too early
to have a set price put on facebook
stock nonetheless hundreds of Facebook's
early employees could become
millionaires here's a breakdown of the
numbers facebook wants to raise five
billion by going public but that number
could go up by comparison when Google in
public it raised 1.9 billion facebook
reported revenue doubled last year to
3.7 billion with a profit of 1 billion
dollars oh and twelve percent of that
revenue came from zynga the gaming giant
behind farmville facebook has 845
million users and each is worth four
dollars and thirty-nine cents in revenue
a year the activity on the site has
doubled since the previous year and each
day 483 million people log into Facebook
and what about the money well payout
numbers are only certain till stock is
official but early employees investors
will be coming away with millions
Zuckerberg currently has an annual
salary of half a million dollars but
will drop it to one dollar a year in the
beginning of next year that's because
the stake in facebook stock could be
worth as much as twenty eight point four
billion dollars if Facebook is valued at
a hundred billion dollars Zuckerberg has
the most control over the company he
owns the largest single state with
twenty point four percent of the shares
but he also controls 56.9 percent of the
voting power in Facebook's finally it
listed what risks the company could face
Google+ could be a stronger competitor
in the future but the filing also said
mobile users pose a threat to the bottom
line there are more than 425 million
people that log into Facebook from a
phone or tablet but facebook said it
doesn't directly generate any meaningful
revenue from those mobile users in other
news website pinterest is now the
fastest growing site for referral
traffic according to a study by Shara
holic if Google+ YouTube and LinkedIn's
referral traffic we're all added up it
still wouldn't match the traffic
Pinterest drives currently users have to
request
an invitation to join the site Pinterest
is an online pinboard where users make
boards for certain topics like cooking
their home decor and whenever a cool
thing is found around the web like tips
or photos that user will pin it for
later reference and inspiration and
those collections are then shared with
friends also if you have an HTC phone
better see there's a system updated
download because a newly discovered bug
shows some phones can have their Wi-Fi
passwords and other info exposed some
models include the evo sensation
thunderbolt and droid incredible but HTC
is issuing a patch those your headlines
