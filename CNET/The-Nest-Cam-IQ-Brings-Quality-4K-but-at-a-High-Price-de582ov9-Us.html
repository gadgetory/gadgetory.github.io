and enhance a grainy low res photo to
reveal the bad guy's face and it's
magically crystal clear well that's not
how security cameras usually work but
the new nest cam IQ you see here can do
something like that zoom and enhance the
IQ is a lot like the nest cam indoor but
with improved two-way audio and the
addition of a 4k sensor now does that
mean you get 4k footage no instead
you'll get 1080p resolution just like
the nest cam indoor but that top-notch
image quality will be maintained across
the 12 x digital zoom range now 4k
streaming isn't really a big loss here
and we're not watching the Superbowl
we're not watching you know the newest
Christopher Nolan movie so 1080p is
really sufficient and this is what this
uses for streaming
so yeah the 4k sensor does offer this
ability to zoom in and maintain that
really high image quality but the
question is is that really worth it for
most average di wires is that really
gonna change your experience not that
much as a result of that high quality
sensor the nest cam IQ also offers free
features like person alerts and super
sight which alerts users to the presence
of people in their home allowing you to
zoom in on their face and identify them
and track that person's movement around
a room the spec upgrades and the
features they afford are pretty killer
for the nest cam IQ but the big question
remains are they worth 300 bucks for
most DIY enthusiast the answer is
probably no but if nest ever drops the
price a top-level camera will be waiting
