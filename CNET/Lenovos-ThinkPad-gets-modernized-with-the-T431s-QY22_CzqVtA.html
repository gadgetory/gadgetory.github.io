look at Lenovo ThinkPad t 431 s it's a
business oriented laptop that's a bit
more consumer-friendly like all of
lenovo's t-series models the t 431 s is
basic black but everything's been
cleaned up a bit from previous
generations at less than four pounds and
less than an inch thick this 14 inch
laptop gives you a larger screen and
keyboard than ultra portables but isn't
a pain to travel with regularly and its
carbon fiber and magnesium body can
handle being tossed around the 1600 by
900 resolution screen has a matte finish
and gets fairly bright so you're not
fighting stray reflections all the time
its viewing angles aren't great though
there are VGA and mini DisplayPort
outputs for connecting to external
displays and a docking port too for
those times when you want or need a
bigger screen the keyboard is large and
comfortable with excellent key travel
and it's available with backlighting
however the touchpad has been redesigned
which might be a deal-breaker for some
gone are the set of three buttons for
using with the track point replaced with
visual indicators the trackpad is
basically a compromise leaning toward
touchpad users with multi-touch gesture
support without completely abandoning
the track point fans as for what's
inside we tested what's basically the
base configuration with a
third-generation Core i5 processor
integrated Intel graphics four gigs of
memory and a 500 gig 7200 rpm hard drive
that's plenty for basic office tasks but
if you need extreme battery life you may
want to hold out for an update well this
got five-and-a-half hours in our test
the fourth gen Core iSeries processors
should deliver more if you're looking
for something now though that will make
your IT department happy that also won't
be a drag to work with on and off the
clock this is certainly a good way to go
