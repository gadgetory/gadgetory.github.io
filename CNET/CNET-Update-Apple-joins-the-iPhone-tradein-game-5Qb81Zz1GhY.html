iphone I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update if you're going to buy
a new iphone at an apple retail store
later in September you can trade in your
old model for store credit on the spot
Apple launched its iphone trade-in
program at its retail stores to make it
easier on customers looking to earn some
cash for older models it's only for
customers buying a new iPhone under
contract and it's unclear how much you
can get for your old iPhone at the apple
store if you wait until launch day which
will likely be September 20th that's the
week following Apple's expected iphone
announcement on September 10th the value
of a used iphone drops as we approach
the arrival of a new model but it
doesn't hurt to lock in a buyback price
quote now from next worth and ghazal
both websites give sellers several weeks
to mail in a used phone before getting a
check and there's no obligation to go
through with it if you change your mind
or if apple offers a better deal
Facebook is rolling out an update to
Android users it's now animating some
stickers you know those cartoon icons
and private messages and it adds music
controls to the lock screen for those
that are using facebook cover feed ett
is launching a no-contract prepaid
wireless network called aio wireless it
starts in mid-september the service
costs between 40 to 70 dollars a month
and that's for unlimited talk text and
data and new subscribers get a free
month of service if they sign up before
September 29th Microsoft has changed the
name of the xbox live marketplace to
simply xbox game store the name change
is a better fit to match the other shops
Xbox music store and Xbox video store
and Android users can now download digs
RSS reader at first launched on iOS back
when Google Reader shut down it's just
another way to keep up with the latest
post from your favorite websites or
shows like this one the streaming TV
service area could be arriving on
Android devices in September at least
that's what the CEO of Aereo told the
international
business times Aereo offers a monthly
subscription to access a live feed of
your local over-the-air broadcast
stations and it also offers the option
of recording shows like a DVR but
there's no box in your living room it's
just stored online subscribers view it
from a website from Apple devices like
an iPad or Apple TV or through Roku
Aereo is in New York Boston Atlanta and
salt lake city but it's expanding to
more areas including miami on September
