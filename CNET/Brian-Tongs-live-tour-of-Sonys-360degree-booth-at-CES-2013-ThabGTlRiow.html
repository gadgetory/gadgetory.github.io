the CES 2013 show floor you know how we
do it like one of the best boots that I
always get a check out here at CES is
Sony smooth because they do so many
amazing and different things so we're
going to take you inside the booth we
know that a lot of times we're not going
to be able to show you everything you
want to see we know sony has their press
conference announcement that you'll be
able to see here live at five p.m.
pacific time but we did want to give you
a sense of what sony is doing here at
the show and i got a min i really feel
like this is one of their best setups
they've ever done before because it
really feels spacious wide open they're
doing a lot of cool things so let's just
kind of walk inside this 360 array of
video screens that sonia is showing off
so when you when you walk around and
you're in here you feel kind of feel
like kind of like you're in the Sony
spaceship like this capsule and they
will be doing they showing a lot of cool
original video content around these
screens that's surround the entire stage
now one of the hottest products that
we're expecting to see here is the
Xperia Z we know there's been a lot of
rumors floating around see see all these
things covered up in this shroud like if
it's in this cloth you you can't really
see I mean even if you try to look in
there you can try like Charlie you can
try I mean you can't see what's inside
there so we're gonna hopefully I'm gonna
get a glimpse of that but we expect to
see that the presser but these are all
clearly the Sony Xperia Z you know
displays and set up so we're gonna walk
through here I know I let you guys down
didn't I I'm sorry now while we're
walking through this tour booth we're
gonna be here for a while so if you guys
feel like you want to ask us any
questions directly you can tweet me at
brian Tong that's my Twitter handle BR
iant LNG and I'm gonna try and answer
some of your questions while we're here
during the boots or because we want to
be able to feel reach out and touch you
ok so right behind me now here this is
another set up here with the Xperia
phones you can see like they're having
them set up they're using their new
wireless headphone set up as well and
this is we don't see many phones coming
out here at CES 2013 we know that
they're starting to give them more
towards you know TVs bake consumer
devices and what makes that different is
that now people are signed announce
their phone products a lot later at
Mobile World Congress so I right now my
gut feeling is the Xperia Z might be the
phone of the show I'm just saying that's
my gut feeling so let's just walk around
here now and kind of
you some more of what Sony's booth has
to offer okay so they're still working
again they're still setting up these
boots and perfecting them and
fine-tuning them because really it's
we're still a ways we're still a day
away so there's a lot of stuff that has
not been to finish it let's just kind of
take a look and we can see all the
workers here in the aisles kind of going
at it again this is this is only the
mobile section of the sony booth so it
just gives you a sense of how much stuff
oh right in my face how much stuff is
really going on okay let's keep on
walking down over here another cool
feature that they're showcasing with
there so many devices is this one touch
capability right the little caption
magic is just one touch away and what
they're doing is enabling a lot of times
we have you know NFC connections on our
phones but how do we really make that a
seamless transaction because we still
have yet to see instantaneous OneTouch
accident it takes some time you know if
you mess around with google phone so
what we have here we're going to walk
down this aisle here these allow you
things like one touch listening here the
Xperia Z here you can touch to these
devices and then they'll start playing
the content whether it's music we also
have one touch sharing again we've seen
these in phones before but here in the
US market xperia z hasn't seen the light
of day I mean that's the phone that
everyone's waiting to see and then also
one touch marion very similar to like
what Apple is doing with their you know
ability to throw and toss content from
your mobile device to your TV set what's
cool is that instead of you having to
switch to an apple TV and your input
this is integrated directly into the TV
set so just boom one touch and they're
good to go so we're gonna keep on
walking through the booths here and
let's let's go over here to the 4k
section because we know 4k stuff is
really hot so come on over this way
alright watch this oh man do you see
that I tapped his right shoulder he
still looked left this can this guy you
know this could this guy knows the game
that can I ask you a quick question is
yes so are you you're here with the sony
booth setting up um have you worked here
on the sony booth before I have not this
is my first year on the sony booth for
sure at CES no 10 years at CES okay so
what do you think of this booth compared
to some of the other ones you personally
seen whether you can say good things
about things but we just want to get
kind of an insider view right I love
this booth doing the whole 360
it's unbelievable his first time this
has been done in this just like this and
I think it's great looks great it's open
love it all right that's chris wilson i
gotta drop his name because he knows
don't tap his right shoulder he's going
to look left okay thanks man all right
so we're gonna keep on coming over here
and we want to show you the 4k section
inside of Sony's booth we know 4k is a
huge buzz word and you know it's
debatable of really what advantages you
get obviously with huge large screen
you're going to see the biggest benefit
but in this specific area we kind of
rotate around me Sony is giving
different examples of the different uses
of 4k television so right behind me see
that that was like a matrix move right
there you see that Charlie with the
matrix move my goodness all right so
here's this is blu-ray disc blu-ray
discs will still have the ability to
support 4k content we won't need any new
discs for that so that's a good thing
for everyone at home right we can also
move down here they're showing off 4k 3d
television a TV set one of the main
benefits with 3d TV and the 4k
technologies you have more lines of
resolution so sometimes that crosstalk
or if you're looking at images close up
and they break down the fact that 4k
does have a higher resolution should
help with your 3d resolution if you're
if you're into that stuff I'm I have a
3d TV you know we'll see that's all
right okay so let's keep on coming down
this way we got some other really cool
stuff to show you this this guy over
here though although it is a 3d TV this
is there are 84 inch television set it
is out and available right now but one
of the cool things that comes with it
because you really need this content to
support the television set is if we walk
over here there they offer when you buy
this TV again it's 25 k it's a lot of
money alright if we come over here let's
see if we can get a click quick little
sneak peek so it's also going to be able
to come with a server that is loaded
with content now when I tell you things
are covered up look you will you can't
tell what that is I've seen it I can't
show you that but this is the new
concept design this is because we're
setting up right we can't show this to
you what is the concept design that's
like as good as a blurry cell phone
picture on a blog right but that's their
new server that they will give you with
the 84 inch TV it will come loaded with
10 movies some short films with 4k
content that will be delivered to buy
really in order for for can really have
a chance
companies were going to need to give you
native 4k content so we're gonna keep on
rolling out over here okay let's see
what else we have going on is this like
the longest coolest tour ever I think so
all right um let's just keep on walking
down this way there's there's people
clean up the floors there's a lot of
static electricity I've been tempted I
like folk someone and shot them but I
won't do that and over here this is some
really cool stuff these cameras behind
me these are Sony's 4k cameras so when
you want to get 4k content from a
consumer standpoint how do you record
that well they have examples of their 4k
content and that second one on the left
side that's a prosumer camera that we
have yet to see you will see it soon
just trust me on that but it's really
shaped like that I think it's the HX
2000 model that is really the prosumer
form factor they're making a 4k camera
in that same form factor so pretty
excited about that okay let's just come
over here a little more we're gonna walk
down to some of the cameras because sony
has a lot of digital imaging products
that are really great and one of the
kind of cool things that I was able to
see is the ability to use their
camcorder technology we've seen if
you're not familiar sony allows you to
use your some of their camcorder lines
as a projector right so if you record
content you can project into them so
we're gonna go over here right now to
show you this really quick I might hey
there you go see that a little hashtag
did you see that that's pretty Nash tag
yeah that's right content okay so we're
not gonna be able to zoom into this that
much but what happens is with these
camcorders now a new product will allow
you to take your camcorder which used to
just show the content recorded but
connect like a tablet connect like a
laptop connect even a blu-ray player
directly to the camcorder use it as a
pass-through and then it'll shoot that
image onto the wall so you know what
guys I'm getting the sign I've got to go
i love you guys I really do but we're
going to be back after break the more
press conferences lexus is coming up
i'll be back here showing you more from
the show floor you guys this is CES 2013
before it opens gotta love it all right
we'll see you guys
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
