this king-sized episode of the cnet labs
cast Joseph thank you for being here
you've probably heard this already so so
I'm just going to remind everyone
they're getting rid of the entire cnet
live lineup including us so this is the
last labs cash show in its current
format but I'm still excited to have
spent all this time with you guys I
think this is like episode like a
hundred and sixty something altogether
since Joseph Julie and I started long
before Scott and I worked here it's
obvious who brought the ship down Scott
diamond edition just call me the fines
but I guess we will have real show what
about some stuff that's going on in the
lab that we've been talking about tell
you how to keep in touch with us and
maybe talk about some fun stuff some fun
surprises a Joseph you wanted to briefly
introduce everybody for the final show
want to go ahead and I I just wanted it
kind of know introduce myself I am
Joseph Kaminsky editor extraordinaire
who writes very little and talks about
much but often now just easing in to my
right is Julie Rivera last show yeah and
I'm ty pendlebury I think that's the
first time we've introduced myself and
that was all fertilizer yeah there's
nothing about our board and you time
capsule introductions I'm Scott Stein
for those people several thousand years
in the future that want to know these
human beings are there talking on this
video recording and and and Scott
obviously got my memo this morning about
wearing the the button up shirt with the
v-neck sweater the rescue guys did not
Geraldine x I all said all week I went I
went a world class look at that why are
you wearing a Sydney 2002 sure where the
hell did that come from I took I took it
for your cheer I slipped over the other
actually I bought a whole bunch of
Sydney Olympics memorabilia thinking
would be really valuable now and I would
like this sippy straw God knows only go
up in value greater so yeah
didn't go you know what your headphones
match your shirt yeah yeah yeah comical
shamu right before we get too far down
the fun hole here I do want to talk
about the one thing that we did last
week that actually is relevant to what
we talked about which is Scott brought
up the good point starting back at CES
that laptops which were all sort of
intimately involved with he said with
the next generation of Intel chips
coming out and windows 8 and all the
other stuff you'd be an idiot to buy a
laptop now I of course violently
disagreed just for the sake of
disagreeing and we did a whole big
debate on it Scott and we did a question
and answer thing on the sign we shot a
video we did whoo-hoo do you feel made
the medication that debate I saw more
comments saying team Scott I did all I
also thought my common fact you've got
no fairness like you said you were
taking a stance that maybe you even were
talking about it was a tougher
counterpoint to argue because i think
that the that really the no-brainer
right now would be that you wait because
ivybridge as everybody knows if you've
been reading cnet and if you don't know
it's coming out anywhere from a month to
several months down the line every month
several months and when that shows up in
laptops like you said dan could could
could flex out to some period of time
several months or maybe longer if you're
waiting for one particular model but it
makes sense to wait if you're going to
get certain gains on it but you did make
a good counterpoint that if you're not
just thing about blindly upgrading there
is logic to in commodity devices like
laptops maybe you should wait yeah my
point was what are you doing with you go
for it like what I'd like I know Joey
does this laptop at everybody else
you're on Facebook you're on Twitter
you're watching Netflix you're not doing
anything that crazy you're not you're
not doing that thing where you can do
distributed computing to help people put
together uh you know like different
chemical molecule compound folding not
just go to get home I disagreed I'm
gonna fight I'm gonna fight because I
was a great for and I don't think that's
true I think you're doing photo editing
or your consolidating what about the
last two years cannot do any photo
editing that you want to do well my 2008
macbooks have an arc I'm running uh
running its photo library now maybe you
just gunked up your laptop over the
course of four years I may have but I i
think that people are also uh you know
but with the amount of photos and video
editing that type of stuff i do think
that
it can be done faster with newer models
of laptops so that's something to
consider but you're right you're not
you're not rendering uh you know
graphics for Jurassic Park for not doing
up to upper right since i came across
that probably but some people might you
know what there are some people out
there that are making the next titanic
on their own little video cameras and
rendering stuff and they're healing is
right in doing abs cat all right i'm
gonna say on a lot of up and you can
you're fired last episode ever listened
to on a lot of points scott is is
correct and if I were gonna buy a new
laptop I'd probably wait a little bit
too but let me ask ty this for example
it's a your laptop catches fire burns
through crisp your you spill
hypothetically a bottle of wine on it
and and putting it you know in a plastic
bag of uncooked rice doesn't fix it
which is what you do with wet gadgets
other soaks up the voice-over i buy them
uh yes I do so he's our hostage Emmy
wait two to three months to buy a new
one or break down and get something new
now or you know the other case be
without a laptop while which would you
choose this is exactly the predicament
I'm in that document my four year old
laptop has finally died and I'm in a
predicament I should've asked you for
the article so essentially i'm looking
at either a tablet or a laptop hmm so
i'm using just an old dinky what are
those horrible things came out a few
years ago as are no important than
Furbies no you did by Furby does oh I
kind of remember that before ultrabooks
netbook networks book it's like a on a
to megahert computer I'm is not at the
moment um but yeah I'm sort of trying to
decide should I get something like this
sony tablet s for example no there's no
answer is easy diner get an iPad or
channel laptop when every alternate ones
get
I don't know your second choice I don't
get it though I don't get it as you
first of all we can ask this question
anybody in the room because we all know
we can easily like guys can I hold on a
laptop like a week or two to like make
up my mind what I want to get it's hard
for us that's true it's hard because I
mean come on that's how Julie Julie
Julie grab from the lab today I mean
come on this you see well you won't see
a different laptop next because you
won't see a spokesman yeah but if there
were a show next week beautiful laptop
next week can we have a spin-off of
those that is their show at the zoo
short the left yesterday now now which
son I am so not looking after I'll leave
your gun you get up Julie take over the
seat we're going we're going we're going
we're going we're talking Lou Gramm we
need have a Lou Gramm you're going we're
going we're going you know no crying
Scott no crying I we're going Joan Julie
you need your own spin-off show that's
right oh well when we talking about
inside the mind of Julius units yes
inside the model Julie yes and all this
acronym needs to be I have to be
censored are you I'm imagination no no
we will be bbbbbb okay I'm sorry no fine
we'll find fun stuff to do until they
come up with a new series of shows maybe
if you get over to our facebook page the
cnet lamps gasps facebook page if we
have something fun going on the lab will
shoot a little video we'll post it there
or you can ask ah send questions in to
join Julie I'll make a mentor on camera
I post it there I think I so long i
sighs into it I so so and you guys could
write an email anybody here would love
to do man woman on the street with Julie
where we take a gadget on the street and
we just buried people with may be stolen
maybe notes even plays on assam howdy
how do you how do you use this how would
you use how to make fun of the audience
that's the way i think whatever just
have fun with them just totally go hey
you come here you have an ipad one or
two no just like this i don't know i
think i think it'd be funny like a tag
team we're hard I hit the street you
know we can even we can even film the
entire show right by shake shack that
line is so long we could have different
people all day every day entertaining us
like what phone is that you using who
you texting is it your mother your girl
baby momma you're your side chick which
was
therefore don't even know how dirty are
you with your table remember the quiz we
used to do when we were we would ask you
guys questions and you have to gotta
come up the answer to win prizes and
stuff that sort of like what what the
the late-night talk shows doing they do
the man on the street you know the
question I think you need your own I
think you'd make a great you I see all
right we should grab land the people of
the street Ackerman is definitely a game
show host yeah I don't know if I should
take that in a good way or bad no it's a
compliment definitely a game show you're
the same like all for people who don't

i just started watching seen that video

exact he is no different do you even
make love like that yeah how are you
doing today final episode will burn
forever we want to see you oh you know
what Joseph I I have something I'm going
to burn into your brain right now do you

that mini alias facebook account I think
you got onto something or people thought
that you were somebody else it happens
so I remember that you flip the switch
early on and I think you went to 30,000
couple months yeah and like I'm I think
I happening like now that that happened
in like January so between january and
march i went from like 32 55 that's just
it was a lot
at a time I like it you know tonight not
deserving of payment at a ratio so
you're really interested in it I
wouldn't know of any other celebrity
like that would that that would happen
too I don't know like when Charlie Sheen
join the Twitter you got a million
flowers right away that's a heck of an
intense an analogy I a night when
responding nobody amazing you need that
happen in the chat room III see some I
see some people pointing out that it's
rather anachronistic of me to having an
actual CD which is true i just did a can
for these for promotional purposes and
they'll be available exclusively through
amazon but obviously for most people
it's a digital download which is why
said ëno shadow they'll be waiting in
barbershops like the LLC i'll be on the
street in front of the subway station
with the guitar out and a case and the
cds will be in the case will note saying
like ten dollar CD mean our dinner guest
house now about the truck of his car
before you know email Joey and i'll send
you a download code i'll send you down
because i don't want to go well I don't
want to use of my favorite size but I
don't want to go to a tea orr empty side
see Ackerman's on back I'll ackerman
needs is money so he can give me at
least take me a Julie out to lunch right
we should have had a big catered lunch
for last episode I'm sorry I can i share
i can i share one thing with you know
premiere of a song again that I i I'd
used to make songs I guess play over my
I'm sorry are you so now you have an
album coming out too no just ran back to
know too late it's already present music
sounds like it sounds like this somebody
points out is there video to go on to
that
can I tell us what we're hearing this is
a one minute song i made called Abraham
Lincoln's a magician and what your
witness this is from 2009 it doesn't eat
what wow the way like a pound sound sort
of thing this is all made with
GarageBand of course you never use
garage musicianship um but this was very
avant-garde I'd like that yes they might
be giant zit it has only one line uh-huh
naturally three lines of dialogue is
about Abraham Lincoln being a magician
yes it was based on song I heard in la
restaurant dude that's not like
something Alex would say it out and it
sound like you should be like important
the movie Flash Gordon it is it is very
savvy 1979 Dino De Laurentiis versions
yes night and then this is the only part
that has a dialogue awesome it's a when
Abraham Lincoln was a magician oh
alright dude I will bring it back
Abraham we can pull papers out of his
hat it's men so many papers rolling
papers no no and that's it and then some
my wife at the end saying Abraham
Lincoln was a magician it also would
thought to say he was a vampire hunter
you'd really be onto something now no
that's right here's a song so I told you
sort our your writing over here we go
here actually I'm not working on that's
what it is something nice for a change
we we can't play copyrighted music on
the show oh I'm plugging that doesn't
matter we can file oh it's copper that's
I I can't play music I should we do we
help the right license that is the one
thing I will change sue dan Akram is
right can't you or will be taken off the
air we won't have another
I do that right oh you weren't here but
initially what we used to do and it's oh
yeah that's right please do mashups yeah
which one whole bunch of current songs
mass and then they don't you can do that
anyway and it's also okay okay so yeah I
was gonna bump Mary but it's all right
ah uh so let's ask an actual technology
question here i vas I thought of this
this morning and I said if I had to if I
just put a gun to your head
hypothetically because I would never
actually another that a commercial gun
to your head mm-hmm if I if I'd say
Scott what's the greatest uh it is what
to you is a greatest gadget of all time
and just had to go with your Rorschach
test immediate answer what would it be
quick come on is an iphone there you go
he says iphone iphone are you shooting
me that's a good okay are you kidding
tell me why you have an iphone post app
store yeah okay change the world why the
world change the world because it to me
it was the the growth of what I would
call like the deck is a computer meaning
like the cyberpunk idea of like
something you carry by your side that is
connected that can do everything that
you need in a pinch and technically you
wouldn't need to carry a laptop or
anything else with you and you be able
to get an amazing amount of things done
and that's basically what the iphone and
then all smartphones have turned into i
think that was that's a good guy a
pretty amazing transformation alright ty
you said you had a choice i I really
also the moment it is the iphone and i
don't know if it would be the same if
I'd i had i deliberated over her i was
going to get a samsung or an iphone hunt
at the time i went for iphone because of
the proprietary pin connector
essentially i was reviewing a lot of
musical systems at the time and so that
meant I could carry a lot of
uncompressed music with me and music is
very important to me so in that respect
I listen to lots of music or play games
it's not that great as a phone or even
as a like texting devices pretty
terrible but to do everything you know
it basically you all the time so that's
a good listen to the iphone I'm not I'm
not listen I'm not living here on this
let me hear Johnny yes it's the identity
no
forget the ipad it's it's my TV home
theater oh hell yes my relaxed time I
walked lean into the mic test I watched
my sports on it I can blast music on and
I you guys are on this work thing I
don't know it's wrong with you people
not me I ought to be disconnected I loan
on a pop go home maybe my son wants to
watch a lion king or whatever we just
zone out we kickback popcorn movies it
brings people together the big screen
movie the ultimate the big screen TV
with the surround sound home theater
okay home theater kitten kaboodle it
brings families together brings people
together it drowns out your noisy
neighbors it's the ultimate come on the
noise maybe then I am yes yells like a
new Bernard a bishop he'll commanders
and I heels so I been what is this I'm
selfish i don't share i don't share
people like a personal device you're a
dead man your dad of course is your
unselfish now Oh home theaters fair
alright so yeah you know you have to be
on selves your dad now you can't be said
we have one iphone a second iphone a
big-screen TV surround sound Julie I
know I've never shot watch it live with
that and what's a good and it doesn't go
mmm what's it gonna beat you yeah I mean
be honest you I try to stay disconnected
as possible I don't have tablets I have
my phone I think that's pretty much them
what something that i have i have
personally just historically what's the
most important gadget I don't know man
seriously from for me right now I guess
is my phone comes and goes but um it
could be something else the next day
yeah exactly all right I don't I don't
play favorites on that so that's just
how it goes and that's a typical Julie
response i like that romanticism persons
my bedroom what is it sort of
re-examining the question looking at it
from a different way not answering it
like straight ahead like like you
predictable guys all did all right okay
are you ready now i I thought about
saying the iPad because it's just as so
darn useful it's changed my life in so
many ways but then i thought back and
said what else has changed my life and
many generations of people's lives so i
said i know this is the this is the most
important gadget of all time here it is
boys the atari 2600 but what if it
doesn't
well the premeditated answer you i gotta
tell you i was i was going to say the I
the ipad up until five minutes before I
walked in here when I walked by the lab
my father's shooting they've had a five
minutes to think about this why did come
up the question so obviously III did
think about it as I thought of the
question as we ran right all right don't
think about it how much time do we spend
on games and game related things whether
it's on our consoles on our phones on
tablets how many generations of people
have been I have been influenced and
have been been goaded into becoming high
tech entrepreneurs and game makers and
creative people because they had an
Atari 2600 I bet it's millions millions
of people around the world I said I've
original that is in a resistor is not
the Sears Game Master I'm not I have
when I was a kid that thing is older
than you guys not all of me not you got
all of you I'm gonna confiscate your
iPad did you know that so what they
don't know what is your most influential
piece of what is always in your hands
space invaders look at that why don't
have it on my hands ah you know what
okay if I'm gonna if I'm gonna think
about it for a few moments then my
answer okay now and it's got changing
his answer oh free this is thinking
about it for a right ahead that's what
we're here for because I thought about
this the moment I said it is that the
one that really changed my life growing
up was the game boy now of course
because black and white that boo yeah
that blew my mind it blew my mind that
you could take that outside the home
that I could go to summer camp and
suddenly I could be my bunk and takes on
video games with me into like the woods
and the battery life into the woods in
the Moscow silicon okis bunks you know I
keep your like it you know playing
soccer selling stock rom singh by the
sideline games like places we don't
electrical outlet we can normally set
that stuff up before it was like books
and puzzles so that's for you did really
did not have on the go technology that
regular people could have before that
only watch Game and Watch was I remember
and I love the hell out of this my Sony
watchman oh yeah I had the black and
white baloney watchman yes I Nicasio on
the sony 40 but the casio knock off the
battery life on that game boy how good
at that laid the groundwork for
something like I think like the iPad and
I
like it having that level of Castle the
way you have to worry about battery life
like you could put batteries my gameboy
and you'd be good for I don't know a
long time whole summer right what was
your favorite tech a kangaroo or koala
bear you're hurting i can't defend
myself obviously i love was uh yeah was
that it was an accident they just
wearing that shirt I wore cuz i wanted
to wear this hat oh ok you know one
night in like a man with my headphones
wonder what happened you know that I got
the nobody can hear you from back there
Jeff it is the same dollar blue if they
don't have to hear me they can see me
yeah right so what are we gonna do uh in
the post podcast world to fill our days
if it turned out so we're coming up I
know well Joe's got a big project coming
up that I'm very excited about we're not
quite ready to pull the wraps off it yet
but we're developing some new battery
life test for phones and I think that
we've made some big breakthroughs and I
think it's going to be really cool to be
able to give evil objective data rather
than just I used it for a while this is
how long it lasted oh yeah so so so look
for that and you've been doing a bang-up
job on development on that yes that well
fortunately you know got some very
helpful you brought it home from all
over the company I got help from around
the world if they're true and will
continue testing more laptops and
desktops and other things ah oh no it's
actually is just me teasing a chat they
loved you like When Harry Met Sally we
will see each other for another another
seven years you gotta give the people
what they want anything exciting going
on in the TV testing realm time I'm
sorry let me wait no speak wait what for
the camera wait wait wait for it wait
for it okay I'm gonna wait now no answer
well we've had an ID inch television
which was okay we're just starting to
get a whole bunch of tvs in now we've
got the Sony hey check so what was it
750 which is the second best TV that
they'll release this year okay which
wasn't very good I'm
a bit I don't know what's going to
happen with Sony this year if they're if
they're second best TV isn't that great
what's the rest of their line going to
be like well what essentially it's like
six hundred dollars more than this
competition okay not as good ha now what
happens in the fall when those OLED TVs
come out of that just gonna knock
everyone else back I don't think so i
think it's going to be a real niche sort
of product in that it'll be they'll ship
probably lesson i'm guessing 10,000 TVs
okay between them they'll be like what
six or seven grand yeah yes Oh 30
thousand dollars and and that's what
it's time I don't blame it on the
sunshine we're gonna get all these sort
of feedback I know really non here so
yeah it's into this is large thing you
got Tyler time vortex so Sony's sort of
taking a year off I think but you're
seeing the rise of the Koreans you're
seeing the LG and Samsung really showing
the technical dominance with the eyelids
so it's going to be very interesting so
look forward to every TV within five
years I think so yeah absolutely that's
going to be the next screamed technology
so and we've seen you know it from the
Vita to the headset yeah thing has
eyelids in it the samsung galaxy s2 hey
eyelids you know pretty much any screen
that it's appeared in has been really
good although i know that you Scott had
some problems with the actual Vita
screen and that it looked like some sort
of weird black level thing going on yeah
or something very odd that I found and
we found it in another video screen in
the office which was kind of a
perfectionist and I can still hear me
and uh and um when you it looks bright
and crisp and the contrast all those are
incredible but if you have an instance
where the screen goes to perfect dark
perfect black um I found that once your
eyes adjusted you actually saw i saw a
sort of a slightly model pattern when i
was in darkness and I see something look
like a muddy modeled and I wondered if
it was like bad compression or dinner
compression or something and it sort of
seeing that too when it turns out that I
think you were saying or somebody was
saying that it may be a layer that was
put on the OLED because it's consistent
each time whatever it is it only shows
up in that one condition I sort even if
you have
like the white p logo for the for the
Vita appearing on a black screen your
eyes adjust and you don't see that
pattern anymore so it's very very rare
in netflix i saw it sometimes with low
lighting it with darker scenes because
it was different between different Vedas
Ryu those yes Patton wasn't a consistent
thing and looked consistent on mine but
it was consistent on somebody else's in
a different pattern hmm so I don't know
if you want to watch her look at your
Vita if you have one in the dark and
look at a black screen see if that shows
up but it is a very specific one
instance thing like that it's not when I
I played any game it never showed them
thats Sarah I I think that's a big
that's a big turning point that's how I
I think I've changed video games I've
actually had a Vita sit in my bag I like
a month and have item it never took it
out at home yeah never it's still in the
same charge well I think it's because we
have so as probably uncharged by now no
it's probably retains charge well okay
but uh yeah we have we have less time I
think I play like one or two games at a
time now instead of like four or five
like its mass effect 3 and like draw
something right and yeah would it what
do you plan out I do something got
something and I love that game so much
any high console games um no I'm playing
what's a battlefield 3 on both ps3 okay
well I love that game got um I love zuma
on the ipad i was waiting for that
forever and it's like crack angry birds
space is fun all those like it i went
back to the basics with that i'm still a
huge fan of kingdom rush that's our
defense game is the i got someone else
hooked on that is the hardest simplest
little tower defense thing I never care
about like swords and shields but it's
incredibly so I play those simple
addictive games and like a board game or
two but I find it hard to get into even
on the iPad anything even like infinity
blade which is not in our sense right
yeah the original but you know I I just
find that anything that starts required
reflexes and timing and proper
positioning I just I want to get lazy
and simple and just tap tap tap mmm and
not have to worry about timing too much
like are those I'm sorry have you ever
requested the chat room dan they want
you to take off your glasses they were
