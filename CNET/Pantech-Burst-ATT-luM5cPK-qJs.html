day so when we see one we really like to
take a look I'm Jessica doll court for
cnet this is the Pantech Burst a new
phone for AT&amp;amp;T first took a look at this
at CES and I have to say there's a lot
to like about it it's got a 4 inch super
amoled screen really nice screen for me
4 inches is perfect and makes the size
of the phone really easy to hold in my
hands I also really love the design of
this phone comes in two colors red here
and titanium it's got these edges that
give it more of a unique look and feel
some of the other specs are pretty good
as well there's 1.5 gigahertz dual-core
processor on here there's a pretty
decent 5 megapixel camera on the back
and a pretty good 2 megapixel camera on
the front too and that's perfect for
video chatting inside you've got android
2.3 Gingerbread and it is running
pantech skin on top of it I find it very
easy to navigate very friendly easy on
the eye as well in addition to that
camera you also have support for 720p HD
video which is pretty gratifying
especially for phone that costs only 50
bucks now the one red flag is the call
quality so far it's been a little bit
hit or miss and the tests sounded a lot
better to my ears and it has to anybody
else's and the speakerphone was pretty
terrible so maybe this isn't the
absolute best phone for somebody who
intends to be on at a long time making
phone calls but if you are going to be
using that feature sparingly and you
want a very affordable very all-around
nice smartphone to use for its other
features then you should definitely
consider the Pantech Burst i'm jessica
doll court for seen it you can read the
