on the market but that's just happened
very recently with Chevy Colorado and
this guy gmc's Canyon this is kind of a
more upscale more heavily equippable of
the two so let's get a full taste of
what GM is doing in the mid-size truck
category as we drive this 15 Canyon
four-wheel drive with v6 check the tech
now the formula for Chevy's Colorado or
gmc's Canyon is basically fourfold first
of all it's on a percent truck just less
of one efficiency no v8 is available car
like ride quality appointments and to a
fair degree into your cabin tech and big
boy truck styling now here are the
configurations you can get your canyon
in we've got the crew cab with the
shorty you can also get a crew cab with
a long bed there's also an extended cab
that has a full length bed and on top of
that you get the choice of two wheel
drive or four-wheel drive four-wheel
drive adds quite a bit as an overall
package and the cost we're gonna focus
on that here compared to a full-size
Sierra with a crew in a long bed the
canyon would be over 14 inches shorter
nearly six inches narrower and over
three inches lower now inside our Canyon
we've got a canyon or two to deal with
lots of these deep set kinds of wells
for the head unit for the lower console
the gauges and the ancillary are pushed
way back very sculpted look now this is
IntelliLink which is one of the many
flavors of whatever length that General
Motors puts out there in their cars I'm
not going to spend too much time on it
we've showed it to you before it's a
pretty good nav system not that
difficult to use some folks really don't
like this idea of persistent bottom
menus or the way they've kind of tablet
eyes these icons here I don't find that
a bad system at all what I don't like is
that it's like so many others that stick
a bunch of buttons down at the bottom or
the edge of the screen where it's hard
to get a finger on them but little
things matter when it comes to interface
now the OnStar icon brings us to a
discussion about 4G in this vehicle you
can get it with the built-in 4G LTE
connection primarily that power is a hot
spot in the car which I find to be kind
of half brain-dead most folks aren't
gonna find that all that valuable
increasingly though on stars just
announced they're going to be doing
services in the car that are powered by
that 4G connection like one that's
called at your service that will
predictably find things you want either
on your route or toward your destination
it's trying to build more smarts into
these services regardless OnStar 4G is
free for the first three months and
verse three gigabytes of data in that
time after that
a gigabyte a month will cost you either
15 or 20 bucks a month depending whether
you are or are not an OnStar subscriber
overall or if you're an AT&amp;amp;T sub you can
add the car that has 4G to your mobile
data bucket the mobile share thing they
do for 10 bucks but then it's eating
into your overall bucket drive controls
in this truck are appropriate to a truck
you've got some paddles back here behind
the wheel but those are actually
controls for the interface and notice
that the four-wheel drive apparatus has
been very shall we say made simple you
don't deal with a lot of different modes
here now you can get your Canyon with a
two and a half liter four but don't do
that here is the 3.6 liter v6 direct
injection more appropriate perhaps to a
truck this is gonna give you a nice 305
horsepower 269 pound-feet of torque not
overwhelming numbers but serviceable for
something that we might have a payload
in it right which by the way it can be
around sixteen hundred and twenty pounds
although in all-wheel-drive mode you can
only get 1550 as a payload either way
any configuration tows 7000 your mpg
will vary but in the four-wheel drive
mode it's 17 24 and that's regular gas
you can get a six-speed manual on a four
banger but all the v6 trucks have a
six-speed automatic a 2.8 liter diesel
is also slated for late 2015
in the 2016 models
as I mentioned the very beginning of
this piece these are real trucks and
certainly in this four-wheel-drive
configuration it handles and drives like
one you've got a very firm suspension
that is part of its real truck routes
and of course rather good payload and
towing capacity it does mean that on
very undulating or bad pavement you feel
it
the powertrain even though we have the
bigger and more powerful of the engines
is uninspiring there's good power there
but it never comes on in a terribly
enthusing way that said the overall ride
quality aside from the stiffness of the
suspension is very good I don't get any
wallow this way I don't get any
porpoising this way which some trucks
will do to you it's tight as a drum
things are ergonomically well done big
buttons and knobs you can run everything
with your gloves on and sight lines all
around are pretty good in general this
is a truck that feels like it's got some
real capability you feel like you'll be
able to get done pretty much whatever
you need to unless you're a heavy truck
user and if so you don't need truck
advice from me and at the same time
you're gonna get a very comfortable
vehicle that is not onerous to get
around suburban environments
now pricing on a canyon is going to
start at $35,000 for four-wheel-drive
because it doesn't come in a super cheap
trim level four-wheel-drive means you're
also gonna get an SLE which is a pretty
nice trim then we're going to add two
things we want and two things we don't
we want Driver Alert for 400 bucks
that's forward collision and lane
departure we have to get the convenience
package for 500 bucks to get it we want
navigation for 495 and we have to get
Bose audio for 500 to get that all right
I don't really mind having Bose audio
and the price is fair all in Shia 37
