at Cupertino looking at the iPhone 5s
now this is the other of the two phones
there's also the iPhone 5c and the 5s is
successor to last year's iPhone 5 and
it's the leader of the pack technically
this has got an a7 processor it's also
got a new camera that's got updated
abilities to scan and pick your best
photos and it's got a larger sensor area
but it also has a very interesting new
home button called touch ID that's going
to kind of be the talk of this new phone
it senses your fingerprint and does it
to integrate who replace your password
and also allow you to log in pay for
stuff in iTunes and could be an
interesting way to tie together security
into a neat package
it's a capacitive home button that's
down here that bakes in under a little
sapphire crystal lens and steel it's got
the fingerprint sensor right there you
can set it up to knowledge your
fingerprint on whatever finger you
choose and you start spinning it around
the whole period of setting it up really
only takes about what seemed like a
dozen to 20 presses and then you're good
to go and then the login seems pretty
instantaneous the 5s is available in the
same capacities as last year 16 32 64 at
the same prices as well so you're
looking at potentially a vastly improved
speed and graphics phone and with two
very interesting elements the sensor and
the camera and a little extra wrinkle
the m7 processor for scanning and being
aware of your motions now the ideas that
we used for health apps and love to keep
an eye on this and see if this could be
kind of a secret sauce for a new
generation of health tracking and
fitness apps with the 5s and of course
it comes with iOS 7
I'm Scott Stein and that's a quick look
at the gold iPhone 5s which as you can
see is not quite as over the top bling
bling as you might think it's a pretty
subtle shade of gold here also available
in silver and Space Gray</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
