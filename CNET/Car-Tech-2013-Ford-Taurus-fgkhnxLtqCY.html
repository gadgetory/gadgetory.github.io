a crossover oh it's not but kind of
biggish isn't it
in fact it's Ford's remaining large
sedan now with the death of my dear
beloved Crown Vic behind us let's roll
excel in the 2013 Ford Taurus limited
check detect good grief the Taurus is
big it's got these massive lines all
around it also has to be big in another
way in the entire class of full-size
sedans take a look at the 2014 Impala
the newly redesigned Toyota Avalon and
the heavily revives Chrysler 300 the
Taurus can no longer be a car that you
ride in only when you rent or visit your
grandparents and this generation
certainly goes way beyond that now
getting in the Taurus is like sliding
into the tub not wet but really high and
enveloping all around you man look at
this big high beltline up here an even
higher brow line across the top of the
dash these sort of projections here also
exude mass the whole the whole dash T
does over here Ford keeps sort of
improving the responsiveness and to some
degree the cleanliness of the buttons in
that interface but they still have a
ways to go these are an issue these four
zones around here are like what Audi
does except they're hard to get to look
how deep and tight the bezel is around
here if you want to get to one of those
you've really got to arc your wrist and
use your fingertip let's get specific
over here on the media side you've got
all the major sources notice that was
kind of a slow transition that's also
something they have to address AM and FM
with HD radio sirius satellite radio a
single disc slot here for optical down
here I've got one of my two USB ports
being used and that's where my iPod
lives and then you've got to scroll down
the menu you can find even more here
there's my droid setup for bluetooth
streaming I have SD card playback as
well and some AV RCA input jacks I want
to see one thing Ford does really well
HD radio is really great on a Ford head
unit everything comes in and
nothing you don't want my indicator that
I have a second HD channel if I hit tune
I end up going to dot - for this station
if I want to tag that song so I can have
it in iTunes later to prompt me to buy
it there's the button right there that's
sending a tag to my iPod and you have an
EZ HD radio on/off up there which you're
going to use when you're in fringe
coverage areas because going between HD
and analog is really annoying in the
current version of sync you get text
messages flashed on the screen you can
have them read to you or read them on
said screen and there's a bunch of
canned replies available navigations up
here not much has changed it's via SD
card so you can add it later by going to
the dealer and spending 800 bucks for
the card and sticking it in there I like
that flexibility I like what they've
done for traffic this is something all
automakers struggle with how do you
place the red yellow or green ink if you
will on the road to show its traffic
status Ford's done it with kind of
glowing shoulders around the traffic
area leaving them free to use a
consistent color for the actual roadway
itself our car has adaptive cruise
control so you end up with a button over
here that you won't always have
that's called gap and that's where when
you turn on the adaptive cruise you see
four bars in front that little car
indicator there and that's where you set
the distance you're going to follow it's
a relative thing I'm sure in the manual
it tells you roughly how many feet those
are that also ties in to what we have
here which is a forward collision alert
system if you're driving along and
you're closing too fast on a car in
front of you this little thing right
here you see that that's a projector it
looks kind of like a tail light it
projects right up on the windshield
right there like a very simple head-up
display that puts a big old tail light
right in your face it's coming off your
dash and of course it beeps and blares
at you what it doesn't do though is
apply the brakes it does however
pre-charge them so they really grab when
you do wake up and get on them I thought
about this and it's almost not so much
as collision avoidance technology as
liability transfer technology because
once this thing beeps and your brakes
are supercharged you jump on them and
this car just stops instead of hitting
the car in front of you you're going to
get rear-ended but in most states that's
their fault
now our car limited has what's
considered the base engine on the tour I
these days and it's an upgraded
modernized v6 no turbo charging on that
EcoBoost stuff it's simply a very modern
v6 sitting sidesaddle of course
front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive we
have the former the numbers 288
horsepower 254 foot-pounds of torque the
car weighs about four thousand thirty
pounds on a chunky gets up to 60 in 6.9
seconds not bad by any stretch mpg is
1929 now the more interesting and
brand-new engine option this big old
Taurus is a little turbocharged EcoBoost
four-cylinder yeah believe it or not it
would have about 17 percent less
horsepower but twelve percent better mpg
by my calculations that $1,000 option
that's right it cost more for the
smaller engine you'd earn back in about
three years so it's a reasonable
alternative to consider and I'd like to
get my hands on one Sue's we do or
report back
now the first thing to remember about
driving a Taurus is that it's a Taurus
if you get too obsessed with skid pad
adhesion and slalom times you missed the
point of this car it's a big roomy semi
luxurious four-door sedan what I find
they've done really well on this vehicle
is that I've got a comfortable ride road
input but not too much you could never
call this car numb and it's handling and
at the same time maintains the comfort
while still having responsive handling
when you get into a turn onto a smaller
road where you press it not to its
limits because this car isn't about its
limits but press it to enjoy the road
some degree does a very nice blending of
comfort and responsiveness very good a
less successful blending is of this
really wonderful motor there's great
smooth Torquay linear power there it
sounds great revving up but it gets
bogged down in a transmission and a
bunch of chips and engine control
computers that just seem to always be
figuring out what they want to do in a
committee meeting common to a lot of
cars it's too bad in this car because
there is such a great v6 up front
okay let's price this big boy 33:9 for a
limited v6 front-wheel drive on top of
that you're gonna want to add package
301 a it's a good value for twenty seven
hundred bucks you get heated and cooled
front seats the bliss blind spot cross
traffic alert on your but Sony premium
audio and the push-button start which I
could live without but it's in there now
seven ninety five on top of that buys
you that little tiny SD card but that
unlocks a pretty darn good navigation
system with great traffic display 1195
gets you the adaptive cruise control
with the forward collision alert all in
done up seen that style you're a tick
below 40,000 that's not a bad value for
a car that I think drives very nicely
and has got good - great tech all the
way through it the problem is a Taurus
has no cachet you got to buy this car
because you like it not because they do
