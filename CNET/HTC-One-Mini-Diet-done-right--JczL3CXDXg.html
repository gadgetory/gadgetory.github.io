in the case of the HTC one mini here it
actually means less and that ain't all
bad I'm Jessica doll court for cnet
going to show you around the HTC One
mini so this phone is actually only
slightly smaller than the HTC One
original but there are a lot of
differences with it it is definitely
mid-tier mostly with the internal specs
a little bit with the outside to you can
see that there are still aluminum
accents and the body looks really
beautiful looks a lot like the HTC One
still has a premium feel but it's got
plastic accents around the rim so it
isn't all metal it also has a slightly
different power button that does not
have an IR blaster built in it so you
cannot use this to remotely control your
TV the phone has a 4.7 inch 720p HD
screen really nice and pretty to look at
very bright it comes with HTC sense 5 as
the custom interface on top of the
Android 4.2 point2 operating system the
processor is a little slower 1.4
gigahertz dual-core versus a 1.7
gigahertz quad-core on the original one
so also got 16 gigabytes of storage
inside instead of 32 and there's no
microSD card slot another thing that's
missing NFC the cameras are about the
same there's a 4-megapixel ultrapixel
camera on the back with flash on the
front you've got a slightly smaller 1.6
megapixel front-facing camera instead of
2 megapixel front-facing camera in the
US the mini sells exclusively with AT&amp;amp;T
for ninety-nine dollars I think it's a
really great value for a phone
especially when that looks this
beautiful it's definitely one of my
favorites in this price point so if
you're looking for a slightly cheaper
alternative to the HTC One this is
definitely your phone I'm tastic adult
