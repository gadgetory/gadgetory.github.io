the labs where I work and if you're
wondering why I'm happy all the time
because that's half amount of soda I
drink every day and I promise you at
home I'm a lot more tidy now that is not
the first surprise of the day the actual
surprise is this baby right here
the my net and 100 HD router now is a
surprise because it's not coming from
Netgear or Cisco or trailer or dealing
it's come from WD yes the company that
makes storage devices this rare it's
very first that marked the move of WD 2
networking so let's check it out now
this router is quite different from
others I've seen first of all on the
back here you can see there are seven
not four seven Gigabit LAN port and one
one port there also two is free port
right here to host printer and extra
hard drive on the front here the router
has a few LED light to show the status
of the network connection the power the
internet and also the WPS which allows
the router to connect to one client
without having to deal with the password
on the bottom here the rarer has a
pre-loss fan which only work when the
router gets hot in my testing though the
router never got hot enough for the fans
to work as you can see here the router
has four rubber feet to sit on any
surface is also won't mount ebal
now the second special thing about the
new router is is web interface which is
one of the most responsive I've seen
with the interface you can control and
manage the routers features including is
very special feature called the
fast-track + QoS now this feature
detects and prioritized the internet
traffic based on the type traffic for
example it would give more bandwidth to
streaming than downloading by itself now
I try that feature out it'll work
actually very well the router also
support other features such as parental
control firewall and the ipv6 now the
minor is a Troodon band and 900
meanings offer the for a 50 megabit per
second on both foggy hood and 2.4
gigahertz bands in my testing the my net
offer very interesting performance to
say the least but that and more
information go check out the full video
dot-com
once again my name is demo and this has
been the first look at the very first
networked device from WD the my net and
my hundred HD router</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
