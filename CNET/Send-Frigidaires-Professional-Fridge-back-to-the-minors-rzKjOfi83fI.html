I'm taking a look at the Frigidaire FP
BC to 277 RF this is a twenty two point
six cubic feet French door refrigerator
it's counter depth and it's part of
frigidaires professional line of
appliances it's 3,500 bucks so it's
pretty expensive and this has a lot to
do to justify the lofty price tag
especially since it's $900 more than the
comparable Frigidaire Gallery we've
already reviewed and here's the thing
it's actually really similar to that
gallery take a look at the interior of
the Frigidaire Professional now take a
look at the interior of the gallery nine
hundred bucks more and I have a lot of
trouble telling them apart it includes a
lot of the same features the folding
shelf I really like the flip up shelf it
even has the same smudge-proof stainless
exterior but you're paying nine hundred
extra bucks and basically you get these
different looking handles a little bit
of a different display and controls on
this inner LCD panel here that's it and
here's the kicker the Frigidaire Gallery
was twenty six hundred dollars and we
didn't think it was worth that this one
is 35 so the math really doesn't add up
the probe does improve on the gallery's
performance but slightly and the middle
shelf and the top shelf of the main body
of the fridge still run warm the FDA
advises against keeping spoiler Bowl
foods above 40 degrees on the default
setting of 37 degrees that middle shelf
and top shelf ran over 40 this is also
counter depth so it's designed to blend
in make it look almost like a much more
expensive built-in fridge for a lot less
I'm not a big fan of the trend though
you're sacrificing space for style and
paying more for it so look this isn't a
bad fridge the touch panel works well
the light is pleasant looking under the
dispenser but there's just nothing
that instills me with a sense of
enthusiasm and for $3,500 that really
really should be it does undercut the
prices of the high-end models of the
competition but it also can't keep up
for more please be sure to check out my
full review on cnet.com for seen it I'm
