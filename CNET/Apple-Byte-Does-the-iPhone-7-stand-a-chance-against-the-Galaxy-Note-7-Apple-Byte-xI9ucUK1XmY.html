the Apple bite with your weekly dose for
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple this week
Samsung dropped the note seven and the
big a has to be a little concerned now
Apple won't have an OLED screen until
the rumour 2017 timetable and don't
expect it to have HDR tech Plus iris
scanning that's rumored in 2018 and
samsung knows that are winning they
ripped on Apple for charging 99 bucks
for the Apple pencil while their s-pen
comes with the note 7 but you know
they're really feeling themselves after
this dig do you wanna know what else
that comes with an audio jack
I'm just saying oh it's like oh that
actually hurt but one thing Apple can be
happy about at least that employees make
a lot more noise when a new product is
introduced it is my pleasure to
introduce the samsung galaxy note 2 7
uh-huh
now Apple will still sell a gazillion
units but if the rumors are true there's
not a single feature the new iPhones
will have that can top what the note 7
has right now and that's a sad Apple
all right Apple has released the 4th
beta to developers for all of its
upcoming software platforms including
iOS 10 TV OS watch shows trace in yes
Mac OS Sierra but the big buzz from the
updates comes out of iOS 10's fourth
beta and the over 100 new emojis they've
added to the mix with more diverse
options female versions of athletes a
rainbow flag for LGBTQ pride and the gun
emoji now looks like a safe Green water
gun unfortunately redheads are still
missing a marginalized and
misrepresented group in the world of
emojis and to offer my support for them
I created my own emoji for all you
redheads hashtag redhead emojis matter
now Apple put out a new TV ad
positioning Apple's iPad pro as a
computer just when you think you know
what a computer is and sure it's a type
of computer and you all know I have a
huge man crush on my iPad Pro it's my
favorite Apple product in a long time
but for my use its keyboard cases junk
and there's no way I'm able to do video
editing script writing Photoshop and
multitasking on it like I can on my
computer now I know there's some of you
who just web browser email a word
process and you use the iPad but the
surface pro is the only tablet that can
really replace a computer right now hey
Apple get on working on a hybrid OS and
then we can talk and the iPad is still a
media consumption device for me and it's
not replacing a computer any time soon
also if you've been wondering what's
been holding Apple back from getting a
TV streaming service the answer is Apple
The Wall Street Journal details how
Apple has come to the table with content
providers and TV networks for serious
talks on at least five different
occasions since 2009 and it's been
apple's arrogance in the belief that hey
where apple that's prevented them from
striking deals it's just what I've
suspected their hubris and demands
aren't reasonable and the TV industry is
doing fine with or without Apple now
one account of the many meetings from
the journal described how Apple's Eddy
Cue arrived to a plan meeting with Time
Warner CEO and others 10 minutes late
wearing jeans and tennis shoes with no
socks and a Hawaiian shirt no socks
people that sounds more like Eddy PU now
the other execs were all in suits and TV
execs feel Apple has no idea how the
industry works while Eddy PU has said
the TV industry is overly complicated
which really translates to they won't do
what we want
now sling TV and Playstation of you have
both figured it out for the past two
years but Apple hasn't and they're in
need of another revenue stream so good
luck to you Apple wear socks next time
and you even made iPad nano socks a long
time ago so uh where are those all right
rumors still point to the next Apple
watch to be announced and released this
year it might even show up at the
September event digit Times reports the
second gen Apple watch will feature a
one glass solution display instead of
the current glass on glass technology
now the new tech would eliminate one
layer of glass from the display and
could allow Apple to save a small amount
of internal space while also reducing
the weight of the watch so we'll keep a
watch on this now Tim Cook also
announced on Twitter that July was a
record-breaking month for the App Store
with the highest ever monthly Billings
and money paid to developers it's pretty
obvious that's almost exclusively tied
to pokemons go or if you're Tim Cook you
pronounce it pokey mango like multiple
times during Apple's earnings come on
Timmy it's not even that hard and you
know what that's a bad apple and try not
to fall directly on your iPhone
everybody a Sydney bicycle rider was
severely burnt when his iPhone exploded
in his back pocket after he fell off his
bike and landed where the iPhone was now
warning this might be a little graphic
for some of you so I'll give you a few
seconds to close your eyes all right one
two okay there it is Gareth clear
suffered third-degree burns which
required skin grafts and apples not
directly to blame but anyone who gets
burnt on their booty by a battery that's
just a bad apple
now batteries have been shown to be
prone to exploding due to high impacts
and there's nothing he could have done
other than getting a better bike like
seriously was he just a bad bike rider
or was it a bad bike okay I'm kidding
but the good thing is that he's okay and
it's just something to be aware of all
right that's gonna do it for this week's
show we didn't have enough time to
announce the winner so the air view
contest is still good for one more week
you can always email us at the Apple
byte at cnn.com or to me at Brian Tom
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
you all next time for another bite of
the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
