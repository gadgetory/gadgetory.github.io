shield giving the streaming gaming TV
box many of the same capabilities of the
Google home speaker now you can talk
into thin air and shield will respond on
your TV
opening control apps or even operate
smart home devices unlike a Google home
shield doesn't have a speaker built-in
so it relies on the speakers in your TV
or home theater system to talk back and
how does it listen through the game
controller a little microphone on top of
the controller is always listening for
the okay Google or hey Google wake words
just like on a Google home speaker my
brief tests that work well when I left
on the table or otherwise exposed but
don't expect good results if you leave
it inside your cabinet or too close to
your TV's speaker and of course you can
always use assistant by talking into the
shields included remote
either way numerous voice commands are
supported including being able to turn
on and off the TV launch apps and simply
sang the name of a show to start
watching immediately for this to work
the app has to be supported HBO and
Netflix are for example but Amazon Vudu
and Plex are not yet YouTube's
integrations excellent and you can also
launch music videos and look for clips
using voice 2 and Google assistant a
shield works with music apps like Google
Music and Spotify you can even play
songs with the TV turned off but you'll
have to leave your soundbar or receiver
on shield also integrates Google
assistant with smart things for smart
home control a separate USB dongle
coming soon for 30 bucks attached to the
device and adds ZigBee and z-wave radios
to command numerous smart things gear
including lights blinds and even garage
door sensors you can also control plenty
of smart home devices that are
compatible with Google home directly
Nvidia will also come out with a little
plug-in device soon called Nvidia spot
that works as a speaker and far-field
mic so you don't have to rely on the
controller the shield is relatively
expensive at 200 bucks for the version
that includes the game controller but
even before Google assistant was one of
the most capable livingroom devices on
the market now it's even better the free
upgrade is available today for all
shield devices although to use it
hands-free you'll need to have the new
controller</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
