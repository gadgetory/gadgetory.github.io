after show
I'm Patrick I'm Lynne and I'm Caitlin
and today we're gonna be talking about
season 2 episode 3 titled virtue Fortuna
which in Latin or Italian means virtue
and fortune yeah and we had to look this
up but as a Poli Sci major I totally
know what this means because it was
there are two major concepts in
Machiavelli's The Prince and I'm just
kidding I actually don't know what these
things mean but no but they roughly
translate to virtue which is not like
Mauro virtue but just basically kind of
you are aware with all your resources
your powerfulness over your own life
sometimes your own ruthlessness and
fortune and not that doesn't mean wealth
but basically luck and chance and those
are some things that the creators of
Westward wanted to keep us in mind in
the episode and that's a theme that is
going to come up a lot and like all the
episodes if you've not seen the actual
episode what are you doing watching our
show
maybe admiring your beautiful kitchen
space but watch this they'll come back
and make sure you do it otherwise we're
gonna have lots of spoilers so let's
just start right at the top I mean what
about that how about that music to that
oh yeah so right at the top what was the
music we heard let's talk about that
that was seven nation army by the White
Stripes originally but on a sitar yeah
so perfectly in line with this new
British colonial India world where these
colonial India world that look badass
I also liked sorry I also like a little
bit of how they did the West world theme
song in the sitar music - yeah and the
q7 nation army because it's on the White
Stripes album elephant I don't know
probably not okay so we see something
that's nothing we've seen before and it
was a giant this colonial state in India
which was exciting but also a little
weird it's beautiful
it's a little uncomfortable a little
problematic because it's kind of that
kind of era in that history where it's
like what are we gonna see next like
antebellum world like how far are we
going and he's like fantasy world like
hey before we were horribly bad we were
just a little bad by enslaving the
entire culture and race of another part
of the world even westerns had issues
like we're seeing that they're picking
out these areas of humanity and yet they
were all problematic like we know we're
gonna see Shogun world even that had
problems like we're in creating these
fantasy worlds aren't they kind of just
giving it us humans exactly what they
want which is that ruthlessness and that
crazy madness of a park experience they
should make a crazy world where it's
like everyone's nice to each other and
that would be why technologically insane
- oh that would just be called a retail
world because he want you to buy shit
it's like oh hey black person oh yeah
all right we meet a very attractive
gentleman and a very attractive lady and
they have this insane like seduction
scene with a gun that was cool and weird
and sexy and so confusing I just have to
say if anyone watches Rick and Morty
there's this whole scene where Beth
tries to shoots mr. poopy butt pants I'm
getting that wrong and I'm sorry
poopy butthole yeah mr. poopy butthole
and it's like the way to determine if
he's like one of them is she shoots him
and she's mistaken so welcome to the
Rick and Morty okay and we jump to that
and one of my favorite moments that led
into like the basically the scene right
after that was the woman basically being
hunted and chased by a Bengal tiger
she's basically runs out of the park and
trips kind of like a grocery store laser
beam thing but supposedly opening a door
she's just running across there's a
bridge but she jumps down next to the
bridge and kind of ends up on this
overlook and River which ties right back
to the first episode what do you guys
think of the Bengal tiger were you guys
excited about that or is it just me
I like that it was kind of a curved
bottom remember when we first saw we're
like oh my god it's Shogun world all
this stuff and we just assumed that it
was just gonna be you know I we already
knew that there was more than two parts
but we just thought in this season it
would only explore those two parts
and then for them to throw a curveball
it's like here's this third Park that no
one was really talking about and we're
gonna make this premiere before we
really go into Shogun world I really
liked it I just liked you know the
creator's kind of keeping us on our toes
I think too that our when we're looking
at how the Bengal also crossed that
laser division is really important not
just because now we know all the parts
are stacked on top of each other more or
less but because now we know how truly
off the rails all of the hosts are right
down to the animals that was curious to
me because if it did show that at least
across parks these robots are these
hosts are having some sort of free will
or being turned off from their normal
storylines I think the reason why the
Bengal went after the unnamed lady is
because that's its natural instinct is
to hunt ok I didn't think it was going
this deep under what Bernard's she'll be
because now we catch up with him and
Charlotte and they've obviously are
being reunited right and kind of
backtracking through some memories what
happened yeah
Bernard is an interesting case one
because he's struggling with his own
consciousness and how much other people
know we've seen in these last episodes
that we aren't sure if everyone knows
that he's Bernard the host they've all
kind of been treating him like Bernard
the human boss in charge of things so I
think a lot of what we're seeing is him
trying to figure out who he is to those
human
I think that's influencing his decisions
and how he's you know trying to help in
certain situations I killed them all of
them versus when he meets Hale and the
commandos she's with she's like hey
where's Peter Abernathy seems like he
just keeps getting away from us Bernards
like I what when am i what's happening
can I just acknowledge here just how
beautiful for performance Jeffrey Wright
gives yeah I mean I thought lassies you
did amazing but this season at least the
first year we've seen so far there's so
many nuances they're kind of different
shades of Barnard some yeah Arnold even
off-camera and the second episode but
moving back into plot of the episode so
but I think the next big thing we see is
also dolor
and we it's kind of like mostly episode
kind of revolves around her story I feel
like a lot of it is split between the
two Abernathy's Dolores Abernathy and
her father Peter both of them all
together but yeah I mean we were kind of
talking about virtue and fortune and how
that has influenced Dolores's
decision-making and how we see her
before we talk more about the
Abernathy's a character connects Peter
Abernathy and Bernard from season 1 was
Elsie Hughes and we got to talk to the
actor who plays her Shannon Woodward and
are out of the kitchen interview you
know I think I think you're right about
one thing I think Elsie has always felt
like the suffering and things were
completely unnecessary now she
definitely didn't see them as people and
me because they weren't autonomous but
she certainly there was a there's a
there's a she's a heavy moral code you
know she's true blue and that's not
gonna change like Elsie is still truly
you know that's that's just who she is
we we try to shoot kind of
chronologically some things are not shot
chronologically because of people's
schedules or whatever or but you know a
lot of times it's like all this takes
place in one location we're gonna shoot
all of this out but it does kind of go
chronologically there are certain things
where like it takes forever to get to
one giant sequence because it's gonna
take three months to build a set you
know sometimes those sets are so
elaborate it takes time but so for
various different reasons it's out of
order but in a chronological style you
know like it they try you know no I like
to read the scripts I like to read the
scripts I mean I love the show so it's
like every time it gets sent it feels
like a new novel got set to me and I'm
like Skye pull the car over put it in
park read the script
yeah I didn't know Bernard was a host
that and I'd been working with Jeffrey
non-stop and I was just I mean I had
certainly noticed the difference in our
tone
and at one point I remember in a
rehearsal I remember what scene it was
it was was in episode 5 it was the
beginning of five and it was like the
scene where I get upset with Bernard for
taking cue inside and I like were
marching down a hallway and we had done
a rehearsal of it and I changed my tone
and I took it down like more like how
Geoffrey was behaving and Lisa a joy was
like nuna no what no no don't do that I
was like why and she's like no no you
know what let him be legato and you can
be staccato and and that and that was
you know they kept me on track without
saying like no you're human keep going
like a crazy person the way you were
before so yeah there's lots of stuff
like that but I'm thankful for it I
think it made my performance more
interesting for me I've already had the
experience now you know like we do at
work we are the first audience so like
we all talked about it with each other
and we get into it but for us you know
now that experience is over and now it's
just kind of like you want them to have
a fun time so it's kind of like now I
will say the more interesting thing at
least that happened last time is that
there were several occasions where like
people that I would need would then
explain their theories to me and I'd be
like oh okay
and then they'd keep going and they'd be
so righteous about it and and they would
I might be like you're close but and
then they would act like I didn't know
better they try to convince me and I was
like you know I read the script right
you know I know what happens like
there's no negotiating like it it was
really funny like that like people would
tell me their theories as if they were
an authority figure as if I had no idea
what I was talking about it's like I'm
not gonna tell you but I you are wrong
like you're definitely wrong yeah I mean
my friends don't even like to know when
I'm working and I'm like listen you have
to choose between liking me or my show
like do you want to be in my life or not
but it's hard to keep stuff secret you
know I want to tell people about my work
day just like everyone else so it's
geared to but you know we have each
other at work so that's
welcome back to the kitchen so let's
talk about Peter Abernathy and his
reunion with Delores yeah that was kind
of sweet even though they're two robots
are two hosts that actually was a
touching reunion between a father and
daughter and then fast-forward one scene
we see Bernard come in and diagnose and
we learned that there's actually a giant
encrypted file that he's carrying and
that the reason his character is messing
up is because it's a thinly written
character yep we have no idea what's
contained in all that information
theories range from all of the host data
to some specific host to all that DNA
and stuff that we saw in episode 1 no
idea what it is but we do know that the
this probably isn't the first time that
Charlotte has tried to get it out of the
park you'll remember in season 1 we saw
one of the hosts trying to like upload
and link to a satellite oh the one that
was like smashing his head against
exactly head smashing exactly that plan
didn't work out to Charlotte's right
theory being perhaps he went a little
crazy because he just had so much data
in his head and that could be what we're
saying with Peter Abernathy now too so
that 256 with like 5 12 of him away from
boulders and he'll be fine but then we
have that also a very touching moment
which or sad moment - it's Bernard
trying to help Peter like figure out
encrypting the file but he's really
breaking down his hands are shaking like
robot spinal fluid the Elmer's glue they
caught what did they got cortical fluid
cortical flu I think it might be a more
scientific but yeah I felt like yeah why
not just get the syringe and take some
still sort of Peters heat honey isn't it
she's like she's the one who does he's
like hey can I borrow some of your cool
well they don't replenish it like you
can't just take it from someone else
like it's like it's like skimming a
bottle of whiskey just put a little more
water in their shoes a little walk rate
it don't rate anybody yes
and everything's more interesting to me
than Bernard and Peters interaction was
him talking to Dolores how Dolores is
like oh you don't remember but guess
what and she's kind of like oh you've
never been out of the park have you
Bernard he had been out of the park
you have no idea he was a great guy also
you are so much more powerful than you
know just unleash a but I do like I
think he was the one during this
dialogue that he says that you don't
know that you're just the speck of dust
in this world and she's like well I'm
getting out of this world but I mean
really living in this world this is also
a speck of dust and everything also
doesn't really matter well yeah yeah he
had like a lot of like like what are you
doing Dolores like where are you going
and it seems like she knows even he's
not necessarily communicating the exact
details to anybody but he's just
communicating just enough detail to get
other people to do what she needs
whether that's you know smart leadership
or whether that's manipulation I don't
know and that takes us to the big huge
battle at the end which we really like
because we see the theme come back come
back so which is basically virtue and
Fortuna and it's basically kind of
explaining we see her for the first time
being a good military strategist before
she was just I need this army I need
this army and Boop and we were like okay
well what she's gonna do with it and she
ends up betraying this is better Otto's
in a really cool ruthless way yeah and
she's like not everyone deserves to go
to this valley beyond which it's kind of
like Dolores is being basically judge
jury and executioner she's the one
deciding who gets to go who doesn't and
that's kind of hypocritical of Dolores I
would have to say okay she's not giving
everyone a choice why do you think she
had them killed or set that trap for
them
well this because a certain amount of
people news who die in the front lines
so that the explosion could go off and
then her people could escape yeah I
think was just to let her and her men
yeah escape that's it and by blocking
that door none of the you know delos
employees could get in my only question
is like why didn't they go around wait a
sec is clearly clear that some of them
do get in and they are able to then grab
Peter Abra happy and it just shows that
like no matter how much
we're with on how much power and
initiative that you have in certain
plans there is sometimes you run into a
bad luck there's skip things that Dargis
going not your way so in terms of
Dolores being this kind of Machiavellian
leader we do see that she is trying to
limit the amount of risk but she doesn't
always succeed yeah what do you guys
think of like the her Army's uniform
like the hoodies that I'd be the guy
that back in line can we just change
uniforms we're in the hot desert do we
have to wear a blood hit on her head
that's how the people die I don't know
but I really like Angela's costume my
favorite costume absolutely and how
about seeing her shoot that gun and blow
up all that it was just so badass
I like that I'm liking her a lot this
season and then what I also like
someone's got a cosplay like yeah hip
hippy Western chic robot gun plus Jesus
crown yeah yeah that's not easy to walk
around in you know I'm going to
comic-con
Oh Oh get on it okay and then I will get
the black thing and be part of your
soldier and we'll see who is more
uncomfortable so another thing that
happen is we see a moment and I think
it's a significant moment of Dolores
commanding Teddy to take out one of the
soldiers and it's you know that she was
gonna watch because there's like she's
like if you're like the wall she's just
like I was so sad that she watched I
thought this was like a good time for
him to do what you want to do and I feel
like if she caught him she was he's dead
I mean I really like because I thought
up into this episode up and said that
scene that she he was basically going to
be like Dolores is reluctant strong are
men that every time someone's gonna mess
with dolorous he was always there he's
gonna punch them out and that was kind
of his role and I and you could always
see him struggling about it so I liked
the fact that he made an executive
decision that might end up costing him
but he did it on his own and he was like
go and I'm like yes Teddy you're
thinking on your own and then you see
him being caught by dealers it's like oh
you're gonna die soon so right we're
thinking like it's no less about if he's
a BD in a disobedient and more about him
making that choice so maybe there is not
a consequence from Dolores I mean in
Jade Western their problem would be or
there'd be like a climactic scene where
later she has to confront him and that
would be the reason she feels capable of
killing him or stopping him but at least
in this moment we're not here about that
which is what I also like let's talk
favorite moments so what were moments
that you absolutely loved in this
episode I really liked when Maeve and
Hector were caught holding hands by way
he's like what is what is going on I
didn't write you guys to Pauline and
they're like well you know sometimes we
were we like each other so we're going
against your writing we're going against
your programming but they still use some
of the lines that he wrote for them and
that that was alluded to earlier when
Maeve kind of talked about cutting off
his vest bits or whatever and he's like
I wrote that line for you and then
Hector said a very familiar line about
love and he's like I wrote that for you
so we realized we know that they're not
fully kind of swept clean of their old
kind of narratives but they are thinking
for them so I think it is another good
evidence that even one of the creators
one of the workers at Delos was like
what is this this is a like like a like
a father it's like no no no you guys
weren't supposed to fall in love with
the neighbor and that fact in a way that
they his kids and the kids have grown up
to be maybe some think at least
seemingly wiser than the creator and
that segues perfectly into one of my
favorite moments which was the return of
Armistice and our favorite line which
might be an allusion to Game of Thrones
she has a dragon so we have that and we
have the wolf form she's like episode 1
so again a lot of thing and yeah and
then we see her Oh
Bionic arms so we know that someone had
to put that arm on her whether it's her
probably it's your og army it's like we
always stuck in the door net basically
probably got the skin no armistice we
now learn is probably one of the
originals which I think we saw her in
the fuckin can dance that's right
can'tcan't like no and she's like
looking at shiny things but yeah seeing
her with a robot arm singer with the
flamethrower was one of my favorite
moments what are you what's your
favorite I think my favorite moment is
probably the ending where Maeve is like
oh it's snowing this is lovely and Lee's
like oh yeah we're probably at the edge
of the park like we'll be getting to
like the homesteaders next this is the
Klondike narrative and as I keep going
half the group well most of the group
sees like a fire out there and they go
oh let's go toward that just to see and
lease stops and he goes what is buried
in the snow and he gets in there and he
pulls out and it's the head of like a
samurai and he just goes oh shit and he
drops it and he runs to tell the group
like we gotta go we gotta go we gotta go
and then there's the guy swinging me
like how man was like Shh and I'm like
if someone's running to me like we gotta
go now my first sense thing would be
like oh well then we actually see a
samurai we are supposed to a warrior
coming at them and we cut sorry yep but
thinking about now it's like why would
he warn them and maybe I'm not
questioning his logic but maybe that
shows the position of going back to the
scene that you were talking about with a
Hecht with Hector and may that he does
have an investment in the post and stuff
and he does care about them so much and
that's why he warrants on versus like
screw this I'm running away
clearly there you ever see a fire in the
woods that you don't know about walk
around the other direction so what are
we hoping next like what are some
theories or hopes for some of the future
episodes here well I really like the
fact that Felix just back I really like
him and Armas who says he said and the
lab guy that nobody likes about whatever
but I feel like you need the lab guy
nobody likes ya it's a really wise name
to be the foil to Felix and to Maeve and
yet without that I don't think that
chemistry would work as well I know but
realistically I would just be like kill
that guy off he's he's we show that he
could betray people and throw people in
there by saying he was like complaining
about being cold and it's like go away
just say Felix enormousness
ah so you're hoping that that guy goes
away all right okay what about you Kayla
Witter something's are helping for I
want to know why Delores and Teddy are
headed back to Sweetwater
what did she let me there yeah
what did she leave there okay that she
has to find could it be the can I
thought about there's like no you're
laughing it's a keeping and a lot of
times we see the can in so many episodes
and it's such a key part of that story
but also Poppa Delos picks up the can
and tosses it was in episode two so
maybe there is something it's there for
pivotal moments I don't doubt it could
be the camera I hope it's like a little
treasure box I was thinking to be
serious I think it's gonna be like we
saw all of her pictures in that one
drawer may have had a drawer of like the
drawings of the guy she had the what the
cabinet of her paintings that were just
there and there and there that they
often cleared out that we learned later
they just you know keep taking them out
she just keeps making them I feel like
she's hidden something in her house
that'll be like a key or a direction or
something you're doing right with it
yeah that cans gonna have unit forward
for the door and the men in black is
gonna be like yo what's up you nail it
got it that's the how it's gonna guys
right here the can is the way the show
can is the key
speaking of cans sometimes drinks come
in cans but today our drinks actually
came via Caitlin and yet another
Westworld morning after after show
cocktail corner today we're making a gin
and tonic variation because much of the
episode took place in british colonial
india world new park that we're seeing
and the gin and tonic was actually
something that british colonial military
men drank since they needed their daily
dose of quinine which is in tonic water
to be fair i
tonic water so we are gonna use ginger
beer today I'm gonna start with a shaker
or a stirring glass of ice we're using
st. George gin made here in Alameda
California and then I'm gonna use a
little
domaine de Ken tone which is ginger
liqueur
take my glass and pop in to lime slices
stir the gin in the court pour that in
there
top with ginger beer
nice little straw to stir it all up and
there you go so thank you Caitlyn's for
making these lovely drinks you know add
a big gym face years back but now more
of a mezcal girl which you were nice
enough to accommodate for last pastry
yeah and I had a big stay away from Lynn
during her gin phase with hopefully see
what happens today also for you guys if
you like it you see you subscribe to us
you can subscribe at the bottom one of
these yes here and for more Westworld
content cnet.com slash
hey if you like us which we hope you do
you can follow us on twitter - I met at
Lily LA with three suppose everything
was taken I'm at trick Holland that's
Patrick on without the first two letters
