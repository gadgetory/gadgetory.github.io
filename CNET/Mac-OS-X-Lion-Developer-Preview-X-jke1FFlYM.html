and we're gonna show you some of the
newest bells and whistles in the
developer version of Mac OS 10 lion in
action which is expected to come out
sometime later this summer plus we're
gonna also show you a lot of hidden gems
that you just haven't seen so let's
start off with a few of the sexy ones
first up is launch pad which gives you
instant access to your apps iOS style
you can change through the launch pad
view by clicking on the icon on the dock
you can drag apps on top of each other
to create folders just like an iOS and
you can move apps around the way that
you want now there's also a lot more
multi-touch support in Lion so you can
pinch with four fingers to bring up the
launch pad display and then spread them
out to return to the desktop now this
can be very fun and also very
time-consuming Mission Control is
another new feature that allows you to
look at everything that is running on
your Mac just swipe upwards with three
or four fingers you can see your desktop
all windows from your multiple apps
group together full screen apps and
spaces is basically like expose on
steroids but it's definitely one of my
favorite features so far now we
mentioned full screen apps and there are
a few built into Mac OS 10 lion like
mail the calendar app and Safari you can
swipe back to your desktop or to other
full screen apps using three fingers but
the full screen experience is a nice
option and if you don't like it just
drag your mouse in the top right hand
corner and click now let's transition
into some of the new features in the
Finder Finder windows are now rounded on
every corner and you can resize the
window by clicking and dragging on any
of the four corners you also have a much
smarter search in the finder we all know
spotlight is very good for finding files
or words in a file but if you know the
type of file you're looking for type in
a file name like AIFF then you can
select to isolate the search by that
specific kind of file and then type in
the name of the file you want to find
another edition is viewing options in
the finder now I can still use the icon
list view columns view or Cover Flow
view but now I can view my files based
on their type so if I select all of my
files in the revamped source list I have
the option to view them by kind and
you'll see text image and movie files
separated or by size as well now if
you're in your applications you can view
by application category and it breaks
them down into internet productivity and
many
others also in the finder airdrop is a
new feature in line that makes it easy
to find computers on your local network
and drag and drop files over to them
you'll find this in the left-hand source
list column now dashboard has also
become its own space so if you swipe to
the right with all three fingers all
your widgets are there and you won't
have a confusing backdrop of your
computer alright let's jump into some
specific apps now we've shown you
multi-touch gestures already but Safari
also gets a few new Lion tricks if you
tap the trackpad with two fingers you'll
be able to zoom into specific text you
can also pinch to zoom into an area of a
webpage and if you swipe back left or
right with two fingers you'll see a new
animation that reveals the previous web
pages that you've looked at mail has
also been completely revamped with a
cleaner look and feel it now threads
your email just like on iOS devices
Apple calls it conversations and related
emails show up on a streamlined feed on
the right-hand side you also can click
on the number displayed to show the
entire list of emails there dates and
then directly jump into that email in
the conversation now inside of an email
data detectors allow you to preview
links without leaving the app and you'll
see new animations throughout the OS
like this one when you reply to an email
cool
now in the email preferences if new view
isn't really your cup of tea you have
the option to go back to the classic
mail layout and another kind of fun
feature is the ability to show a context
photo in the message list touching I
know and let's show off one more feature
called versions when you're working on a
document go to the file menu to save as
version Lion has the ability to auto
save changes to your files so from then
on you can click on the top right hand
corner of your document and it will
allow you to browse all the different
versions of the file in a time machine
like view then you can restore the file
if there's a previous version that you
wanted and voila it's like magic alright
that was a lot of eye candy and
information and there are plenty more
things we could show you but that's an
overview of some of the cool new
features that we can expect to see in
Mac OS 10 lion coming out this summer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
