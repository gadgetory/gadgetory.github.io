looking at the onkyo TX NR 646 receiver
while some Evancho's competitors have
gone for music streaming features this
year the NR 646 sticks to its home
cinema centric formula at the center of
this is support for the two newest
surround formats Dolby Atmos and des ex
which require the addition of height
speakers which can mean speakers which
have an up firing speaker built into
them the 646 looks similar to other on
Kiyo's of the past with a very stern
look and the familiar green LED readout
while most competitors have gone with
input selection knobs the onkyo has kept
its more user friendly source buttons
the remote control is also the same as
previous years and has the look of a
scientific calculator not the most
user-friendly design but it's okay once
you get used to it also not very
friendly is the on-screen display which
harks backs to the 1990s the receiver
now offers more inputs than last year
and extra HDMI bringing it to seven and
more analog ports as well plus it adds
Apple AirPlay for streaming from iOS
devices and Spotify Connect as a home
theater amp the focuses on movies and
compared head-to-head against one of its
biggest competitors the Sony SDR DN 10
60d Onkyo has a bigger more dynamic
sound the addition of a front high
channel for the few movies that do
support it is also fun but don't expect
it to change your life as a music hub
the onkyo isn't as strong as a Sony even
though they do sound similar but the
addition of a turntable phono input
might sway some people at around $600
the onkyo offers a lot of features and
dolby atmos is intriguing but the reason
to buy this is that it can do home
cinema really really well this has been
tied Pendlebury for cnet.com
