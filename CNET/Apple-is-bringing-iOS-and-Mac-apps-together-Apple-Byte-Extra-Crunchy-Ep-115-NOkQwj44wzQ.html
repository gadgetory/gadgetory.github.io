is Steven Beach a producer of the Apple
byte extra crunchy podcast with your
host mr. Brian Tom what's up everybody
welcome to show it's Apple byte extra
crunchy we keep it extra munching our
complimentary piece to our weekly show
you know how it is it's everything good
and bad inside the world of Apple just a
lot more in-depth and before we start
the show because people like to chime in
when they're watching live we got to
give props Orlando in Orlando Orlando in
our land Orlando in Orlando says what's
up all right
115 again you can call us to be a part
of show we actually got a lot of calls
but some are like really hard to hear so
we're not gonna play them and some are
just really long and made no sense
whatsoever so remember keep it tight
remember think about what you're gonna
say before you say it because I think
that helps like just grab your thoughts
together before you're calling right the
number yeah just like some bullet points
even 1-866 two six three eight that is
the number to call again we want to
remind you that this is the last show of
the year
we'll be back in about a month so not
much the good thing is not much crazy
Apple news happens during this whole CES
break but maybe there will we don't know
we won't be here we're gonna be what are
you gonna go on vacation Beach I'm going
to the LA for like five days gonna hit
Universal Studios yes I'm gonna go to
the back to the Bay Area though oh
you're gonna be in the bay I'm stoked
anyways enjoy it enjoy the time with
your loved ones friends families or
yourself this break but we will be gone
for a month but let's jump to the
stories really the lead story this week
is coming to us from Bloomberg I don't
know this made me this gave me an I roll
Beach here we go here's the headline
from Bloomberg mark governing company
all those friends over there Apple plans
a combined iPhone iPad and Mac apps to
create one user experience oh wow here
we go did anyone say Microsoft
they have they had to do this man Wow
totally had to do this cuz all their
stuffs segmented you know I didn't they
just had the uniform and yet they have
to unify everything unification yeah and
look you're right isn't it it is an
inevitability they've kind of been the
last they've been so stubborn about it I
want to hear in the comments people are
watching will kind of let you chime in
and kind of drop what you're doing we've
got some eye rolls already being posted
in the comments but here we go
Apple's aim is to let developers expand
iOS apps to Mac computers I'm kind of
laughing it inside a little bit now
here's the thing here's some of the
strategy behind it and we'll kind of
talk and break it down apple's customers
in the past of complain that some of
these like the Mac App Store apps they
get kind of the short end of the stick
they're not as and that people are no
matter what let's be honest developers
if you're gonna pick between App Store
and Mac store you're gonna go App Store
first you're not even gonna care about
the mac store as much but at the same
time there's some developers who've been
able to make a nice little niche in the
Mac store because there's not as much
love there okay so this is what's gonna
happen we've always talked about like oh
well Apple make a laptop with touch you
know capabilities on a screen or an iMac
with touch please this is the first this
is the first step to getting there yeah
building apps that work for both iOS
iPhone iPad and Mac at the same time in
addition to that the the belief is that
these apps will not only work with a
touch interface but they will be made to
work with a mouse as well a click
clicking point Mouse so starting is
according to this report starting as
early as next year
software developers will be able to
design a single application that works
with a type screen or mouse or trackpad
depending on whether it's running on the
iPhone or iMac or hardware that's
according to people familiar with the
matter and this is directly from
Bloomberg's report um currently
developers must design 2 different apps
what we've talked about one for iOS one
for the Mac Store that's not as
efficient and then also
by unifying these apps they could help
iOS and Mac OS kind of evolve and grow
as one like look this is literally what
Microsoft has been pushing Universal
apps that work both on even-even games
let's talk about Xbox that's the big one
that's the big one yeah right Xbox one
games such as cuphead Forza 7 and I
think Gears of War 4 at least off the
top of my head those are three titles
that work both on the console but if
you're a Windows 10 owner you can
directly download those apps games and
play them I can play them on a surface
with a Bluetooth controller yeah that
only is the games I mean that's that's
everything and then if they're gonna be
moving into AR and VR and all that stuff
they got to get onboard with the games
you know so this is all about this
universal app Apple is developing this
strategy is kind of the next major iOS
and Mac OS updates that will be
announced next year it's code the
project is codenamed marzipan according
to their sources marzipan is that a
sweet ol mini that's a little bit like
paste I love it's good which also brings
back one of my favorite Ben and Jerry
ice cream flavors did any of you ever
have mission so marzipan back in the day
do you know what I'm talking about okay
it was this amazing like almond cookies
and then like that sweet almond marzipan
swirls in it it was ridiculous and they
got rid of it and it's been gone for
like seven or eight years and I don't
know what to do it but they should bring
it back I'm just
this is a side request in case anyone
from Ben &amp;amp; Jerry's is listening this
podcast so they're calling it marzipan
like that that seems kind of like an
Android thing how they named everything
after food we had KitKat what do we have
now what is what's a new name for
Android so the secret project that is no
longer a secret marzipan is planned as a
multi-year effort it's gonna start
rolling out to developers as early as
next year and will most definitely
according to the support be announced at
the annual Developers Conference in the
summer this
is also what I found kind of interesting
too funny you you have to rewind a
little bit back in time but there was a
point in time specifically an apple has
always said if you've looked
historically when they have been
approached specifically about bringing
the two worlds together
they've outright said oh no iOS is a
separate experience from Mac OS they
offer different benefits and all this
are like saying dude just make an Apple
version of the surface pro and it'll be
sick right I mean a lot of people been
wanting that but instead they've
actually gone over to the surface Pro
because you can do so many more things
you can use
you know desktop based apps and run
these other you know use it as a tablet
as well so remember we made fun of this
in the show years ago Tim Cook had
argued that he kind of used this this
comparison and this is his quote you can
converge a toaster and a refrigerator
but those things are probably not going
to be pleasing to the user he said this
in 2012 Craig federighi also called the
blending of iOS and Mac OS a compromise
really compromise that's an ugly word I
gotta say something though about I don't
have a Microsoft Surface but I have a
Windows 10 laptop touchscreen and I
completely avoid all the the tile
applications you know what I mean like
the applications that are optimized for
both for both a laptop and a Microsoft
Surface like I avoid those I just want
the PC ones you know cuz they yeah
they're always kind of limited and they
look crappy so I think Microsoft can
definitely do a better job of
integrating and then to integrating
those into all their you know all their
their laptops and tablets but I do avoid
them so if if Apple can do it better
then I'll be all on board and it's
definitely gonna be all about the games
are people that are watching and
listening right now are you guys on
board with this I just want to see your
yes your nose your thumbs up a thumbs
down I think what's also interesting
will kind of get the pulse of everybody
but it's also interesting is by opening
this gateway to allow iOS apps to be
ported to or made for also Mac I think
you're gonna see two things you're gonna
get a flood of garbage cuz yeah how many
like you're going to get a flood of
garbage but did it like in any situation
with developers that care you're you you
will there will be developers like for
example affinity photo is one of the not
infinity not infinity war but affinity
photo it just was rewarded like one of
the best apps of the year really my
favorite app on the iPad pro giving me
complete like Photoshop control with a
pen stylus on an iPad it does work
cross-platform with the Mac based
desktop app but those are good examples
developers that you'll want them to make
an app that crosses over both iOS and
Mac OS so it will always come down the
developer who's gonna make the quality
stuff that's gonna come over would you
would you like to play a few games on
your Mac once in a while just while
you're shooting the breeze like I will
you wouldn't you yeah for sure I mean
that's that's gonna be the biggest deal
you know I'm also like stuff like you
know just like using Spotify or
something if you're like used to using
it a certain way on your phone all the
time and then you have to go and use it
on a desktop and you're actually like
using the website interface and stuff
it's always so much different and kind
of a more of a pain in the in the ass
you know so it would be nice to be able
to just use the app on your computer as
you would on your phone you know just I
think this yeah I think this was an
inevitable move for Apple was just one
of those things where users are like
when are you going to actually do this
and we're gonna see how this transition
happens I see people with thumbs up some
people are like yeah ok you know maybe
we'll see we'll see how it shakes out
but it is you know I think knowing Apple
and someone makes a great point here
caster B are they going to still censor
conservative apps or are they going to
really curate and only approve certain
apps that will go that'll kind of be a
part of this now new iOS Mac OS platform
because Apple likes to control their
platform more than anyone else it'll be
more stringent you know like more rules
because it has to meet the guidelines
for both the laptop and the and the
tablets and the phone so it's probably
be a lot more difficult for developers
actually
yeah Naveen Kumar Singh just put iOS
apps on a Mac already he's like just
yeah oh yeah and I think there's some
great examples where that would help
everyone out and again make this right
now we've talked about this this is the
most fragmented Apple's operating
systems have ever been when you have
different hardware doing different
things with different devices even from
something like an iPhone 8 to an iPhone
10 to an iPad
those are iOS devices that all use iOS
in three different ways it's time to
bring it together so I think it's a
really fascinating story and I think
that it's just this is a classic thing
where Apple will be so stubborn about
saying we're not gonna do this we're
never gonna do this this is not gonna be
how it is and then four or five years
later they decide to do it yeah and then
the general consumer is gonna say oh my
gosh
Apple made iOS apps for the Mac now and
that's like I know my desktops gonna be
messy man because I have a ton of apps
on my phone so the whole desktop she's
gonna be covered in apps they're gonna
have some got a way to like organize
that in a cool way you know somewhere
Satya Nadella is a is smiling and kind
of like half smirk giggling that's the
head of my okay all right I'm just some
kind of updates with the iPhone 10 the
iPhone 10 plus should help kind of aid
in Apple's new push for OLED displays
according to some reports here Apple is
now or sorry excuse me samsung display
is now at a 90 percent yield rate for
producing OLED screens and what does
that really mean earlier in the year as
Apple is ramping up to build the iPhone
10s they were only able to get about a
60 percent yield rate of actual displays
that could be used in these phones it
bump up to 80 percent later this year it
now believes it's up to 90 percent so
they're able to churn through these a
lot faster and more efficiently
according to a report by the investor
samsung Display will end up supply an
apple with be somewhere between 180 and
200 million flexible OLED displays for
the iPhone in 2018 that's up from an
estimated 50 million from this year so
that's a
jump also let's be honest there's a lot
more time we've had this kind of like
last quarter of 2017 versus a full year
in 2018 also the the general thinking is
that a big amount of these o LEDs will
also go towards the iPhone 10 plus or
whatever they call it right just the
larger iPhone display that's expected to
be a six point four inch OLED just that
big sized iPhone 10 ultimately to kind
of diversify their lineup even more but
that is something that we're expected to
see next year sometime just a whole lot
more of OLED and there is no comment on
apples dependence if they're still
really gonna start producing o LEDs out
of their own factories or work with some
of these other companies there has never
there hasn't been a sign yet that
they've been successfully been able to
flip that switch on but they'll
definitely need it so get ready more o
LEDs for the iPhone now here's the story
about the iPhone that has been getting
probably the most buzz over the past
week I'm not sure if you've heard about
it or read about it but it kind of
started on reddit and a user posted how
basically the performance on their old
iPhone success seemed like really slow
once they had updated the operating
system and they're wondering like what
is going on and so what they did is they
actually replaced their battery in their
phone and then they ran another they
first did an original Geekbench score on
their kind of worn-down battery running
the latest operating system I think it
was like iOS 11 or 11 point 2 and
they're like I'm getting weak scores a
single core score of 14 66 and it's
multi-core score of 25 12 ok so then
they put in a new battery and much to
their surprise but also what they had
thought the performance on their phone
jumped up significantly the single core
score of 2526 which is almost double and
a multi-core score of 44 56 which is
almost double
now forget out the numbers the
performance of the phones were actually
just a lot better almost twice as fast
and so what did Geekbench do well
Geekbench wanted to analyze it and see
like okay is there really a correlation
between the operating systems and how
they deal with power management so power
geek bench took the iPhone 6s and round
their own test and basically they're
looking for Geekbench performance scores
they have an iPhone success running 10.2
and basically the general scores hit on
that high 2500 mark score but as they
started getting updating the OS on this
phone to check its performance levels
and what the geek bench scores were
getting you started to see a broader
range of scores anywhere from 1,000 to
2,500 okay so you see this deviation
that not all these phones are performing
at their highest rate as you update your
phone hmm now they did the same thing
with the iPhone 7 it wasn't as drastic
but again as they updated the operating
system clearly the power management and
performance is different they saw
similar spikes in iOS 11 point 2 on the
iPhone 7 as they did with iOS 11 point 2
on the 6s and so now everyone is same
like what is going on what is really
happening here
now clearly batteries do aged over time
and one of the issues if you don't
remember Apple had released a software
update I think it was like ten point two
point one and that was because people's
phones were actually specific I think
six and successes were randomly shutting
down yeah when they were around 30%
battery to remember that yeah yeah I
remember I remember story about that
yeah so this was kind of an explanation
what happened many iPhones this is
according to the Geekbench story and a
quote from reddit that many iPhone 6s
devices were shutting down unexpectedly
even after the battery replacement
program because the grated batteries
last muscle lasts much less and end up
with lower voltage Apple solution was to
scale down CPU performance again this
doesn't solve anything and it is a bad
experience your your phone is actually
slower but it's better than having your
device shut down at around a 40% 30%
battery juice life when you need it the
most and so that's a compromise right
there it is right and ultimately it's
not a good option No is it better than a
shutdown yes but people have started to
kind of figure this out and put put the
pieces together so if
you're experiencing some of these issues
you know we just want to talk about it
it is a very kind of like in-depth
almost insider baseball what is
happening to iPhone 6s and 6s is
specifically as you update the operating
system but how many times have you heard
people after two years and glow and
behold this is the two-year mark oh my
phone is feeling slow it's almost like
it's like it's almost like an old wives
tale at this point you know like Oh two
years is up Apple's throttling me now I
have to go get a new phone you know it's
almost like an inside joke that a lot of
us say to each other you know like even
just you know not even people in the
tech field just just random consumers
they feel that you know everyone kind of
feels that and it and to my point I've
always told people if you have a phone
that's two years old don't update to the
latest operating system it never so part
of this is clearly the way that it deals
with power management when there's a
lower voltage coming from the batteries
because these batteries are worn out
instead of shutting down the phone
they're gonna scale down the performance
so this is just something to know it
Apple hasn't confirmed this Apple hasn't
responded to this but now at least you
have a legitimate benchmarking site that
is doing testing these out and showing
that this does happen in both the iPhone
6s and an iPhone 7 as you update the
software to the phones that's a bummer
man so just something you would think
like updating to the latest would make
your phone faster and improve it you
know like that's what everyone wants to
think but I think I mean I feel like in
the past sometimes they've been old in
general most of the time when you're
running a more advanced OS on hardware
that look Apple is always going to
prioritize the newest phone with the
newest software and then they'll go to
the phone one year lower and then the
phone tiers lower it's and you can only
squeeze out so much from from from those
from that phone when it's a two-year old
phone I mean there's a lot of
advancements that happened in that time
so I get that you know it may not
perform as well but just don't I just
tell people don't update your OS if
you're one of those phones just don't do
it like if you're on the two-year window
yours
okay if it's at the two-year point
basically you're the two phone cycle
just don't do it and I think that this
is gonna get gain even more steam as
more people talk about this I think as
it becomes more of a mainstream story
and it's starting to get there people
aren't gonna be happy about this but at
the same time what can you do other than
like is someone gonna file you know it's
gonna someone gonna file a lawsuit
against Apple or action
yeah a class-action lawsuit I mean who
there possible I mean you know it's
totally possible because people feeling
like they're getting throttled like AT&amp;amp;T
startles me when I get to like 22 gigs a
month or something you know but I have
unlimited data so they're saying oh
we're gonna start throttling you after
you reach 16 gigs or something and I'm
like well that's not unlimited you know
like I am paying for unlimited data and
you're throttling me so why are you
slowing me down you know and it's it's
it's upsetting you know we're people are
upset people are only gonna get more
upset listen to this you know all right
I'll get you a little more upset if you
want air pods they are out Apple is
officially out sold out of air pods
until January of next year so I know
Beach that was probably like the gift
that would keep giving for you but a
coin too if you go to the Apple online
store if you even go to like choose to
pick up air pods at least with Apple
retail you might find them at like Best
Buy in other places or Target or
something you might find them right now
through Apple earpods are out until
January which then leads to our next
story like when will the next next air
pods come out according to ming chi quo
and this is just makes logical sense to
all of us here
according to Ming XI quo from digit
times Apple is expected to release an
upgrade to the air pods in the second
half of 2018 that pretty much put this
upgrade about tears out like I said when
they first came out they don't need to
upgrade this every year they need to
catch up with even selling them they're
a really really really good product
they're not great yet they can be better
they still flip out on me when I'm out
on the street like the sound once in a
while we'll just like cut out and you're
like huh what the hell was that right it
just it does happen and also I want more
better touch controls in them and
do we really have to keep the the like
the the q-tip look like do we have to do
we really have to do that still yeah get
rid of that they're gonna keep that
they're gonna keep I think this is just
what its gonna be for a while
so anyways expect that sometime in late
2018 we are also are still expecting the
the what guy why does it slipped my mind
is it air power that pad that I keep on
making fun yes I think it's gonna make
sure here's the other thing I want to
bring up that I realized about the air
power pad it's a wireless charging pad
it charges your phone your air pods with
the new updated case and your Apple
watch but if you're someone who has an
apple basically if you have an Apple
watch that has like the sporty rubber
band that can actually come apart in two
or some of the leather bands you're
gonna be able to lay that flat but if
you're someone who has something like
the metal link watch band some of the
classroom ones that actually can't
flatten out you're not gonna be able to
use the air power maxi pad with it
that's a bummer man those other bands
are way more expensive too and like have
all kinds of built-in functionality so
that is a bummer
it's so stupid because not stupid for
them but stupid that I didn't even think
about it cuz I just saw the pics I'm
like oh cool I'll be able to charge all
three devices and pay $200 for that but
it's like alright fine you know I would
try it out but I can't even my phone I
have that classy stealing ban on and
it's not gonna if it won't I can't use
that it actually absolutely has to sit
complete a slap do they have a special
Apple watch one like well probably not
but you know if they had one that was
like a like a watch holder kind of thing
that would be kind of cool I mean
there's there's companies that make
stuff like that so someone's like you
gotta slide the metal link thing stays
like in a chain you have to you have to
like break it apart okay work um
guess what before our holiday season
because we told them we're gonna be gone
for a month no one wanted to sponsor the
show so we're gonna end it right now
just kidding
all right let's get some more stories
this week this is kind of the ongoing
battle between Apple and Amazon this is
finally like a little kumbaya moment for
both Apple and Amazon the Amazons amazon
says prime video the actual prime video
app had its most had the most first week
downloads of any Apple TV app ever Wow
Amazon Prime video there's so much
demand according to an apple this is
according to the Amazon spokesperson it
had the most first week downloads of any
app in the history of TV OS I believe
that yeah you believe that that's
totally free I don't know how many you
jumped onboard and just got it because
it works for both the Amazon TV 4k what
is that music
this is kumbaya I chose the wrong
version of kumbaya
oh my god we're in a instrumental guitar
kumbaya moment for these two you know I
found the wrong version it works the so
Amazon Prime video app number one top
most downloaded in the first week in the
history of TV OS which then of course
you know now that Apple and Amazon are
good terms
the Apple TV is now finally back on sale
on Amazon do you remember oh yeah that's
right yeah much like Amazon is doing
having this beef with Google where
YouTube is no longer can be streamed on
Amazon devices Amazon's like screw you
were taken off the Google home and
chromecast from Amazon at least Apple
and Amazon to squash their beef so you
can now get an Apple TV on Amazon but
they're out of stock already sold out
just letting you know I'm and then other
news just quickly for the holidays for
some Apple TV 4k bundles Apple is doing
that on there I guess should I call it
our iTunes store or just on their movie
store you can now get like different
bundles great 4k bundles like
transformers like all five movies
nothing I was curious
just to be like oh okay like what what
4k models you know they have like the
huh
game bundles they have other 4k ones
they even have something like
action-adventure where did they put
together like the accountant Argo and
into the storm but as I was curious I
looked up the Transformers package deal
that they have gone right now and three
of the five movies were rated below 20%
rotten tomato one of them was like a 35
and then the very first one was like at
a fifty fifty seven Wow I wonder if they
based like the prices off the those
those ratings you know those movie
ratings okay so give you some twenty
percent rated videos for free and oh
yeah I'm looking at these deals maybe
the best deal is I'm gonna say for drama
for 25 bucks Life of Pi the Martian in
revenue it movies yeah so I haven't seen
sony Sony Pictures for twenty bucks they
got bad boys Crouching Tiger Hidden
Dragon in the professional that's kind
of a dope deal yeah I'm just I'm just
listing off stuff sci-fi fantasy Blade
Runner I am Legend that might be cool
totally worth it alright umm let's jump
over to a games and apps just some quick
notes before we end up this holiday
season if you thought pokey Mongo was
dead I feel like it's dead but they're
trying to bring it back and what they're
doing now exclusively on the iPhone
because the iPhone now has a are kid
involved in it they're calling what they
Pokemon go is calling this an AR plus
mode again powered by Apple's air kit
now what makes this different is that
before you know you would use the AR kit
mode in Pokemon go and you'd see the
character there and it just would like
stay there and run around well now the
characters are actually anchored to the
ground you can go up close to them so
they'll increase in size you can get an
idea of the size of the Pokemon like
Pikachu is not the same as like who
knows who else would I like charizard
charizard charizard to get away yeah I
like what Joker
yeah squirrels a cute one so anyways
it anchors the actual character there
you can move around it but then they
also say if you get too close to some of
them or kind of like Surprise them
they'll run away but it just keeps it
locked in this space so like there's
like a video clip that you guys can
check out CNET got to go and check it
out it's it's it's fun whatever can you
pick them that's what I want to know I
don't think you know oh no not at all
the other game that is worth checking
out it's kind of hard to deal with but
uh it's called rainbrow have you seen
this game no it's kind of getting some
buzz rain ring growl is this game where
it's think of it as like a jumping game
where you're just kind of jumping up
different ledges and trying to avoid
things flying in it but you use your
eyebrows you jump up and you do a frown
OOP down and then you keep your face
like normal to keep it in place I did
find this very difficult to move down
cuz when you frown it tends to jump down
more than one notch so it makes it hard
but when you use your eyebrows up you
get a little up it jumps accurately
rainbrow it's fun to watch people play
its called 'rain brow I'm telling you
this is like for the kids for the family
you got to get this game I know kill
chimera is like downloading this right
now he's like rain on it come on I
already know I already know you kill so
yeah my kids would love that game dude
that's hilarious
thank you man um the other cool app that
just dropped a little update I'm a big
user of the Shazam for iOS finally is
getting offline mode so what that means
is if you have a poor or crappy internet
connection you can still use Shazam and
then once you get an internet connection
it will then send the data later on and
then tell you the songs that you heard
because I hate it when I want to hear a
song and I have bad data in it it won't
work that's cool so like it keeps a
record of songs you've listened to it
just while you're walking through your
life and then not later or you have to
you have to prompt it but it'll most
likely at least while it's listening and
now record that song snippet and then
upload it later on which is cool that is
cool and then for holiday season just a
little deal deal action for you guys and
gals iTunes there's a $100 giftcard that

and before we go just to end the show
this is like the last story before we
get to our calls Apple's newest Mac the
nemah the Mac Pro the trashcan Mac today
as of today it turned four years old
that's amazing I've only seen like three
of them in the wild dude I mean we we
invested in them and then people like
got pretty sick of them pretty fast
yeah like I don't see anybody using them
at all ever so wow it's four years it
was December 19th was its birthday but I
think it's gonna when we look back in
time it's gonna be one of the black eyes
because it also is it's black eyes from
Apple's history because also they didn't
upgrade or do anything with it for four
years and then their idea of a pro
computer became the iMac Pro and now
they're gonna give us a modular Mac
maybe what five years after this and
after doing nothing with it it's pretty
bad like it's pretty bad strategy
strategy wise yeah and again the thing
that will also live in infamy is when
they released this Mac Pro Phil Schiller
walked out on stage all cocky me said
can't innovate my ass Wow it kind of
came as a surprise of the keynote and
then he strutted onstage after they show
the cool promo videos I can't innovate
my ass and it really started laughs
and it's like probably shouldn't said
that it's a misstep
hindsight's 20/20 though hindsight is
20/20 bababooey would have called that a
big misstep in apples apples history all
right so we get to the calls let's do
some calls thank you guys all for
calling we had a bunch and we narrowed
it down to I think five four or five
something like that so here we go oh I
turned up the wrong Saturday
wrong fader my bad hey guys Matt from
Illinois yeah I was just curious about
iPhones with the new 5g network that is
coming out any updates on that Thanks
love your show back 5g
the first thing to make it very clear is
because of Apple's decisions their
current iPhone tens that you have will
not support 5g networks or at least get
those excuse me optimal 5g speeds that
are expected to come out I think
realistically we're gonna start seeing I
think t-mobile per se might be pushing
it but it's not gonna happen really
anytime soon it's probably gonna happen
sometime we might see 5g networks
starting rolling out maybe late 2018 it
won't be anything prevalent where all
cares will be up to 5g speeds honestly
I'm gonna say somewhere around Gees late
2019 2020 it's gonna take some time to
get here so yeah sure your iPhone work
there but when a 5g network is gonna be
available sometime most likely in 2018
you probably want a phone that is
capable to do that and the iPhone 10 is
not one of them
actually any of the iPhones is not one
of them so hmm it's something to look
out for it's still it's still taking its
time it's not gonna be like a switches
flipped off and flipped on and all some
we're gonna see it in a month or two
it's still gonna be a while but uh we're
expecting it at least see one of the
carriers go for it and by the end of
2018 so we'll see if that actually does
happen yeah I remember the first time
when they turn on 4G that was a pretty
big deal and it orgy LTE baby it was so
much faster game-changer yeah
okay next call here we go Weejun song
what's going on
this is calling from Atlanta again and I
just like to call it and ask your
opinion do you think Apple will release
their own homekit certified home
security camera system either just one
single camera or maybe an array of
cameras in 2018 love the show thanks
guys but I will they do that um probably
I'm gonna say no not not next year yeah
they don't do camera stuff ever really
I've never seen like an apple like a
webcam or anything like that I wouldn't
put it past a dude have do you remember
they had the FaceTime camera that was
like a silver Scylla cylinder that you
could get in addition your iMac years
ago it was like a thing you mount on
your iMac yeah yeah well it actually
looked pretty dope I still have it at my
apartment it's a wide screen like HD
widescreen everything it was in HD
wasn't it I feel like it was a 720p cam
at the time it wasn't HD like it wasn't
like 1080p it wasn't super fan it
actually might have not been 720p might
have been 480p it was a long time ago
hmm
there's a long time ago but they did put
out a web cam I honestly I don't want
Apple to make a security cam and the
reason being is they need a frickin
focus they need to stop making new crap
and make their their bread and butter
really good like they're they're doing
too much stuff just slow your roll
little bit I'm not selling telling them
out of all the people in this world to
say stay in your lane I'm just saying
just you have so many things going on
just just kind of tighten it up a little
bit man
it's tight-knit we used to say that
about Google - it'd be like Google's
doing so much stuff something they would
like launch three of the same product at
the same product launch you know now
it's like apples doing the same thing
you can tell you can tell like Apple is
doing so many different things like
they're the focus of the quality and the
focus that used to be there just isn't
there anymore it's just a fact something
to move
is hard they're moving into the new
campus I'm gonna use as they moved like
two miles is that if that and it's like
all fancy and stuff they should be like
then there should be like motivated to
be like oh we're gonna make this good so
we don't look stupid right now
yeah that's what they got to focus on
all right you know I think this this guy
had a follow up real quick Missy also
this column again tongue where did you
get that shirt that is pretty dope
all right by this one I think he's
talking about last week yeah I didn't
even remember what I wore but I had to
look it up although I hope he thinks
this shirt is dope too but it was it was
like this like reddish camo shirt from G
star raw I just gave out all my secrets
guys oh my G star raw nice yeah I don't
know why we are we talking about clothes
I always want to know about your clothes
I mean that's cool okay last call here
we go what's crack-a-lackin' beach songs
tyler from Hotlanta so I've got a couple
things here one I've got the iPhone
extra foam ten and battery life actually
a lot better than what I expected
even with using Google Maps and so forth
or ways anyway I really like the camera
as well definitely great phones and so
forth but the main my main thing was
about the Apple watch 2 things one do
you feel like that the Apple watch will
ever get Spotify or Pandora for
streaming services okay that's my first
question
I think question is do you does anybody
know how to turn off explicit lyrics on
you know the Apple radio alright just
want to ask that question just got done
for each other Jim and I just didn't
like all the cussing and everything like
that just my personal preference anyway
freedom freedom I'm pretty positive
of that you can turn off the explicit
lyrics on Apple music in the settings
let's see here
yeah I think so too I like I'm almost
positive I remember that I remember that
being an actual like option now you know
you can turn off let's see here I'm
gonna because we're just hanging out
right now turn off yeah you have to go
into the settings of Apple musics app
specifically scroll to the allowed
content section and then you can turn
explicit content off you have to confirm
it by entering in your passcode but you
can't do it directly from the settings
in the app cool that's helpful that is
and then what was this other question Oh
Spotify another service yeah you know I
wish they did but because you know you
can do it from in front I feel like
apples like hey we're already letting
you do these other music services on
your phone please I wish they could but
right now with the Apple watch the only
music service that they're promoting to
operate on it is Apple music if you pay
for a subscription you can stream
specifically from the watch over LTE
which is awesome that's the only reason
I'm I like flirted with the idea of
getting Apple music but I don't expect
them to put any other third-party
services to stream directly from the
watch and only from the watch I just
don't think they're they continue to be
more locked down than ever and I just I
wish they did but I don't see it
happening really that's a bummer they're
not letting people build third-party
music apps for the Apple watch that's
well they do you can but they're you
know they're not um I'm talking about
using it specifically with just LTE on
the watch itself okay right now Apple
music is that app I'm I'm like 99% sure
so if I'm wrong so much it correct me
but I'm I know that they have you know
watch versions the app but I don't but
it's pulling from the phone not from
just the the watch specifically yeah I
guess what was her self sales pitch like
2 million songs in your watch or
something like that right so they can
prove that number a little bit all your
music apps in your watch okay that's it
man are we that's it
2017 is almost done
It's A Wrap I can't wait honestly so
anyways everyone thanks so much for
listening and just helping build this
podcast to make it what it is uh we
continue to get more viewers more
subscribers and we continue to get more
sponsors from it so I think it's a
win-win across the board and it's all
thanks to you so I think from myself and
Beecham I don't know if you have any of
the words Beach but definitely thank you
to everybody we're so we're so grateful
