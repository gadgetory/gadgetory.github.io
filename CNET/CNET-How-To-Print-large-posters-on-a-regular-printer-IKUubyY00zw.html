to show you how to print out a giant
poster using any standard printer you'll
need a computer a printer some scissors
and some glue you also need a picture
lighter images with lots of contrast
tend to scale and print best they also
use up less ink also remember printing
copyrighted material is against the law
so just stick to your own photos and
graphics the first step is to use our
computer to scale up the image and
process it so that it can be printed out
across multiple sheets of paper if you
just want an accurate blown-up version
of any image upload it to a site like
faster poster or block posters and will
spit out a downloadable PDF aside from
the fact that the image has been diced
up there's not a lot of processing going
on here so it's great for school
projects or printing out a big sign for
your garage sale but you'll have to
accept that it's going to look a little
Frankenstein once you glue it together
now if the goal is something pretty to
hang on the wall I recommend embracing
imperfection and going a little abstract
there's a great but unfortunately named
program out there called raster bader
that scales images up using a halftone
effect this makes them a little more
forgiving the stitch together and the
result has a nice Andy Warhol vibe the
program is a free download for Windows
but a ported version for Mac and Linux
is also out there so check out my posts
on SEANET how-to for links and details
once you open up the software select the
image choose the paper size you'll be
printing to and how many sheets wide you
want the poster to be on the next page
you'll find a checkbox that will put a
cut out guide around the image
I recommend having that on you also have
a setting for halftone dots size
generally small dots work best for
smaller prints and big dots are meant
for the big stuff but play around with
it there's also a setting here for the
color mode if you have a full color
printer try multicolor or go artsy by
choosing a custom monochrome color if
all you have is a black and white
printer don't worry the results are
still pretty cool and sometimes even
cooler than going full color finally
choose where the file is going to go and
then hit raster bate you now the PDF of
your image all chopped up and ready to
go you'll see what each page is going to
look like when printed but before you do
that
see if you can scrounge up some thick
paper to print on it'll be easier to cut
easier to glue and it's not going to
warp as easily as cheap copy paper also
if you're printing a black and white
tricolor paper to punch things up after
you print that out all the pages it's
time to cut them up and then glue them
together the pro method is to trim off
all the edges with a paper cutter and
then glue the arrange sections to a
poster board but the quick and cheap way
to go is to slice the edges off of every
other page so that you have a little lip
here that you can glue on to now I did
this one here with just a pair of
scissors and a glue stick and then I
flipped it over and I taped up the seams
on the back for a little extra support
now depending on how many pages you end
up with this could take some time to
assemble and chances are you're going to
mess up your first attempt and want to
start over but it gets easier as you go
along and by the time you're done you're
going to end up with something like this
it's not perfect but I think it looks
pretty cool from a distance so there you
go those are my favorite options for
printing up big posters from a small
printer follow me on Twitter for more
