Giant Bomb podcast studio in San
Francisco California see a provide extra
crunchy podcast with your host mr. Brian
Tom what's up everybody welcome welcome
to the show
believe it or not we haven't done one
and I checked the calendar Beecham yeah
one month and three days a month and
three days people are being thirsty they
were tweeting me like they were thirsty
they're like yo where's Apple bite
actual crunchy where are you guys at
what are you doing
okay let's explain ourselves Steven can
you tell them where we have been like
this whole time we had Christmas we had
Christmas break that's like a week and a
half we open gifts we had a lot of fun
New Year's yes and we had a new year's
time then we went to Las Vegas to the
CES Consumer Electronics Show and then
after that Brian Tom went home and I
went to Detroit you were in Detroit for
another week for natalier that yes at
the Auto Show which was really cool
actually
so do that math it's four weeks we're
gone we're here we are back we want to
jump into the show and let you know it's
been a month and probably the phone
calls you left us a month ago probably
aren't that dated a little outdated so
we want to start a clean slate and get
you all back in on in the drill you can
call us at 1-866-376-8255 is all over
the place Apple did a software fix that
is still only available in beta right
now it's still not available to the
public
the moment of this recording so we still
know exactly how that's gonna affect
everyday users but look I'm gonna tell
you why you should just wait for the new
MacBooks in 2017 kaby lake processors
this is the new family of intel
processors that were announced
basically at CES on january 2 the third
they're going to give you basically all
the performance improvements that you
wanted and we're hoping for that you
didn't get from the first generation so
we have the touch bar we can the touch
bar still I think is a lukewarm feature
everyone I talk to is like I'm gonna use
it I don't really use it it's actually
more annoying I don't like the
personally I don't like the fact that
there's no actual haptic feedback on it
when you touch something you kind of
want to know that it's registering a
click especially if it's on a keyboard
like your laptop you know it still
doesn't have that not every app is
really using it the best way but some
people love it because you can at least
customize some of the quick actions that
you jump to anyways the new MacBook Pros
that are expected to come out this year
2017 most likely around the August
September timeframe will use cabbie Lake
processors why do you want that
kaby Lake brings you a 20% improvement
in performance it also uses less power
consumption which means more battery
life and the 15-inch model will support
a 32 gig Ram option for pros one of the
kind of the big blackeyes that pros were
like hey not only did you take away our
ports this is just like a standard
machine with the processing power that
just isn't all that yeah yeah
hearing that of that complaint from a
lot of people that's just not as fast
i I implore you if you were thinking
about a MacBook Pro with the touch bar
just wait I'm sure your current laptop
will last you at least another year I'm
sure of that yeah I mean before this
laptop even came out you're telling
everyone maybe wait for the second
iteration you kinda you say that with
every product unless but almost you know
yeah cuz they always Apple always screws
up the first of all I was the first to
buy the iPad pro I was the further you
got burned got burned three months later
with their true tone display
Beate I'm gonna do something about that
Apple anyways um MacBook Pros I know
Apple loyalists are like dude why are
you telling people not to buy eggs you
heard those three reasons 20% better
performance better power battery
consumption and 32 gig ram support so
when when is this option going to come
out I'm guessing most likely in the fall
that's typically when they do their
laptop refresh so it's about let's give
it a 7 7 months or so 7 8 months all
right be patient guys you can live first
world hashtag first world problems to go
to hashtag also Apple we talked about
the battery issues that were plaguing
them apples fourth beta of Makos Sierra
ten point twelve point three has this
new added feature that it warns you if
your display brightness is higher than
75% it actually shows you a warning you
can either choose to manually turn it
down or excuse me automatically have it
turn down the brightness to save power
so they're basically telling you when
your bright screen is too bright it's
gonna be using more battery power than
you'd like I'm looking at my screen
right now I am easily over 75% is it
warning use it say no Brian turn it down
it's not because I don't have the beta
but I would say most people probably
have the brightness of their screen over
75% always I always like and then when
you unplug it you know it'll turn itself
down a little bit yeah but then I'll
just turn it back up exactly I live
dangerously my battery life you're such
a rebel jump you're so crazy
on my PC it does the same thing I'm like
No turn up turn up turn up
alright iPhone use because you want it
you want to hear the latest rumors uh
this is again you've probably heard a
lot of this stuff but we're just kind of
catching you up to speed then we can
start talking about other stuff but the
iPhone 8 could now potentially according
to a report introduced facial
recognition now this is the first time
we've heard of something like this but
why would this be advantage advantageous
we we know that Apple acquired prime
sense this was the company that was
responsible for the Kinect camera on the
Xbox it had a depth sensor array of
different cameras in there to be able to
see the world around you that's actually
really important for augmented reality
that's also one of the big
initiatives that Tim Cook cannot stop
talking about
like I feel like he's said it at every
recent interview like we like augmented
reality
thanks for keeping things a secret
thanks for making things exciting and
cool Tim like really just tell us
everything you're doing already so that
that is why that could be important
again we haven't seen any reports about
this it's a rumor it may or may not be
true but what is pretty much been solid
now while the reports are aligning with
the fact that we will see the standard
4.7 inch iPhone we will see the standard
5.5 inch iPhone right so those will most
likely be the 7s line of phones but
everyone is pointing to the fact that we
will see a premium 5.8 inch OLED iPhone
not only that reports are saying that it
will be roughly based or pretty much
take design cues from the iPhone 4 that
was my favorite iPhone of all time we've
talked about in the past episode of that
I from a metal frame two pieces of glass
super sexy let's let's take away the
whole antenna gate stuff that happened
with there let's pretend like that
hadn't happened right but the actual
design is amazing some people like I
don't like the fact that the glass
shattered on the back well guess what
how many times your screen shatter
anyways Gorilla Glass has improved
significant conservation since then
they'll have to make some sort of
shatterproof glass we're gonna go back
to that design design there I mean the
the Samsung Galaxy s7 did have some
shadow problems if you dropped it but it
was a sexy beast and let's be honest are
you really are you iPhone users out
there not going to buy an eye for the
next-gen iPhone just because it has a
glass backing you're gonna buy it and
how many people are cruising around with
an iPhone without a case I mean plenty
you're crazy if you're doing that I mean
you know plenty of people are doing that
that's that's living dangerously steep
that's very dangerously so I'm all for
this new design also the fact that it
would be enable with by getting rid of
that aluminum backing it would enable
the phone to do wireless charging one of
the mmm in the year 2017 cool Apple will
bring wireless charging to the table
thank you
finally like four years later finally
it's either and might be for now it
sounds bad when was the first phone that
was charged while it was hold on
actually I believe it was the Palm Pre
pump was one of the very first phones
that had wireless charging you all can
check me on that YouTube or periscope
but I believe it was the Palm Pre that
was like then please tell us the year -
if you can in the chat I'll look it up
online we're talking we get we don't we
don't have the resources or brainpower
to keep up with that so I'm excited
about that and this new iPhone premium
edition we'll see what they call it you
know what we like to call it iPhone X
iPhone X or iPhone future so so it's
gonna be like a very big iPhone 4 which
I which I'm not I don't I which is cool
but I don't want a 5.8 inch phone to be
the printable phone neither do I that is
gonna be dog doo-doo it's gotta be
smaller gave me that design in a smaller
form factor we're just talking about
based on the reports we've heard we
don't know any of this no one really
knows any of what is official until it's
official so again we're just
pontificating but don't give me don't
make the premium phone a 5.8 inch one
don't
that's stupid like that doesn't fit in
my pant like my pocket literally can't
support a 5.8 inch phone my giant hands
can't hold it properly I have learned
how to balance my phone though my iPhone
6 cuz it's too big I can't get my hands
around it I'm like good at balancing it
now but you know good luck good luck
with that
now we adapt good luck with that all
right let's take a break cuz guess what
we've got a sponsor and I've actually
used this product whether you're busy
professional couple a large family that
runs at a breakneck pace or someone who
simply wants to start cooking more check
it out our friends at hellofresh make it
easier tastier and healthier than ever
to enjoy the experience of cooking new
recipes and eating together at home this
is really cool because you can go to
their website you have different options
you can choose like a veggie box you can
choose like a classic box which is what
I do because I need my meat like how do
you think I stay so swole you need a boy
oh I'm so slow
you leave that protein son she does have
quinoa I'm sure they got Kim they're
often that Oh trust me um
they're also going to be launching a
family box customers can order three
four or five different meals per week
designed for either two or four people
now pretty awesome because I have a not
a lot of time to cook meals son so many
healthy comes to my house and I could
just throw it more how you heat it up or
something boom this is what's cool about
it right oh yeah
it's a meal kit delivery service so it
comes in this box we've heard of meal
kit delivery services before so this is
not new per se but hello freshers I will
say hello fresh was pretty fresh like
what haha they should just hat their
hire me to actually do an advertised yo
man that's fresh that's some fresh stuff
that's hella fresh elephant hella fresh
alright so each meal approximately takes
around 30 minutes to make one of them
took 45 minutes I had a bundle that did
okay check this out it was like abyssal
McChicken with like onions in it wow it
was like sweet tangy like I was like
dude that sounds good with like an
arugula salad I did one of those I did
like a it was like a muster a sweet miso
it was like a mustard like salmon and
then I loved my like a love salmon
yeah and then was the last one I had was
an Italian meatloaf and I like I like
grounded with my hands like I got into
this three things you just named or
three things that I would eat these are
a few of my favorite things
anyways 30 minutes roughly for each but
let's be honest if you're someone like
me it takes like an hour to cook this
because you're like chopping the onions
and you're like crying you're chopping
the onions and you're crying it sucks
that sucks but anyways I just want to
let you all know not only are they a
sponsor of our show this week but it is
a dope service the call to action if you
want to take advantage of this we've got
a special offer for you $35 off your
first week of deliveries visit
hellofresh comm and enter apple when you
subscribe hello fresh guess what is
hella fresh I just made a jingle for I
just made a Jean
you made like two jingles during that
but it was yet Oh what did I say I was
already did my tagline hella fresh is
hella versus hello fresh is hello
damn that's fresh
all right getting on along to the rest
of the stories in our rundown because
really that's all you guys and gals care
about air pods
there was a story earlier this week that
claimed according to slice intelligence
as more towards like the end of last
week that the air pods had made this
huge gain in market share slice
intelligence is a analytics website that
takes receipts of all online sales and
then breaks them down now according to
the original slice report the air pods
in just arguably two or three weeks in
the entire month of December versus the
entire year for all headphone
manufacturers based on that first report
they said that they took up 26% of all
online sales of wireless headphones ok
think about that they were on sale for
three weeks versus other companies like
Sony and LG and Sennheiser they even
topped beats which are at fifteen point
four percent and then Bose came in at
16.1% this is for online sales only but
then but then I know beat you're like
damn that's crazy Wow but then NPD data
was like well actually we take the
receipts of both brick-and-mortar stores
and online sales how what percentage do
you think earpods came in at once
NPD decided to step in and be like hey
guys here's a little reality oh man
that's a tough one like this is the
rotted number fifteen percent maybe you
could you could try maybe try a little
lower than that I'm gonna 10% you could
go you know that how about two percent
to two percent market share now that's
obviously significantly lower than the
twenty five percent number that were 26
percent number that was thrown around
initially
again this is brick-and-mortar and
online sales but let's put this in
perspective again they were on sale
arguably for I'm gonna be generous and
say two and a half weeks it's like not
even before Christmas naughty yeah it
was like rules right before the other
day but it was like right before the end
of the year but then if you look at
other manufacturers or other competitors
you have someone like Bose who through
the course year made up 8% you know
Plantronics you know j-bird they
a for the year sold 2% so that's
actually pretty incredible that the air
pods in just that small amount of time
this was able to match based on MPD's
data to establish brands that have been
selling to headphones for the entire
year yeah it makes sense because you
know when you buy headphones you're not
really in the market for another pair of
headphones anytime soon so and also air
pods were so new and a high very
high-profile product so that makes sense
and I did see a lot of them at CES and I
saw them at Detroit and I didn't hate
him I was like oh yeah you're kind of
like you kind of get over it you're like
I could afford him you can beeps had a
25% unit sales share again Apple at 2%
bows at 8% LG had 10% Sony at 7 and then
like I said Plantronics in j-bird went
around 2% where Apple is now neck and
neck with them but it's kind of an
interesting thing of how much momentum
they've been able to gain and let's just
be honest that is the power of the
freakin Apple brand totally there is
nothing like really Wireless hair
earbuds headphones have been around for
quite some time and even talking to some
of my co-workers that are like oh yeah
I've never had wireless headphones when
they are almost introduced the idea of
wireless earbuds thanks to Apple just
talking about them so again the power of
the brand in other new products coming
out what about that Apple pencil a shaky
sketch sketchy get it sketchy rumor
hey pencil sketchy did I really have to
call that out it's pretty good good job
Ryan thanks loser
sketchy supply chain rumor claims Apple
pencil 2 will be launching along side
new iPad pro models this year a recent
report also pegged that iPad pro models
are gonna get delayed a little bit and
come out sometime in the mid the second
half of 2017 we were expecting to maybe
around a march/april timeframe they
typically bring them up in the first
kind of quarter of the year but that
doesn't appear to be the case the iPad
pro also for this coming year is
expected to have a 12-point 9-inch my
big boy my big bertha nice nine point
seven inch will be the entry-level model
and then rumored 10.5 inch with thinner
bezels on the side I'm like okay that's
fine
everyone watches like dude I got my iPad
I'm good
no rocking the third generation so
here's the thing about the Apple pencil
- that they're talking about there's
been a variety of patents and new
features for example one of them was
this Smart Cover integration where the
Smart Cover could be like a drawing pad
another one was using Tim Cook's like
we've already been testing the Apple
pencil for use on the iPhone oh that
makes me sad
yeah why would you do that not only why
would I do that in the phone if you all
look up online there is a classic moment
of Steve Jobs if you just look up Steve
Jobs stylist ah where he talks about
he's like nobody wants a stylus you
gotta put it in you lose it yak but this
isn't a stylist it's a pen it's a little
pen so you're right app opens so they
also have a pen for using the Apple
pencil or a stylus type device on a
MacBook trackpad mmm to then use with
your Mac sorry not a MacBook trackpad a
Mac trackpad so they've been playing
around with all these different ideas
who knows if that's what the Apple
pencil two will support to me it's like
you just open up a can of worms you've
got to come up with more in or UI more
OS functionality - all of a sudden
integrate a pencil stylus into all of
your products it seems a little silly
that Apple would do that but again this
is not the Apple we know it's not the
Apple we know it's a totally new Apple
what do you think about that whole idea
that I think it's it's silly I mean no
one's the pen is gonna be longer than
the phone first of all that's gonna be
kind of funny we're gonna keep the pen
you know maybe maybe telephony I could
tell him the funny thing about it is
people would still buy it oh for sure
see I love that
you see how that people would like hey I
got my cool long pencil with my phone
I'll see someone riding on in the bus
and I'll just look at him and glare at
them you just look at him with judgy
eyes
yeah I saw a funny tweet this morning
and it said like apples apples sales
plan for 2017 is all jet-black iPhone
jet black Apple pencil a jet black
MacBook you know zile jet black
everything it's not gonna be in it's
probably not that far from the truth
yeah
I'm Apple though trying to reinvent
themselves and do different things I
think based on what we've seen let me
just throw this out here as a talking
point yes you and I were both at CES
mm-hmm
the things that you saw at CES Tim for
me I felt like Apple isn't in n is in
none of the hot categories that were at
CES yes there are nowhere to be found in
any of the hot categories our CS CES I'm
not saying CES is the end-all be-all but
things like the smart home like yes
anymore Apple has a smart home product
but nothing on nothing on the level of
the Amazon echo let's just throw that
out there um virtual reality we didn't
see much we don't you know yeah virtual
reality it's like space is still
figuring itself out yeah so freaking
what else what else like obviously
autonomous cars house cars were
everywhere everywhere there was robots
everywhere robot assistants a lot of the
only thing that we really talked about
that was Apple related was Siri at CES
you know to be able to control things
control your home and stuff but that's
that's about it and that's not really
like a physical product no yeah I I just
found it interesting that a lot of the
hot things that I was excited about
especially the smart home integration
you know Apple just doesn't have a
product and I've said this even two
years ago when the echo came out that
was a product that is created a new
platform a new market a new ecosystem
and that's what Apple used to do Alexa
was in everything it's in cars was
anything car every other speaker
refrigerators yeah everyone it's it's
the new it's the new tech plus crazy
it's the new tech platform and you know
just a little perspective it was
surprising because I thought that Google
home would have a chance to really catch
up to Alexa and at CES it really made
the gap of partnerships and third-party
relations that Google has the gap used
to be like oh here it's like here now
it's like it's huge so Google is even
behind yeah so Google may be smarter
from a algorithm and understanding
standpoint but Alexa is more than good
enough but also has all this third party
integration lie
I just got a harmony hub then I'm gonna
just be like turn on Netflix and it's
gonna be able to do like turn on your TV
you're receiving a night off I need that
I'm like oh I need like but I'm gonna
call it Netflix and chill
Alexa Netflix and chill I need it for my
kids right just come home and say turn
on paw Patrol and I just start playing
paw patrol from Amazon Prime or
something that would be cool but then
that then my that would empower my kids
just just start turning crap on movies
and stuff so I want to throw this out
Apple is trying to figure out new ways
to do things one of them is with content
we've talked about the past that they
did fail for a TV streaming service
we've also talked about how they've
lined up two shows one is they're
basically have the rights to carpool
karaoke without James Corden but they'll
be doing their own version on their
Apple music service which I there's it's
just not gonna be as cool it's just not
gonna have the same magic unless you
combine two music artists together of
different genres that could be cool the
problem is that artists don't
necessarily because artists are artists
they don't necessarily get along right
now and they don't want to sing another
artist so you like you have to
coordinate is like a neutral party yeah
you know and he's also not afraid to
like make an idiot of ya rock stars are
trying to be cool exactly so you're
right it's just not going to be this
it's gonna be weird
the other one was dr. Dre's a biopic
vital signs which reportedly had an orgy
in it oh so actually maybe Stephen might
do a trial subscription about do you
have Apple music I forgot I I tried it
in the beginning in the night yeah got
rid of it it was good it was good not
great nothing like I'm like I gotta have
this now so check this out Apple has
been talking with Hollywood executives
and we know this but they're trying to
post new original content in the form of
not only those two series we talked
about but TV shows and movies that they
claim would be on the same quality level
as Westworld and stranger things it's
like yeah let's throw like the two
hottest shows out there and just say our
stuffs gonna be like that yeah yeah we
go that's kind of seems silly to do
something like that you know well this
could be even sillier Beach
they they want to create this new
content that's TV show and movie related
but they don't want to put it on like
their Apple TV app or anything they want
to put it on the Apple music app they
want to put you behind Apple music to
watch their exclusive programming and in
that well why would they do that so
that's your first and gut instinct is
why like um so it's Apple music there's
an Apple TV I have the Apple TV app on
my phone so that makes sense that I
would go there to watch Apple TV
productions yeah what one again one way
of thinking of this is they're trying to
boost their spot of their subscription
service why right hey pay ten bucks not
only do you get Apple music you get
these great shows I'm like I'm sorry
there are tons of other great shows
everywhere else okay so they're gonna
bundle this together they want Apple you
some of this exclusive programming or
they're gonna nitpick and like pick and
choose not certain things
no not even so they from what all
reports are saying and what Apple is
talking is that they want these TV shows
and movies to only appear on the Apple
music service which if the shows are
good enough and Buzz were they would
hope that you people like you and me
would then subscribe to Apple music and
they don't at the moment they're not
planning to change the name of it either
it's a mistake they're trying to make it
like a little bit of everything so I
have a solution for them I talked about
in last week's show
look Apple all you really have to do is
buy Netflix let let Netflix do what they
do incorporate their programming into
the Apple TV or just leave the Netflix
app the way it is and post put your
shows on Netflix because that's where
people are gonna watch them yeah like
don't overthink this bro hi you know
what don't let Netflix be Netflix just
buy them and put your shows on there or
you are sitting on two hundred billion
dollar I know I've cash or they could be
like Netflix and what Netflix is doing
and all like TV movie movie studio
directors and actors are like oh my god
Netflix is just throwing out cash right
now yeah like they're giving directors
like we want you to make an awesome show
we're not going to get in your way yeah
we're going to give you this big chunk
of money you go do
ever you want to do right and we're not
gonna get in your way make it as screwed
up dark violent whatever you want you
know and and all these movie directors
and actors are like oh this is great I'm
going to Netflix yeah you know even like
Chris Rock got like 40 million dollars
to do like two comedy specials or
something right so look at people who
didn't have a platform on mainstream TV
like Aziz Ansari yes perfect example and
and all these actors and directors want
to go to Netflix because they know that
the culture there is that where they're
gonna get complete backing complete like
do whatever you want you know and apples
like we're gonna do carpool karaoke
they're already trying to put my god
they're already trying to put barriers
around all their shows and like they're
already trying to make you know put
everything in a slot yeah and then put
it on a platform where it doesn't even
make sense so look I recall I can't I'm
someone's gonna have to correct me on
this because I used to have the number
Netflix invested something like
somewhere around like a billion dollars
in content for last year and I think
they were gonna bump that up I don't
want to say too but I feel like it might
be like one and a half definitely more
than a billion more this year and for
2017 they're smart they're they are just
giving us what is it that we want
content okay this can so no matter what
Apple tries to do you're not gonna tell
me Netflix has a deal with Disney Civil
War and Zootopia and Jungle Book are on
Netflix right now bro the only is rad I
like that movie bro you need to get on
Netflix already now I'm a sliding on the
head III borrow a friend's account now I
just watch spies like us oh my god watch
that cuz right right now we're in like
this Cold War era you gotta go watch
that movie because I'm funny and is on
Netflix
you know kids if you don't know what
we're talking about trust us spies like
us it might be just a little oh it's one
of the one of the that's when comedy
comedy holds up for sure anyways again
Apple trying to get in the business of
content I doesn't excite me because they
already want to put it behind their
Apple
paywall and i'm sorry it took us that
long to get to that point but yeah it's
you know there's nothing exciting about
putting two behind Apple music they
gotta hire someone who's willing to just
let actors and directors do what they
want and make this awesome stuff then
they'll be winning Emmys like Amazon and
Netflix are there they're winning Golden
Globe Awards Amazon is doing like
Netflix is going bonkers right Amazon
has carved a nice little niche and
reward when he's they've got some cool
stuff yes right yeah but let's just that
the whole dynamic between Netflix and
Amazon shows you how tough it really is
that Amazon a company that bundles their
programming with an Amazon Prime service
right yeah it's not like they're getting
30 top-tier shows they're being very
selective picking and choosing and they
do have some great shows but if you
match up Amazon shows compared to
Netflix I mean come on where are you
going where you gonna go like if you had
to pick one or the other where you're
gonna go you already know the answer to
that
Hulu Apple music is music is the correct
answer for carpool karaoke and vital
signs yes and this depth is Danny the
dr. Dre show to this by Netflix already
just just do it this is the best advice
you could ever get all right you know um
so we wanted we're gonna wrap things up
here but again we just want to let you
know call us be a part of the show let's
talk about what you expect from Apple
the future but more anything are you
excited about the future of Apple I
think that we've gotten to the point
where we need to ask this question and
talk about it a couple years ago I said
is Apple lost their magic everyone was
pissed at me no you know it's the
conversation you want to have to and I'm
not trying to talk down though let's be
real here so um let's hear what you guys
have to say guys and gals I'd love to
hear that call us
