Chromebook the convertible laptop can
prop up as a tenth whip over into a
stand or transform into a tablet it's
impeccably designed with the smooth
glass panel on the back and minimal
branding it's very thin at a little over
10 millimeters thick and lightweight
weighing just under two and a half
pounds it has two USB sea ports a
headphone jack power button and volume
rocker the silicone pads on the keyboard
deck are a nice touch they feel pleasant
and the keyboard itself is quite
uncomfortable to type on the pixel book
has a dedicated Google assistant button
on its backlit keyboard it quickly
launches the assistant window and can
analyze what's currently on your screen
and offer popular search results Google
made a stylus that works specifically
with the pixel book the pixel book pen
does it require charging or pairing it
sold separately and costs $99 it's more
than just a stylus for writing and
drawing though the pixel book pen works
like a magic wand that only works for
Google searches when using the stylus
you can press a little button and
highlight text or circle an image then
get a search result shortly after it
worked well for image searches but texts
needed to be very specific and ordered
for the search to offer more than a
dictionary definition there is no place
to store the stylus on the laptop so
best of luck not losing it pricing for
the Google pixel book starts at 999
dollars that's really expensive for a
Chromebook
but Google justifies its price with a
laptop luxe design and high-end internal
components
but still for the cost of one pixel book
you could buy two Samsung Chromebook pro
laptops or an iPhone 10 and even though
Chrome OS now has access to the Google
Play Store
meaning Chromebooks can download
millions of apps and games there's still
a lack of support for Android apps on
devices with large screens it's hard to
justify spending so much on a chrome OS
laptop the pixel book is beautiful and
fast but it's just too expensive to
recommend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
