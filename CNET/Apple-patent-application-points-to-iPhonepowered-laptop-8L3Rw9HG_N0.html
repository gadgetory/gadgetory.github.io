patents are far from everyone's favorite
topic however due to their nature
companies must disclose cool stuff they
might be working on filed in September
2016 an Apple patent essentially details
a laptop shell that is powered by an
iPhone going through the patent claims
here's how the accessory would work or
not work the laptop life shelf would
have a recessed housing for an
electronic host device in the
illustration that host device appears to
be an iPhone the iPhone would still be
able to receive touch inputs from a
person the shell itself would not do
much besides provide power a keyboard
and a display this isn't Apple's first
patent like this back in 2004 Apple
filed for a patent on a media player
system it detailed the various ways to
dock an iPod including a laptop and an
iMac
as you can see patents don't necessarily
mean we'll ever see a product however
considering the new MacBook Pros
integrate a touch bar the idea of a dual
interface a polite word not be entirely
foreign to consumers motorola tried
something similar years ago with the
Motorola Atrix 4G the design was far
from elegant with the phone being housed
in the back of the laptop dock of the
design
CNET editor Scott Stein said a more
sensible idea to me would have been to
dock the Atrix in the bottom of the
keyboard deck flat so you could still
operate the touchscreen like a second
screen that was back in 2011 for more
