tracker may not have HR and its naming
scheme like its predecessor did but it
does include a heart rate monitor with
24/7 monitoring and add two new smart
features while returning to the slimmer
design and hidden display of the
original vivosmart
it costs a little less to at $140 it
competes with the Fitbit Alta HR and the
Fitbit charge 2 and comes in two color
options black and purple although the
purple version is only available with a
smaller band that won't be suitable for
those with bigger wrists what's new well
aside from the ultra slim design which I
liked a lot you get higher-end fitness
tracking tools such as vo2 max and
Fitness age all de-stress tracking and a
rep counter when pumping iron or doing
push-ups and pull-ups this model is
fully waterproof down to 50 meters a big
plus in its favor
both the Fitbit and this tracker also
featured notification alerts when
connected via bluetooth to your phone
the battery life for the vivosmart 3 is
rated at up to 5 days and I was able to
consistently get close to that this is
the first product in the Garmin vivofit
to estimate vo2 max a measurable
indication of aerobic performance that
was previously available only in
higher-end Garmin running watches your
vo2 max score translates into a fitness
level ranging from for superior and it's
also used to calculate your fitness age
the idea of course is to increase your
vo2 max and reduce your fitness age
through a steady workout regime overall
I like the vivosmart 3 particularly its
light slim design and thought both the
touchscreen and the device was pretty
responsive I found it a little more
comfortable to wear than the Fitbit
charge too but I thought the fit fit was
a little more responsive more user
friendly and display is a little easier
to read also the vivosmart threes
display didn't always turn on when I
turn my wrist which could be annoying
ultimately this is a very good activity
tracker that's waterproof and loaded
with features but it does have some
small downsides the biggest of which is
that some people may find that it's a
little hard to navigate and access all
those features quickly and easily and to
make use of them in general I'm David
karna for cnet.com that's a quick look
at garmin vivosmart 3 thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
