iPad art now you don't need a pen or any
sort of stylus to create art like this
on an iPad just use your little finger
ask any Draw Something addict then again
there's a pretty big market for iPad
skylight why because the more art that
you do on an iPad or any sort of
capacitive tablet like an Android tablet
you're probably going to want to use
something like a pen otherwise that the
finger painting can get a little bit
tiring there are a lot of style I on the
market and one of the favorites that I
saw last year was the Wacom Bamboo
Stylus a 30-dollar stylus that had a
nice aluminum barrel and a good feel to
it and a nice rubber tip well lo and
behold Wacom has introduced the stylus
duo for people who still like writing on
regular pads with pens because it is a
stylus with a pen on the other end
pretty obvious and pretty clever this is
ten dollars more than last year's wacom
stylus and it's a little bit larger to
accommodate the size and feel of a pen
would be plus there's a refillable ink
cartridge in here that works like any
standard refillable ballpoint ink pen I
mean it's not the most spectacular pen
but it's a fine pen it's got a nice
little fine tip there does everything
you'd think a pen would do and the other
side here has a rubberized capacitive
stylus tip that works just like last
year's now if anyone hasn't used a
capacitive stylus before you might be a
little thrown by the fact that it
doesn't come to a sharp tip it kind of
replicates what your finger does and it
has a soft touch but it doesn't have any
pressure sensitivity because there is no
pressure sensitivity on styli using the
iPad unlike what you'd see on the
samsung galaxy note but still use the
wacom stylus and you'll find that that
soft touch gives a lot more flexibility
at least for me then my finger does
although you'll notice that there's a
little bit of a delay in most apps
that's not quite like what you would
have when you put a pen to paper keep
the cap off and I think it's a little
too short for as a pen but if you put
that cap on the back it feels perfect
now what's the appeal of having a pen in
the Styles together it's one less thing
to carry in your bag I mean when you get
your keyboard your case your shammy your
stylist it gets to be a lot of
accessories for a device that was
supposed to be pure and minimal and have
no accessories that was the whole life
dia behind the ipad in the first place
but if you're an artist and if you find
yourself using a lot of the great sketch
apps that around the ipad already like
paper and and all these other programs
then you might find yourself really
gained kick out of using one of these
style light and remember this is not
just for the ipad it's for any
capacitive tablet or even something like
a smartphone you could use this on an
android phone you could use on an iphone
you could use on an android tablet as
long as it's got that capacitive touch
interface then this will work just fine
i'm scott stein and that's a look at the
Wacom Bamboo Stylus duo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
