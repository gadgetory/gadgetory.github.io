today we're gonna take a look at the
Falcon Northwest T key so this is a
high-end slim tower gaming PC you might
remember the Alienware x51 from earlier
this year that system cost about $9.99
this one goes for 2,800 bucks in this
configuration it starts at 1800 this is
a higher end version has an overclocked
core i7 chip as well as a geforce 6800
gtx graphics card so in addition to
being a very fast computer you can see
that there's a granite base here in the
bottom designed to sort of keep the
system stable because it's a very slim
system and kind of tall it tends to be
top-heavy so it's easy to knock over to
solve that problem Falco Northwest has
gone for a polished granite base it
comes in a couple different options
aesthetically I'm not really sure about
it you might like it I kind of think it
looks like an Employee of the Month
award but overall it does kind of do its
job here but for the system itself
Falcon was actually doing some pretty
cool stuff at this the only question is
if you really want to pay that much for
the relatively limited slim tower case
so the front of the system is nice and
clean it's got this sort of sleek black
look to it overall appear at the top
there's a slot loading blu-ray drive as
well as a couple of USB 3 jacks as well
as power reset in a couple audio jacks
as well up here in the back you'll see
an upside down version of a standard PC
layout there's a couple USB ports down
here digital audio output wireless
antenna Jack's USB 3/8 Ornette eSATA and
up here you've got analog audio ones
here in the graphics card you've got two
DVI Jack's HDMI and DisplayPort outputs
so even though this is a slim tower PC
there's actually a remarkable amount of
hardware in here you can see there's a
liquid cooling rig connected here to the
side panel goes here to the overclocked
CPU that's a core i7 3770k chip or
o'clock to four point three gigahertz
there's a standard 2 terabyte hard drive
here as well as a solid-state drive in
room for another solid-state one if you
wanted to of course that would jack the
price up down here you've got 8 gigs of
memory and up here there's a graphics
card and it's dual wide board connected
via daughter card so design wise that
really sets the system apart from the
Alienware it's not only the water
cooling rig but also the fact that the
power supply is built into the system
the Alienware x51 had an external power
supply and it was kind of giant brick
and only gave you 330 watts of power
Falcons managed to cram
450 watt power supply in here so you
really don't need to worry about
overclocking or the high-end graphics
card maxing out the system of course due
to the specialized nature of the system
aside from the solid-state drive there
really is no room for upgrading so
Falcon has taken the slim tower game PC
concept well beyond what Alienware I
came up with of course it charges more
for that privilege but you also seem to
get a lot more power the question though
is how much do you want to pay for this
when you can pay say 200 hours more for
a system that's actually pretty small
but let's use two graphics cards and is
otherwise relatively equal in terms of
its performance you can find such a PC
from main gear which makes us wonder how
good a value this system really is
overall I can recommend this someone who
has their mind specifically set on a
slim tower gaming PC otherwise you could
probably get better deal for your money
and even still have a pretty small
chassis
sorry much Brown this is the Falcon
