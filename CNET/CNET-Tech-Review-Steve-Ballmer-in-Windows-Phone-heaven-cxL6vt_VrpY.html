Ballmer shows off new Windows Phone 7
models find things on Facebook that you
would probably rather forget
Sony's internet TV is one screen worth
watching and an a sous monitor that
probably isn't it's all coming up right
now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the CNET tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of our bottom line
but let's start with the good way back
in February Microsoft announced the
Windows Phone 7 Series at Mobile World
Congress 2010 fast forward to October
and the new Zune like handsets are
finally ready for their debut Microsoft
Steve Ballmer was on hand to personally
unveil nine different models and our own
ena freed sat down with him afterwards
to talk about them
I mean if read with CNET here in New
York for the launch of Windows Phone 7
where Steve Ballmer is about to show off
Microsoft's answer to the iPhone and
Android and all the other smart phones
that it hopes to compete against we
think there's a lot of things that
you'll see today that'll help you
understand how the Windows Phone is
different but I'd focus on two key
themes always delightful and wonderfully
mine will have nine phones available
when the Windows Phone chips here in the
United States in November there's a
range of phones here from LG from
Samsung from HTC and from Dell all
windows phones in fact have at least a
full gigahertz processor and have
several other great standard features
under the hood and we're thrilled to be
launching the Samsung Focus on November
the 8th and the HTC surround and the LG
quantum just a few weeks later u-verse
Mobile is an application we launched
earlier this year to let our u-verse TV
customers download and watch hit TV
shows on their smart phones starting
next month we'll bring this capability
to Windows Phone 7 customers and if you
don't have AT&amp;amp;T u-verse TV we're gonna
let you do that
nationwide for any Windows Phone for a
low monthly fee
one of the key features for making the
phone really wonderfully yours really
deeply personal is being able to put the
people that you care about right up
there on your start experience in a live
tile and these tiles are live because as
Steve updated his Facebook post you can
see if he posts pictures I'll see them
right there I don't have to go in and
out of a whole lot of applications to
see all these sorts of things its
aggregated for me right on the home
screen um st said we want the phone
experience to be always delightful
whether you're using our software
third-party software or no matter which
phone you buy we're trying to make it
easy for end-users but also for
developers the pictures hub has
automatically customized with pictures
of my twins you see my Xbox Live avatar
these games were developed using XNA
which is a development framework that
works both on the Xbox and on the phone
these phones are gonna be amazing game
machines and with games developed that
are happening on the Xbox platform as
well we think people have a terrific
experience well then you have it it's
mostly what we expected but a few things
that one should pay attention to one
copy-and-paste coming in early 2011 also
while the first models are gonna hit
AT&amp;amp;T November 8 some of the models for
both AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile will be somewhat
later than that and then also all the
AT&amp;amp;T phones are gonna be priced at $1.99
for those were the new contracts
I mean if read with C net here was Steve
Ballmer the CEO of Microsoft you just
introduced Windows Phone Steve you've
talked about how Windows Phone is
different kind of phone what do you mean
by that different kind of phone in the
sense that we think we can help people
get in and out and back to life quickly
it all begins with the Start screen you
see the Start screen really brings a set
of activities and people and websites
that are important to you right to the
forefront of the user interface it
starts with being very personal we have
devices of various shapes and for its
forms keyboards no keyboards AMOLED
screen very durable devices machines
that are phones that are optimized with
surround sound and Dolby sound so you
get a raw a wide variety of choices and
yet a consistent the lightful user
interface
that's about you do you guys feel
there's an opportunity to have it sounds
like more variety than Apple but perhaps
not as much variety and not as much
fragmentation as in the Android world I
think you clearly have a lot more
variety than Apple has there's really
one choice in the Apple in the Apple
world big screen little screen we got a
lot of choices I think the problem if
you don't have a minimum kind of
standard is the brand means nothing to
the user our brand means something to
the user it means something to the
developer it implies a certain level of
consistency and high quality which i
think is important for the Windows Phone
what do you do on the phone what are the
things that matter the most to you that
you're like I want to do this when I'm
using the phone and I don't really want
to do X Y or Z I do their very little I
won't do when I'm on my phone I
certainly do the typical email messaging
I make phone calls not surprising a lot
of them and I don't want those calls
dropped I actually kind of fairly active
on Facebook I'm kind of watching what's
going on in that world I do in fact
travel a lot so the fact that I can kind
of take my office with me is important
and I can take some videos to watch and
music to listen to it's all great for me
actually as a as a mobile mobile person
are there things that you think will be
doing on our phones a couple years from
now that we don't do today that you guys
want to be positioned to do well in the
future I think we're gonna see a
continual evolution the way these things
interact I mean this will be a projector
someday hold it up put it down on the
kickstand and project we'll be able to
more and more with sensors to capture
images and you see what we've done with
Xbox Kinect you can let your mind run
wild on kind of what that might be in
the context of a mobile device I see a
lot of opportunities thanks a lot Steve
I appreciate it thank you Christina
I mean afraid
you can find the rest of Venus interview
with Steve Ballmer over at scene at
tv.com but ok enough talking about
Windows Phone 7
let's see some phones here's Bonnie cha
with a look at some of the new handsets
that are headed your way
hi I'm Bonnie Todd senior editor at
Phoenix comm and we're here in New York
for the Windows Phone 7 launch and today
18 key announced three phones that will
be coming for the holiday season all
will cost one $99.99 with a contract and
the first one we have for hands-on looks
is the HTC surround now this is the
first mobile device to have Dolby's
surround sound and so just push down the
screen and you've got a little speaker
system it also has a kickstand on the
back so you can lay it on a flat surface
and watch video and listen to music as
well other highlights of the surrounding
put a 5 megapixel camera as well as
video recording and actually all the 18t
phones will come with the AT&amp;amp;T u-verse
mobile which is a video streaming
service so that will be on all the
Windows Phone 7 devices from AT&amp;amp;T
overall the design looks really nice
very solid and HTC has had a good
history of making great design so it's
like this around follows that pack so
let's go check out the other two device
here we have the Samsung Focus it's
going to be the first one in launched on
November 8th like a lot of the Samsung
Galaxy phones this one has a four inch
Super AMOLED screen which is going to be
great for the Xbox experience as well
soon and again the AT&amp;amp;T u-verse other
highlights of the focus include a 5
megapixel camera 8 gigabytes of internal
memory as well as an expansion slot so
that's really a nice tip II and finally
we have here the LG quantum which is a
little more business-focused than the
other smartphones it has a slide up full
QWERTY keyboard and it feels pretty nice
to you so it'll be great for email and
messaging Windows Phone 7 also offers a
virtual keyboard which I found seems
pretty easy to use by its looks other
business highlights of Windows Phone 7
include Outlook integration as well as
other emails protocols also has the
office suite so you can view and edit
office documents such as PowerPoint Word
and Excel just a quick rundown of some
of the other design features you've got
the hardware buttons down here which are
required on all Windows Phone 7 devices
which is the back previous button the
start button as well as search you've
got a little micro USB port here as well
as a camera on back and flush a volume
rocker and camera activation and just as
a reminder all three phones will be
available from 18t the Samsung Focus
will launch
November 8 and the rest will follow the
holiday season and they're all going to
be $1.99 99 with a two-year contract I'm
Bonnie time that's been your first look
at the Windows Phone 7 zones for 80s
now for all you iphone folks who've been
feeling burned by AT&amp;amp;T service and are
looking for another excuse to switch
maybe now is the time let's see what
Bonnie has to say about these windows
phones for t-mobile hi I'm Bonnie Jos
senior editor at cnet.com and we're here
in New York for the Windows Phone 7
launch and today I've got the HTC hd7
which will be available through t-mobile
in November this is Windows Phone 7
device and it was actually got the
biggest - screen all the Windows Phone 7
devices it's 4.3 inches diagonally so
it'll also have the largest virtual
keyboard really beautiful screen here
t-mobile is gonna take advantage of the
screen and bundling some entertainment
apps with it including Netflix as well
as t-mobile TVs
it'll also have a family app where you
can send out group messages and share
calendars as well design-wise sort of
like to even afford a very very solid
design you've got the three shortcut
buttons down here on back you've got a
five megapixel camera with HD video
capture and got a kickstand which we
always love so the HD 7 will be
available in mid November pricing has
not been announced yet in addition to
the HD 7 t-mobile II will be launching
the Dell Venue Pro so we're gonna go
take a hands-on look at that next all
right we are here with Dell as they will
be bringing the Dell Venue Pro to
t-mobile for the holiday season and
can you give us a few highlights of the
Dell Venue Pro first I'd be happy to so
as you said this is the Dell Venue Pro
it will be available for holiday what's
unique about this phone it is the only
one with an integrated 40 keyboard but
in portrait mode a lot of the microsoft
operating system is optimized more for
portrait like the Start screen certain
applications are in portrait only as
well but just some key features about
the phone like I said it does have the
integrated keyboard for those that like
to actually have a physical keyboard the
portrait mode actually lets it be
optimized for one-handed text messaging
as well it also has an on-screen
keyboard if you prefer that it has a
four point one inch AMOLED display so
you can see it's a very vibrant the
resolution is great the pixels per inch
are good it also I don't know if you can
tell here but it's got a curvature to
the lens which actually is more like an
aesthetic in his Parrilla class on it
which makes it extra durable has a five
megapixel camera on it and it does come
with a gigabyte and we'll also be
selling a 16 gigabyte version as well
all right those are the two phones that
will be available from t-mobile this
holiday season the HTC hd7 will march in
mid-november and the Dell Venue Pro will
be available sometime for the holidays
I'm personally really excited about the
Dell Venue Pro because of the form
factor but we're looking forward to
reviewing them both I'm Bonnie Tom this
been your first look at the HTC hd7 and
Dell Venue Pro for t-mobile and if
that's not enough Windows Phone 7 frenzy
for you head on over to Cena tv.com for
bonney's look at some handsets for the
international market and just a condole
quartz demo of some noteworthy apps but
don't go there yet because we still have
a lot more tech review coming up
including our first look at Sony's
internet TV with google TV built in
that's coming up in just a minute so
stick around
and welcome back to the CNET tech review
our weekly video digest of all things
good and bad we've seen here at Sina TV
continuing on in the good
we certainly kept our New York team busy
this week in addition to the Windows
Phone 7 launch we were also on hand for
the premiere of the sony internet TV
with google TV inside here's David Katz
Meyer with a decidedly thorough overview
hi I'm David Katz Meyer from C net here
with the sony internet TV with google TV
the first product of its kind it's a
television that builds in Google TV
service right into the TV so there's no
need for any external set-top box or
anything like that to get your Google TV
functionality this is a standard
edge-lit TV with not too many bells and
whistles 120 Hertz or anything like that
the main feature on this thing is Google
TV Google TV for the uninitiated allows
you to basically search internet video
sources as well as your own TV sources
from cable set-top or antenna right from
the same search window so you can just
go in type in a search for a show title
up will come results from the internet
from the various TV services as well as
from your own cable or satellite so it's
the first we've kind of incorporate all
of those sources into one easy to search
window the Sony TV comes with this
remote here that's kind of a little
handheld unit little reminiscent of the
pleasse 3 controller it's got a built-in
QWERTY keyboard so you can type in
whatever you want to the search results
screen it's also got what I consider a
pretty cool little touch sensitive Mouse
it allows you to drive your cursor
around on the screen and select items
there's also a standard up/down
left/right arrows that allow you to
select items a little more easily so all
things considered it's a pretty slick
remote although it is a little bulkier
than your standard TV remote it will
probably take a little bit of getting
used to the remote incorporates RF
technology so you don't need line of
sight between the remote and the
television the TV can also control your
other devices including the cable box
and a couple of other AV devices via IR
blasters allows it to incorporate for
example search results from the TV
itself including an EPG you don't get
full integration however unless you hook
up this thing to a dish DVR which allows
you to search the DVR and also
incorporate a couple of other control
features including control over IP as
opposed to
read the Sony NSX GT 1 series is
available in four screen sizes I'm with
the 46 inch here there's also a 40 a 32
and a little 24 inch here all of them
have that LED edgelet backlighting
except for the 24 which is a standard
CCFL display price points range from
$5.99 for the 24 up to 13 99 for the 46
inch though prices are actually pretty
good and in line with a lot of the other
well featured HD TVs on the market today
Sony's also announcing a blu-ray player
at the 399 price point it's the nsz GT 1
it incorporates all those Google TV
features and of course it doesn't have a
screen but it does have a built in
blu-ray so you can get all of your
Google TV goodness including the remote
from a separate standalone blu-ray
player that's for people who already own
a TV and want to get the Google TV
experience we'll walk through a couple
of features on Google TV it does include
Netflix Amazon video on-demand Twitter
and a few other apps right out of the
box we expect more apps to come in the
future so let's use Facebook but the
real killer app of Google TV is its
access to the Internet so you can
actually go out using its built-in
Chrome browser and search a variety of
Internet video websites for example to
comedycentral.com be a sorg and a lot of
other places that have Internet video
that aren't easily available on a lot of
the other internet enabled TVs and
blu-ray players out there one big
missing link right now whoever is
hulu.com you cannot search the hulu.com
website or play any of its videos right
now on this device we're expecting
Google to announce sites compatibility
with Hulu Plus in the future but they're
still in talks at the moment on the
other hand you do have Netflix Amazon
video in demand and the ability to
search Sony's curiosity VOD service
that's a proprietary feature this TV
Sony also offers a few other content
options familiar with its bravia
internet link service including Howcast
blip TV and a few other niche video
websites so that's a content offering a
step above the Logitech Revue which is
the only other Google TV box on the
market right now one other big
difference between the Sony and the
Logitech box is the Sony at the moment
does not allow you to stream video and
audio over a DLNA connection so you
can't use the Sony TV to go out and play
streaming video directly over your home
network speaking of apps in 2011 google
says it will allow access for Google TV
products to go out and use the Android
Market which has thousands of apps
designed for smartphones it'll be
interesting to see how those apps apply
to the big screen but it is
the unlimited content development for
the Google TV products that's a quick
look at the sony internet TV with google
TV functionality I'm David Katz mark
from seen it Wow
yeah that remote is definitely something
to be reckoned with but considering that
the standalone Google TV box from
Logitech is 300 bucks by itself
$13.99 for sony's 46 inch model
not too shabby at all alright but now
let's give some of our SF peeps some
face time as we move along to the bad
when it comes to pronunciation some tech
companies have names or products that
are open to interpretation nokia comes
to mind nokia nokia or OS 10 versus OS X
the same goes for a soos but as Eric
Franklin found out having a funny
sounding name is far from the biggest
problem with this new monitor hey guys
is Eric Franco I'm cnet.com and today
we're taking a first look at the asus ve
276 q it also looks fairly slight for a
27 inch err with a thin profile compared
to other monitors of its size the house
loses bezel is low to the desktop making
accessing its connection options kind of
a hassle those connection options
include one HDMI port a DVI port VGA and
DisplayPort the display also includes an
ambient light sensor visa wall support
and built-in speakers sounds from the
speaker's was adequate although much too
low even at max volume the on screen
display includes several preset options
as well as brightness contrast and
sharpness options
also when a night view mode you're given
the option of just in the saturation and
changing the skin tone from natural
yellowish and reddish why this option is
only available in night view mode is a
mystery to us as it would have been
useful in other presets
in movies we notice a green tent push
but only when a monitor was sitting next
to the bank um 2700 HD which didn't have
the same tint problem the AHS who says
theater preset was not as apt as the
BenQ and displaying dark detail in dark
scenes either
in games we found the display to deliver
a bright image with a good level of
vibrancy
however when directly compared with the
bank you we once again did notice a
slight green tint to the image again we
need to stress that this isn't something
we likely notice the two monitors
weren't sitting right next to each other
the others isn't a particularly bad
monitor it just doesn't offer enough in
terms of performance and features to
warrant a stronger recommendation the
biggest thing that has going forward is
its price at $330 it's the lowest price
of the recent 27 inches we've reviewed
and includes a useful assortment of
connections and built-in speakers
unfortunately the speaker sound is
muffled there's a slight green tint to
the image compared to the BenQ and has
less connection options in the bank you
as well which costs only $20 more unless
that $20 is a big deal for you we
recommend the Ben QM 2700 HD over the
asus ve 276 q thanks to its better
performance and more numerous features
once again this is Eric Franklin and
this has been the first look at the
Ossus ve 276 q
for the record if you ask us Seuss
they'll tell you it's pronounced a Seuss
either way it sounds like it's a pass on
the assist but be sure to check out
Eric's review of the BenQ m270 0 HD
which although more expensive sounds
like a much better value all right now
let's turn our attention to the bottom
line there's no denying that Facebook
has changed the way we interact with
people we share our thoughts our
activities we schedule events and then
post photos and videos of the events
afterwards but if you've ever been
curious to see everything you've ever
posted to Facebook or you just want to
back up items that only exist on the
site then check out this super handy tip
from Josh Lewin s'en hey I'm Josh
Levinson with cnet.com and I'm going to
show you how to use Facebook's new
download your information feature it
lets you grab an offline copy of
everything you've ever sent to the
social network including photos videos
as well as your entire private message
inbox and a list of events to get
started log into Facebook and then head
to the account button in the top right
then click on account settings near the
bottom of the page you'll see a download
your information setting and click on
learn more here you'll be asked to
re-enter your Facebook password if
you're using a computer that you don't
normally browse Facebook from it will
have you solve a CAPTCHA - the first
time you ask for this information
Facebook needs a little bit of time to
collect it for you for us this took
about 10 minutes from hitting the
download button to when it was actually
ready to download Facebook then sends
you an email link when the download link
is ready what you end up with is a file
that unzips with a folder for us this
was 270 megabytes but it can be much
larger or much smaller depending on how
much media you've uploaded included in
the folder are subfolders for your
photos and one for videos as well as
something called index.html which you
can click on to view an offline version
of your profile this includes everything
that's ever been posted to your wall
photo and video pages a full list of
friends every event you ever RSVP to and
the entirety of your private
message inbox for both the message inbox
and the wall you get everything that's
ever been posted on one long page this
can be a little hard to parse so if you
feel like saving some time use your
browsers on page search feature if it
has one worth noting is that you'll get
the original quality of the videos you
uploaded even if they're in high
definition but that's not the case for
photos which are the same size as what
you see on Facebook this isn't a problem
with photos you may have uploaded since
Facebook added support for high
resolution shots but something to keep
in mind if you think you're going to get
the originals back another thing to keep
in mind is that there's a ton of
personal information in this folder and
while Facebook has gone to great lengths
to keep the wrong people from
downloading it once you have it it's a
big unprotected jackpot of information
we recommend using the file level
password protection that's built into
your machine for more information on
that check out our other how to's I'm
Josh Lowen sin' and this has been a
quick how-to on using Facebook's
information downloader
for more check out cnet.com
the bottom line this week nice job
Facebook for once finally a feature
that's actually useful but doesn't
expose your private info to prying eyes
until you forget to log out of your
account and someone comes along and
downloads your whole life that couldn't
happen right could that happen
okay folks it is time for me to go join
us next week when we'll have our apples
back to the Mack event coverage until
then there are tons of great videos
available every day at CNET tv.com I'll
see you next time and thank you for
