Ballmer shows off new windows phone
seven models find things on Facebook
that you would probably rather forget
Sony's internet TV is one screen worth
watching and Anna Seuss monitor that
probably isn't it's all coming up right
now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of our bottom line
but let's start with the good way back
in February microsoft announced the
windows phone 7 series at Mobile World
Congress 2010 fast forward to October
and the new zune like handsets are
finally ready for their debut Microsoft
Steve Ballmer was on hand to personally
unveil nine different models and our own
inna freed sat down with him afterwards
to talk about them I mean a freed with
Cena here in New York for the launch of
windows phone 7 where Steve Ballmer is
about to show off Microsoft's answer to
the iphone and android and all the other
smartphones that it hopes to compete
against we think there's a lot of things
that you'll see today that will help you
understand how the windows phone is
different but I'd focus on two key
themes always delightful and wonderfully
mine will have nine phones available
when the windows phone ships here in the
United States in November there's a
range of phones here from LG from
Samsung from HTC and from Dell all
windows phones in fact have at least a
full gigahertz processor and have
several other great standard features
under the hood and we're thrilled to be
launching the samsung focus on november
the eighth and the HTC surround and the
LG quantum just a few weeks later
u-verse mobile is an application we
launched earlier this year to let our
u-verse TV customers download and watch
hit TV shows on their smartphones
starting next month we'll bring this
capability to Windows Phone 7 customers
and if you don't have AT&amp;amp;T u-verse TV
we're going to let you do that
nationwide for any windows phone for a
low monthly fee
one of the key features for making the
phone really wonderfully yours really
deeply personal is being able to put the
people that you care about right up
there on your Start experience in a live
tile and these tiles are live because as
Steve updated his facebook post you can
see if he posts pictures I'll see them
right there I don't have to go in and
out of a whole lot of applications to
see all these sorts of things it's
aggregated for me right on the home
screen s Steve said we want the phone
experience to be always delightful
whether you're using our software
third-party software or no matter which
phone you buy we're trying to make it
easy for end users but also for
developers the pictures hub has
automatically customized with pictures
of my twins you see my xbox live avatar
these games were developed using XNA
which is a development framework that
works both on the Xbox and on the phone
these phones are going to be amazing
game machines and with games developed
that are happening on the Xbox platform
as well we think people have a terrific
experience well then you have it it's
mostly what we expected but a few things
that one should pay attention to one
copy and paste coming in early 2011 also
while the first models are going to hit
AT&amp;amp;T november eight some of the models
for both AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile will be
somewhat later than that and then also
all the AT&amp;amp;T phones are going to be
priced at 199 for those were the new
contract amina freed with cnet here with
Steve Ballmer the CEO of Microsoft you
just introduce Windows Phone Steve
you've talked about how Windows Phone
it's different kind of phone what do you
mean by that different kind of fun in
the sense that we think we can help
people get in and out and back to life
quickly it all begins with the Start
screen you see the Start screen really
brings a set of activities and people
and websites that are important to you
right to the forefront of the user
interface it starts with being very
personal we have devices of various
shapes and Ford's forms keyboards no
keyboards a mowatt screen very durable
devices machines that are phones that
are optimized with surround sound Dolby
sound so you get a raw a wide variety of
choices and yet a consistent delightful
user interface
that's about you do you guys feel
there's an opportunity to have it sounds
like more variety than Apple but perhaps
not as much variety and not as much
fragmentation as in the Android world I
think you clearly have a lot more
variety than apple has there's really
one choice in the Apple in the Apple
world big screen little screen we got a
lot of choices I think the problem if
you don't have a minimum kind of
standard is the brand means nothing to
the user our brand means something to
the user it means something to the
developer it implies a certain level of
consistency and high quality which i
think is important for the windows phone
what do you do on the phone what are the
things that matter the most to you that
you're like I want to do this when i'm
using the phone and i don't really want
to do X Y or Z I do they're very little
I won't do when I'm on my phone I
certainly do the typical email messaging
I make phone calls not surprising a lot
of them and I don't want those calls
drop I actually kind of fairly active on
Facebook I'm kind of watching what's
going on in that world I do in fact
travel a lot so the fact that I can kind
of take my office with me is important
and I can take some videos to watch and
music to listen to it's all great for me
actually as a as a mobile mobile person
are there things that you think will be
doing on our phones a couple of years
from now that we don't do today that you
guys want to be positioned to do well in
the future I think we're going to see a
continual evolution the way these things
interact I mean this will be a projector
someday hold it up put it down on the
kickstand and project will be able to
more and more with sensors to capture
images and you see what we've done with
Xbox Kinect you can let your mind run
wild on kind of what that might be in
the context of a mobile device I see a
lot of opportunities thanks a lot Steve
I appreciate it thank you for seeing it
I mean afraid
you can find the rest of Venus interview
with Steve Ballmer over at cnet TV com
but okay enough talking about Windows
Phone 7 let's see some phones here's
Bonnie cha with a look at some of the
new handsets that are headed your way hi
I'm Bonnie Todd senior editor at cnet
com and we're here in New York for the
windows phone 7 launch and today 18 key
announced three phones that will be
coming for the holiday season all will
cost 199 99 with the contract and the
first one we have for hands-on luck is
the HTC surround now this is the first
mobile device to have dolby's surround
sound and so just push down the screen
and you've got a little speaker system
it also has a kickstand on the back so
you can lay it on a flat surface and
watch video and listen to music as well
other highlights of the surrounding code
a 5 megapixel camera as well as video
recording and actually all the 18t
phones will come with the AT&amp;amp;T u-verse
mobile which is a video streaming
service so that will be on all the
windows phone 7 devices from AT&amp;amp;T
overall the design looks really nice
very solid in him HTC has had a good
history of making great design so it's
like this around follow that path so
let's go check out the other two devices
here we have the samsung focus is going
to be the first one in launched on
november eight like a lot of the Samsung
Galaxy phones this one has a 4 inch
Super AMOLED screen which is going to be
great for the xbox experience as well as
soon and again the AT&amp;amp;T u-verse other
highlights of the focus include a 5
megapixel camera 8 gigabytes of internal
memory as well as an expansion slot so
it's really nice to see and finally we
have here the LG quantum which is a
little more business focus than the
other smartphone so it has a slight up
full qwerty keyboard and it feels pretty
nice to use so it'll be great for email
and messaging windows phone 7 also
offers a virtual keyboard which I found
seems pretty easy to use by its looks
other business highlights of Windows
Phone 7 include outlook integration as
well as other emails protocols also has
the office suite so you can view and
edit Office documents such as PowerPoint
Word and Excel just a quick rundown of
some of the other design features you've
got the hardware buttons down here which
are required on all windows phone 7
devices which is the back previous
button the start button as well as
search you've got a little micro USB
port here as well as a camera on back
and flesh of volume rocker and camera
activation key and just as a reminder
all three phones will be available from
18t the same some focus to launch
november eighth and the rest will follow
the holiday season and they're all going
to be 1 99 99 with a two-year contract
I'm Bonnie time this has been your first
book of the windows phone 7 14 18 now
for all you iphone folks who've been
feeling burned by AT&amp;amp;T service and are
looking for another excuse to switch
maybe now is the time let's see what
body has to say about these windows
phones for t-mobile hi I'm Bonnie toss
senior editor at cnet com and we're here
in New York for the windows phone 7
launch and today I've got the HTC hd7
which will be available through t-mobile
in November this is Windows Phone 7
device and it will actually got the
biggest to screen of all the windows
phone 7 devices it's 4.3 inches
diagonally so it'll also have the
largest virtual keyboard really
beautiful screen here t-mobile is going
to take advantage of the screen and
bundling some entertainment apps with it
including netflix as well as t mobile TV
it'll also have a family app where you
can send out group messages and share
calendars as well design-wise sort of
like the evo 4g a very very solid design
got 23 shortcut buttons down here on
back you've got a 5 megapixel camera
with HD video capture and got a
kickstand which we always love so the
hd7 will be available in mid-november
pricing has not been announced yet in
addition to the hd7 t-mobile we will be
launching the dell venue pro so we're
going to go take a hands-on look at that
next alright we are here with Dell as
they will be bringing the dell venue pro
2 t-mobile for the holiday season
and Julie and L can you give us a few
highlights of the dell venue pro first
I'd be happy to so as you said this is
the dell venue pro it will be available
for holiday what's unique about this
phone it is the only one with an
integrated 40 keyboard but in portrait
mode a lot of the Microsoft operating
system is optimized more for portrait
like the start screen certain
applications are in portrait only as
well but just some key features about
the phone like I said it does have the
integrated keyboard for those that like
to actually have a physical keyboard the
portrait mode actually lets it be
optimized for one-handed text messaging
as well it also has an on-screen
keyboard if you prefer that it has a
four point one inch AMOLED display so
you can see it's very vibrant the
resolution is great the pixels per inch
are good it also i don't know if you can
tell here but it's got a curvature to
the lens which actually is more like an
aesthetic it has gorilla glass on it
which makes it extra durable has a 5
megapixel camera on it and it does come
with a gigabyte and will also be selling
a 16 gigabyte version as well alright
those are the two phones that will be
available from t-mobile this holiday
season the HTC hd7 will watch in
mid-november and the dell venue pro will
be available sometime for the holidays
i'm personally really excited about the
dell venue pro because of the form
factor but we're looking forward to
reviewing them both I'm Bonnie Tom to
spin your first look at the HTC hd7 and
dell venue pro for t-mobile and if
that's not enough windows phone 7 frenzy
for you head on over to Cena at tv.com
for Bonnie's look at some handsets for
the international market and just a
cadool quartz demo of some noteworthy
apps but don't go there yet because we
still have a lot more tech review coming
up including our first look at sony's
internet TV with google TV built-in
that's coming up in just a minute so
stick around
you
and welcome back to the cnet tech review
our weekly video digest of all things
good and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good we certainly
kept our New York team busy this week in
addition to the Windows Phone 7 launch
we were also on hand for the premiere of
the sony internet TV with google TV
inside here's David Katz Meyer with a
decidedly thorough overview hi I'm David
Katz man from cnet here with the sony
internet TV with google TV the first
product of its kind that's a television
that builds in google TV service right
into the TV so there's no need for any
external set-top box or anything like
that to get your google TV functionality
this is a standard edge-lit TV with not
too many bells and whistles 120 Hertz or
anything like that the main feature on
this thing is Google TV google TV for
the uninitiated allows you to basically
search internet video sources as well as
your own TV sources from cable set-top
or antenna right from the same search
windows you can just go in type in a
search for a show title up will come
results from the internet from the
various TV services as well as from your
own cable or satellite so it's the first
of its kind to incorporate all of those
sources into one easy to search window
the sony TV comes with this remote here
that's kind of a little handheld unit
little reminiscent of the plea s3
controller it's got a built-in qwerty
keyboard so you can type in whatever you
want to the search results screen it's
also got what I consider a pretty cool
little touch sensitive mouse it allows
you to drive your cursor around on the
screen and select items there's also a
standard up down left right arrows that
allow you to select items a little more
easily so All Things Considered it's a
pretty slick remote although it is a
little bulkier than your standard TV
remote it will probably take a little
bit of getting used to the remote
incorporates RF technology so you don't
need line of sight between the remote
and the television the TV can also
control your other devices including the
cable box and a couple of other AV
devices via IR blasters allows it to
incorporate for example search results
from the TV itself including an EPG you
don't get full integration however
unless you hook up this thing to a dish
DVR which allows you to search the DVR
and also incorporate a couple of other
control features including control over
IP as opposed to infrared the Sony NSX
gt1 series
available in four screen sizes i'm with
the 46 inch here there's also a 40 a 32
and a little 24 inch or all of them have
that led edge LED backlighting except
for the 24 which is a standard ccfl
display price points range from 5 99 for
the 24 up to 13 99 for the 46 inch so
prices are actually pretty good and in
line with a lot of the other well
featured HD TVs on the market today
Sony's also announcing a blu-ray player
at the 399 price point it's the NS z GT
1 it incorporates all of those google TV
features and of course it doesn't have a
screen but it does have a built-in
blu-ray so you can get all of your
google TV goodness including the remote
from a separate standalone blu-ray
player that's for people who already own
a TV and want to get the google TV
experience walk through a couple of
features on google TV it does include
netflix amazon video on demand twitter
and a few other apps right out of the
box we expect more apps to come in the
future so it's just facebook but the
real killer app of google TV is its
access to the internet so you can
actually go out using its built-in
chrome browser and search a variety of
internet video websites for example d
comedycentral com PBS org and a lot of
other places that have internet video
that aren't easily available on a lot of
the other Internet enabled TVs and
blu-ray players out there one big
missing link right now however is hulu
com you cannot search the hulu.com
website or play any of its videos right
now on this device we're expecting
Google to announce that compatibility
with Hulu Plus in the future but they're
still in talks at the moment on the
other hand you do have netflix amazon
video on demand and the ability to
search sony's curiosity VOD service
that's a proprietary feature this TV
sony also offers a few other content
options familiar with its bravia
internet link service including Howcast
blip TV and a few other niche video
websites so that's a content offering a
step above the logitech revue which is
the only other google TV box on the
market right now one other big
difference between the Sony and the
Logitech box is the Sonia at the moment
does not allow you to stream video and
audio over a DLNA connection so you
can't use the sony TV to go out and play
streaming video directly over your home
network speaking of apps in 2011 google
says it will allow access for Google TV
products to go out and use the android
market which has thousands of apps
designed for smartphones and the
interesting to see how those apps apply
to the big screen but it is potentially
unlimited
to development for the Google TV
products that's a quick look at the sony
internet TV with google TV functionality
I'm David Katz man from seen it wow yeah
that remote is definitely something to
be reckoned with but considering that
the standalone google TV box from
logitech is 300 bucks by itself 1399 for
Sony's 46 inch model not too shabby at
all alright but now let's give some of
our SF peeps some face time as we move
along to the bad when it comes to
pronunciation some tech companies have
names or products that are open to
interpretation nokia comes to mind nokia
nokia or OS 10 vs OS x the same goes for
a sous but as Eric Franklin found out
having a funny sounding name is far from
the biggest problem with this new
monitor hey guys is eric franklin cnet
com and today we're taking a first look
at the asus ve 276 q it also looks
fairly slight for a 27 incher with a
thin profile compared to other monitors
of its size the auspices bezel is low to
the desktop making accessing its
connection options kind of a hassle
those connection options include one
HDMI port a DVI port VGA and DisplayPort
the display also includes an ambient
light sensor visa wall support and
built-in speakers sounds from the
speakers was adequate although much too
low even at max volume the on-screen
display includes several preset options
as well as brightness contrast and
sharpness options also when a night view
mode you're given the option of just in
the saturation and changing the skin
tone from natural yellowish and reddish
why this option is only available in
night view mode is a mystery to us as it
would have been useful in other presets
in movies we notice a green tent push
but only when a monitor was sitting next
to the benq M 2700 HD which didn't have
the same tent problem the awesome says
theater preset was not as apt as the
benq and displaying dark detail in dark
scenes either
games we found the display to deliver a
bright image with a good level of
vibrancy however when directly compared
with the bank you we once again did
notice a slight green tent to the image
again we need to stress that this isn't
something we likely notice the two
monitors weren't sitting right next to
each other the haces isn't a
particularly bad monitor it just doesn't
offer enough in terms of performance and
features to warrant a stronger
recommendation the biggest thing that
Austin says going forward is its price
at three hundred thirty dollars it's the
lowest price of the recent 27 inches
we've reviewed and includes a useful
assortment of connections and built-in
speakers unfortunately the speaker sound
is muffled there's a slight green tint
to the image compared to the benq and
has less connection options in the bank
you as well which costs only twenty
dollars more unless that twenty dollars
is a big deal for you we recommend the
benq M 2700 HD over the asus v 276 q
thanks to its better performance and
more numerous features once again this
is eric franklin and this has been the
first look at the haces ve 276 q
for the record if you ask a sous they'll
tell you it's pronounced a sous either
way it sounds like it's a pass on the
asuste but be sure to check out Eric's
review of the benq M 2700 HD which
although more expensive sounds like a
much better value alright now let's turn
our attention to the bottom line there's
no denying that Facebook has changed the
way we interact with people we share our
thoughts or activities we schedule
events and then post photos and videos
of the events afterwards but if you've
ever been curious to see everything
you've ever posted to Facebook or you
just want to backup items that only
exist on the site then check out this
super handy tip from Josh Lowensohn hey
I'm Josh Lowensohn with cnet com and I'm
going to show you how to use Facebook's
new download your information feature it
lets you grab an offline copy of
everything you've ever sent to the
social network including photos videos
as well as your entire private message
inbox and a list of events to get
started log into Facebook and the head
to the account button in the top right
then click on account settings near the
bottom of the page you'll see a download
your information setting and click on
learn more here you'll be asked to
re-enter your Facebook password if
you're using a computer that you don't
normally browse facebook from it will
have you solve a CAPTCHA to the first
time you ask for this information
facebook needs a little bit of time to
collect it for you for us this took
about 10 minutes from hitting the
download button to when it was actually
ready to download facebook then sends
you an email link when the download link
is ready what you end up with is a file
that unzips with a folder for us this
was 270 megabytes but it can be much
larger or much smaller depending on how
much media you've uploaded included in
the folder or sub folders for your
photos and 14 videos as well as
something called index.html which you
can click on to view an offline version
of your profile this includes everything
that's ever been posted to your wall
photo and video pages a full list of
friends every event you ever RSVP to and
the entirety of your private
message inbox for both the message inbox
and the wall you get everything that's
ever been posted on one long page this
can be a little hard to parse so if you
feel like saving some time use your
browser's on page search feature if it
has one worth noting is that you'll get
the original quality of the videos you
uploaded even if they're in high
definition but that's not the case for
photos which are the same size as what
you see on facebook this isn't a problem
with photos you may have uploaded since
Facebook added support for high
resolution shots but something to keep
in mind if you think you're going to get
the originals back another thing to keep
in mind is that there's a ton of
personal information in this folder and
well Facebook has gone to great lengths
to keep the wrong people from
downloading it once you have it it's a
big unprotected jackpot of information
we recommend using the file level
password protection that's built into
your machine for more information on
that check out our other how to's i'm
josh lowensohn and this has been a quick
how-to on using Facebook's information
downloader for more checkout cnet com
the bottom line this week nice job
Facebook for once finally a feature
that's actually useful but doesn't
expose your private info to prying eyes
until you forget to log out of your
account and someone comes along and
downloads your whole life that couldn't
happen right could that happen okay
folks it is time for me to go join us
next week when we'll have our apples
back to the mac event coverage until
then there are tons of great videos
available every day at cnet TV com I'll
see you next time and thank you for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
