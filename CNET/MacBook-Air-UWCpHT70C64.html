blocks from the Apple Campus in
Cupertino with a very first hands-on
look with the new 11.6 inch MacBook Air
as everyone expected the newest member
of the MacBook family is this 11 inch
air it looks and feels a lot like a
cross between the current netbook air
and those 11 inch premium netbooks that
we've seen a lot of this year this guy
actually has an Intel Core 2 Duo
processor and NVIDIA GeForce 320 m
graphics and that's pretty much the same
as you'd actually get in the white $9.99
a back book although this is an ultra
low voltage version of that processor
still for an 11 inch you know premium
netbook style system that's a fairly
reasonable powerful set of hardware
you're gonna find pretty much the same
full-size keyboard and large multi-touch
trackpad as you find on other members of
the MacBook family and the screen on
this this is actually really interesting
this is the first MacBook ever with a 16
by 9 display that's really the industry
standard now it's 1366 by 768 the 13
inch version of the MacBook Air still
has a 16 by 10 screen MacBooks are
really some of the only laptops left
with 16 by 10 displays resides a new
version of iLife the upcoming OS 10 lion
Edition and the new app store the thing
you're probably gonna be most excited
about is get this not one but count'em
two USB ports that's twice as many as in
the original MacBook Air and really
fixes one of the main complaints people
had about that system like the original
MacBook Air it's actually very tapered
it's about 0.68 inches in the back that
tapers on very thin in the front the 11
inch is actually just as thick at the 13
inch it's not really any thinner and
there you go we just turned it off and
turn it back on again that's the
instant-on that's something else people
are very excited about observe again I
close the lid
it goes into kind of very low power mode
and then when you open it up instant on
almost like you get with your iPad the
new 11 inch macbook starts with 64 gigs
of solid-state memory for $9.99 it's
actually not an SSD hard drive they
actually take the memory modules out of
it and put it right on the motherboard
and of course you can trade up from
there to more memory or a faster
processor or the 13 inch screen there's
one kind of thumb note about the design
I'm not too pleased with and that is the
lack of itch
glass on the display you see it's got
the silver bezel here it doesn't look
nearly as good as a black bezel with the
glass over it that you see on other
MacBooks but that's about the only
negative so far in our very early
hands-on impressions I'm Dan Ackerman
and then is the new 11.6 inch MacBook
Air</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
