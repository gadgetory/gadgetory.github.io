microsoft announces the next version of
the xbox console and you know it's
unclear what that's going to be they've
called it Xbox next Xbox 720 which is of
course two times that xbox 360 was you
can imagine really interesting console
from an industrial design standpoint but
what I think is actually interesting is
what comes after that because this could
well be the last console we see I think
video games in the future will be simply
delivered digitally we won't have discs
to put into the consoles and so you
could imagine that in a TV set the
technology itself so there or maybe in a
set-top box but it's very easy for me to
see in the future think phones is sort
of one area where you might expect more
of that will see they they haven't
really shown their hand but I could
imagine that could be one place I sort
of wonder about tvs I you know Microsoft
has given no indication of that
certainly Apple is talked about that
Microsoft is playing in the same world
as Apple Microsoft actually has things
that it can bring to that world with
Xbox and video gaming that Apple can
Microsoft feels the need and they're
right that they need to be better in the
consumer world they are an
extraordinarily strong company in
enterprises and big businesses but when
it comes to the consumer world they
really are trailing Apple and Google and
others and so you know Microsoft has
been making a big push particularly this
year with Windows 8 particularly with
something like the surface and with
Windows Phone to try and become a bigger
player in the consumer world</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
