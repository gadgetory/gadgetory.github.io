Brian more video games no Charlie this
is mortal kombat my favorite game you're
distracting me man come on hey listen
when I was a young man we wouldn't be in
here playing video games we'd be outside
get the girls Charlie the girls now come
to me hey Charlie here is your Arnold
Palmer with extra sweetener that is baby
Oh is sweet okay yeah dr. my baby so
yeah yeah oh ah so Charlie how does he
do it
what's up brian Tong here and welcome to
the apple byte for everything good and
bad inside the world of apple and yes I
like floral shirts but I also love you
more with a special Mortal Kombat X
giveaway but first on to the show and
the headliner this week comes from apple
with their official announcement that
WWDC 2015 will take place on june the
8th in San Francisco with the invite
tagline the epicenter of change now you
know me I always like to read and
analyze these invites but this one seems
pretty obvious that will be seen a whole
lot of Apple TV now we already know ties
to home kit have been found in code
directly looking to make the apple TV
the central hub for the smart home in
addition to its video streaming
functionality and what's that in the
center yeah it's an apple TV unless it
ends up looking completely different in
shape and apple is releasing a colorful
kaleidoscope like the Col I disco uh-huh
yeah ya see what I'm getting that okay
now apple also seated the first iOS 8.4
beta to developers with a revamped music
app that features pictures of artists
and lets you use your own pictures for
your own playlist there's also a new
mini player and a more streamlined
design for iTunes radio and we're
expecting to hear about Apple's upcoming
music service at WWDC this year as well
now Apple also announced that research
kit is now available for developers and
medical researchers not really the
sexiest thing to talk about but this
could be a huge breakthrough in the
future for tracking our health working
with doctors and contributing to medical
research from just our phones for that
itch that just won't go away and kudos
to Apple for increasing the number of
WWDC 2015 scholarships to 350 up from
200 last year pulling in students 13
years and older while working a boost
gender and racial diversity including
organizations specifically for women
blacks and Latinos unfortunately Asians
with blonde streaks in their hair was
not one of them alright Apple watch
pre-orders started last week on Friday
and slice intelligence estimates 1
million pre-orders were made
seen all of the Android wear devices
shipped out in all of 2014 now I've
always said this will be the best
selling SmartWatch to date but it's
still a small number because this
product category still has a lot to
figure out now the firm also says
sixty-two percent of customers purchase
the Apple watch sport and let's be
honest at $350 it's not like this is the
cheapest essential add on to your tech
life now teen interest has also dropped
ahead of the Apple watch watch according
to a piper jaffray survey pulling
roughly 6200 us teens in the fall
sixteen percent said they would buy an
Apple watch but that's now dropped to
eleven percent after they probably
realized it costs the same as a ps4 or
more than two years worth of their
allowance money alright you can head out
to an apple store or sign up online for
an Apple watch fitting right now you
Apple biters know I'm still really
lukewarm to the SmartWatch but I'm open
to changing my mind I'm going to review
this as someone who actually pays for it
so I headed out to the Apple store in
Palo Alto to get a fitting for myself
we're gonna do a first-time fitting with
my friend Leslie here because I want to
see what these watches feel like and
what you guys would walk through as well
so Leslie I'm thinking a probably debate
between the Milanese loop and the steel
link yeah sure so the first one we'll go
ahead and we'll try
the link bracelet and stainless steel we
want to make sure that the digital crown
here is going to be facing your knuckle
so obviously this one just a little too
big but we're able to take out the links
so it's about four what's a six segments
that we can remove there are a good idea
to take off the same even amount on both
sides see how this does right away yeah
anything weird either way yeah okay okay
cool oh very nice that is nice sharp
like and watch on you alright let's try
this beautiful Melanie this one's tricky
because it actually loops through and
you can kind of slide it and change the
adjustability of it which one you like
though my favorite is actually the
sports man oh no I want on me yeah I
mean yeah I want to only get Leslie's
advice because a woman is gonna this I'm
gonna get this watch to get girls quite
honestly okay so your opinion matters I
would go with the Milanese wait wait
really I would I think it's like I like
it the most so you're telling me I know
I know nice its classic but I like like
this one I could see you're taken but
you're just telling me if you see if you
and let's say if Leslie was single you
would think you'd be like hello sir
that's a really nice morning loop at the
gorgeous watch that you have I'm
blushing it isn't so plush it's a very
good tip very good tip so there you go
you know just kind of a quick look at
the fitting process Leslie thanks so
much for that that was really cool and I
might have to go with the recommendation
will find out you know I have to admit
the process is really smart and it
warmed me up to the idea because i like
how the watch actually looked on me the
wrist straps felt really good in a lot
better than i expected so i'm a little
more excited about it but that's if i
get the watch up in time after many of
you who made pre-orders in the first 15
minutes we're told they would receive
them in mid-may and people who order
later we're told even june or july or
even way later like august and by that
time the apple watch 2 will be released
come on I'm messing with you all but
apple says deliveries could arrive
sooner than the estimated time given but
they wanted to set realistic
expectations first but one watch you
will never get
this custom gold apple watch edition
with a gold link bracelet that Apple
gifted to German fashion designer Karl
Lagerfeld oh yeah and a nice gloves
buddy alright Mortal Kombat X was just
released this week it's my favorite
video game franchise of all time you can
also check out the killer ios app get it
killer alright so I reached out to
Warner Bros to get you the Apple biters
two copies of the game one for the ps4
and one for the xbox one and no this is
not sponsored I just wanted to share the
love so all you have to do to win this
is tell me what you thought of my mom
and what she said about the Apple watch
last week let me know if you're a
Playstation or Xbox person and i will
pick my favorite comments and announce
them in next week's show this is a game
for mature grown-ups like myself so you
gotta be 17 years or older to win all
right that's going to do it for this
week email me at the apple byte at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong and i'll
answer you when I'm not teaching myself
how to play the harp online thanks so
much for watching we will catch you all
next time for another bite of the Apple
yeah yeah oh yeah double tally you got a
guy you've got a good yeah yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
