speaking san francisco back in 2002 we
decided to open up a different style of
music store more geared towards
electronic musicians we decide to carry
analog synthesizers drum machines
circumvent toys audio interfaces you
know we kind of carry stuff it's a
little off the beaten track things that
are that you're not gonna find it some
of these big box stores
I really like machine I like like the
mofo like machine drum the The Tempest
the new Dave Smith instrument tempest
and also really like the Oxus virus of
all the virus keyboards kind of built up
an electronic music community the part
of that I believe and we also do classes
we teach classes and circuit bending
we teaches the software related classes
like Ableton Logic Pro Tools we also do
some classes to teach you how to build
your own MIDI controller we didn't call
it Stephen Allen's music store music
store you know it's my original business
partner and my friend Alan Stewart his
ex-girlfriend Aerin
came up with the name just off the cuff
you know we were trying to figure out a
name it just kind of kind of worked and
you know I think that that has carried
you know our name further because if it
was just you know some kind of standard
name it wouldn't be as cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
