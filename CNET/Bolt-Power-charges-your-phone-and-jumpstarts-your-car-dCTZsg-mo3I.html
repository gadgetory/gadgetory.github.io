looking at three portable car jump
starters so we've got three different
products from bulk power this is the D
28 this one is called the k3 Mini and
this one is called the x5 Mini now I put
these all together just because they do
pretty much all the same thing the D 28
here has a USB port on this side here
and you can plug in this white cable
think loo this is a multi adapter cable
that not only includes a mini and micro
USB it also includes an iPhone lightning
nioh s lightning and an older iOS 30 pin
cable so you can charge most of your
Apple devices with this this particular
model d28 also has this multi adapter
power cable which this will actually let
you charge up a laptop off this thing
too so that's pretty cool
this one has a thirteen thousand six
hundred milliamp hour battery that will
handle most of your tablets a lot of
your devices so now this one the k3 mini
we've got t USB ports in the side here
this doesn't have that multi adapter
cable for laptops this has a twelve
thousand milliamp hour battery now the
smallest one here the x5 Mini this one
also has two USB ports in the end here
this one only has an eight thousand
milliamp hour battery so this will maybe
charge a phone a couple of times but it
won't charge up most tablets to full
nice thing about this one it does have a
little screen in the front here that
shows you its battery capacity how much
it's charged up because you got to
charge these up obviously off of a wall
circuit or a car's 12-volt outlet the
key thing is we also have a jump starter
cable adapter so these are two typical
car battery clamps here and you just
plug this guy into the side you get the
special port here you plug this guy in
you attach it to your car and you jump
start it we've got a 5 liter v8 engine
that's a pretty big engine so we're
going to jumpstart this car with one of
these devices here just to show you can
be done now what I've done is I've
unattached the positive terminal on this
battery to simulate a dead battery we
have the k3 mini here attach the battery
clamp terminals
going to put my negative on my negative
terminal here and just attach the
positive to the hanging cable here kind
of not get that touching any other metal
it's not touching the battery I turn on
my power switch I have my trusty
assistant Jason crank up this v8 hey
Jason crank it up look at that the
engine is running and we're good to go
I'm Wayne Cunningham and this has been
your look at the bulk power portable
jumpstarters the D 28 the k3 mini and
the x5 mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
