I'm actually talking to a camera right
now it's very unnatural and it's way
less good than me talking to myself in
the mural because I cannot see just how
awesome I look right now
that's it let me show you what I am
looking at for the first time I see that
you can see this okay there you go we've
got a few in here but before you can see
those photos that's something you need
to see first and that is the Sandi's
connect wireless media drive right here
as you can see is tiny but despite that
it has a lot on the inside first up it
has up to 64 gigabyte of storage space
and it has a battery that are for up to
8 hours of battery life and there's more
as a Wi-Fi network built in the idea is
you can put content onto this B photo
music video or document and then stream
that to connected mobile devices such as
tablet or smartphone now to make that
work easily there's a mobile apps called
Sandi's media drive this app is
available for iOS Android and Kindle
Fire using the app you can both play
back the content store in here and also
moving data back and forth between the
drive and the connected devices for
backup purposes actually very cool now
if you find 64 here by not enough and I
don't blame you
well you can add more to it that's
because the media drive here comes with
an SD card slot right here so you can
add another card to it right like this
one right here and with SD card offering
up to 128 gigabyte now this one can
carry up to 192 gigabytes or space now
that's quite something on one side the
device has a power button right here you
can to press and hold for a few seconds
to turn it on or off over here there are
three little lights to show the status
of the power of the Wi-Fi network and of
the internet that's right the media
drive can connect itself to another
Wi-Fi network and then relays that
networks in your connection to the rest
of the devices connected to it that's
really cool again over here there is a
standard micro USB port for
or connecting the device yet to a
computer and in that case it also works
as a purple drive because then it can
quickly copy data from the computer onto
this or not so quickly because this is
it's not USB 2.0 which it used to be 2.0
and in my testing the device awful okay
speed just about 14 megabyte per second
for reading and only four megabyte per
second for writing now at that speed you
take you about four and a half hours to
fill it up this drive 64 gig of storage
space but for a device that costs only
hundred dollars or 80 dollars for the 32
gig capacity it's still quite good
considering how mask it has to offer now
there are many other Wi-Fi store devices
on the market such as this Seagate
wireless plus right here or the picture
art arrow but none of them can actually
do what this Sandi's can and that is the
level of flexibility in thermal storage
thanks again to his SD card slot now for
the first time you can quickly show up
what have just taken it with your camera
which I'm doing right now here the
camera and take off the SD card from it
I put it in the slot right here and I
don't let's see what we've got here we
go that's my dog that's my dog game and
my doll game and here this is the camera
and the man who are responsible for how
good I look do not give them someone
credit though looking good it's just my
secondary and that's because I'm don't
know and this has been the first look at
the Standish connect wireless media
drive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
