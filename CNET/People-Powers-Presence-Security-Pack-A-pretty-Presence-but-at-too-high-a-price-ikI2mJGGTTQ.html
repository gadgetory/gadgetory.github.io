presents security pact that is a set of
seven sensors and a zigbee hub from
startup people power for year two
hundred and ninety-nine bucks you get a
water sensor a motion sensor a
temperature sensor a touch or tamper
sensor and three door and window sensors
it also comes with a zigbee hub that
ties everything together that's quite a
bit of stuff and it works well to the
app is intuitive and allows you to set
rules within the app that are similar to
if this than that the if service that we
all know for example i put this water
sensor in my dog's water bowl and set a
rule to notify me when she ran out of
water pretty simple but it worked
extremely well it was very responsive
and you can use it for more important
stuff like detecting leaks in your house
I do have one big issue with this kit
though two hundred and ninety-nine
dollars for seven sensors so you are
getting a lot but if you average that
out that's just under forty bucks per
device here and that may not seem like a
lot but you can find door and window
sensors and temperature sensors for a
lot less online and you really have to
be committed to the people power brand
to buy into this at all the biggest
disconnect for me is that a lot of the
people using people powers free present
app are enjoying the free aspect of that
security camera as an alternative to
buying a real security camera so how
many of those people are probably going
to drop three hundred bucks on all these
sensors to accompany this free app I
don't think that's super likely so while
I do think this is a solid set of
sensors I also think that it will
alienate a lot of people powers existing
fans
