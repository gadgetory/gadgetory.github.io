it's time for the 359 podcast you know
me I'm BVG and in the house today we've
got Alfred Inge and Roger Chang good
morning good afternoon guys wow it's all
just program now so that when we throw
off the schedule and run late I can't
help myself it is morning it's boring
somewhere it's 11 a.m. it's 11 a.m. it
is not in San Francisco that's tech
Larry all right there you go so we just
flip the the coast line we're actually
all NSF right now we just secretly
transported overnight yeah we've
recreated the entire room there guys we
got a pretty packed show today yeah yeah
what are we talking about what are we
talking about the possibility that we
might see phones with diamond hardened
displays we'll also be talking about the
terror switch it's a fantastic console
but Cena editor David Connolly has one
big problem with it we'll talk about
that as well as apps to help you stay
sober now if you get clean are one of
the reporters of RL he D has a nice take
on that so as always if you have any
questions leave them in the comments
section Brian will pick out the best and
we will try to answer them in 3 minutes
and 59 seconds from 3 to welcome to the
359 I'm Roger Chang I'm Alfred hang are
you ready for the floor phone with a
diamond glass display once art believes
it will have one ready by 2019
it sounds kind of crazy right sounds
like I'm something that's super
excessive I'm very ready to propose to
somebody with a phone ring on it
somebody has to so the the idea of video
is like it's a lot more resilient than
your phone like like the Gorilla Glass
ok so you have currently there were
those discussion a few years ago I
remember a sapphire crystal being sort
of a big crystal to kind of help protect
your phone from getting scratches Apple
even invested in a plan to create
sapphires place that didn't work out
because of cost but now this company
Akon this startup is trying to work on
lab-grown diamonds as you help harden
the destruction display of your glass so
when you drop it there for your
scratches yeah I'm I'm confused though
because so sapphire glass
cases wouldn't work because it'd be too
expensive but somehow diamonds are
cheaper I'm not getting the man
I think that's issue also whoa the the
sapphire that had to be produced I think
there were beyond just expense I think
he was actually difficult to do so maybe
this startup is you know cracked the
code on making Diamond glass more
feasible yeah but how much are you
willing to pay for a like glass case
that like doesn't break like an
indestructible phone how much would you
pay for that I don't know we're already
used to paying a thousand bucks for a
phone that breaks to just resin glass
yeah so I don't know that that's a
pretty significant premium right like a
phone that you can guarantee doesn't
crack I bought it just even if it lasts
forever there's no point because you're
gonna replace it with in like two years
anyway yeah that's true I'm sure they're
gonna be a lot of a lot one percenters
who are willing to pay just for the fact
that it's it's diamonds
yeah all right next up the Nintendo
switch is damn near the perfect console
but our own David Karn only has one
problem with it and that is what the
price of the games right games games
that run on different that are sold
across different consoles are generally
more expensive on internal switch and
they're hardly ever any sales yes I
think that was his biggest that was
biggest gripe so what what we've talked
about this I he's like he's complaining
about this to me before and I recently
got my Nintendo switch and I would have
to agree there's not that many sales on
it but at the same time I think
Nintendo's focus on it is that you're
not buying like multiple games like all
at the same time right or so you're
buying like Legend of Zelda breath of
the water you're gonna play that for
like six months and then get like mario
de ca√±a that for really a long time so i
can it's reasonable that they don't go
on sales as often i think he it's
because he's comparing to all the sales
for like Xbox one and PlayStation 4
where you know a game that came out four
months ago will be like fifteen dollars
or something now right exactly there are
a lot more aggressive sales I mean I saw
them during the holidays I guess the
switches doesn't do it but I mean given
the those exclusive games that are there
Zelda Mario in particular yeah it's
still that I bought overcooked the other
day and it was it's originally twenty
dollars it was on sale this was a rare
sale okay it was on sale for five
dollars it's not really that big of a
deal but like 15 bucks now say five
dollars whatever
yeah lastly our reporter abroad al he D
she took a look at apps that help people
deal with their addictions and stay
sober
most researchers understand that to stay
sober you need to have like social
interactions like puter sobriety is
essentially relationships so there's
apps like I am sober no mo sober grid HS
some of them you know they put you in
contact with other people to chat with
some of them are kinda more like
journaling stuff there's one more like
you mark every day that you're sober
their chart basically using like all the
communication stuff like in social media
that you would like you know go on
Facebook for or anything like that I
think try to do that to help so there I
mean in some ways they are like it
depends on what your definition of
gamifying so like there are ones like
you go in every day as like I've been
sober this day yeah it's kind of like
keeping like statistics on yourself calm
yeah it definitely is
it's definitely counter to it right
because you think about yeah the sort of
the normal steps to becoming sober does
require you to talk with people and and
like I just a face on the face level the
idea of using app seems isolating but
this is actually solving an issue yeah I
mean I really like that they take
advantage of it with like social media
only because I think in general there's
always like a stigma against like
battling addictions absolutely even
though it's something that that is an
incredible effort and it's very hard to
do it's not the same as you know I'm
gonna lose weight or something like that
people will be like yeah you go that
kind of thing unless you're successful
alright so if these stories and more
chick sounds seen it I'm Roger Chang I'm
alfred Aang thanks for listening all
right so we're gonna go ahead and delve
back into the chat and I'm gonna dig out
some good questions and comments and
right out the gate we have one from
Matthew dacher about the display what's
up - hey Dad diamond displays how do
they stack up against Gorilla Glass it's
from Gorilla Glass isn't it no no it's
not well the idea is actually that if
you look the stories from Jessica
Belcourt the idea is that some of the
diamond structure would be actually
mixed in with the the Gorilla Glass I
know it's a Gorilla Glass is sort of the
standard for glass that's being used on
phones now to help kind of harden them
but they're not perfect though they
obviously can crack and scratch the idea
is by by kind of combining the strength
of diamond
with Gorilla Glass you'd have something
that's that's virtually indestructible
moving on then that was quick and a
little too easy sorry sorry
you know I guess go try harder stun me
alright we'll try this one sir enjoy
didn't breath of the wild break sales
records and become the second
best-selling Zelda game of all time and
our effort broke sales records but it
definitely was the second best zealous
like selling game of all time I think it
helps that it was a Zelda game of old
yes Zelda game yes I think it helps that
it was paired with the Nintendo switch
and it was a launch title for them so
yes basically when you buy your Nintendo
switch which was one of the like
top-selling Nintendo consoles of all
time
the idea is well what game am I gonna
play this with like at launch they had
like breath of the wild then they had
Bomberman and Puyo Puyo versus Tetris
and all the sevens like oh I'm sorry
also one to switch right which should
have just came with a game that don't
need to have that conversation again it
really should he just came with the
console but anyway the idea like you
know that was essentially it was like
Game of the Year across the board for
like yeah everything so yeah yeah breath
of the wild was very good I did that's
the argument for why I shouldn't go on
sale I guess like it was really great
yeah yeah it's also like I I would I
would agree though that you know after a
year or so most things should yeah you
can do what they want right like people
were still gonna buy pokemons is the
only game I know that gets more
expensive when it's used really yeah and
that's not true think about any retro
collector game that's coming down to
yeah wait wait why did why do Pokemon
games get more expensive because you get
like that person's like safe also it's
it's like much I I think that I don't
know it's just like harder to find like
new like the older gets I think I think
it's really interesting that we're
finally getting sincere jump forward in
phone build quality after we've seen a
steady down tick over the past few years
manufacturers want you to break your
phone so you buy more it just would have
been cool like three years ago though
cool when they invented the damn
smartphone just there's so much stuff
like like how's this gonna work with
those like foldable phones and the
bending phones from like Samsung that
we've been seeing getting pause it's not
like everyone's gonna have a bendable
yeah but my point is is that like is it
too late 2019 when this thing is
supposed to be coming out should have
been a point where like we've moved past
glass and like everything's I should
note by the way this this company had
talked Jessica talk to this company
before the CEO Adam Khan had originally
promised that we see a phone by 2017 I
was last year nothing happened
now he's revised his time for anybody it
does say that a number of handset makers
are testing this so that gives them a
little bit more confidence but still you
know take a little bit with a grain of
salt then it'll show up in 2019 we
thought you know sapphire was gonna be
the big trend again a couple years ago
we thought iPhone was gonna embrace that
never happened I mean look at this but
we're in 2018 and perpetually everything
we talk about is like this should have
happened a long time yeah yeah that's
kind of the state of the industry we're
in yeah pretty much
sadly I want to hear more about the
sobriety app I think this is interesting
how you kind of hemmed in hard about it
being gamified it seems kind of gamified
to me like it's you're you're striving
for achievements and those achievements
are pseudo rewarded yeah although I mean
if you I mean if you look at our Mis
right there are achievements right you
get yeah and I don't you call that kind
of a game not to take it so lightly no
no I read it the the effort being made
the term gamification isn't we're not
using it to say that it's being treated
lightly just yes the structure in which
they're motivating I will say right
there there's a caveat of the story that
that is important to point out that
despite how helpful all these apps are
they will never replace like
face-to-face connections like absolutely
like yeah you know these meetings and
things like that they'd say it's kind of
like for those like gaps in your life
where you can't like there aren't
meetings going on or anything like that
if you're you know by yourself and you
need like somebody to talk to and like I
don't know it could be like 3:00 4:00
a.m. in the morning well in a they that
you have a sponsor right so you can call
them more or less nice day but this is
kind of even fill in the cracks yeah
yeah it's more these apps are more sort
of like fill in the gaps during like the
down times of life look at that we had a
positive show guys like there's good
things happening things that help people
things that improve products by the way
we ran out of time but I wanted to bring
up the Super Bowl just well you missed
the
but I'm just wondering like the the
biggest memes I came out of a kid Harbor
or the David Harbor it's not the kid I
feel like the kid the selfie kid was
kind of the biggest meme right
I don't know that David harbors kind of
killing out I don't know I saw your face
before you're like you just have a man
crush a David Harbor always did always
have always will
I am every time he showed up my freshman
hi where'd you say hey that's the guy
from stranger things and hell boy and
then we just we all know is yeah but we
just like turned into a meme or like we
just yelled it out like any person that
showed up be like Tom Brady I was like
guys I mean yeah all of last night it
was kind of a meme goldmine right down
to the fact that they were rolling hall
&amp;amp; oates in between all the Philly breaks
and stuff like it was a pretty fun show
the one thing I will say is I'm really
glad that they backed out of the
hologram I was really oh yeah the Prince
hologram I thought those they were gonna
do I saw the rumor and then it got
quashed pretty early on by the the
family of the estate I thought the
suicide I don't know I don't know all
the details I kind of just saw the head
because he lit up the city I thought
that was a filter I I don't know if that
was legit or not that was real I say you
know the tribute was very well done
tastefully done they should be tributing
I thought was fine that was mediocre
yeah I don't know I just saw a selfie
kid I think the highlight of the show
the highlight of the halftime show
I think it was like you couldn't even
like awkwardly kind of like looking his
phone well justin timberlake's I think
he was trying to find the 3:59 podcast
yes yeah where's my podcast one thing I
will say though that that got me was the
that new Crocodile Dundee sequel oh yeah
oh man I was so pissed when I saw that
you're like friggin dude oh wait no this
is genius I thought you were like oh
that actually looks like a pretty decent
I was furious that they were gonna try
to make that especially with him my my
friends who are like massive sneaker
heads apparently there was this part of
this one ad campaign where this company
this like sneaker website called stock X
they couldn't they couldn't really
afford like a full Superbowl ad but
but a cameo of their logo on another ad
really yeah so it's on like a lot of
guys hat and like a scene
he's like which is one word Big Sean in
it I think was like Wells Fargo and
keegan-michael from-from key and Peele
oh yeah yeah yeah so he that ad so if
you notice him one scene there's a dude
with a hat and they're like there's a
green X on his hat the idea of that
campaign though is that like anybody
that took the photo of that or got a
screenshot of like that X and tweeted at
stock X would be eligible to win like a
free pair of like Easy's oh okay yeah
like it was part of like some sweet sake
my oh no they go that's pretty smart
like don't buy the full ad just pay for
a cameo in and get all the views on
social media instead there you go I
thought Morgan Freeman stole the show
but that's just oh yeah yeah that was
pretty good
serene joy wants us to comment on what
we thought about the post game vandalism
that's America I think we need to have
been here to really I know a resident of
Philadelphia oh that was that way as
well and give him an exam right we
should really we're out of it no we're
not but we should really wait till Ben
comes in yeah then is a lifelong Eagles
fan I think he's out vandalizing cars
his own house actually there's a live in
Philly a memorial is out but I'm sure
he's embracing the spirit and just
running around via all right let's get
to a couple more question before we call
the day Scott Wyatt when will we get to
the stage where we just carry around a
sheet of glass like in sci-fi films
that's exactly what I'm saying that's
what I'm saying like the glass case yeah
would you want list would you want that
sheet of glass to be like diamonds yes
yes I would there you go saying though
like this has come like way too late
like we should be evolving in what we're
using for phones now and the fact that
like I don't know you should be
Holograms or something man this is a
glass screen like that's not our
innovation all right that's all I hold
it in my I don't like a 28 system there
Stewie
we're still holding phone that was the
problem of selfie kid he had to use a
phone come on yeah it's true it was just
embedded to his eyeball
had been fine what if he had spectacles
you can't take it so it without though
no you can't
oh yeah you you JT up close though
grilled Timberlake's nose hair all right
Alan or Sutan there's a big difference
between demonstrating that you can make
a screen made of synthetic diamond or
sapphire and actually fulfilling an
order for 20 million when Apple or
Samsung order some I that's a good point
like that's an excellent it's a finite
resource so that's what they're growing
in our lab that takes time same time I
don't know anything about it it's very
lengthy it is expensive and it is
difficult I will say you're not gonna
see this in Apple or Samsung whoever
takes them up on this offer is probably
being am gonna be a much smaller company
smaller volumes a niche player trying to
make a name for themselves like like a
Seuss honestly probably essential well
maybe yeah guys talk about like titanium
yeah that's true I think that actually
that's a good one because the volumes
are a load yeah probably manage it
mm-hmm
but you saw a sous the last couple of
weeks they've been touting this whole
under the glass fingerprint sensor this
is tech that is it any phone right now
but they're out there say hey we've got
this and then it's a bit for attention
like no one really buys or uses a sous
phone so you can imagine a company like
that trying to get attention embracing
this technology we got a shout out to
love and Bryson hello from Croatia hey
welcome to the show nice to have you
welcome this is a little off-topic but
this is a good one to always kind of
revisit they want to know what were the
three best things we saw at CES now
before we get to that it was funny I was
listening to a podcast on the way in
this morning and they were kind of
revisiting CES and it occurred that so
much of CES was what they called geezer
tech yeah easier tech geezer tech so
like sneakers that counted your steps
and would be able to call for help if
you fell down
oh yeah the airbag hair bag yes and
that's an interesting point I don't mean
to sound derogatory at all but it's like
that there was actually a decent amount
of tech aimed at the elderly this year
and that's kind of interesting of what
the quote they said was Millennials be
damned so on that note old man yells at
on that note let's revisit a couple
siesta um I mean highlights it's an
obvious one obviously the the Samsung
wall the modular TV was amazing seen one
hundred forty six inch that none of us
will ever have exactly it's probably
super expensive Consumer Electronics
Show it's all about wowing people but
those little individual panels put
together you can't see the lines I mean
like unless you walk right up to the TV
you can't really see where the the seams
are between different pals that's that's
kind of impressive oh it's totally
impressive but it will never go in your
home I mean my most the most memorable
moment from CES that isn't alfred
dancing on stage was me and David Katz
Meyer and a BMW as they were drifting
around the course know that those cars
were like they were know the crap out of
us all drifting all day they have
nothing to do with tech and then poor
Lexi got severely carsick than Joe no
I'm kidding I don't think she actually
got sick but she did go for a ride in
that and that was fun to watch hats and
I went and we waited in line the last
day we got there early got in the car
and it was pretty amazing you look like
you at the time of your life yeah
although the video doesn't really
capture how quickly it felt like the car
didn't seem like it was moving that fast
the video but like in that like when we
were in the moment it was like kind of
freaky they should open that as its own
like rollercoaster ride and like six
legs Disney World or something yeah
the fastest furious type of experience
mmm those that we've raised the bar to
the theme park ride is going in a car
yeah yeah if it's drifting some point in
the future when everything's like a
self-driving car and like really safe
and there's no like car accidents
anymore or anything like that oh my god
wait no that's your drone car drifting
yeah do it
but no challenge no self-driving car
drifting right yes that's a challenge to
somebody at CES if you're watching this
Robo drifter everything is a drift if
you uh take enough risks in life I got a
quick there's a quick question from
alien for me this is that a dune book or
VHS behind me that is the VHS all of my
books are at home he controls the
universe VHS is a it's a tape that we
use to play movies back in the day just
what's a tape
sorry you're right you can't use one
thing because neither old all right we
got one more from syringe Oh before we
call at the end of the day we'll voice
assistant services get improvements so
that they could do things like pep talks
and motivational speaking and that I
think kind of stems off from the the
sobriety app there's a lot right there
what if it did get built into your home
if you went the night and Alexa's there
sorry everybody
and you know who's there encouraging you
to stay sober be healthy better that I
think the I am sober app is actually
like a motivational companion so I mean
I haven't looked that much into it that
but I imagine it's something along those
lunch it's not like of a voice like
activated kind of thing I mean I could I
could definitely see that happening
maybe is a skill that you called with
Alexa like Alexa yeah I mean they have
they have stuff like that where like
they sell like I think it they're like
Spotify playlist and stuff whereas like
self affirmations tub or like you listen
to I was like you are smart you're a
cool like your friends love your jokes
you're not short and ugly this is like
something that I've just seen it's not
for me I what it's worth I imagine like
you could ask like you're Alexa to play
something like that it's worth it in the
realm of appropriation I want to do the
opposite of that look you're a Butthead
what do you waste you people would
probably buy that we should make an
album that would definitely sell all
right well unless you will produce a
limited edition GoFundMe BVG tells you
you suck album we can sell it we can
sell it on the 315 I'm sure there you go
there we go I think we are just about
out of time what a great day good to be
back sorry we're late
things happen we're turning fan yes if
you're Pats fan none for me yeah but on
that note we'll see you guys tomorrow
Roger yeah all right if you liked
