Classic Car Club to show you Amazon's
newest delivery service now the company
will deliver inside your car so this
service is part of Amazon key which
Amazon launched last year which started
within home delivery service where they
will deliver packages directly inside
your house this now extends the service
to your car the service will launch with
2015 model year cars or after they have
to have a connected car service like
OnStar and it will launch with Volvo
Buick Chevy Cadillac an GMC cars so for
the service to work you have to use the
Amazon key app and you have to park your
car within a roughly two block radius of
your home or your office you include
things like the make and model of your
car what color it is what your license
plate is and then the delivery driver
will be able to find your car wherever
it is parked in that radius the Amazon
key in car delivery service works a lot
like Amazon key for your home where the
delivery driver doesn't need a specific
access code or anything basically once
the delivery driver is set and in the
right place Amazon will automatically
open the car for the delivery driver
they'll be able to open it up slide the
package in close and then remotely lock
the car and the delivery driver has to
confirm that the car is locked or they
won't get their next delivery address
the delivery service allows you to
purchase tens of millions of different
items from Amazon it includes same day
to day delivery depending on what your
location is it's also launching in the
37 cities where Amazon key in home is
available and speaking to Amazon today
they mentioned that this is another
extension of Amazon key so you might
expect to see Amazon key and more
delivery services being added to this
some time soon when Amazon key first
launched last year the initial
impression from the public was broadly
negative at least from a lot of people
folks didn't really
the idea of giving Amazon access to the
front doors a lot of people made fun of
the service and said there's no way I'm
gonna do this at least my initial
impression from looking at this demo is
that maybe people will be a little bit
more comfortable with in-car deliveries
than in home deliveries after all you
don't have all your valuables really in
your car at all times so it might be a
little bit safer or more comfortable for
people to give Amazon access to
something like that I also asked Amazon
if there's anything that they wouldn't
deliver to your car specifically they
obviously mentioned big items that
wouldn't fit in your car or really
expensive stuff that would require a
signature they also expect customers to
be a lot smarter about what they deliver
specifically to your car saying if you
live in Arizona and it's in the dead of
summer you probably don't want to get a
bunch of chocolates delivered to your
car so be sure to remember not to do
something like that thanks everybody for
watching really appreciate it don't
forget to subscribe or like or ring the
bell for notifications also what do you
