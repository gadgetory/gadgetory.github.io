hey a genuine fan letter dear CNET smart
home huh first time a long time a little
strange we've only been around for a
month all day at work I have to use my
hands to open doors and to turn on
lights it's a terrible burden is there
any way I can avoid such tedium in the
comfort of my own home good news first
that a long time you're in luck because
that's exactly what we're gonna talk
about
you're there we're here at the scene at
smart-home taking a look at controlling
the tech in this house with our voice
why because voice control is cool and
because controlling tech with your voice
keeps it all simple and accessible to
that end we have four kind of one two
three four option number one
corta the AI from the popular Halo video
game franchise Cortana is a personal
assistant on Windows phones and Windows
tablets but she doesn't offer any smart
home integrations so she's at option
number two
Google now the Android personal
assistant you can use Google now to
control the nest thermostat which we
have installed here at the smart house
but that's it right now so Google's out
- that leaves us with these two
opportunity three Siri your iPhones
digital assistant can control things
compatible with apple's homekit option
number four Alexa the personality inside
the Amazon echo which is not only a
Bluetooth speaker but can act as a smart
home controller and manipulate devices
that homekit can't so between these two
options which one best meets our needs
pick me pick me I'm great for this sort
of thing I can let you control things
remotely this shouldn't even be up for
debate you must be crazy if you don't
pick me everybody knows I'm the best
this is the best with home kit you can
control all kinds of gadgets time
objects how matter that you want stop
because you do stuff that you don't and
because you do stuff that you don't
we're going with both for the CNN smart
between Siri and Alexa were able to
control almost everything we have set up
in the CNET smart house Alexa can
control the smart things accessories and
the Belkin Wemo switches searing can
control the Philips hue lights as well
as the Schlage door locks we currently
have installed both platforms also have
a lot of strengths and weaknesses but
they complement each other well Alexa
you can't control remotely at all Siri
cat you need to have an apple
set up but if you do you can control any
homekit devices from wherever you have
your iPhone and soon you won't even need
an Apple TV to do that but Syria doesn't
have any centralized controls if you
don't have your iPhone with you or a
family member doesn't have one at all
then they're completely out of luck in
terms of being able to control anything
with Alexa all you need to do is say her
name and if she can hear you she'll
respond turn on the porch lights lock
the front door I can't think of a better
metaphor for the current state of the
smart home than two robots vying for our
attention but that's where we are for
now so for the moment Siri and Alexa are
going to live side by side in the CNET
smart home be sure to check back in the
coming weeks and months to see all of
our plans for this house</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
