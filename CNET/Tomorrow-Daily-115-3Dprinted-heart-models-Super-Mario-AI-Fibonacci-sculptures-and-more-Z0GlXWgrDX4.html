little girl's life you know Mario from
the Mario Brothers well now he's alive
and can think for himself and doesn't
need you to play games anymore oh and
some amazing Fibonacci sculptures that
come to life whoa no it's gonna be a
good show Mario doesn't need me anymore
it's tomorrow daily
I'm mad oh I promise maximum sky punches
wings we don't hurt each other not
welcome to Saguaro daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe Oh
greetings citizens of the Internet of
course I'm your host Ashley scale join
me once again kale anonymous still
slightly infectious yep but not in a
good light enthusiasm way more like a
bad sick way yeah it's okay I they
replaced me and I'm a new kale so well
it's actually we 3d printed him
yesterday took a day it's not it's not a
safe safe thing but yeah i want to thank
brian bishop brian bishop thank you for
filling in sorry could I was I still
can't think correctly brain isn't
working quite right thank you Brian for
coming in and keeping my chair warm yeah
so without further ado we should
probably hit the headlines
I know your tea is gonna keep you warm
today I just wanted I just wanted
something special for the people that
are listening like I yo podcast fully
effects it's like a real old radio Syria
because I gave that a listen the other
day that was it was it was different for
sure show okay so this story is a little
bit similar to yesterday's first story
which is about robots in hospitals okay
so its technology kind of making medical
care a little better which is my
favorite i love all these stories um and
this is also kind of been done before
like we've seen stories like this before
but I don't care because it makes me
feel good on the inside and I'm gonna
talk about it so um this is a story
about a little girl at the Miami
Children's Hospital and she has this a
situation this condition called tap vc
or ta PVC which is a heart condition
that'll kill you if unless you get it
fixed it's extremely dangerous yeah I
believe it's the heart pumps blood to
the wrong places oh it's really bad and
it said they give you like weeks or even
like days to live if you have this um so
the hospital used 3d printing technology
to print out the girl's heart they like
scanned it and then print it out oh my
god allow back model of her heart and so
here's the video or Sarah used black I
know it's a little bit of a cold black
heart it's her blackened heart um so but
it's pretty incredible that they did
this and they were able to perform a
surgery that hadn't been performed
before using parts from a donor heart so
this particular surgery I I'm assuming
based on what i had read had not been
performed before using parts from a
donor heart so there it is there's a
picture of it it's a little more
detailed it's not so in shadow but
because of that surgery super great
success lo girls rested up wow that's
great so yeah it was a little testing
ground for them to test out but she's
totally fine she's it looks like she's
okay she's still in recovery I'm so she
but she's doing okay she came out
surgery doctor so like it went very well
um but yeah I just I love this idea of
doctors being able to and we've seen
this before I was gonna sign him Sir
house before can you give me a couple of
the examples what we've seen we've seen
them print out things like you know
different parts of the body where
they're able to look at like maybe a
bone and a tumor
are you know an organ with a tumor
attached to and they say okay here's
exactly where we're gonna make that
incision and they can really kind of
prepare a little bit better visually
they can know what they're looking for
um if it's the exact patients you know
organ or whatever it is so for her or
these drivers they are able to say okay
here's the scan of this little girl's
heart and we're going to go over this
over and over and over again with the
team of doctors that are me performing
his heart surgery so that we know
exactly what we're looking for exactly
what we need to fix without just opening
up and being like well we've never seen
her heart before but we've seen you know
in anatomy books and we've seen other
people's hearts so we kind of have a
good idea of what it is but not exactly
that's very cool I mean it like
obviously when we thought of 3d printing
were like we're going to be able to
print anything will print a you know a
leg or whatever replace it but I mean
this is a good good start for that going
in that direction it is really cool
there you go I just really it's 10 yeah
she's gonna be she seems like she's
gonna be all right cool I always love
hearing stories like that so okay um
meanwhile in Germany into to tube to
tube engine type it again team in gym
gym in Germany they are messing with the
AI they're adding a I to Mario so
basically yeah no this is this is really
interesting so what they did was they
took super mario world Mario game super
mario today and they've added they added
some AI and used and also speech
recognition so they they used Carnegie
Mellon speech recognition and also added
a I to Mario so that now you can talk to
Mario and he'll respond I don't like
that and also you can add emotions uh
including hunger curiosity ok you can
add like like kind of like guilt and
happiness now I feel as happy so here's
so here's some of the stuff there's some
of the stuff that you can do you can ask
Mario how he's doing he'll say good not
so good you can tell him to be sadder
okay he can also let he can get
discouraged if he can't keep making a
jump like he'll die skirts oh and these
are all a command yeah so you can like
these are things you can actually say to
him go to the left the one of the more
direct one of the more interesting
things that they said was you can tell
him you can tell him that stepping on a
Goomba kills the Goomba like that they
died and even
comes aware of the death of the Goomba
otherwise no I would have known
otherwise but now he does see there he
goes my jumbo Taggart Goomba it
certainly dies why don't like this at
all yeah where does he does he is he
able to get like white-hot rage when
toad tells him thank you for rescuing
here for your presence in another castle
he definitely would I could imagine like
that AI Mario would like punch that toad
right in the face he like kick him in
the throat and be like you better
chances now but he also gets he gets
cured he gets hungry so when he gets
hungry this is hungry when he gets
hungry he goes and he collects coins and
when he gets furious he explores the map
more oh so this whole a I am Mario he's
happy he said looking for an easy sad
that he kills people really weird yeah
so I you know again it's very cool that
they're able to give AI to Mario but I
want to play the video game oh yeah okay
so I have a look so with that said I
have a half back of the day TD aware
mm-hmm what video game character would
you want to see play their own game so
like if you could make any video game
character aware and it would play its
own gaming you could just watch mm-hmm
and like maybe give it teach it some
stuff yeah what would you want to do
Frogger Frogger really yeah i just want
to see like what like his you know
ultimately Frogger is it's a translation
of our lives you know like we always
keep trying to like get to that goal
there's always something hitting us so
he's gonna go insane but he's also from
extremely philosophical you're such a
simple yes tag it's like it you know its
explanation of life what about you yes
it is a main character wise gosh I
Tetris yeah I know right a hundred
percent Tetris dish want to teach those
blocks how to just take care of
themselves cuz really at certain point
during a tetris session use don't want
to deal tonight so ultimately your
question is which which character would
you like to see explore being in the
world that they exist in i would say
okay so i would say like crash bandicoot
okay why do you think perhaps for crash
bandicoot would know i just think it's a
really good choice like it's sort of
this or or or i guess you and fought
like fallout like an open world like
Skyrim I'd love to say I take on
something like an open-world game it now
you bring up a good point because an AI
in a game where there's good and bad
results where you can make a good
decision in a bad position would be
really interesting I see that's what I
there's a lot of possibilities here you
could do an NPC and see what they do I
like it it's almost like that story
where the guys those those art guys put
that bot into the dark web and was like
here one hundred dollars of my stuff
it's kind of like that if you do it with
open world it's AI you kind of see what
it decides to do GTA how can we didn't
think Jesus a low gondola logans in the
boot is quite a bigger blood sounds like
GTA it's like a no it's a game shows
were just screaming at the TV like look
it's a really screaming as a Gravitron
yeah but like a hot dog VTA just a guy
just going like what am I doing with my
life here I don't even know what access
are really weird accent yeah okay so
last story are these amazing 3d printed
Fibonacci inspired sculptures so these
are 3d printed sculptures that this
designer and artist named John edmark
created and when you film them spinning
and you bring the shutter speed way way
down it looks like it is animated Wow so
that is it just a plain like 3d
sculpture and then it looks like it's
melting into the bottom there if you
notice that and they so they animate
when they're spun under a strobe light
so in person if you're looking at them
you need a strobe light to be able to
see the effect or in this case you would
have to set a camera to a really short
shutter speed to recreate a strobe
effect so these designs are sort of
based off of the same Fibonacci sort of
sequences or design modeled after pine
cones and sunflowers that's incredible
it looks like it's alive it looks like
it's it looks like it's living which is
just awesome like a look at that one
that's crazy you could always see one of
the things that I notice is if you watch
it long enough as its rotating you can
see like errors in the 3d printer it's
not entirely perfect and perfectly as
Metro so like this one in particular you
see like a white thing kind of flinging
around in a circle yeah it just looks
absolutely amazing and
really one of the things I enjoyed the
most about this is that the guide mark
he released the how to overrun
instructables so if you want to make
your own give a 3d printer you want to
make some your own so he has like a
whole thing on instructables about how
to sort of recreate these that's awesome
it's pretty great yeah that's fantastic
it's super good um and I just you know I
love beautiful design and interesting
things and this really kind of press
those buttons today but I'm gonna let
you drink some tea we're going to take a
quick break we'll be right back with new
releases because it's Tuesday I'm glad
your hair and then we're gonna have your
user feedback and of course our phone
talker for the day so don't click away
tomorrow daily nice late oh haha
you
you
welcome back to the show yeah just throw
them out we are we are back we have it's
Tuesday yes and of course I'm glad
you're here and money yeah cuz yeah this
is Kayla's favorite part of the week
honestly I think everything is his
favorite part of everything but this in
fear part of the week to this in
particular is one of his favorite parts
of the show which is new releases
mostly game today oh you got two games
two movies but I I'm a little remiss
because you mentioned saints row we'll
get to that okay well gets that ok so
first up um I was something i was very
excited resident evil remaster you're
gonna play this i have a story about
Resident Evil can I tell it really quick
I feel like everyone does actually okay
I think everyone has a resident evil
story I made my grandma rent this game
for me from a blockbuster when I was a
kid I was not old enough to rent the
game myself and my cousin and I thought
we were so cool like running this game
so her and I get back to my room we pop
it in the PlayStation of course it's got
the big eyeballs and resident evil we're
like this is gonna be awesome and we
start playing it and it's super creeps
us out like right away and as soon as
those dogs jump into the windows in that
first hallway we started screaming
bloody murder and we ran down the
hallway and we made my grandma go get it
out of the PlayStation and take it back
as it was weird that was scared yeah and
then a week later I made her rented
again and then I played through it and
it was okay but it was like that first
experience I was like this is the
scariest thing I've ever done in a video
it was a scariest game I'd ever played
at that point yeah and it was just um I
feel like it hardened me a little bit in
a good way like it's shaped me up to
deal with the perils of life yes what
are the og horror games like one of the
ones that like scared the crap out of
people even that loading screen with the
doors like and that script ya voy so
verse terrified you really want to tap
into like that old school way of you
know playing video games where they said
this set camera original certainly can
really move the camera everything's slow
moving you actually feel limited bullets
limited bullet limited save feel weak
and that's the best horror kind of game
so oh I remember that moment three turns
and it's all we doing about 20 bucks i
think that's deep fry station for imovie
treta i'll probably pick it up just to
relive relive the magic we live a magic
of Resident Evil she was almost a Jill
sandwich there's really gonna be like
one person that watches the show that
gets the jill sandwich reference I was
love you Jill the master of unlocking
that's what I Caroline's for that for
that um and then something a little bit
different this is gonna be on 3ds gunman
Clive to this is a game I loved on
mobile and is the original ones on
mobile and it has this really cute art
style where it's sort of flat and it
looks like a living cartoon it's like
looking at fantastic it's gorgeous and
it's really entertaining and that I mean
in the first one the gameplay was
fantastic really good platforming like
I'm a big platformer fan and it looks
like this one is going to be more of the
same and better and it's on 3d s so I'm
sure it'll look really great with the 3d
on the new 3ds if you get one next month
but that's out now on 3ds in a shop that
looks really cool yeah do you want to do
saints row now or do you want to do it
after movies so Ashley forgot one of the
most important I'm sorry 2015 ever ever
ever in that space row get out of hell
we don't have any footage for it but
it's basically more for more sanctions
or saints row Johnny Gat which is the
leader of the Saints died and is in hell
and it's him escaping from hell so he
has all these like super power horses
saints row so it's going to be crazy
there's guns there's there's an armchair
gun where you sit in like they're all
based off of the descents the seven sins
oh so there's one that's gluttony where
you sit in an armchair and you drives
you around and you shoot out of it so
it's gonna be all the way I tell anyone
it's gonna be great I'm sorry sure we
get it's gonna be fun so that's sorry
for not including that and then we have
some movies coming out this weekend
strange magic is coming out this is a
George Lucas creation from the they
always said from the mind of George
Lucas likes a very big thing that isn't
Star Wars so apparently this is sort of
a fairy tale that's I guess inspired by
a midsummer night's dream so if you're
big Shakespeare fan this might be
something go see there's like a goblin
an elf a fairy imps it's all kinds of
misadventures and I guess there's some
some kind of according the trailer so we
had a very powerful potion that like
people want to get their hands on and
that's sort of these gummy berry juice
is there any life recumbents out of this
uh I haven't you know I haven't been
keeping tabs on the reviews amazing it's
gaurav either animation looks gorgeous
and it looked funny like the trailer I
was like well that looks entertaining if
I had a kid and probably like take them
to go see this but I do so so I probably
won't see it but if you're
you're so inclined and it's a it's a
little dry for movies right now like
january-february is usually the month
where movies go to die yeah because
there's so many Oscar winners to watch
so well that and also like these are the
two months where you don't you're not
expected to be a blockbuster or an indie
darling or an Oscar favorite so these
are what movies go to die speaking of
which Mordecai comes out this weekend
which looks hahahaha a little bit of
background on Mordecai he's supposed to
come out last year i believe during this
summer or maybe august and and
apparently from what i've heard the
studio's felt that it was so terrible
that they moved it to january to like
send it off to die because I Johnny Depp
get it together man man I just you know
Johnny Depp we I have some I have some
issues with joined up these days um
apparently this follows the the again
misadventures of this like degenerate
aristocrat so he plays this degenerate
aristocrat whose an art dealer during
the day and he's a thief at night so
Anna Gwenyth Paltrow plays his wife and
then I think Olivia Munn plays his
sidepiece surprise Olivia Munn's in it
and she plays somebody sidepiece hahaha
so yeah the thing is is this doesn't I
you know it looks like he's got a
mustache is that funny I don't you know
what it is it's johnny depp playing a
weirdo with weird facial hair and I just
I can't get behind this anymore like I'm
kind of done with this this is the sassy
part of tomorrow daily that you're
watching right I'm just a little done
with Johnny Depp plain weirdos with
facial hair who speak with strange
accents like I just feel like he plays
himself now in every movie just with a
different character name and maybe
caution I don't know transcendence was
go no Lone Ranger mmhmm yeah that's a
good dark shadow Oh up but pirates of
the caribbean 437 was pretty solid
rewrite so terrible so maybe we'll get
some good depth uh you know someday but
not yet yeah we're gonna have to wait a
little longer but if you wanted to see a
bad movie go see Mordecai I don't know I
think down the number two still haven't
theatres you can go see a bad movie
there maybe just maybe to see something
else yeah see strange man Jesse part is
over alright sassy parts over actually
just for us now it's time for you to be
sassy it's time for your user feedback
yesterday I asked you guys to send in TD
amazon to tell us what you think about
Amazon producing movies and some of you
guys had some very interesting things to
say Sebastian roaches and said if
they're good movies great if they're not
I don't care same is with the shows
they're doing has to be good Sebastian
got a high entry bar he's like it better
be great Sebastian was real talk yeah
that is a real time you are not messing
around you're right Jeff Bezos should
hire you as a consultant Whitaker wit
wrote us and said the more content
creators competing the better the
content becomes bring it on can't argue
with that can't cater is that what
occurs got his stuff together get his
fingers on the pulse Armin wrote to us
and said it's great and it's the future
finally netflix has some competition I
do agree that they're covering all the
important basis here right it really are
there just like boom boom boom just
crushing it checking all the boxes okay
so what's a lot and then our last one is
actually two tweets from Lynn who says
totally for more studios being more
modern would have liked simultaneous
release but I get it and then he wrote
blood at the same time I really hope
it's not another fire phone and I think
we all agree with you there all right I
think I actually covered every base yeah
you guys pretty much checked off all the
boxes I mean that's impressive also I
all seem positive which is good yeah
they all seemed very positive people
were just like yeah more competitions
good competition I'm in and if it's bad
then I'll just ignore it like I do other
bad stuff yeah it wasn't like Amazon's
like 12 new movies people kicking
puppies like they're actually out there
look like they're really bad so it
should be pretty interesting I think
we'll be good fingers crossed fingers
crossed everybody fingers crossed on
Amazon movies and of course it's time
