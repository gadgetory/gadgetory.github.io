you have to record an album the track
you're hearing now is called to be free
is to be lonely recorded by Tim bloom of
the mother hips once your song is
recorded then you have to track
professionally mixed and mastered for
vinyl next grooves are cut into what is
called a master lacquer disc these
grooves represent the sound of the
recorded music
the record players needle runs over
these grooves creating an electric
current that is amplified through the
speakers
and this photo technicians monitor the
record lathe while it cuts the master
lacquer
the master lacquers been sprayed with
silver and then dipped into a nickel
bath
a nickel adheres to the disk in a
process known as electroplating
electroplating creates what's known as a
metal master the metal master is then
pulled apart showing how each side is a
mirror image of the other one side has
grooves while the other side has ridges
decide what the ridges is what's known
as a metal Stamper the Stamper is
refined a bit to fit into the record
pressing machine the Stamper is then
inspected further with microscopic
precision these black vinyl pellets will
be superheated and formed into a hockey
puck shaped gooey biscuit the Stamper is
mounted into the press and a fresh
biscuit is placed on top the superhot
vinyl is flattened while the stampers
ridges press into it creating the
grooves of the record and finally you
have a stack of freshly pressed vinyl
records
