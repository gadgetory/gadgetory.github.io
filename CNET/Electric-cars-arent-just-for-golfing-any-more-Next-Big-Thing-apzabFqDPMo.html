electric car turned your head they
aren't novel anymore though they do
remain rare under 1% of new car sales
here in the US lagging where a lot of
folks thought they'd be a lot of the
normalcy comes from range issues being
satisfied we no longer think about these
as having range in the double digits
most of the cars that are coming to the
market now are in the 200 250 mile range
per charge that would be Chevy Volt the
coming Tesla Model 3 newly announced
Jaguar I pace and the new hyundai ioniq
battery electric new research by
bloomberg new energy finance suggests
that by 2040 thirty five percent of all
new cars sold worldwide will have a plug
and by 2025 those kinds of cars will
have a lower total cost of ownership
than those that are combustion only a
new novel study from MIT did some
interesting muxing of data they took a
look at second by second gps tracking of
drivers in texas california and georgia
added that to a national driver habits
database also looked at real-world fuel
economy of the vehicles and factored in
local temperature which can affect the
range and output of a car's battery out
of all that they deduced that
eighty-seven percent of current trips in
america can be handled by the current
state of the art plug-in cars and the
remaining thirteen percent or so would
be handled by better more prevalent car
show another new survey from the
University of Michigan Transportation
Research Institute shows another piece
of the discussion and that is the
livability of charging cars it's the
number one thing that kind of works on
someone's mind after range itself
researchers Brandon shut lee and michael
sivak found that drivers would want to
decide each time their car is charged
not via some automatic authorization
they would prefer pre-negotiated pricing
though not the variable spot market were
used to at the gas pump and would prefer
smart charging but where the car and the
infrastructure talked to each other to
figure out when to do it based on using
renewable energy it wasn't that long ago
you had a big rift in the auto industry
between companies who believed in plug
and battery cars and those that didn't a
conversation now though is has that
happened because of must sell
regulations or real consumer pull
through and a lot of this research is
working on that answer
