new android kitkat I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update google
announced sweet new features coming to
android 4.4 which is named KitKat after
the popular candy bar of course google
also unveiled the Nexus 5 smartphone
which will run Android KitKat but first
let's break down what's new about the
operating system google made Android
KitKat so it works with low-end devices
that run on less memory and that means a
few things for one it can be added to
older phones without any problem which
fixes one of the biggest problems with
android fragmentation every Android
phone should be able to get this update
even cheaper phones normally an
operating system update requires more
memory but not in this case it runs on
sixteen percent less memory than the
last version jellybean this update also
opens the doors to putting the KitKat
system on a different type of device
maybe a SmartWatch well there's no
official word on that yet but KitKat was
designed to use less battery when a
fitness app or pedometer is measuring
your activity so we shall see where that
goes it also has code to make it easier
to wirelessly print photos and documents
and web pages and of course there are
some style changes like a uniform color
for status bars a new font and more ways
to customize the home screens text
messages and hangouts there in one place
now which is handy the phone app will
automatically prioritize your contacts
based on the people you talk to the most
and if you get a call from someone who's
not in your address book Google will see
if that number matches any business
listings to give you a caller ID the
intelligent google now service can be
accessed with one swipe on the home
screen after saying the magic words ok
Google a voice command can be used to
search send messages get directions or
play music the first phone to run this
will be the nexus 5 as the name
indicates it has a 5-inch screen which
is larger than its predecessor it also
has a faster processor and supports 4G
LTE wireless connection speeds even
though this model is larger it weighs a
little less the eight mega
scammer has a few perks too including
image stabilization and a feature to
reduce blur and improve photos taken in
bright or low light it's on sale now at
the Google Play Store starting at three
hundred and fifty dollars for the 16 gig
model and that's the full price without
requiring any service plans or contracts
normally a high-end smartphone will go
for six hundred dollars or more off
contract it's going to work on ATT
t-mobile and Sprint but not on verizon
