10r and Google pixel three to see which
one has the best camera this is iPhone
10 are versus pixel 3 let's start with
the basics they both have a single lens
12 megapixel camera around the back the
10r has a 26 millimeter wide angle lens
at F 1.8 while the pixel 3 has a 28
millimeter wide angle lens also at F 1.8
one important thing to remember is that
the iPhone 10 R and the more expensive
iPhone 10 s actually share the same
wide-angle lens camera and I've already
compared the iPhone 10 s to the pixel 3
in an earlier comparison on CNET if
you've watched that then the results of
this comparison might not be too much of
a surprise however that being said the
10r does take photos in a slightly
different way in areas such as portraits
and in low-light and for zoom so that's
where I expect there to be the biggest
changes for general photos the phones do
an excellent job expects shots with
pleasing color saturation and good
exposures when it comes to HDR the
iPhone uses a mode called smart HDR
while the pixel has hdr+ and hdr+
enhanced turn them on and you'll notice
a big difference in the dynamic range
captured photos from the pixel have a
touch more contrast than the iPhone
smart HDR actually evens out the
differences between shadows and
highlights a little more than the pixel
does
the portrait mode both phones generate
the bokeh or the blur in the background
through software on the iPhone you can
use this simulated f-stop slider to
increase or decrease the bokeh effect by
default it's set at F 2.8 while the
iPhone 10 s is set at F 4.5 the pixel
uses a plane slider without the f-stop
markers but it also lets you change the
focus point and add foreground blur the
wider lens on the 10r means that
portraits look different to those taken
on other iPhones like the 10s with two
lenses you have to physically move
closer to get more of your subject in
the frame and because the iPhones lens
is so wide there can be a slight
distortion of faces if your subject is
at the sides of the frame the pixel can
do portrait mode on just about anything
from flowers to dogs just spooky
skeletons the iPhone though can only do
portrait mode on people if you try it on
a non human subject it will just say no
person detected on the screen that being
said I love the look of portrait mode on
both your subjects will look pin-sharp
while the background is nice and creamy
the iPhones blur can smooth out edges
around things like hair a little too
much but the pixel does make highlights
and details look a little harsh that
being said there's more contrast on the
pixel so it does make images look
sharper and sometimes a complicated
background can throw the pixel off
completely
the selfies the pixel has two
front-facing cameras with a regular and
wide angle lens with that wide lens you
can get a lot more in your shot than the
iPhone does the pixel also has a face
retouching filter if you don't like the
super detailed photos without any
filters at all and I definitely don't
you can try using the natural filter for
a good middle ground
I think smart HDR on the iPhone does a
better job overall of evening out the
highlight and shadow detail over the
pixel but that being said you might like
that look better
neither phone has optical zoom so they
rely on digital zoom to get closer the
pixel uses super a zoom which combines
multiple photos to produce a better
looking zoomed shot it kicks in at 1.2 X
or more results are impressive
especially when you compare them to
regular digital zoom on the iPhone this
is at 5x the maximum reach of the iPhone
time for some low-light shots I took
them to the spooky terror vault in San
Francisco to push the cameras to the
limit the pixel has the clear edge here
producing photos with less noise and
more sharpness than the iPhone but the
pixel does saturate the red Channel more
than the iPhone so photos look really
vivid the low-light portrait mode the
iPhone sometimes struggles locking onto
the subject but both can leave the image
looking a little soft
I think the pixels flash looks more
natural and brightens up the scene more
but this one's close and Google's night
sight feature that promises better
looking low-light photos without flash
wasn't officially available at the time
of testing per video both phones record
in 4k but only the iPhone does 60 frames
a second it's put on both but the iPhone
is sharper with smoother shifts in
exposure and colors look more natural
the pixel has the added bonus of
tracking moving subjects in stills or
video but stabilization looks more
natural on the iPhone while the pixel
has some evidence of that jello-like
effect the slow motion video both can
film at 240 frames a second but the
pixel maxes out at 720p while the iPhone
is full HD in low-light the results of
flipped from the still photos
it's the pixel that has a noisy messy
image and it also has trouble focusing
in low-light
the iPhones recording sounds more rich
than the pixel even though they're both
recording in stereo
we're waiting for you on the iPhone a
setting called auto low-light FPS
automatically drops the frame rate from
30 to 24 frames a second the difference
between the two in low-light video is
dramatic
both these phones have fantastic cameras
each with their strengths and weaknesses
without comparing the photos I'd be
pleased with either but like the results
from my 10 s versus pixel 3 comparison
the pixel just has the edge for still
images especially in low light and the
iPhone clearly wins for video recording
so now it's time for you to choose did
you like the iPhone 10 R or did you
prefer the pixel 3 let me know in the
