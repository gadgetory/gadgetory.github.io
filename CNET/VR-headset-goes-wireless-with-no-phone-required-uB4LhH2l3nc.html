down versions of what are going to be
next-gen technologies they're showing
them off at ether here in Berlin let's
take a look at the first one it's a VR
headset so this is called the Alcatel
vision inside here there are two OLED 1k
displays but what's interesting about
this headset is that unlike others you
don't slide a phone in here it operates
completely independently so there are no
wires this thing connects to the
internet over Wi-Fi and the battery pack
is in the rear which helps a little bit
with weight and actually I have to say
putting this thing on it feels a lot
lighter than some other VR headsets I've
tried good news for glasses wearers as
well there's a lot of room inside the
mask itself so if you do wear specs you
might find that the experience isn't
ruined it's going to be out at the end
of this year
Alcatel saying that it's going to cost
around 500 to 600 euros that's not cheap
but it is less than some of the other VR
headsets out there at the moment the
company is promising that there are
going to be a hundred be optimized
videos and over 50 games that launch
watching stuff in VR is only half the
battle oh you also need to create things
that you can enjoy once you've got that
headset on and that's where the second
piece of tech comes in this is the
Alcatel 360 camera as the name suggests
is a 360 degrees snapper it's got two
lenses on here for a total 2k pixel
resolution it works with an Alcatel 360
app on your phone and what's interesting
about this is that unlike other 360
cameras it's really quite basic so it
plugs into the phone itself or into the
phone via cable and this selfie stick
accessory so there's no wireless
technology inside the camera at all the
idea there is to bring the price down
Alcatel says this thing will cost around
99 euros when it goes on sale around the
end of the year it comes in two designs
there's this eyeball style one here or
there's a slightly slimmer one which has
the lenses offset even though they are
slightly apart from each other
Alcatel says that thanks to some clever
algorithmic stitching technology the 360
image shouldn't be broken so 360 degree
cameras and Vee are both very
interesting technologies but at the
moment they're complicated and they're
expensive so it's nice to see Alcatel
doing something to perhaps change that
much more check out see Netcom /fo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
