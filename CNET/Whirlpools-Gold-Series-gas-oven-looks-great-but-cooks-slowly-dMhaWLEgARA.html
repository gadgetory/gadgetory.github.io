it appliances and right now we're taking
a closer look at the whirlpool five
point eight cubic foot front control gas
stove with fan convection so for 1749
this range certainly isn't cheap
but for all that cash you get premium
build quality good looks and a big
convection oven this range also offers
burner controls that are all on the
front face of the unit
they're also flat here sitting on the
front lip which gives it a very
distinctive and handsome design there's
also a very slick LED panel right here
that displays all the pertinent
information as you're cooking it
definitely looks cool and it's something
that sets this range apart from others I
also like this oven has a very large
capacity its 5.8 cubic feet in size and
there's also five burners up top on the
cooktop
they range on the high end at 17,000 BTU
for very high sears and go all the way
down to 5000 BTU for melting sauces and
doing light simmers so what I don't like
about this particular gas range is that
it takes a while to do its job
essentially it'll take a while to broil
burgers to boil pots of water so there's
not a lot of power that you might see in
other competing gas ranges and like I
said this oven costs 17:49 and that's
pretty expensive especially for a small
compact gas range like this
the Whirlpool 5 point 8 cubic foot front
control gas stove definitely costs a lot
of money but it does provide excellent
build quality to match if you want a
faster performing gas range you're
probably gonna have to go with something
from Samsung I'm Brian Bennett foreseen
it appliances be sure to check out my
review of this oven as well as other
ranges at cnet.com
