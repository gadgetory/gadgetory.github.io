with the review of the sharp r8 to 0j s
one of the first things you may notice
about this microwave is its coating it's
got a silver coated metal outside I wish
they would have just made it stainless
it would have looked more durable and a
little bit more elegant
it's a 0.9 cubic foot interior and it
has a 12 point 7 5 inch turntable the
sharp is a 900 watt microwave which
makes it the lowest powered microwave of
any of the four we tested in this set
the Panasonic claimed that it made
really excellent omelets with its
inverter technology and yet we found the
Sharps to be the best they were fluffy
evenly cooked and not overdone one of
the things that were important for us to
test when we set about assessing
microwaves and their various performance
capabilities were their presets and how
accurately those worked the popcorn
preset with the sharp was probably the
most abysmal failure of all of his
presets that we tested there were times
that it only popped 40 kernels leaving
vastly over 400 kernels unpopped it's a
pretty disappointing bag of popcorn if
you ask me but if you follow the popcorn
manufacturers directions it popped a bag
of popcorn that more resembled what we
were expecting with between 69 and 80
unpopped kernels so again it's not a bad
microwave it's just the preset doesn't
really work very well this was true of
frozen dinners and potatoes but basic
core microwave functions aren't really
what sharp is selling here they're
selling their grill technology in their
convection convection ovens use a fan to
circulate that hot air throughout the
inside of the oven rather than just
letting it radiate and bounce off the
walls and it works pretty well it comes
with a grill rack that we use to grill
burgers and chicken while it was better
in terms of texture and overall
juiciness the product wasn't so vastly
superior to the other microwaves product
that we felt that it was really worth
the difference we defrosted chicken the
defrost works about the same as a lot of
other microwaves it's inconsistent it
won't defrost all the way through most
food items without beginning to cook
thinner parts or the parts that are
coming in contact
directly with your cookware but we
wanted to put the grill rack in the
convection into the test again with all
of that defrosted chicken and we put
some chicken drumsticks on the grill pan
and it made okay chicken in 17 minutes
but for that amount of time you could
make great chicken on your traditional
grill outside so what's the lesson here
my takeaway from this is that the Sharps
presets are not necessarily optimum but
that doesn't make it a badly performing
microwave however for a price of 289
dollars you want a really well
performing microwave but for our intents
and purposes testing all of its
functionality including those presets
and sensors it just didn't hit the mark
with this the little microwave that
almost could the sharp are 8 to 0 Jas
