checking out the 13-inch lenovo yoga
tablet tube with Windows now you might
be thinking this looks a little familiar
I recently checked out the 10 inch
version which offered a pretty nice
screen and a less useful keyboard this
version takes the exact same premise
including the quirky kickstand on the
back and inflates the screen size to 13
inches the display on the 13-inch model
has a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution and
it's powered by a quad-core intel atom
processor coupled with four gigs of ram
this is almost the exact same load as
the 10 inch model was double the RAM so
once again don't expect miracles
streaming HD video works great and so
will the occasional tablet friendly
games the storage capacity has been
doubled to 64 gigs and you can pop in a
microSD card for bit of extra room the
hinge on this model is almost identical
push this button on the rear and they'll
pop out allowing you to prop the device
up at any angle there is once again a
hole or a hook so you can hang on your
tablet I still have no idea why you'd
want to hang your tablet but it doesn't
hurt the battery and the hinge is here
and Lenovo claims you can see up to 15
hours of battery life the keyboard is
once again bundled in and it connects
via bluetooth it's rather thin but the
keys offer a fair bit of travel distance
so typing still feels comfortable and
their wide spaces keys too so it feels
just right provide admittedly giant
hands the touchpad is serviceable but i
prefer sticking to the touch screen in
this case unfortunately like the 10 inch
version the keyboard connected the
tablet by way of really weak magnets
it'll stay in place when you've got the
device sitting on a table but try to
move it or pick it up and it will fall
right off which kind of defeats the
purpose of letting the to connect in the
first place it's also supposed to double
as a cover but once again the weak man
just make me nervous about carrying it
all so this is as expected just a larger
version of the tenants Lenovo yoga
tablet window but that 10 inch size was
key you were getting a good screen and
while the keyboard wasn't very useful it
was still pretty easy to tote around and
it was at a bargain price this 13-inch
model is just a little too big to use
comfortably and at six hundred dollars
it's not nearly the bargain and smaller
sibling is you're going to be better off
sticking with the tenants model or
paying a little bit more and getting
something like the surface pro 3 instead
I'm Nate Ralph thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
