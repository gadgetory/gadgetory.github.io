report special report from comic-con
comic-con is about so much more than
comics as you know there's video games
TV movies speaking of video games how
about a little red Falcon Armageddon
and then of course comic-con is all
about promoting movies there's movies
that are coming out like Battlefield LA
Green Hornet kind of owns this show then
there's movies that are just cool and
geeky like transformers you've got
people getting in and out of pods for
aliens because it's coming out on
blu-ray and there's this nice big booth
for tron featuring the light cycle which
I think I'm totally going to steal
because it looks hella fast you turn
that off real quick TV big deal here at
comic-con lost was pretty much main here
true blood is huge CBS is premiering its
new show Hawaii five-o here and then AMC
has this new show called walking dead
I want to go now can we go now are we
done also Big Bang Theory huge a
comic-con who knew verse was in a hot
dense state the nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started waiting here began
a coup de otros began to drew
Neanderthal develop tools
another huge trend at comic-con toys
figurines and collectibles for example
collectibles for the very serious
collector what are you guys in line for
the Hasbro booth here Hasbro's toy shop
you needed a ticket all weekend but
right now there's no ticket needed so no
fight are there actually are there new
toys being released they are excited
about yes it's a pre-release right yeah
there they debuting a lot of the some
special edition toys and releases them
the new sergeant slaughter figure from
GI Joe they're debuting here and then I
guess they're going to be available on
hazardous website or that's what they've
done every other year so and so normally
you had to get a ticket how you actually
I went through this yesterday you have
to go upstairs wait in line for about
two hours to get a ticket to wait in
line for another five hours to get a
ticket so it's really not worth it
unless you want to go put it on ebay and
make money but i just want sergeant
slaughter so I'm good
also turns out comic-con is kind of hot
as in horny gchat it's Marilyn Monroe
with Mickey Mouse boobies
and although it may not seem like it
anymore comic-con is in fact still about
comics actually super serious comics we
are currently in the presence of
greatness in Wonder Woman greatness
alone they have in this glass case the
first appearance of Wonder Woman Wonder
Woman's first cover and the first issue
of Wonder Woman plus in this case
there's like the first Superman which is
gonna go an auction the first Batman
it's unbelievable and I'm not going to
touch anything because most of this cus
as much as my house
the other thing everybody will tell you
about comic-con is that it is all about
the unbelievable costumes
thank you you know yesterday I got my
picture taken a lot as Hollywood hosted
the bus reported buzz out loud but then
i put this costume on and everyone wants
to take my picture as Wonder Woman thank
you have a good time have I mentioned
how much I love it here ok so you got
your movies your TV your comic books or
costumes and then there's just
everything else and that's it for the
bus report I'm Hollywood thanks for
watching just leave me here I'm with my
people
