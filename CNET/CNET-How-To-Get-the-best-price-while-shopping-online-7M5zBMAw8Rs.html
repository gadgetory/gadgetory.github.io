to give you a crash course on saving
money when you're shopping online
whether it's for a birthday or for the
holidays if you want to save some money
without a lot of effort here are five
simple tips that are easy to remember if
you've already made up your mind and
you're shopping for something specific
like a nexus 7 tablet there are two
things you'll want to know first is it a
good time to buy sites like retrieve oh
and camel camel camel will show you
where the price has been and what you
should realistically expect to pay if
you're at a price peak you may want to
hold off second who's offering the best
price for that I like PriceGrabber calm
or Google shopping they do a great job
too on either one you can quickly see
who's offering the best price and
whether or not you're paying tax or
shipping now what if you're not shopping
for something specific it's your uncle's
birthday you have no idea what to get
them but you need to get him something
for that I would try a daily deal site
places like woot.com where slick deals
will offer a range of interesting deeply
discounted products but to make it even
easier check out DoD tracker comm this
site compiles all the offers from the
deal of the day sites onto one page if
you still have no idea what to buy one
time-honored cop-out present is the gift
card we've all done it before and
honestly once you rather get one of
these than some salad shooter you can't
return the only crime here is paying
full price for the gift card a site like
gift card grammy allows you to buy cards
at a discount from any name-brand shop
or restaurant and buying a high-value
card at a discount is also a good way to
save money for yourself if you plan on
buying a lot of holiday gifts at one
retailer like an Amazon or a Target
finally no matter what you're buying
don't pay for shipping if you can help
it while you're shopping around on price
be sure to factor in whether the site
will ship it for free if you found
something you love and only one retailer
has it and it comes with a shipping
charge check free shipping org to see if
you can find a promo code to knock out
that shipping cost so there you go those
are some quick tips for finding a great
deal online with a minimum of effort for

you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
