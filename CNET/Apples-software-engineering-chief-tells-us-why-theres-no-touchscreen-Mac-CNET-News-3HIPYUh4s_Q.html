on our Macs and our hands can be super
productive right there with the trackpad
with the keyboard and so that's where
when we look at providing more controls
that's where we want them right where
you're right where your hands are right
at your fingertips if you're on the
keyboard you tend to want to stay on the
keyboard if you're on the trackpad or
using a mouse you tend to want to stay
on that Mouse and so having your hands
on the keyboard and having just without
even lifting your hand to be able to
reach a control just right in front of
you we saw the opportunity with the
function key strip being really
something that's a throwback to the past
and a legacy too instead create an area
that was so useful and so powerful and
that really provided the controls
contextually that were most relevant to
what you were doing at any given time
and so when the technology came together
with a multi-touch display that we could
actually engineer into that space and
into this extreme enclosure
you know our eyes really got got very
wide as to what we could make what we
can make happen there the touch bar
almost becomes this mutable custom piece
of hardware most of your keys are fixed
in position and purpose but the touch
bar is as a reprogrammable touch surface
anything it needs to be for what you're
doing suddenly it's a musical instrument
where you can use multiple fingers to be
doing real-time performance and operate
not just buttons but but sliders and
different effects and I think that
really is an idea and a capability that
it's just going to continue to get
better as more and more developers
really rethink how they can solve their
problem through the framework of the
touch bar its surfaces functionality
that in the past has been in a way
hidden behind a menu but the fact that
it can come forward contextually based
on exactly what you're doing that moment
really prompts you to rediscover the
depth of some of your applications and
accomplish tasks that you might not have
even realized were available to you and
now you can do them in so much a faster
way so there's a really great
discoverability element to this this
display that's right at your fingertips
my wife of course wasn't able to know
that I was using the system but she must
have wondered why I was sending her more
emoji because they were they were right
at my fingertips you know so it is
things it is things like that I do think
also some tasks that you do like
navigating through your photos just
become so much quicker you know you end
up approaching it differently because
you just want to move around you just
put your hand down slide across it's
it's really fantastic at Apple we build
prototypes around all sorts of ideas so
we certainly explored the topic deeply
many years ago and had had working
models but decided that it really was a
compromise that for a device that you
hold in your hand like a phone or a
tablet it's very natural rest your hand
on the tablet and and work that way we
think touch is at its best and we wanted
to build and have built a really deep
experience around a multi-touch first
user interface grafting touch on
something that fundamentally was
designed around a precise pointer really
compromises the experience when we
engineered touch ID for the phone
privacy and security were fundamental in
fact we we'd had to put capabilities
into our custom silicon years before
people saw the the ever saw the the
iPhone 5s with that capability because
we wanted to make sure that we could
keep your fingerprint data securely in a
secure Enclave away from even even a
hacker if they could possibly get access
to your phone and so we've been able to
take that same custom silicon that
technology and build it into a chip
that's in the Mac so you get those same
protections and then you get this really
incredibly fast sensor so when it comes
to signing in to your Mac touch ID for
payments with Apple pay or even fast
user switching they all work here and I
think just as with iOS as we saw people
other third party starting to take
advantage of the sensor over time to
provide kind of security features we'll
see the same kind of roadmap for the Mac
as we built this 13-inch machine and
really made the ID both so so tight and
X&amp;amp;Y so dense so small we realized in the
end we had the perfect 13 inch laptop
and in fact when we compared it to the
MacBook Air which is so beloved we saw
that we built a machine that was
actually
a thinner smaller just as light and then
had all the things that we really as
users wished we could have in our air
right it had the Retina display that I
think once you have one it's it's really
hard to turn back you have the fantastic
trackpad and then just all the
performance and so we realize for so
many MacBook Air potential users this
was the the right next step for them and
so we were able to create a
configuration of the 13-inch without the
touch bar and with just the two ports
which actually is a ton of i/o Phil
talked about the incredible capabilities
at the event about the thunderbolt ports
and and it's sort of the best MacBook
Air you could have and I think a lot of
people who want it's a little a little
something more from from the air are
going to find this the perfect 13-inch
machine</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
