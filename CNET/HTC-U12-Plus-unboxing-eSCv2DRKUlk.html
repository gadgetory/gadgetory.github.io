no this is not the box that you're going
to get but it is straight from HTC this
is the final hardware and software so
let's begin all right what do we have
here we have the phone which is in this
nice bubble wrap pouch put that aside
for a second and we have ogen the case
this is a clear case that we were
promised for the phone this is great
because it will protect solute glass
backing and you won't have to buy a new
case yourself you'll be able to just buy
the phone and use the case right away we
will put those two together soon but
let's see what else we have here all
right we've got the charger pack this is
for fast charging and we have the USBC
cable that will go along with it these
are always nice because you can plug it
into the charger you can plug it into
your laptop or anywhere else that has
the USB a charger port and USB see on
the other side which is the new standard
that almost every phone will use so
really not a surprise and we have the
you sonic earbuds that come along in the
box with a variety of different tips so
even though this isn't the typical box
that you're gonna get on retail shelves
if you go out and buy this phone or have
it shipped to you these are the same
contents that you're gonna find in your
box
alright so let's put this together we
don't care about this box anymore it's
white right so here we go it's not a lot
to see in there here we have the phone I
have the really cool blue color it looks
kind of translucent so if you take a
look at the back you can kind of see
through to some of the components on the
inside it is a really mean effect when
you hold it in the light and some light
it definitely shows up a little bit more
than others but it's definitely cool and
that's why you want to have this clear
case so you can sort of see inside so
let's just snap this on this snaps on
pretty easily see if it's easy to come
on yeah actually you just kind of tug on
these corners and it'll snap right off
so I already feel pretty good about that
and since most phone companies don't
throw in a case this is a nice little
value-add there's plenty of room
I can tell already to reach the
fingerprint reader on the back of the
phone so I like that there's a pretty
big good window here
you're not going to confuse the
fingerprint reader for the camera like
you might on some other phones and
there's a lot of room on the sides also
to reach those buttons the buttons are
pretty much the most interesting thing
about the u12 plus because although they
look like buttons and they feel like
buttons they don't actually press down
you can't suppress them at all and
already you know I can kind of feel some
haptic feedback when I press them
they're touch sensitive and also
pressure-sensitive let's turn this on it
it is really weird this is a really
weird feeling because my body wants to
press down I've got that muscle memory
but nothing happens so I think it might
be one of those things that you just
kind of get used to all right let's see
the phone's start up there we go there's
the chime so on the front one of the
first things I notice is that there are
two camera modules on the front these
are eight megapixel cameras only one of
them is for taking most photos the
second one adds that portrait mode to
cameras on the back too so that makes a
total of four cameras again we have a
second camera that is there for the
portrait mode but it's also a telephoto
lens so you can take pictures with it as
well a fingerprint reader on the back
that we mentioned as well one thing that
you will not see anywhere on the phone
is a headset Jack we just have that USB
C port down below alright so now I've
turned on the phone I've gone through
most of the setup process and I have one
more decision to make and that's how I
want the navigation bar brand-new to HTC
and I actually haven't seen this on any
other phone I can choose to have a
navigation bar that I swipe so I have
more options
pretty simple I'll just swipe to get
more controls that's something that's
kind of cool you can't tell by looking
but the sides are squeezable too so it
can squeeze to launch the camera app or
another app that I choose I can squeeze
and hold to do something like launch
Google assistant or maybe even keep the
screen from dimming that's what the
holding gesture here means as
you can keep it from turning and keep it
from dimming which is great if you're
laying on your bed reading a story and
then also I can tap the sides to get it
to do whatever I want so I can turn on
one handed mode I can use the back
button for navigation or any other of
these options here so this is pretty
great customization and there are a lot
of choices and you're able to really do
a lot with this so the remaining
question is are these new design
features any good these buttons that
don't press squeezy sides with a lot new
features than we've seen in past HTC
phones that is what our full review is
going to be about so stay tuned for that
I will say that HTC has always made very
beautiful phones and I'm really liking
the look at this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
