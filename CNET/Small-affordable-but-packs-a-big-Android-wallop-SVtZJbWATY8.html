and right now we're taking a first look
at the motorola droid mini super small
compact and very lightweight you may not
think much of the mini after all it does
occupy the lowest rung and motorola's
droid lineup for 2013 I have to say
though that this little guy packs quite
a mobile punch and for an affordable
price to available now on verizon for
9999 with 2-year contract the droid mini
offers most of the same core features
you'll find on motorola's more expensive
new droid models namely the one 9999
droid ultra and to 9999 droid maxx
driving the phones android 4.2 jelly
bean software is Motorola's fresh x8
mobile computing platform it crams 6
discrete processing centers around a
dual-core 1.7 gigahertz Snapdragon s4
pro CPU an ability called touchless
control means that the phone is
constantly listening out for your vocal
commands just say the words okay Google
now then tell the mini what you'd like
it to do there are a long list of
commands at your disposal including ones
for sending texts emails and making
calls you can also look up places get
directions set reminders and check the
current forecast a feature called active
display handily showcases phone alerts
on the screen when the droid mini is
sleeping the droid mini also feels very
nimble and responsive whether that's
flipping through home screens or
settings menus there are five home
screens you can personalize with your
choice of application shortcuts and
widgets the main screen features the
useful circles widget that grace older
motorola handsets it displays a time
whether battery level plus offers fast
access to settings and two other slick
abilities these are wireless display to
mirror the mini screen to compatible TVs
and monitors and droid zap which shares
photos and video with other android
phones nearby the droid mini is 720p
screen measures 4.3 inches bigger than
the iPhones but relatively small
compared with most Android phones it
does get pretty bright though and has
vibrant colors above the display is a
2-megapixel front-facing camera while
below said three capacitive buttons for
basic android control the only physical
keys are on the right
edge of volume rocker and power button
the bottom lip holds a micro USB port
and up top is the minis 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack around back is the
phone's main 10 megapixel camera with
LED flash like the Moto X droid ultra
and Droid Maxx twisting the mini a few
times in your wrist fires up the camera
app it offers minimal controls and
settings but does have important
shooting modes such as HDR slow-motion
video and panorama snap images by
tapping anywhere on the screen holding
your finger down takes multiple shots in
a row you can also zoom in and out by
swiping up and down one thing I really
don't like about the droid mini are its
glossy surfaces like the droid ultra
this phone gets covered in fingerprints
and smudges in no time there's no SD
card slot either to expand the minis 16
gigabytes of internal storage the droid
minis power source is a sizable 2,000
milliamp battery which motorola says
provides 28 hours of runtime I also like
that just like the other new droids the
mini supports the Qi standard for
wireless charging connecting to
Verizon's 4G LTE network the droid mini
can grab fast data speeds that is if
you're in an LTE coverage area I'm Brian

first look at the motorola droid mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
