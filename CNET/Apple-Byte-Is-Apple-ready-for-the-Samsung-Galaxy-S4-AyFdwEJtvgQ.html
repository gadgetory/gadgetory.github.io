the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple plus we have a
big prize giveaway now it's been pretty
quiet on the Apple news front this week
and it's the galaxy s4 that's going to
get a lot of the attention with its
rumored 5-inch screen 13 megapixel
camera and quad-core processor with
potential I tracking software but we'll
obviously know what the big a is up
against after the official announcement
now it's important because we talked
about how Apple will need a response and
it probably won't happen until later in
the summer when I'm working on my tan
just like that guy now the China Times
reports that Taiwanese chip firm chip
bond has been selected to provide a
number of components for the iphone 5s
including chips that will support a
fingerprint sensor and near-field
communications capabilities this is
exactly the combination of tech that I
used in Japan in 2003 yes you heard me
right 2003 that still hasn't arrived in
the US now the fingerprint sensor is for
security to unlock the NFC functionality
for mobile payments apple acquired
mobile security firm authentic last year
to presumably integrate fingerprint
security into their own products and
we'll see if this makes it into the next
iPhone now in digit times rumors that
pretty much used the throw spaghetti on
the wall and see what sticks method have
also chimed in that it expects Apple
will add wireless charging to their 2013
flagship phone now I'm leaning towards
probably not on this one right now also
rumors have stated that Foxconn has
already started production on the new
iphone 5s and guess what it's a rumor
that any one of us could have made up so
guys for the record if you believe what
you hear the iphone 5s will have all the
unique features of other flagship phones
combined it's a one package that looks
like last year's phone now we've beat up
Siri a lot on the show and for good
reason but recently a leaked video from
google which has been taken down show
case Google now for iOS is coming soon
this is Google's own assistant that
gives you recommendations for best local
travel routes sports scores or
restaurant recommendations and it uses
Google superior voice recognition now
the video also implies that the Google
now feature will be part of the current
google search app so we'll keep watching
this unless Apple rejects it which they
shouldn't also apple streaming music
service is still a long ways out and in
news that happened last week a New York
Post report says Apple approached music
labels and offered what they considered
to be a low ball royalty rate for a
streaming service Apple's initial offer
was six cents for every 100 songs
streamed according to their sources now
that's half of Pandora's 12 cents per
100 songs a service that's struggling to
make money an online service iHeartRadio
that's backed by terrestrial radio
stations pays 22 cents per 100 songs and
then you have spotify which pays the
highest rate at 35 cents per 100 songs
streamed now Apple plans to bundle it
with their itunes match service and we
don't know other specifics of the
potential deal but apple's starting that
low they just look like that cheap guy
on the first date who's getting nothing
at the end of the night now the report
says the music labels have rejected the
initial offer not surprisingly and both
sides are preparing their counter offers
okay guys let's check out some quick
bites if you like your iphone you like
cases and you like Iron Man like a lot
check out the pre-order from Brando for
this Iron Man iphone case based off his
mark 7 armor design that has a white LED
light that shines on the back side and
an opening shoulder camera cover it will
cost forty nine dollars in I'm ordering
mine immediately to match my awesome
costume and in a fun article by ARS
technica they have a photo gallery of
one of the earliest prototypes of the
iphone from 2005 that included a five by
seven inch screen it was roughly two
inches thick with USB ports and Ethernet
port and a serial port not that kind of
cereal the one you might find on a
computer
see Apple was the first company to make
a phone tablet or seven-inch tablet so
take that same seung cee i just want to
let you guys know some of the emails I
get from people every day and my name is
