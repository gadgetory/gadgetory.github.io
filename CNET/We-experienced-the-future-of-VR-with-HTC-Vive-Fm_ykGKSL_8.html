reality again I'm Scott Stein here in
Barcelona and the HTC 5 developer
edition when we heard about it it's a
partnership with valve that's promising
to bring virtual reality gaming by the
holidays we knew that and now I've
demoed it and believe me it's awesome
i've seen oculus rift I've seen project
Morpheus and this might be the best of
all of them which is a shocker so what
makes the HTC vive so cool and so much
different than other stuff will oculus
rift its latest version allows you to
wander around within a little square the
HTC vive allows you to wander through an
entire room as long as this 5 meter
tether cable to your PC allows you to go
this is a prototype version the
developer edition may be like this we
don't know what the consumer version
will be like exactly probably wired and
as you move around it has sensors there
are little laser beam boxes that sit on
each corner of the room and shoot an
array of lights that work with sensors
on the helmet that tell you where you
are in space now the war version for
consumers will have I are instead of
lasers but it really worked and I was
able to tell when I got close to a wall
even though I was blinded from it a
ghost wall appeared in my virtual
experience that matched it and let me
know that I was about to run into it but
there are two other awesome things about
HTC vive the controller is one it's like
valves steam controller split in two
you've got two with triggers here and
you've got capacitive disks here that
you can click on so you can actually
move around almost like a trackpad or a
mouse and when you're using the game
those appear in the game and allow you
they become different tools so I did a
painting tool where I can move my thumb
over this and suddenly the tools
appeared and I was a look dip my
paintbrush in and suddenly paint with
light all around the room and I felt
like I was painting like this and
dancing around it was ridiculous this is
not capture it but that's pretty amazing
because you can suddenly use tools in
space also there's the valve steam store
there's going to be an actual store for
games now oculus only just begun getting
into that and you can expect a lot of
games a lot of partnerships HBO Lions
Gate Valve of course Google
what did I see in that world well I saw
the blue which was an aquarium
simulation where I was standing on a
sunken pirate ship walking right up to
the edge and looking at a giant blue
whale overhead that was gigantic and
finally what did it wrap up with a
little teaser from aperture science I've
seen a lot of VR and I was still pretty
amazed by this it's maybe the very first
consumer-ready pc gaming experience when
it comes out by the holidays or maybe
there'll be other surprises but this
really raises the bar and shows there
are a lot more players in VR than oculus
I'm Scott Stein here at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona and you haven't
seen the things I've seen but you would
want to</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
