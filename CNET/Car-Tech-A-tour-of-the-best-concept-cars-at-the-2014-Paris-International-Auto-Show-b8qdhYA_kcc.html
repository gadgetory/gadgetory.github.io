International Auto Show as ever the
floor is covered with lots of beautiful
cars and lots of beautiful concept cars
these are machines intended to give a
bit of a design statement for the brands
that they represent cars that may be too
big or too impractical or simply too far
out there to ever show up on a showroom
floor in fact many of these cars may
never see the light of day again so
let's enjoy them while we can and take a
look at the best concept cars of Paris
2014 this is the Infiniti qat
inspiration an absolutely beautiful car
that is long and low and lovely infinity
says that it is aggressively styled to
say that is a bit of an understatement
on the inside of this of course packed
with technology there are dual heads-up
displays upfront one for the driver one
for the passenger the car can drive
itself but it can also give advice to
the driver for example telling them when
to change lanes and traffic to avoid the
worst of it the rear seats have plenty
of technology to high-definition
displays for entertainment but the best
form of entertainment perhaps the bottle
of champagne is nestled between the
quilted leather seats now what's under
the hood probably nothing at all this is
a show car after all but infinity would
like us to believe that's got a
twin-turbo v6 with a hybrid powertrain
giving up total of 550 horsepower get
still delivering 42 miles per gallon
which isn't too bad next up is a concept
that's looking a little bit closer to
production this is the Audi TT sports
bag a four-door version the company's
iconic roadster now if you told me
before the show that Audi was going to
slap a couple of extra doors on the TT I
probably would have been fairly
skeptical but I have to admit I think it
looks great especially the rear haunches
with that sloping profile looks
fantastic on the fort or perhaps even
better than on the two-door now on the
inside we've got the same 12 inch
virtual display that's the same as we
see on the TT I think some fantastic
future technology LED lighting all
around we've got Laser headlights in the
front of 400 horsepower turbocharged
motor that'll get you from zero to 60 in
less than four seconds up
despite looking like it just rolled off
of a production facility we're hearing
that out he has no plans of ever
offering this for sale so my advice take
a good look like n now all the Audi has
all-wheel drive for good performance in
all conditions pooja is taking that a
step further with the off-road focused
quartz concept which we're sitting in
here 500 horsepower on tap means that
this is a peppy pug and it is a plug-in
hybrid as well I mean you'd go to 30
miles without burning any gas at all in
theory anyway we're sitting in the
interior here which is wonderfully
futuristic there's actually a
holographic display for the driver here
lots of controls on the tunnel steering
wheel so you never need to take your
hands off of here and beautiful lighting
beautiful materials even real stone here
in the middle now is this car ever
destined for production all the giant
wheels the razor blade mirrors the
scissor doors the smell of resins inside
the interior I'd say don't get your
hopes up children has announced the show
this year they're spinning off yes the
sort of some random there celebrating
with this the des divine a bit of an
appropriate name given the diamond
studded interior my favorite part though
the diamond-shaped louvers on the rear
they do block rearward visibility but
who needs to see out the back when
you've got HD cameras HD displays and
yes even the heads-up display a bit of a
trend this year likelihood for
production well look at the suicide
doors and the giant wheels and
everything else you have to say that
it's pretty unlikely that this is ever
going to be showing up in a Citroen
showroom just as unlikely as will be
showing up in John Waters next movie
and finally my favorite concept car of
the show this is the Lamborghini Asteria
on LP i 910 dash for yes a very lengthy
name but the Austrian part is the most
important he was a mythical half-man
half-bull Minotaur in this cartoon is a
bit of a split personality v10 in the
back electric motor up front yes this is
a hybrid a 910 horsepower hybrid so very
much a Lamborghini the styling I think
is a bit more refined in a lot of recent
Lambos a little bit more classical looks
a little bit like the mirror and
matter-of-fact from a couple angles and
I am absolutely in love with its but it
is unfortunately at this point just a
concept car lamborghini has no plans for
production but maybe if we all wish
really hard and clap our hands never
bikini we'll make our wishes and our
dreams come true hope you've enjoyed
this look at the greatest concept cars
from Paris 2014 though these cars may
never make an appearance in your
driveway I hope they do at least make an
appearance in your dreams now if you'll
excuse me that's an agreement to do
myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
