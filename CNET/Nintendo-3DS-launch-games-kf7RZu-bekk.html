here at the 3d s press event in New York
City we have everything we need to know
about the hardware but what about the
software why don't you come with me and
let's check out some of these games our
first game demo is steel diver you might
remember the game as a tech demo but
Nintendo gave it its own game to the 3ds
it's going to be one of the launch games
and basically you're controlling the
submarine the height and acceleration of
the of the vehicle and you get to shoot
missiles there's also a periscope mode
we actually have to move your entire
body to shoot missiles at oncoming
shifts so that's our first game demo and
there's a lot more stuff to see here
let's go check them out right now I
guess you can't release a new game
console without Madden so here it is
Madden football for the 3ds plays a sort
of like how we used to on the iPad that
sort of experience but it's going to be
coming up very soon in the 3ds game
launch window we're really psyched to
get our final hands on it
and that's it for Madden football
all right the next game we've got is
legend of zelda ocarina of time it's a
game you might recall widely regarded as
one of the best Zelda games ever 3d
makeover for the 3d as the 3d really
adds something special to it the effect
is spectacular and it's going to make
you want to play the entire game over
all over again all right this is
Pilotwings resort takes place in the
same area
from sports resort pilotwings is a
classic Nintendo game where you fly
around and hit goals and use jetpacks
the top balloons and stuff like that
really fun and the 3d effect on this is
so far the most impressive that we've
seen out of all the games here it's a
lot of fun gives you that really
realistic 3d flying effects there's a
lot more games I have to play Resident
Evil at some point let's go check it out
all right this is Super Street Fighter 4
in 3d s completely rendered and 3d this
is a very interesting experience because
you're playing in one dimension the
backgrounds in another and they're sort
of you know it's almost tough to keep
your eye on the action because you're
sort of looking around all over the
screen but this is going to be one of
the launch window titles for the 3ds
it's coming soon can't wait to play the
final version let's see what else they
got all right we finally made it this is
Resident Evil mercenaries 3d it's sort
of like an all-star game it features a
lot of scenes from past Resident Evil
games and combines them into one sort of
Arcadia experience by far the
best-looking game we've seen here at the
event today and the 3d effect is just
awesome once you lock in it really is
spectacular alright there's a lot of
other games here that we didn't get to
like Nintendogs + Cats reach racer
there's going to be a lot of stuff
available at launch but one thing we
want to sort of disclose to everyone is
you know all these games we've been
showing has had the 3d slider off now
you have to have it officer that the
camera is able to shoot the image and it
doesn't look all screwy but when you do
pick it up and you turn that 3d effect
on it works really well and once you're
locked into that sweet spot the game
actually is pretty spectacular
that's going to do it for us here in New
York at the 3d s press event I'm Jeff
Bakalar for cnet.com thanks so much for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
