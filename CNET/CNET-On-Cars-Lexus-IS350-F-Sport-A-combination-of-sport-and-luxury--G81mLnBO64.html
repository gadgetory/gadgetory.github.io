their best bet may be their only bet
let's drive the new 2014 is a 350 all
wheel drive in F Sport trim and check
the tech art spotting the new is is
pretty darn easy big deep spindle grille
Lexus style and look down at the rear
quarter and seen this incredible swoop
that comes up off the sill and meets the
outside brow of the taillight that's
very different it is a little bit longer
check out that front seat legroom I can
actually put the driver's seat so far
back I can't even drive the car which
for me is saying something now ordering
and I ass is like ordering hashbrowns at
the Waffle House a thousand combinations
250 or 350 all-wheel drive rear wheel
drive f-sport available on any
combination of the above so what's an F
Sport it's basically better brakes
cooler wheels adaptive suspension and
variable steering no engine changes
okay inside this new is cabin it's a
real handsome thing they've gotten rid
of some of the needless curved organic
stuff and gotten a more angular look
that I think fits a sporty car the
materials have been brought up as well
nice faux aluminum nice whatever this
machine turn finishes and all the
pleather is really good quality too now
in the concept version of this car they
promised us two 12-inch LCDs well you
know concept cars we ended up with
considerably less there is a seven inch
main LCD right there
navigation doesn't look a whole lot
different than it has before slightly
childish in this very kind of cool
interior they've revised a lot of the
cursor work on this car and notice when
you go on top of a button it gets this
big doughy glowing thing as well so
that's a nice simple improvement here's
the top menu you also see we have the
Lexus app suite a lot of things live
inside there that we have seen before no
major changes and on Lexus cars the
connection to the Internet is also
through your phone it's not built in the
way BMW Audi and soon General Motors are
all gonna do it some of those apps show
up as media sources as well as they
should in one place thank you here's our
iPod right here and bluetooth streaming
as well let's take a look at how
metadata forms from our iPod for example
this is one of the better uses of the
real estate to spell things instead of
rotate scrolling them which I hate in a
car now these guys are known for Mark
Levinson audio that is optional as well
and notice you've got sound profiles per
source which I think might be new in
this car so I'm setting up my iPod sound
curve now that'd be separate from my FM
radio for example notice in all of this
I would absolutely kill I mean kill for
a back button that isn't on the screen
only I need a button right here under my
thumb which brings us to this haptic
feedback touch thing they called it
remote touch I think it's like an upside
down puck debut to the RX a few years
ago and it's just not precise or
positive enough I think it needs to go
I'd kill for a knob with a click right
now 2 3 5 2nd Street San Francisco
California
two three five second Street San
Francisco California is this correct yes
yes okay the key two tests were passed I
can enter the address in one long phrase
not bucket by bucket by bucket and it
got it on the first try it was kind of
slow though doing its processing but
that doesn't distract you from driving
as much as those other failings would
have now this laid-back console I think
is genius it's the only one I can think
of in the car biz
that's exactly at the angle of your
fingertips when you pivot your elbow no
one else does that it's so simple
unfortunately too much of it is
squandered on climate control these are
your temperature thingies they're a
sensor strip I don't need that that's
really just tech filigree what I really
want is it the dam not which still works
better than anything else here's a huge
great what do you use more than anything
except the gas pedal and steering wheel
when you drive the volume knob this one
you can never get to looks easy right
well think about it to go this way bang
your head hits the gear shifter wherever
it is
ouch if you try and go this way it's
this kind of tortured little twist of
your wrist if you go this way you can't
quite reach it around the gearshift
there's no easy way to get to that thing
that's a huge screw-up I'm pleased how
they've done the seat heaters though and
remember little things add up on a car
when you live with it for years lots of
these electronic switches reset every
time you restart the car what's also
clever is when you get back in the car
when it's cold it automatically goes to
3 which will throw you for a minute what
it's doing it's fast heating and then it
gradually stops itself down to the one
that I had before well thought out very
Lexus now drive controls one choice only
automatic gearbox not a dual clutch
we'll talk about how many gears when we
get to the engine bay but it's right
here with a shiftable gate here to go up
and down shift also you can get on the
paddles of course they're wheel mounted
and blessedly simple personality control
over here you go counterclockwise to put
it in Eco mode which you might do once
in a while push the thing to go back to
normal
turn it once to go to sport
which is going to sharpen up
transmission and accelerator behavior
turn it again for Sport Plus which will
add sharper suspension and steering
behavior now the real crowd-pleaser
let's go to the instrument panel which
they borrowed some of the technology are
from the LFA supercar and I hate to
break their hearts but it should have
stayed there here's the trick you push
the Menu button here on the wheel and we
there we go that gauge in the middle
which is a video gauge moves to the
right on a little motor then exposing a
whole bunch of additional menus you've
got to the left of it when don't I want
to see all those menus on the left when
do I want to see less in my interface
it's not often and I don't want my
wallet within a mile of that dealership
when the little motor that does this
breaks and they got to I assume dig all
this out to get to it
no thanks
now here in the bow we've got a three
and a half liter v6 because this is a
350 to get a 250 you can fill in the
blanks
this v6 is sitting longitudinally drives
the rear wheel standard drive the front
wheels and the rear all-wheel drive in
our optional configuration here your
transmission is interesting if you get
rear-wheel drive you get an 8-speed
automatic if you get all-wheel drive you
get a six-speed Automatic that's what
we're going to be driving today
you've got multi port as well as direct
injection on the intake side here the
logic goes that multi port is better for
cruising or idle performance but direct
injection is better when you're on the
throttle so I'm seeing a combination
here which adds some complexity but
seems to pay off mpg nineteen city
twenty six highway 28 highway if you get
rear-wheel drive 306 horsepower 277
foot-pounds of torque gets this 3700
pound car up to 60 and 5.7 it's a tenth
slower than the rear-wheel drive you
don't give up much okay under way the
biggest complaint I have about this car
that I share with a lot of others is a
kind of sleepy soft gearbox the shifts
are kind of slow and this guy gets
caught in its top two gears way too
often way too much they've got the great
engine note in this car as well you can
hear that and you can even set the tact
go red when you hit a preset rpm limit
that's a lot of nice theater but it
helps to inject a certain DNA you don't
think of in a Lexus the ride is tuned
towards softness not the same precision
I would expect out of let's say a 335 is
but it's got a certain lack of precision
at the really sharp edge here's the
bottom line for a buyer's tip this car
among athletic sport sedans I think is
the most comfortable riding not sloppy
but comfortable and that sets it apart I
think from a lot of the German and even
American and Asian competition that tend
to punish you from underneath this car
you will feel refreshed in after a long
drive if not quite as exhilarated from
after a short twisty Drive
okay let's price this guy a fourteen if'
350 s going out at about forty thousand
three twenty two hundred bucks or so
more for all-wheel-drive note that there
are some sacrifices there you lose
variable steering you get a 14-inch
bigger turning circle and you get a
six-speed not an eight-speed right go
rear now the big pact is it takes you
totally see that style is seventy seven
hundred bucks to throw everything on
this car including a few tech I didn't
even show you on here this brings the
car up to fifty thousand three seen that
style it's a fair amount of change but
this car is a nice blend of performance
to the degree that you can actually use
it and comfort to the degree that you
will always appreciate</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
