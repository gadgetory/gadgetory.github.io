lenovo is going after professionals who
are more likely to be huddled around a
coffee table than all day at a desk the
ThinkPad x1 carbon is the star of the
lineup this year with a 14 inch display
that goes nearly edge-to-edge allowing
lenovo to make its carbon
fiber-reinforced body the size of a
typical 13 inch laptop it weighs in at
two and a half pounds is just more than
a half an inch thick
but can be configured with a new core i7
processor and can run for more than 15
hours it's packed with wireless options
including super fast way gig and 4G LTE
and with plenty of other connection
options including two Thunderbolt 3
ports you're ready to connect to
monitors keyboards or whatever else you
need and of course security is important
so lenovo includes a fingerprint reader
and an IR camera for use with windows
hello it looks like an amazing little
laptop but if you need the flexibility
of a hybrid lenovo updated the x1 yoga 2
and it keeps the same awesome OLED
display from last year but adds much of
what you'll find in the carbon however
you can flip it all the way around for
use as a tablet and it comes with an
improved pen and a lay flat keyboard and
if you'd rather have something that's
more tablet than laptop lenovo updated
the x1 tablet with the latest Intel
processors and wireless features the
ThinkPad x1 carbon will be available in
February starting at 1350 along with the
x1 yoga starting at 1500 the ThinkPad x1
tablet starting at 950 follows in March</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
