tuned into the 44 show on CNN TV I'm
Jeff Bakalar I'm Joseph kaminski and I'm
Justin you this is the show where is
this look infected I don't know you're
gonna be viable and by this we mean your
whole face dude I you know the weather
is getting warmer yeah I had an allergy
attack over the weekend that left me
paralyzed you have to understand that
when the seasons change and the Sun
actually comes out in the sky Jeff's
entire being is affected right like his
skin every year my body seems to reject
it more I know so the the side effects
are so much more severe you have to
worry about like sunburn on your school
have to worry about internal allergies
messing up your what like all your your
nasal cavity I can't breathe my eyes are
not be you're not meant for this world
no I don't think humans are meant for
this world or something's trying to get
rid of us yeah it's like the happening I
don't know man do you guys don't suffer
from allergies I do i do I like I said
earlier I used to be allergic to cats
but I don't think I'm allergic to them
anymore so that one count that that was
it although I asked anything that's
anything I was at the Rockstar Games
offices on Friday may had a cat I just
realized that but that's I mean I mean
we always said I know that you're
allergic I'm over my apartment your eyes
yeah let's put that lasts for 12 seconds
right this has been happening to me for
like five days I could barely speak
sometimes you're crazy that's like
that's crazy that what should i do what
should i do dr. Kaminsky what should you
do what should you do arm I prescribe a
room with an air filter air conditioner
giddy and a dozen of your favorite video
games yeah I need a one-way trip to the
North Pole is what I mean I they need to
stop going outside it's ice bad and you
know I want I think about him like man
if I was still living in suburbia with
my parents with the trees and the grass
right I'd be in a hospital you're lucky
that you live somewhere where there's
even one tree you're talking about these
single tree at the apartment 1a whole
tree out yeah my since I've lived in New
York City Oh haven't seen a tree in four
years remember what that looks like I
find the one tree that's just making me
just disable blowing leaves into your
face it's just terrible so do you start
sneezing and whooping and coughing
during cripples no i don't why why well
just know the trees Christmas trees pine
trees I would recommend that you move to
the west coast but California's dealing
with smog and you probably wouldn't get
used to that F goes just goes the Radio
City Kan went to see the big train
passes out is also why i love winter so
much people are like all you love the
coal because there's no there's no
allergies right there's no bugs that i
agree i plug I don't like getting bit
the logs are that well you got you got
that sweet blood I guess I do notice i
don't know maybe maybe like a you know
they like that kettle tonic blood i
don't know near me you know that's just
yeah that happens yeah yeah yeah so
Joey's here today to help us out thanks
for being here Joey thank you for having
me guys uh not too much news over the
weekend South by Southwest is alive and
kicking yeah um we're we're not there
for the record not in Texas right now
Bridget Carey was there though I saw a
video this morning of her witnessing a
eating competition with takeru kobayashi
just this video i did on there what were
they eating i forgot it was uh yet it
was i heard about the video I'll I
didn't see it it was it a hot dog eating
competition that is nobody's known for
yeah he is he also does something else
though wait I'm sorry he ate 13 grilled
cheeses and set the record at South by
Southwest that's a lot of a new chain
seen it what kind of bread are we
talking I think it was white bread but
it was toasted which makes a big
difference apparently it was for uh it's
for a record setter calm okay and his
company called group me which is like
group text messaging it's like a startup
that was happening at South by Southwest
this year and there was a competition he
beat the record it was like 13 grilled
cheeses and uh forget how long in 60
seconds Wow yeah 60 seconds that's 26
pieces of bread 13 slices of American
cheese that's a lot look at this guy
he's pretty jacked yeah and then they
have the traditional yellow coat grilled
cheese officiating yeah on either side
of him announcing so did you imagine
could you imagine i were there with them
they'd be like oh that you know they
everybody expect the fat guy to win a
blue
I know why you keep saying that I mean
people listen to the video are gonna
think that you're actually fat you know
none of that guy you're not fat you have
no clear big dude like a big stature
yeah you can mess you could be like a
offensive lineman but yeah if I looked
at you I wouldn't be like that guy's
effect yes well I'd be scared too you've
a solution of the show God or the show
where Joe thinks he's fat that's the
show top you ya body dysmorphia man yeah
man relax you look great you're looking
in some fun house mirrors what nobody
when you do that you're like you know
Jimmy you're not coming ya got there I'm
literally but so like tickling myself
all justin is doing is moving his shirt
yeah oh you're doing all you're doing is
massaging your intestine yeah I
literally got a finger through my stuff
yeah we actually have some you know
respectable guts I think right well that
actually winter weight to you know it
sure is coming up you can be running
around it's always your body naturally
hibernates a little bit of ever played
ball in over a month lets you just got
back from a cruise dude that's why I
have they 20 pounds that's what's a lot
but that's why I feel so bad cuz ya IM
like like 14 15 pounds yeah totally
understandable yeah all right speaking
of losing some weight good good the xbox
the new xbox perhaps losing a little bit
of weight the next go-around there are
rumors and none of this is necessarily
true or or confirmed by Microsoft but
there are rumors that the next Xbox call
it 720 call it whatever the hell you
want to call it maybe it's not going to
have a disk drive an actual physical
media disk drive instead opting for
nothing but oh maybe like a solid state
drive but nothing but digital downloads
for the next generation ago Joey I want
to hear you sigh everything about this
what do you think about this I don't
like it why is that I don't like because
you know what all right first of all
it's bad enough now with the Xbox as it
is with the hard drive that if you were
to get another replacement Xbox that
you'd have to go through some loops and
hoops just to get your data to the
network that have you done that I
haven't theta not that bad well it's not
as easy like even a ps3 you can't take
your hard drive move oh yeah everybody
want you to cloud save your data right
I'm not all for giving everything to
everyone else
and me paying for don't you think that
the next version will streamline that
process even more well is the thing all
right let's say I don't want to pay for
xbox live now now what I can't buy a
game uh it's a good question i would
imagine for people who uh you know for
people who you're talking about me
holding on to those clouds say like well
not even now that this that well if it's
if it's going to be all dlc right how am
I going to download a game if I can't
get online because I've you can download
stuff being a silver member if you want
to buy only any member well that's your
crazy fault i mean you know but that's
the thing you can't even come on but I
said logic but it doesn't what I'm
saying so you're pushing me into
purchasing the system right now you're
locking me into having to have some type
of on lies and this may not be the case
but there's just me following their
scheme as of now sure now you're forcing
me to pay an annual subscription price
just to play and download games that and
I don't think that's what they're gonna
do okay well hopefully they don't
they're not gonna charge you can't swap
and loan games with friends maybe I
don't want to buy a game anybody's gonna
check it out well demos are your friend
don't worry you don't have to have those
are my friend but you know sometimes you
just want to play a little more through
you just want to swap with a friend well
come on I can't just you know have our
cake and eat it too I mean I mean look
what I had to do this a player on it had
to borrow the whole v10 that's share in
the game but but don't you think that uh
it sort of makes less sense to continue
using physical media in games don't you
think that hard drive space is so cheap
it does but I but the thing is is that
it does make sense but what do you do in
the case of like a call of duty when
that comes out you're killing the
service because everyone's going to
download that game at midnight and you
don't want to see three hours two hours
you don't want to see long download
times for a game that you've been
itching to get your hands on component
so will they be able to give you quick
access to the things you want when you
want if you combine a premium price you
want it when you want it and that's the
nice thing about the physical disk you
get it you pop it in and even those
require some install so you're
downloading then you're probably
installing like how long does it take
from when you initiate this before
you actually get the play well maybe
like Steam where you could preload stuff
right you can download steam allows you
to download games before they come out
you just can't play them till the day I
come out that makes a lot of sense that
would be really good you got imagine and
maybe we're giving them a little more uh
you know confidence then perhaps they
are currently you know are working
through but maybe they will introduce
some sort of pre-loading you know uh and
and is it up there and in Microsoft
defense i have to say every time there
has been an xbox update it has been
tremendously faster than n ps3 update
it's like boom boom boom you mean you
know so it's always been most pose my
figure me what you question I've got the
red ring of death on xbox so that lets
you know I really never I've never read
we have an original one I have the
second generation your we were the one
you know the one before with the hdmi
before the you sir and look at me in the
eyes yes I the first person I've ever
known to not have a red ring I'm serious
yeah yeah Xbox how widespread and
pervasive it was reinstated I was gonna
ask you guys what do you think about
people that have bought 360 games that
won't be able to play them on this news
well there's no first off let's let's
what about I mean like there's an issue
of backward compat sure and bring up a
good point let's in let's take a pause
there number one I don't believe this
yeah I think they will have a drive I
think this I think the story's BS yeah
but uh you make a good point if it does
in fact eliminate the dist they you know
I'm with you yeah I think people will
still want to play 360 games especially
this current generation has gone on
longer than anybody thought it would
write the xbox is going on seven years
old yeah okay so there are a lot of
games that that are still out there that
people want to play and the next
generation will definitely you know have
people wanting to have that backwards
compatibility right I don't know how
that's going to work maybe you'll be
able to somehow hook up your 360 to this
new one and sort of rip the game on to
it I don't know yeah like on to the
solid state drive I don't know how it's
going to work but they got to figure out
a way to do that because I think perhaps
backwards compatibility wasn't as big of
an issue as it was from the ps2 to ps3
generation
right feel like it's going to be bigger
now because of how widespread how big
this generally talking seven years of
games yeah i mean like xbox is gonna one
all said and done they're gonna have
like 700 games in the library or so
maybe even more i think another reason
for this long lifespan just because i
don't think people are ready to buy a
new console sure you know the economy i
mean it took how long for people even
start buying ps3 yes they took a while
took about this every years to get it
because i remember we used to go to
events and they would demo a lot of the
games on xbox you wouldn't even see
ps3's there was only like maybe like a
couple years back right started seeing
ps3 and xbox is running side by side
Brett demonstrating the game's not to
mention the fact that a lot of frames
per second were better because
developers had more time to write and
learn the right for the xbox and ps3 so
I think right now it's just a major
point for them because you have
developers who know how to utilize the
hardware they not a right for and it's
like writing in their sleep now you
introduce a new platform how long will
that adoption factor take place with
people buying and developers being able
to write for it and so for this it's a
lot it is a lot again I cannot stress
this enough it's this is probably you
know it song cover we don't know if this
is true when the news first came out
late last week it was like this is a
fact and obviously Microsoft not
confirming or denying anything but of
course III 23rd 2012 will really
probably shed some light on the next
generation especially the wii u i I
can't see Microsoft having a press
conference and not at least mentioning
the fact that they're working on
something new i think the cult the code
name is durango or something like that
dodge drag it's not it's not an SUV but
uh perhaps they'll they'll touch on this
yeah um either way definitely exciting
stuff I want to talk to you Joey
specifically about a little game called
mass effect 3 have you played it at all
I mean what's your deal you're laughing
at me like I'm some little kid what's
the deal I'm not laughing at you like a
little kid it's I I don't even know this
I can't even believe it myself I am the
last game i've actually played and
finished was Arkham City wow I have not
played a game I've been meaning to get a
pickup unchartered I just never did I've
been meaning to pick up SX SX SX right I
never did
I don't know my xbox is even hooked up I
like last sucked on my xbox at a living
room TV so my son can play Disneyland
connect I'm in ladies and gentlemen I am
yeah I'm shocked I wish I could freeze
my live account because it's just going
to waste right now Justin do you believe
this I mean this is a guy you go on ps3
network and look all I know I haven't
seen your gamertag this is crazy what so
now are you blaming this because you're
a father or what does oh no I'm not I'm
not blaming it on anything like that I
just I don't know just things have
changed i mean i mean i had the vita i
had the VTOL weekend I didn't even play
it what the heck's man it's still in the
bag what it's the video game days behind
you are you actually what are you doing
now it sounds like that dude what's are
you sick no no I go through these phases
where i get really really intense and I
step away just as of late it just been
more and you know here's another thing
i've i've actually considered just today
I was like I wonder if they sell out
beepers I was actually thinking about
putting my cell phone to rest for a
little ways that is Eliza man who had to
buy a second belt to put his bolsters
our joke it was a bandolier that he put
over this like a sack you seriously
always have the latest cellphone despite
having the four previously your the
cellular commando yeah for time out miss
you this is a guy that had Gary yeah
that's really this is really updated evo
and then an EVO 3d too yes the beer dude
there comes a time we just I just say
I'm done with it i just got a man just
taking a break but every now and then
cuz you know it just feels so good to be
free when when i was when i was on that
cruise it felt so good yeah not to be
reachable no he's right it's like more
times unless your phone rings it's it's
someone that wants something and i'm not
saying i'm opposed to doing favors
looking out for people but it you
associate such a bad feeling with it
that you don't really enjoy it like you
used to write like you know I used to
love playing games online and then all
of a sudden they introduced the headset
with you know with the consoles and
totally hated it because I'd be online
with either some ignorant person on the
other end or some rowdy little kid and
discuss cus cus it's with you what you
start associating things with that
really attorney from and I think
my phone rings so much your texts from
just like oh yeah you don't like you
know what I'd rather not and the only
reason why I'd even consider be but I
would even do that is because I am a
father and I go if they need to reach
mean regards on my son other than that
or my mother cuz you huh right so I'm
like you know like I'm just like done
this is this is I know how that feels i
remember before i got my iphone 4s i was
working with a pay-as-you-go flip phone
is really nice to only be able to accept
text messages there were no beeping
notifications for facebook stuff no
Instagram is great I I went through the
same thing just recently at in the
Dominican Republic being completely
detached right didn't even and there's
something of weird about leaving your
your room without your phone because I
don't know if you do that the thing that
i do when i leave my parts like the
whole slap check yes slap slap slap
solid oh yeah so 23 slap thing its keys
wallet phone right lap slap slap and I
was just doing one slap I didn't even
carry my wall I just had my room key you
did laughing yourselves just one slap I
was wearing my thing around I was
rocking my room key around my neck it
was like the perfect thing to yeah uh
look I can't you know uh insult you or
blame you for wanting to have some sort
of leave of absence from the electronic
world in gaming but go back to mess I do
really think mass effect 3 is worth
talking about it really talked about it
already my opinion the best the best
game in the year that's not saying much
the the years only about two and a half
months old but mass effect 3 is such an
unbelievable accomplishment Ackerman has
like the shirt and we should go take it
does he yeah I don't I don't care we
should just take it he's not gonna we're
just gonna sit this office and collect
us yeah he'll probably would've what
kind of shirt does he have yeah the one
to n seven on it yeah and ever given as
a jacket came with a yellow jacket as
well that's cool yeah and here's the
slim ps3 case that okay it lights up it
goes on a ps3 I like the vault there
yeah yeah interesting man I didn't
realize this but Clint Mansell did the
soundtrack for Matsui he's the same guy
who did uh was that one movie there's a
clint mansell and the kronos quartet
it's like the one about a heroine yeah i
was reading something about that i was
like a cure movie Oh William yeah he did
the requiem for a dream score as well
that's crazy yeah but yeah is the score
really very good the game look very good
everything Sam the score the evening you
know and games really haven't reached a
level of this consistently at least yeah
just even the acting it's really really
good unbelievable and compelling right I
love it oh I think I'll try it I think
mass effect 3 is able to create a
science fiction universe uh that I
actually give a crap about and that's
saying a lot I feel like I care more
about mass effect than I do Star Wars
you know what star wars they just milk
it so much it's like jeez Lucas let it
go I mean they released a blu-ray one
and into this day and I've discussed
this before they didn't release the
original the original format like Ram
you know they have the edited version on
the blu-ray but it's not the original
original release right which I remember
telling was my son's mother some years
younger than me that you know when I was
a kid they used to play the Ewok song on
z100 really yes I didn't know that yak
bak mei li z 100 but the thing is within
the with the windows in the remake of
the movie yeah they replaced that all I
kind of like a tribal music and a little
beat which is pool too but huh I kind of
wanted to hear I also i would love for
my son hear the song too yeah you know
are gonna praise they used to play that
on the radio yeah and it was that's what
a phenomenal movie that was not like you
know what a phenom I want a major point
like a major point yeah at that time and
you just can't share it with anybody
could they edited out and I gotta go
like look for VHS times like Star Wars
that's a bummer honey Jeremy's asking me
about connect and how that incorporates
to the 360 version uh it's mostly
useless but it's cool though because
there are certain things that you could
do with it that perhaps save you some
time okay I didn't realize but there is
a quick save button you just hit the
back button and it saves but you could
also say quick save and the ganger saves
whenever you want that's really cool
also Shepherd can carry five weapons and
if you want to switch from one class to
the other you can't just hit a button
you have to hold down the wheel and then
do it if you just
say sniper rifle he'll pull out a sniper
rifle you just say you know assault
rifle so instead of like having to go
from each one I think you save a couple
maybe like half a second by saying it
out loud other than that the kinect
incorporation is not that great i mean
it's good for giving out commands like
if you're playing with like liara and
she's in your squad you can say liara
assault I'm like you can have her equip
certain things without navigating to the
wheel so it's sort of like a preference
thing how's that any different from
having like a microphone in the you know
I'm just saying it what do you mean like
having the mic plugged into the the
controller just saying it and no Mike
why I mean what what does the kinect
bring that a microphone wouldn't bring
oh that but it brings that functionality
you can't I don't think you can put that
what I'm saying but that's something
they can incorporate into my crew show
me so my whole point is like you need
like this hundred plus dollar peripheral
right just I was until out sniper rifle
when they could just like you know it's
a kind of kind of guy gimmicky when you
just kind of put a mic and it's like
okay sniper rifle yeah but I think this
is I mean know about this nobody should
buy kinect just for mass effect 3 how
about that does it use the camera at all
in the guitar not that I'm aware of no
maybe this I don't think so I couldn't
tell you because I have because his is
in the exit I still have the first ps3
as well it's long line at the first ps3
and blowing them on let me get that off
you you're not using it oh that thing is
broken I'm just you broke no it's still
it's still there I think probably got
more like a hair in it than not when
you're so much dust that's so gross I
guess what it's yours hahaha keep it
pawn shop seriously alright what else we
got going on oh man so we talked about
South by Southwest a little earlier and
I wish this were a joke it's not a joke
there's a marketing company out of South
by Southwest this year called bartle
bogle hegarty what their experience
menting with something called homeless
4g hotspots that is exactly what the
name sounds like n denotes so basically
they're giving 4g hot spots to homeless
people around the austin texas area and
this is like why should examine the
marketing experiments bigger screen
Bumfights pretty much it you can stream
whatever you want so they're giving
these 4g hot spots to the homeless guys
along with a t-shirt that reads i am a 4
gee hot spot on it do they get any more
they get all the money that people pay
to get access that 4g hotspot username
and password in Fergus but they forget
that I now need to hang out near home
exactly so they're encouraging people to
sit down next these homeless people pay
them for access and then you know do
whatever work you need on your laptop
right next to them and then a person can
also Panhandle why the yeah I became
itself by they're saying that it's gonna
encourage social interaction with
homeless people whereas when you're
passing by you just give them like a
dollar change or ignore them right you
know they're inviting a five-second
interaction yeah now you actually have
to sit down next to them in order to
work you want to do are they like
background check these people at all
there's a reason why some some of them
yeah some of them are homeless due to
certain circumstances I'm sorry for that
similar homeless for other reasons and I
mean you can't just give one I totally
don't you i can imagine homeless people
just being like i could either sit here
all day and hang out with these like
really overly wealthy people who can
afford four chances or i could just sell
this whole thing for like thirty dollars
the first guy that'll buy it off me I
just don't think it's nice that we're
essentially bumf I yeah I mean we're
like we're just sorry I don't mean to
say that you're like I just think it's
not i think we're using these people as
like guinea pigs yes no it's really a
humiliating right you know like hey all
will for whatever reason you're homeless
time for us to exploit your your sort of
mobility it's totally dehumanizing to
say i am a 4g hotspot as opposed to
being like i'm operating or i'm running
about hi i'm in person teens ya ask me
about a 4g hotspot you know like i am
it's really really d human oh where are
they gonna where they're gonna charge
these things up that's I don't know I
don't know their solar beam is garlic
it's not like it's not like people are
gonna let these people walk into an
establishment and just plug it in right
right I don't know I don't know if let's
get two voice mails or something cuz
that's a totally Bellhorn show to love
well like that but before we get to that
speaking of South by Southwest everyone
knows our our old friend Caroline
McCarthy's probably out there yeah it
was it up with her instagrams into
Twitter followers and whatever she does
but she's gonna be on the 404 soon Oh
no way yes II boogie when he gets back
when she gets back that's gonna be fun
so definitely look forward to it's been
forever I can't wait to see her and give
her a big hug total that'll be a lot of
fun uh but for now let's get to some
calls from the public time to show the
love 86 404 scenic he calls from the
public time a little nervous let's just
get to that one right away yeah Jeff
warned me about a kind of a hateful
voicemail we're not hateful well
critical it's just like it's just
pre-written you don't mean yeah he's
just reading off something which means
you put a lot of thought into it I
appreciate that he showed the love I
mean any time he's just like hey i don't
know let's just get let's just let's
like try and and and civilly sort of
discuss this and see how we can move on
let's have some fun with this one is
that fun with it all right you don't let
Joey have fun just and I'll actually
deal with it hi I'd like to point out
that it's rather ignorant of you to
consider it the iPad announcement a
minor upgrade name because of the
unchanged form factor lots of people
would consider 4G LTE and the retina
display to be significant changes and
the 5 megapixel camera makes the camera
actually usable regardless of whether
you approve of I've had photography I
respect your right to have your own
opinion regarding the announcement but
as the only daily podcast on cnet I hope
for a more balanced analysis without
listen you guys are like a two-legged
stool what's more ridiculous is your
discussion of AT&amp;amp;T 4G on iOS 5.1 4G has
been loosely defined for a while now
t-mobile is called hspa+ their 4g
network forever but you just now get mad
cuz Apple has complied with a PM cheese
marketing scheme and just gonna have the
nerve to say that apple claims his phone
now get 72 megabits per second Apple
clearly did not have been LTE ship in
your phone while you were sleeping and
yes I know and intend to exercise my
right to unsubscribe ok ok I wrote I
wrote some point I recognize this guy's
voice he sent us video voicemails before
I see yeah I member he sent us one video
voicemail woman oh we're taking the
beanie that I was wearing well that's
nice but he's very calculated I
appreciate him writing this down and
read preparing this because
clearly didn't just spurt that off the
dome if he did right I'm terrified of
him number one let's address this point
by point we were making week now we were
not smacking on we weren't really
jabbing at the iPad because it didn't
have a new form factor I think that's
okay if the new ipad doesn't it doesn't
have a new pizza like what half a
millimeter thicker whatever the hell it
is I did bring that up that I thought
there's Riley hardware case refresh that
would've been nice but it wasn't a deal
for sure no I'm not buying it because it
looks the same as an ipad 2 how about
that it has the iphone 4s camera though
it's like it's not even the 4 s's care
much the fours how is that true it's
what it's a 5 megapixels in the forest
like eight well megapixels don't mean
understood but I'm sucking where the
lenses are different there are some
changes to it but I'm speaking in terms
of like what apple doesn't continue to
do when everybody gets all nasty about
it is they could have made the ipad 2
with the retina display they could have
made the ipad 2 with this camera they
intentionally leave things out and i
think people get upset when people point
that out it's not like the technology
wasn't there it costs them roughly about
three hundred and ten dollars per ipad
16 gig with the 4g chip in so they're
still making a significant profit right
now not as much as they did on the
previous generation but they're still
making money okay so you know it just it
just tends to make that's what upsets me
I'm not saying they don't put out great
products you don't want to own it's just
very annoying that what you know when
people are waiting for the to that thing
on the retinas going to be in there
thinking that like everybody thought the
4s is going to be the 5 and you just
don't get it the next year you get 25
that's what's frustrating what people
expect something you dangle it like it's
going to be that and you give them
something else right totally pumped Sri
they didn't put Syrian this one why not
yeah you know I'm sorry good no no I'll
i like to hear what you're here i don't
necessarily disagree i think the biggest
sort of let down was perhaps the iphone
4s announcement more so than the ipad
right Newt the new iPad ok so then he
goes on about the 5 megapixel camera
says that's still usable even though
it's you know like taking a picture with
a book great I stabilization given that
look I'm not I I and I came and said
that the camera in the 4s is the best
cell phone camera out there and now it's
almost all of it is in the iPad yeah
still not okay though yes it does it
could have been in the other one and it
could have been you know and it's not
okay because it's not practical people
don't want to take can't put all photos
with a tablet it's silly right have it
for skype you have it for stuff like
that I space or things like FaceTime
yeah exactly exactly my resolution so he
goes on and says well we're the only
daily podcast we should be unbiased well
guess what the real world doesn't work
like that okay don't get me wrong I say
we never claimed to be unbiased I and I
think I'm and look I don't you know like
to brag about anything something that
yeah I consider myself one of the most
indifferent unbiased bats that's what
our job is here right we have to be
completely indifferent no biased but and
I think we maintain that Apple isn't the
the end all you know Messiah also not
the official cell phone reviewers of
scenic tours we have so of course would
be limit by space on the products that
we personally owned you know I have an
iPad well thing is what a lot of people
feel understand is also we come at it
from their perspective as well how many
people want to go out and I have a 64
gigabyte ipad with me right now Wi-Fi
how many people want to go out every
year and drop seven hundred dollars
right you just don't want to do it so of
course you're gonna get upset because
these are features that aren't new porgy
is not new right though it's not as fast
as it should be it's not new and they
make you wait and they make you wait and
they like to him I gotta gotta 4g if I
waited here but no but the two was great
i should have got and that's where the
anger comes towards it because yeah an
annual upgrade and it's not an expensive
one and it's not necessarily a want I
mean she's not necessarily need it's a
one I think a lot of people also have a
tough time waiting two years to buy an
ipad I think there's like this
psychological a sort of thing that Apple
is able to do to people in this office
included that they don't care right they
have to do with their there's some sort
of synapse that triggers in their brain
that says you know what this is the new
thing I just spent over and paid 700
bucks last year because I got don't get
me wrong you sell your ipad back you
make some of the money back but again
that you're never netting you're never
netting you never even telling people
that just because this new
ipad came out last week doesn't mean
that your ipad 2 and who I a pre a week
prior doesn't mean that thing's a piece
of garbage now no I this weekend uh I
was after my brother's birthday I had
half a dozen people do I get the new one
and I said look if you're paying for it
and you want the most bang out of your
book I'm telling people get the two if
you do i'd say you shouldn't even get
and I the new iPad if you still have the
first one if you have an iPhone 4s you
know like this that's that's a peasant
that's like a point I said Maya my
scheme is I'm just going even 246 number
2 i'll go for i'll go sickles the floral
the floral have the retina it'll have an
even better camera right and that's when
I and that's and they'll have apps ideal
for the three by then share the new iPad
which will run smoothly on the force
that what we call the new to old Apple
to you for free we was talking about the
4g right before juicing brings up yeah
last week we're talking about how 15.1
rolled out the day after the keynote a
lot of people started seeing 4g pop up
next to the bars on their iphone 4s
which is definitely not running 4G LTE
that's still in the hspa+ brain that
that to me is deceptive and obviously
the next one is I'm gonna assume is
going to come out with official 4G LTE
it's deceptive but it's not right now so
why does it say it we are taking a
bigger issue with with the industry
right nomenclature torn or one the
industry's nomenclature and to the
arguable fact that Apple's appears to be
taking advantage of like right you know
I mean I don't of what and that's
another that's another good point to
bring up I mean and let's take a look at
this from an apple perspective Apple
wouldn't would never really given they
shouldn't have a 4g product out I think
that was like one of the things that
uses a seller because apples not known
for putting something out until it's
vastly available right you know first
iPhone was edged it wasn't even 3g sure
then the next one was 3g three is so
forth so to even see one with 4g in it
it's kind of Apple saying hey come on we
gotta we gotta entice these people to
buy this product right cuz 4g is not
widely available every just came to New
York last year exactly well you know it
is not in I think that you're talking
about only right now and verizon AT&amp;amp;T
right so who knows where what small
areas are small markets
even have 4g I just I hate misleading I
hate I hate companies who mislead and
and do it deliberately yeah you they're
doing it with the 4g thing popping up to
the layperson they're like oh my god my
phone's faster now right and I need to
get most people don't know the specific
speed differences betray or exactly
regular friend I'm kind of getting sick
of these Syrians was like this couple
traveling traveling from New York to
California yeah and it's like Oh what do
you do you think there's a gets thing
like the guy that learns to be a rock
right there cutting things short me rock
are tightening that whole sequence
they're tightening that have you noticed
that yeah they definitely are taking
steps out of that entire process that so
yeah so that's that's the next question
now so there's no sirree in the ipad or
the new ipad will it be in the fourth
one I mean that's tough and that's
something that will make and then you
know next year if we have this
discussion that something will bash it
on again because so we'll say why wasn't
Siri in the third generation and it had
to be held over to the fourth yeah I
mean you're the camera in the fourth
well sure you're right call me a rock
god Jessica I just learned to play one
song right he's not a rock he's a
pop-rock guys like okay I'll call you
rock you know there's an app within the
app store you can download in the iphone
on any generation iphone even the ipad
called EV it sounds like Siri you can
ask it questions to it goes to a
different server and it responds evi it
works just as well 99 cents no it's not
it's not see rebut it's like Siri okay
for those who desperately want their
device to talk back to them right so
we're talking back I do like the fact
that the listener criticized for sure
voices opinions about what we think on
the show and it you know a lot I don't
expect everybody to agree with this but
I like that people will call in and call
us out yeah Usher casa I hope he doesn't
unsubscribe because of that cuz I know
he's been with us for a while yeah he
was he was he's just a little hot right
he threatened I think he says but that's
a good but you bad no but that lets you
know how and bias you guys are because
you asked for sure is what you could
have been buried and never had right
ready played it are we legless tripod is
that what he called us he called us a
two-legged stool
I've sat on plenty of two-legged stools
with no problem whatsoever r in many a
unicycle very comfortably it works fine
lunar cycles are the best yeah arguably
the best really a biped yeah that's a
real a bike we got to get out of here
