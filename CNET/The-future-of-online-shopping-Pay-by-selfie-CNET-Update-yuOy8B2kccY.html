some duct tape I'm Bridget Carey this is
your C net update when passwords can be
easily compromised perhaps the safest
way to shop online is by using a selfie
to pay that's the idea behind amazon's
latest patent it filed a patent
application for a process to let
shoppers make a purchase by taking a
photo or video of themselves it's just
another type of biometric password to
prove it's really you but the concept
isn't new right now you can unlock a
Windows 10 computer by living its scan
your face and MasterCard has also begun
using selfies to validate online
purchases in some countries so how do
you stop someone from just pointing the
phone camera at an old photo or video of
your face well Amazon would tell you to
blink smile or move your head at a
certain time to prove you are a real
human soon we may be in a world where
we're too lazy to type in a password in
fact there are many tech companies out
to help those of us that are too lazy to
do all sorts of things take eBay for
example eBay announced a partnership
with the app ship that's spelled SH YP
sellers in certain US metro areas can
request someone from ship to come by in
20 minutes and pack and Mail sold items
normally ship charges five dollars for
the service but the fee is waived for
eBay users until the end of June eBay is
facing a ton of competition from other
apps that want to make it easy to sell
your stuff like Poshmark urinal Listia
and offer up to name a few so the battle
is now over which service can make it
easiest for you to sell stuff eBay's
ship partnership is only for New York
Chicago San Francisco and Los Angeles
for now and because we're too busy with
online shopping and selfies we have no
time for household chores so iRobot the
makers of the Roomba have come out with
a brand new tiny mopping robot that can
get into the nooks and crannies of your
kitchen bathroom and other hard to reach
places on hard floors
it's the Bravo jet 240 and it's a step
down from the previous model because it
covers a smaller area and it can really
run one room at a time it uses pre-mixed
detergent in disposable pads is only
$200 making it the cheapest robot
cleaning machine ever released by the
company another reason though why it's
so cheap is that you'll have to charge
the battery yourself it's like a
motorized Swiffer it does dry sweeping
damp sweeping and wet mopping if you're
interested hang tight for us to do some
testing on it for the full review but
you'll start to see it in stores in
April that's it for this tech news
update you can head to cnet.com for more
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
