today is senior editor Scott Stein who
has just completed a massive review of
the best ipad games and I checked out
your list quite hard to boil down to 30
yeah I imagined it would be I went
through them and you can probably fit
more than half in the category of
strategy and puzzles so over the years
where have you seen ipad games really
shine and fall flat well you got me I
like strategy and puzzle games on the
ipad but the reason is that i think when
you started out and the ipad wasn't a
big phenomenon yet you had a lot of
iphone ports and you're holding a thing
in your hand you've got virtual buttons
it's easier in your hands like this to
tilt and so it was easy to bring over to
the ipad and look like that you got more
room for those virtual buttons but
they're harder to find I find tilting
and lifting the iPad a little more
annoying not that it doesn't have some
great you know versions out there games
like driving games and flight games if
you want to experiment with that but I
think the best games i've seen are the
ones that take advantage of the puzzle
elements the ones that use all of your
fingers and and that large screen and
almost more like pc games i think Angry
Birds sealed the deal as far as the
games that you see most likely on the
store are going to be puzzle games
affordable puzzle games so it tends to
be that those are the majority of games
that you see out there on the app store
makes sense to put it on a table and
play because how many times do you want
to lift that whole thing up to you know
steer or something yeah I think like for
a few novelty games I mean especially
they're just a couple of bucks each you
may want to experiment with a couple but
I find that the the rewards are limited
for those now we're at the
third-generation iPad where you have the
high-resolution Retina display is that
really adding a lot to the game
experience at this point not a huge
amount but I almost think that's by
design you know sort of like the
nintendo 3ds doesn't really use 3d all
the time there's a bad example but you
know the the ipad 2 is out there and
it's out there at the same time as the
IV the 3rd gen ipad something a lot of
developers are making games that take
advantage of both but also those
graphics you know at retina display if
you're going to play 3d quality graphics
like shooters first-person shooters and
racers it's hard to get those graph
at Retina display you can even do that
on a laptop so largely the games that
take advantage of it the best tend to be
ones with static images board games 2d
games not that there aren't some games
like airmail sky gamblers which our
flight games you know real racing to
some of them really show off that Retina
display and you'd like to see it in all
games but it's not it's not essential
now let's talk price because app games
on the ipad are known to be pretty cheap
you can get them for five dollars or
less but you pointed out that sid
meier's pirates if that was on a pc it
would cost at least twice as much so is
this culture of keeping the prices low
discouraging these game developers from
making better games and getting more
money for them we look at some meier's
pirates and that's a bet is a pc game
that got ported over and that you know
it's also been on consoles and the touch
controls are really nice on it I think
people think about making good big games
and then pricing them the way they want
to price them then I think you end up
with you know maybe some some higher
quality games not that there aren't
great games priced at just a dollar but
I think maybe some developers take the
attitude of almost going scattershot
making a lot of small low-budget games
for a dollar each throwing them out
there see if one goes viral and then
you're also starting to see a lot of
these games with in-app purchases you
know a dollar here two dollars there and
I think that's an unfortunate trend I
you know I think if you price a game
well you let the market figure it out
you have hit that sweet spot maybe
promote it for a while at a lower price
but you can definitely capable making
great games on an iPad I think it's all
about the mentality of is it worth it
for the price that you're going to
charge now tablets and touchscreen
gaming is its own genre now thanks to
the iPhone the iPad you're seeing it in
the next Nintendo Wii U with the
controller has a touchpad you're seeing
Apple saying that you're going to be
able to take your ipad game and pour it
to your television Microsoft's going to
be teasing with this too or you have two
screens now in your tablet gaming
environment the controller is evolving
or we're going to be seeing better
tablet games because of this push I
think you will because a lot of games
are involving touch now
the nintendo DS started it you had the
touch with the stylus and then you saw
iphone games and ipad games now you've
got microsoft with SmartGlass you've got
the Nintendo Wii U which is a very
different concept but it also has touch
the PlayStation Vita has touch almost
all smartphones tablets you have Windows
8 computers coming out with touch so I
think so many devices are going to have
touch that it's inevitable that game
developers are going to think in terms
of that and so it's going to create
better games with touch and probably a
lot more across platform games great
point Scott thank you for seeing it I'm
Bridget Carey thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
