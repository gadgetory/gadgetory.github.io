iPhone Microsoft wants bots to replace
apps and everything else you need to
know the great privacy battle between
the FBI and Apple has been called off
for now and a court filing the US
Department of Justice said the FBI was
able to break into the encrypted iphone
5c of the San Bernardino terrorists and
no longer needed to go to court to force
Apple to build a back door but there are
still many questions about what happened

iphones all the government will reveal
is that it got help from an outside
party meanwhile Microsoft showed off its
progress with artificial intelligence

or order a pizza just as long as
companies are building BOTS to handle
such requests for Cortana to carry out
at the annual BUILD conference microsoft
says chatting with a bot inside of skype
or with Cortana is the future rather
than opening an app for every task we

be used in applications to help blind

them or read people's expressions and

crazy for Tesla's next electric car and
thousands of people waited in line to
pre-order it even before knowing what it
looked like or what it could do in the
first 24 hours more than 180,000 people
