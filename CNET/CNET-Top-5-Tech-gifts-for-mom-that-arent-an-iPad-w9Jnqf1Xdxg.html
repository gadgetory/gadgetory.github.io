Cooley with my annual top five standing
gig the top five tech gifts for Mother's
Day
now before we start I am assuming that
you already got your mom or your wife or
yourself an e-reader a tablet of some
sort or a smartphone if not then do not
pass go just yet I mean a kindle
preloaded with 50 shades of grey always
gonna be a winner iPad or Kindle Fire
no-brainer smartphone must-have but that
list gets kind of old so I put together
a list of five other ideas that I know
will be a hit with the ladies well for
other ideas and one smartphone coming in
at number five the Nokia Lumia 900 just
in case she doesn't have a smartphone or
is ready for a new one
I think the Lumia 900 is a stylish and
different kind of choice it's not an
iPhone and it's also not as expensive as
an iPhone it's 99 bucks
it's very good-looking and it's super
easy to use in a way that's great for
new smartphone users plus it's a good
bet that your mom isn't a total app
freak so as long as it has angry birds
I'm good to go and don't worry
it has Angry Birds mom phone coming in
at number four it's the Bose
QuietComfort 15 noise cancelling
headphones my personal favorite thing
right now if your mom is a commuter or
she travels a lot or she just needs some
instant alone time these headphones are
like the new Calgon they take you away
they're comfortable they're active
noise-cancelling tech removes all
outside distraction and they really do
sound amazing and they should their
boats plus they're stylish so you don't
look like a dork but you do give off a
strong leave me alone' vibe perfect
they're not as compact as in ear buds of
course and at 300 bucks they're not
cheap but trust me I just took my first
transatlantic flight with these babies
and I would have paid double for them
it's like your own personal cone of
silence number three on the list
the Jawbone Jambox iPhone and iPod
speaker docks are always a great gift
idea but the jam box takes the concept
to the next level it's a super stylish
little Bluetooth speaker that actually
sounds pretty good it comes in multiple
colors pretty much everyone who sees
this thing falls in love with it and
it's so portable that you can use it
anywhere in the house it's great for
like streaming relaxing music while
you're taking a nice long bubble bath or
out in the garden or even on a weekend
getaway it's not cheap but well I mean
you want mom to feel appreciated don't
you in it number two get her an Apple TV
2 Roku is usually my favorite connected
TV gift but let's face it iTunes has so
much content even Game of Thrones
episodes and then it has all those
movies and Apple TV is so easy to use
and attractive plus it can stream music
video and pictures from an iPhone or an
iPad and it has Netflix and a couple
other video streaming services
especially if you've already bought a
lot of iTunes content this 99 bucks
totally worth it before I get to my
number one mom pick of the year I do
have to give a little advice to keep you
out of trouble
here are some tech gifts not to get mom
this year don't get her a pink gadget no
pink cell phones no pink digital cameras
if you think she wants something cute in
pink
get a cellphone case or a kitten digital
picture frames they're over they're
complicated they're annoying no one ever
updates the pictures on them do not
bother also do not get her a Wi-Fi scale
you shouldn't even have to ask why not
and I'm sure it seems like a good idea
but don't get mom a Roomba you know what
she'd rather have a cleaning lady and
with that let's get to my top pick for
mother's day tech this year the nest
thermostat I know I know a thermostat
sounds like a crazy present but women
are going crazy for this thing CNET
editor-in-chief and mom lindsay
Turrentine gave it a perfect five star
review because why it looks gorgeous in
your house it does these cool little
things like report the weather and show
you exactly how much energy you're using
and these pretty little charts and it's
networked which means you can control
the weather in your own home from your
phone whether you're snuggled under the
covers or in a boring meeting at work
trust me
nest thermostat it's the bomb and you
can install it for her too for bonus
points and that's it for this year
everyone find all the seen at top 5
videos that seen at tv.com and happy
Mother's Day
