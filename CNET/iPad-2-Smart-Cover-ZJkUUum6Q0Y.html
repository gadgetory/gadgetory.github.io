popular though we call Smart Covers for
the original iPad we did a case case is
pretty cool it can prop the iPad up for
typing or for watching movies work
pretty well except that we went to all
this trouble to make a beautiful design
and we cover it up with this case right
but more than that we added thickness
and weight to the product and we made it
more difficult to use with some of the
accessories so we thought we could do
better than this for iPad 2 and we
started from the very beginning to
design the case right alongside the
product and we have done that but it's
not a case anymore it's a cover to cover
the glass it's a smart cover this is
what it looks like and it bends and
folds around just like this as a typing
stand and to watch movies on just like
the the old one looks great with black
looks great with white and it even
automatically instantly wakes up the
iPad from sleep when you open it and
automatically puts the iPad to sleep
when you close it now how is this held
on do we have some screws the screw in
what do we do no we use magnets our
engineering and ID team came up with
this idea of using magnets that grasp it
and auto-align it so it's always in
perfect alignment and I'll show you a
little video this you won't believe it
it's so cool and you can remove it in a
second you can add it in a second it
adds minimal weight and thickness
because it's just covering the top
it's got a microfiber lining that cleans
the screen every time you move it open
it or close it again
it automatically wakes on open puts the
iPad to sleep when you close it it's
really easy to remove or change the
cover so you can have a bunch of them
and pick which cover you feel like today
and easily just put it on and they come
in polyurethane which is used to make
space suits or leather and so I've got a
little video that just shows you how
this thing works and let's run that
video
it's one of my favorite little videos it
actually kind of reminds me of a Pixar
short or something like but as you see
we actually built magnets right into the
iPad itself and then there's magnets in
the hinge for the smart cover and it not
only holds the cover on but it Ottawa
winds it it's really cool and of course
what would these cases be if they didn't
come in colors so we've got five
polyurethane colors and five colors of
leather and they're really really
beautiful they look great with the black
unit they look great with the white unit
the polyurethane cases are $39 the
leather cases are $69 and we think this
is going to we think people are going to
love these cases</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
