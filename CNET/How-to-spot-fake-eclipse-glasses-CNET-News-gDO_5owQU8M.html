or you will fry your eyes with the solar
eclipse approaching proper Eclipse
viewing glasses are in low supply so of
course unsafe fake ones are being sold
Amazon has been pulling counterfeits off
its website and you should be aware of
people selling fakes on the street
during the event it's actually hard to
spot a fake but there are some signs to
look for there are a few reputable
vendors listed as trustworthy from the
American Astronomical Society they are
ones such as this pair made by Eclipse
glasses calm you should check if your
vendors on the safe list also check the
label print it on the side a safe pair
should be labeled with ISO one two three
one two - two it's an international
safety standard for how dark the lenses
are for blocking sunlight and UV and IR
radiation but anyone can print whatever
they want on some paper glasses doesn't
mean it's true right how do you really
know well if you're being sold a fake
pair of shades there is another clue how
much light you can see when you put them
on you shouldn't be able to see anything
except the Sun itself and you can test
it by looking directly at the LED light
of your smartphone you should only be
able to see the bulbs I see two tiny
orange circles surrounded by darkness if
you see any light behind a lampshade
that's not good if there's any haze not
good if it feels uncomfortable bright
not good don't play around with maybes
it could do permanent damage to your
eyesight that you can't feel or notice
right away oh and never use this for
looking at the Sun through a telescope
or camera lens there's a whole other
rulebook for those do research before
playing around with binoculars and
cameras so be safe earthlings
