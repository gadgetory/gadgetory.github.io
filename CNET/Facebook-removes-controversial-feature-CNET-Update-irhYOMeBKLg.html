blackberry and friend some stranger's on
Facebook I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your scene at update blackberry maker
researcher motion has long been
struggling to thrive and turn the
company around with thousands of layoffs
ongoing it could be time for the company
to try something drastic and one report
says researcher motion is considering to
split itself into two companies dividing
the software and messaging network from
the hardware and phone side and it will
sell the hardware division to some
larger tech company this report ran in
the British newspaper The Sunday Times
without any sources named research
emotion didn't comment on the specifics
it just said that it is examining a wide
range of strategies and we're still
waiting to see if that new blackberry 10
operating system can shake things up
it's got a whole new interface and a
touchscreen keyboard that can predict
the next words you're likely to type so
you can type faster that way it'll come
out later this year but there's no
official date yet and when we'll see
those new blackberries Sony is launching
a new google TV set-top box next month
for two hundred dollars the only problem
is that it's google TV sony might have
come out with new hardware but the
google TV software isn't dire need of an
update if you're looking to add some
zing to your home theater setup google
TV still disappoints as you can read in
our full review get ready for a ton of
Google News to drop this week at the
Google i/o Developers Conference the

already seeing leaked specs and images
about the Nexus tablet google plans to
show off documents posted on gizmodo
show of being a 7 inch asus tablet with
android 4.1 jelly bean and NFC support

start at two hundred bucks and the
samsung galaxy s3 which hit us stores
last week could be the hottest phone
this year Samsung is projecting that 10
million galaxy s3's will be sold by the
end of July but it's likely they mean 10
million phone shipped Facebook has taken
down a controversial feature it was
testing on mobile double it you locate
other Facebook users geographically near
you it was called fine friends nearby
and was hidden deep in
app the idea is that if you met someone
at a venue or an event and you wanted to
add them as a friend on Facebook instead
of hunting through names you could just
narrow it down to the strangers near you
and quickly make a friend request
facebook says this wasn't a formal
release it was just a test but another
app has already been doing the same
thing for a year now it's called friend
them the creators of friend them accused
Facebook of stealing the idea and
threatened to sue surely after Facebook
removed the future that's your tech news
