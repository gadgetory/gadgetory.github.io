with nokia in Abu Dhabi checking out for
lumia 1520 smokiest flagship 6 inch
smartphone backing a full HD display and
a quad-core processor the 1520 has a six
inch display which is the larger screen
nokia has so far crammed into a phone
it's quite chunky so if you've got small
hands and might be a problem that
there's loads of room for videos and
photos on there it's fairly slim which
makes it a bit easier to hold and it has
the same polycarbonate design that
you'll find on a lot of Nokia's previous
Lumias sticking out of the back is a 20
megapixel camera which not he reckoned
it's particularly good with a low light
situations like it has also bundled in
some of its new camera software onto
Windows Phone 8 to help you get the most
of it now that screen is full HD that's
1920 x 1080 p which is the highest
resolution we've so far seen on a nokia
phone thanks to a recent updates of
Windows Phone 8 which supports full HD
obviously then everything looks
incredibly crisp and also very bright
and bold nakia reckons which is
particularly good for using in bright
daylight so if you're in california or
here under the bright Abu Dhabi slam it
shouldn't be a problem to see what's
going on joining the latest version of
Windows Phone 8 which crucially has
three rows of tiles on screen it's
really handy on a phone this size as you
can cram a lot more in to see everything
that's going on it's packing inside
Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 800
processor now as a quad-core chip which
is the first quad-core processor we've
ever seen on a Windows Phone device you
can expect things to run a very very
smoothly although there's not a whole
lot in the Windows Phone 8 app store
that's really going to be challenging
that processor just yet anokhi it has
crumbed a 3400 milliamp battery into
this which should keep it ticking along
for a long time now you also find four
microphones around the edge which nakia
at records will help with noise
cancellation as well as get a better
quality stereo recording sound it's got
some impressive specs under the hood and
an impressive 740 dollar price tag due
to go on sale towards the end of the
year make sure to keep it cnet for all
the latest news
oil and this is the Nokia Lumia 1520</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
