I'm Brian Chung and we're here to find
out who's king of the ring for ultra
portable laptops now slim is in when it
comes to tech and what is everyone
looking for a laptop that fits an
envelope of course well we've got both
of them in this week's prize fight it's
a face-off between Apple's MacBook Air
and the Lenovo ThinkPad x300 we've got
five needing green rounds so let's see
who's bringing the heat we're talking
sexiness why does Apple always seem to
win when it comes to the sexy well
because they do it right every time the
MacBook Air at its thinnest point is
0.16 inches a collapsible door reveals
its ports and more importantly the
machine feels solid and sturdy on the
other hand the x300 may fit in an
envelope but it's a tighter fit because
this laptop doesn't taper like the air
does its design remind you of a think
pad and it isn't that ugly in fact its
design is more impressive when it comes
to what they packed inside the macbook
air gets a perfect 5 because we've never
seen anything like it
but the think pad isn't too far off with
the four next round is all about the
display both of these guys are equipped
with 13.3 inch backlit LED displays but
there are a few key differences the x300
uses a matte finish versus the MacBook
Airs
which is glossy and a whole lot more
reflective the ThinkPad also features a
1440 by 900 native resolution and that's
sharper than the air and also gives you
more screen real estate we do have to
point out that Apple's ambient light
sensing screen helps with power
consumption but it's just not enough the
ThinkPad gets the 5 and the MacBook Air
we give it a 4 in this round the X 300
takes this round with a jab and hook
combo and we're even next up we've got
features how many goodies can you pack
in an ultra portable well the MacBook
Air has a lot in its thin frame with
Wi-Fi Bluetooth a full sized backlit
keyboard iSight camera and a single USB
port but what are the big things missing
there's no internal optical drive
no Ethernet port and no removable
battery that just hurts daddy and sure
you can purchase add-ons but who wants
to drag them around
now this is where the ThinkPad shines
and addresses the air shortcomings with
an internal DVD burning drive and a
removable battery it has Wi-Fi bluetooth
a keyboard light and webcam and it adds
w win gps three USB ports and Ethernet
whoo the x300 gets a perfect 5 in this
round and the macbook air gets a 3 the
ThinkPad rocks the air on this round
packing nearly every feature imaginable
but apple's million-dollar baby isn't
seeing stars yet who really flexes their
ultraportable muscle the next round is
performance so let's start off with the
specs of the machines we're comparing
we're using an entry-level MacBook Air
with the 1.6 gigahertz core 2 duo 2 gigs
of ram and the 80 gig hard drive that's
not solid-state now the x300 is rocking
a 1.2 gigahertz core 2 duo with 2 gigs
of ram and a 64 gig solid state hard
drive and a 6 cell battery in our DVD
battery drain test the MacBook Air came
out on top
lasting about 20 more minutes than the X
300 and just getting over the 4 hour
mark
the air also outperformed the X 300 and
our multitasking test and our image
processing test and that's just the
entry-level model the macbook air gets
swole with the 5 and the ThinkPad racks
up before it's still real close with the
X 300 up one these guys have pushed us
to the limit but when it comes down to
it who gives us the best bang for the
buck sure these guys are revolutionary
laptops what we want to know if they're
worth the dough were dropping for them
here's comparison with the machines that
we tested now our beefed-up ThinkPad
ring up to just over 2900 dollars add
120 bucks
if you want the three-year coverage the
base model MacBook Air is about eighteen
hundred dollars and add another 250
bucks for the three-year coverage there
the MacBook Air is about $1,000 cheaper
now let's look at how the pricing
changes if we make the specs comparable
in this price in comparison the upgraded
macbook air reaches $3,200 when you add
on the external DVD Drive and the 64 gig
solid-state drive plus throw in the 250
3-year coverage that's about a $400
difference when you're comparing similar
machines with similar specs now these
ultra portables don't come cheap but if
you want to be groundbreaking eh
sometimes you have to pay bang
breaking prices the ThinkPad gets a 4
and the MacBook Air a 3 tally up the
scores guys and and after throwing them
bows back and forth the final score is
22 to 20 the Lenovo ThinkPad X 300 gives
Apple's MacBook Air the two I ninja poke
you know we have a lot of fun here but
ultimately the final choice between
these two laptops comes down to you
I'm Brian Tong and we'll catch you next
time on another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
