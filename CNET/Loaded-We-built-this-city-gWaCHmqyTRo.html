Natali Morris and it's time to get
loaded the maker is a farmville are set
to launch in cityville farmville is the
game that gained popularity on Facebook
City bill will be a like-minded social
game where you build a city from the
ground up it will be available in
English French Italian Spanish and
German when it launches in the coming
weeks on tuesday Apple announced that
iTunes is the first online music store
to sell the Beatles music apparently the
negotiation was heated according to the
New York Post both Google and Amazon
were bidding for these rights these are
heavy hitters but we don't know how much
money it took for Apple to win the war
I'm guessing a lot 80 now has a mifi it
was the only major cellular carrier that
didn't have one this is a mobile 3g
device that brings you Wi-Fi data over
80 s 3g network the mifi 2372 launches
on november 21st and it costs fifty
dollars with a 100-dollar mail-in rebate
plans start at thirty-five dollars per
month google docs now supports editing
on mobile devices if you're a google
docs power user like most of us here at
cnet you know that editing a Google
spreadsheet on a mobile device is murder
but no more google docs now has been
optimized for mobile on all mobile
browsers including the ipad google has
also made peace in France the company
reached an agreement with the French
book publisher called hatchet live ray
I'm not sure if I'm saying that right
the agreement allows Google to scan
thousands of out of print books for
google books they can sell those books
as ebooks but they have to be
pre-approved by the publisher Google
will share revenue with hatchet but the
revenue share was not disclosed and
finally do you ever stare at a vending
machine wondering what you're in the
mood for now the vending machine will
help you out a Japanese canned drink
machine uses facial recognition to
recommend a drink based on who's
standing in front of it an old man
perhaps a nice ginger ale a young kid
maybe they want a dr. pepper it sounds
ridiculous but apparently sales on those
machines have tripled as a result though
zero headlines for today
see you tomorrow I'm Natali Morris for
cnet.com and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
