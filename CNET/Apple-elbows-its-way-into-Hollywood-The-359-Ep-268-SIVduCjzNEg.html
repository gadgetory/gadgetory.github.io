16th it's episode 268 of the 359 podcast
my name is BVG and we got a full house
today in the house we've got alfred hang
roger chang and there occurs back hey
thanks everybody for joining it is
wednesday my dudes and hello to
periscope we're back on periscope a
periscope
what up why aren't we I'm your cat stop
stop all right
it's been Rubens nudes sake like that's
yeah it's Ben's buddy I'm sticking up
for him I know all right so what are we
talking about Apple making a well
reportedly making a big investment into
Hollywood Google helping you with your
allergies with this pollen detector
which actual rate could need I need I
don't have allergies but yes you're
lucky man and lastly we'll be talking
about our own colleagues Terry Collins
profile on the Kapoor Center for social
impact and how they're making it easier
for women and underrepresented
minorities start their own businesses so
you actually got to meet them yeah
towards themselves so you'll be able to
share some some insight there so as
always if you have any questions leave
them in the comment section and we'll
get to them in three minutes and 59
seconds here we go in three two welcome
to the fusion I'm Roger Chang I'm out
for dang and with this the special guest
Derek Carr
hello how you doing good thanks so no
Apple is getting serious about Hollywood
the companies are poorly set to spend 1
billion dollars over the next year to
fund new shows they could definitely use
the help because right now all we've got
is carpool karaoke and planted the apps
those are all fantastic shows by the way
great will.i.am doesn't make a fool of
himself on the show and the apps aren't
terrible but you know that said that
looked bad maybe their early starts are
a little bit awkward but they they did
hire some TV execs from Sony and you
know billion dollars that's that's a lot
of money to throw out a couple good
shows right
I mean Netflix's budget is like seven
billion dollars that said they also they
also create tons of shows right they
they seemingly have a canoe show every
week it's almost too many shows yeah I
feel like they need to stagger them out
a little bit I mean if they follow the
formula though and create like original
serialized content then maybe you know
Apple will have a hit on its hands but
right now what they're doing is like
it's just gonna be a bunch of reality
show it's rude yeah no sense look I
think I'm looking at it from their
perspective it's probably this was them
tipping they're dipping their toes in
the water
these shows are probably not that
expensive produce but a billion dollars
I mean that's like Game of Thrones money
right do you think that it'll be
available off of Apple TV though or do
you think it'll be an Apple TV exclusive
uh well I don't know it's a question
there's some of the original stuff I
imagine they're gonna try to keep
exclusive right I feel like if they
spend all this money on it though and
they only make it available on Apple TV
that it's really not gonna go anywhere
that's true you're gonna drink the whole
nature of what these shows on Netflix
like did you watch this and right yes
because I have Netflix because it only
cost me $10 a month well he does not
have well without the music oh okay so
you actually watch these shows through
Apple music so they do have I forget how
many subscribers now I mean in the
millions but they could theoretically
license the show's over Cesar yeah so I
mean I think that's how Netflix does it
for some of their stuff I mixed up
Google writing Pollan yeah so if you
have allergies this tool seems like it's
gonna be really useful for you where
when you look up a location on Google
you know it'll tell you the weather
forecast there but now they're adding a
new feature that basically tells you
what the pollen forecast is gonna be
like - okay so you know if you see that
there's a lot of pollen in the area and
you know that you have allergies either
get your medicine out or just don't go
there ya know I'm someone who suffers
from allergies and high pollen counts
that's I never thought to really Google
it so it's kinda nice that they're just
gonna package it all into a single
search yeah Google has been doing that
for a lot of things when you just like
just like small things to add on so
they'll tell you if I look up like a
restaurant it'll tell me how many people
are there at the moment or like how like
what times it gets the most packed what
times is the most empty and that's not
even looking that up like specifically
that's just me looking up the location
of it so they've been adding all these
small things
pollens definitely like one that I
didn't really consider because I don't
really have allergies right yeah totally
useful though alright lastly Terry
Collins has a nice profile of Kapoor
Center for social impact and keyboard
capital the venture capital fund that
makes it easier for women and
underrepresented people of color to
start new businesses Jerry you've
actually met with the Kapoor's right I
went to one of their events where they
were it was a camp where they had young
young adults learning how to code all
from Oakland they're based in Oakland
ok and it was really cool I must say
they it was the real deal
it wasn't just some you know smoke and
mirrors type of stuff they they're
really doing what they say they're doing
and trying to create a pipeline I mean
it seems really helpful just based on
the sheer statistics of how little
minorities and women there are as far as
like successful entrepreneurs right and
like VC is like the biggest roadblock to
that right there are like clear stats a
show they even like women who do obtain
funding generally obtain less funding
than apart so it's kind of yeah it's
nice to see that there is a fund that's
actually actively looking to diversify
the perspective yeah they're yeah
they're you know they're really
interesting investment group they also
were the first investors to criticize
uber their investors in uber and they
were the first ones when all the
everything in the fan right and they
were the first ones to criticize uber
for that toxic shareholders uber they
are yeah they're one of the early
investors oh wow yeah they have some big
profile companies in their portfolio but
and at the same time they're trying to
build this pipeline for women and
minorities no it's great yeah alright
for those stories and more chicks on
SEANET Roger Tsien I'm out for name I'm
Derek ER thanks listening
Roger what kind of allergies do you have
a myriad of allergies a myriad I'm
allergic to our office AC system I am
allergic to pollen allergic to grass
grass allergic to certain kinds of fruit
tomatoes watermelon Wow so would you eat
everything go somewhere say you're you
look up a place and then you see the
pollen report would you be like wow
let's cancel that trip oh yeah I think
that's why would you I probably take
allergy meds although it usually takes a
few hours for that stuff to kick in if
it was like a long road trip it was
planned out yeah and like I did a google
search and upon me was high I wouldn't
cancel the trip Oh screw this what if it
was like going to the park for that yeah
I probably avoid it I'd probably go
somewhere else yeah but I feel like like
you don't need a forecast to know how
much pollen is gonna be at the park well
another air like another town over I
feel like it's like an umbrella moment
kind of thing though where you know like
when you when you look at the weather
for the day like you just want to know
like what the temperature is but then a
turn or is like oh it's raining and then
you're planning so like if you were like
planning a picnic you would probably
cancel it like when you're seeing that
it's gonna rain today right I feel like
the pollen kind of indicators kind of
the same thing whereas like oh there's
gonna be like a bunch of pollen there I
don't know if I wanna go I mean I feel
like it's like the same like rain thing
yeah yeah yeah definitely I mean again
like if it was like a big trip planned a
night I did a Google search it's like
pollen counts hi I wouldn't cancel for
it like I would probably take Claridon
and just relocate well it's like yeah
so should we speculate on what series
that apples going to bring to the table
here because Danny Green's got a great
prediction ooh
what is Danny Green's prediction hey
what's up Danny so Siri and the rock
might have a series Oh God well that
would be their entire billion dollar
budget yeah on the rock because the rock
he's worth it damn it
because he's magnificent although that
commercial is terrible it's not even see
it what happened it's Dwayne Johnson
going about his day and using Siri yeah
help him out that's it yeah and he's an
outer space and he says here he'd take a
cell
and it does it which by now wouldn't
work realistically because I mean it's
not like he can talk in the vacuum of
space yeah how can Siri make noises when
there's nobody can hear you in space
even if you are Siri
alright mr. wizard moving on yeah wait
what other shows are we going to see
well that's thing we don't know yet this
is so let's speculate aha I mean
obviously nothing branded right like
they couldn't take a game of Thrones and
pour it over to Apple but it'd have to
be like imagine they'd want to do
something ambitious like that right like
you know Netflix well into West worlds
like they're all robots now and they
fight you in a flesh throne that sounds
pretty it's like the reverse cuz it's
not like the Iron Throne because they're
all made of iron oh these are in this
series or a vein or something so wait do
you don't think any more reality TV
shows and I hope not I easily think
they're gonna do it it's easy I think if
they wanted like steam the report said
that you know this is the the a billion
dollars is enough to fund 10 shows or as
many as 10 shows so that's if you just
do the math 100 million dollars per show
that's way more than you need for a
reality show well I am has a dance
contest it's basically a ripoff of So
You Think You Can Dance but it's with
the video game just dance if they were
just making reality shows with a billion
dollars they could make like a hundred
of these shows right yeah
like 100 a billion dollars is enough to
get you like house of card
caliber of shows right maybe one or two
like like I forget how much Game of
Thrones cause I mean Game of Thrones
crazy yes I mean that that shows extra
expensive house of cards
isn't that why West No was it what what
show just got canceled the one from the
Wachowskis
the matrix no there was
was it a show on Netflix help me out
Chad yes that's the overhead yes yeah
yeah but I mean apples got money coming
out their ears have apples set to make
45 to 46 billion dollars in revenue just
next quarter alone so a billion dollars
is like nothing that's so what you're
saying is Asian investment
so we could get higher quality
programming yeah Gweneth Paltrow is
health show no you know the GUP
experience I thought oh my god I like
that so we've got the - back in the chat
he says what do people think of the fact
that we can no longer get entertainment
content from one place maybe I'm
nostalgic for the old days of everything
being somewhere on TV and I see your
point but even that wasn't really the
case because remember you had different
tiers of cable packages oh no or you
could just had the antenna than you guys
I would say he brings up a good point
because we've been we've been pushing
and advocating for all the cart all the
cart distribution model for channels
right paying for you to content you do
want and now we kind of have that it's
like way more expensive than actually a
traditional cable because we've got
Netflix Hulu YouTube that's what I was
saying something it's kind of CBS reap
reap what we sow where he begged for the
ala carte and they're like okay but on
our terms and now you're well it can be
if you pile it up but I do Netflix Hulu
Amazon and that like 60 bucks isn't it
yeah so there's lots of reasons to stick
with that I don't even use the video
that much but between Netflix Hulu
that's about 16 17 bucks a month
that's why Amazon's like the only one
that I have because it comes as part of
a package kind of thing if you asked for
you know Amazon ala carte I don't know
how many people would be on Amazon like
they do offer it actually no I I'm the
same way with Amazon like I I cannot
live without my Prime subscription like
the video stuff you know if they also
killed it tomorrow thing that's good
about Amazon I find is that if you want
to watch a movie they have almost every
movie and you can rent them for right
the rental thing built in is a nice
price like jumping back and forth
between Netflix to iTunes to whatever
we're just waiting for what's new on
Netflix yeah which tends to not pay off
these days I think going back to Dodgers
point though like they're pretty much
all like the same I mean obviously
Amazon and Netflix have their own
exclusives and if you want it then you
can subscribe to their services but
I enjoy having like all these different
platforms where I can pick what I want I
kind of look at it they're not all the
same though like you've got these kind
of huge platforms like Netflix and
Amazon but then now you've got a carving
out of different channels right I've got
CBS for HBO Showtime yeah which
full-disclosure CBS and Showtime a part
of CBS which is our parent company but
now you've got Disney considering their
own breakaway it's not even considering
it's happening they're doing it but
there are also other side channels we
constantly forget like crackle and
ethics right yes comedians and cracks
that secretly show crackle worth
watching is false
The Critic radio well I have the DVDs of
news radio so I watched that you and I
have had this conversation but somebody
that I was like I was following some
thread on Twitter where they were making
a point after Disney was all you know
we're gonna make our own streaming
service with blackjack and yeah but
basically it was like what it's a future
of a reference but the idea I got it the
idea was you know if you do this you're
only gonna drive people back to piracy
because you're once again making it hard
for people to get all the content that
they want I mean would it be better
though if every network just did their
own thing do we really want to go down
that route were you paying like a buck
for this channel a buck for the channel
a buck I mean oh I feel like it'd be
fair if it were I mean that's where
we're heading I'm looking out like the
music industry as like a good case study
of it where like you look at how like
jay-z was going you know had tidal and
then he had all these exclusives on
title and then Kanye was when he put his
album to the life of Pablo out on title
and not on Spotify it was the most
pirated album like that year you know
just becomes one of those things where
if you're gonna make it hard for me to
get this even though I already pay for
something else that I should be able to
get this on I'm just gonna buy I wonder
what the kind of cost benefit or the of
that is like if for Disney for example I
can add
if they load up their channel with lots
of cartoons all their movies whatever
yeah
parents are gonna like line up to kids
there's Netflix doesn't like Netflix do
a kid's thing - no no but yes there's a
difference that kid is into Disney stuff
yeah what are you gonna do you can't go
to youtube for that's high rated yeah
they're discounting heroness don't have
time to pirate stuff really last time I
checked you apparently pirating is time
consuming it's I guess I don't know yeah
I don't pirate so I know the mantra I
live by is giving excuse to pay for it
if you make me jump through too many
hoops it's too much of a pain in the
butt
then I know other ways and I'm not like
a threat no no but I do feel like we are
kind of getting show getting to that
point though because I feel like as a
consumer we had a tolerance for a couple
of these like that early guys would come
out there with own services like all
right I'll pay an extra $10 but though
if you've got like 15 channels with
their own services then you're like well
this is this is terrible
yeah it would be kind of a pain in the
butt imagine soggy brings up a good
point he's asking well these shows
actually draw people into Apple music is
that going to be the key house of cards
help draw some people in the Netflix and
they outbid HBO for that show yeah there
are they just going to self-serve that
pre-existing installed Loyalists sheeple
audience or are they gonna actually draw
people in with this I mean I was like I
can't really speak for like what their
strategy is but I mean the idea is they
have a large enough basis of paying
subscribers now that like they could
technically generate enough buzz from
one other shows that it might cause
people to sign up for the service yeah
but it's different because they're the
ones funding it themselves they got
their like large base from like Apple
music like wow off the music but you
know that was you know they because they
had these exclusives where chance the
rapper's album was exclusively on it for
like a few days before they put like I
think they paid him like three million
dollars for that Frank ocean's album
which was like highly anticipated they
paid him like a certain amount of money
I don't know how much but for the
exclusives of that before went on
Spotify or anything else like that I
don't think they can do that for TV
shows because they're gonna be the ones
that have to produce it and put it
together and all this stuff and it's
another thing though they have full
control so they can keep exclusive for
as long as maybe it'd be like like
just making the the parallel from like
music to TV with like Frank Ocean and
chance the rapper it'd be like if they
got rights to Game of Thrones like ten
days before like it released to
everybody you don't think that's how
they would do it no I'm saying like
that's what the parallel would be to
build up like their fanbase for TV shows
and that's not how they're gonna do it
cuz there's no chance I think I may
that's why I'm so different for a house
of cards I mean that was exclusive to
Netflix right yeah you have to be but
they release it on DVD as well
well no but after the fact but like
initially when that when that showed you
buzz like that got people interested in
the Netflix or but have them hooked into
it yeah I guess like I just just wanna
know Apple music is 27 million paying
subscribers right there is already more
than a lot of fun that's a massive
instant I thought what are they going to
so if you're already in Apple music are
you going to get the service do you pay
an extra premium premium for the video
I'm not sure I think Apple music
subscribers now get carpool karaoke do
they yeah that'll the apps I believe
like I don't get it
yeah I understand it but you can watch
one more good question from razor 204 a
oh excuse me from Josh Buddha do you
have to have Apple products to watch
these shows or perhaps can you just
watch it I'm assuming like on an app
that you install a third party pop music
Apple music is an Android app to not I
write down it for Android I know I have
Apple music I'm iPhone I don't write I
don't know why would get Apple but you
don't use an Apple Avenue but I don't
think they would be dumb enough to
tether it to hardware no I mean yeah
isn't Apple music like a roku channel to
or something I believe so yeah yeah we
should have had cats come in I know
we'll get cats back on soon I think
that's about it for today that was
really good conversation interesting to
see where this is all gonna go but you
wanna you want up no thanks thanks again
