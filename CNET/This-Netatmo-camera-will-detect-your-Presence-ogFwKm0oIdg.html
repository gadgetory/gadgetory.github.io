connected security cameras we've been
waiting for that moment when motion
detection was a lot smarter enter net
Atmos $300 presents it's that floodlight
right behind me with a built-in 1080p
camera with motion detection it also has
audio and a lot of other functionality
but the coolest thing about it is that
it's supposed to tell the difference
between cars people and animals not only
is that cool functionality from a
security standpoint but it also promises
advanced automations with smart home
integrations from IFFT that way you can
set up advanced recipes like if the
camera detects a car coming then it can
open the garage door
that kind of stuff pretty awesome it
also has a built-in micro SD card and
that makes it totally free there's no
cloud storage there's no cloud fee so
there's no issue with monthly fees and
worrying about that storage space and
you can also send that stuff over to
Dropbox if you want to access it from a
website I do have a couple of issues
with this camera though for starters it
cost 300 bucks so that's really
expensive for any DIY camera when a lot
of them costs $200 or less it also has
kind of a wonky design I mean it's kind
of contemporary and modern which is cool
if it fits with your design aesthetic
but it doesn't really work with the
facade of this house so if you don't
like the design you're kind of out of
luck
I do like where netatmo is going with
this but I wish they dropped down the
price introduce some more design options
and integrate with additional smart home
partners</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
