today we're gonna take a look at the
cases ET 2700 I so this is a $13.99 on
one and it comes with a large 27-inch
display that's relatively new screen
size for PC all on once and this is not
quite as high resolution as the display
that you get with the 27-inch Apple iMac
that resolution is 25 by 14 this is a 19
by 10
aka 1080p that said the resolution on
the screen is still high enough that you
can play a blu-ray movie or any other
high-definition content and have it look
pretty great so it's important to know
that this is not a touchscreen but what
I've heard from a number of vendors
touch screens in the 27-inch sides are
prohibitively expensive for the consumer
market so this is a non touch display
I've got a feeling a lot of you won't
really miss the touch input now at
$13.99 this is a pretty expensive
Windows PC it's fair the Aces might
charge a premium for such a large
display but you also get a dedicated
subwoofer would you get over here as
well as a core i7 CPU and a dedicated
Nvidia graphics card now that makes the
system more powerful than the HP omni 27
which you've seen it's also a 27-inch
Windows all-in-one still it's a little
bit pricey for its performance and
there's a lenovo on one that actually
has a 23 inch display but that's much
faster it actually has 3d display
capability so what you might want to buy
from all these high-end all-in-ones kind
of depends on what your needs are all
those three I mentioned the Asus is the
most expensive but it's also the most
well-rounded given its high-end specs as
well as its large screen you'll note I
didn't mention the subwoofer is a
benefit for the asus and among those
other systems because it's not quite
powerful enough to really make a big
difference so going over the hardware
you can see there's a nice clean design
here a little webcam up top you can see
there are some ports in the door here
here's where the subwoofer connects
there's also a couple other audio ports
some use to be three outs those are very
common now an SD card reader and an
eSATA port those are the few other ports
in the back of the system a couple of
the USB twos VGA input as well as HDMI
input those video inputs are great they
make the system a lot more versatile
because you can effectively use it as a
second monitor and then rounding out the
unit over here on the right side there's
a blu-ray drive now it's certainly fair
to ask with touch oriented Windows 8
coming around the corner why you'd be
interested in a non touch on one I think
the large 27s screen pretty much speaks
for
self creates a nice big space for
productivity and it also lets you use
this system and say a dorm room or an
office for some home entertainment star
much Brown this is the asus ET 2700</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
