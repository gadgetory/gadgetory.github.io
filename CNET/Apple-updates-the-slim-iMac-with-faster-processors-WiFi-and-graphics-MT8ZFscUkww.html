latest version of apple's imac
all-in-one desktop this of course looks
just like the really radically revamped
version that Apple introduced last year
and it is the same on the outside there
are a lot of big changes inside but
let's start with the actual body when we
first saw this back in 2012 everyone
said Wow look how razor thin it is and
at first glance it does look almost as
thin as maybe an ipad now you turn it
around still looks very thin then you
realized it sort of bowled out in the
center here that's where all the
components are but still very slim and
very bulk free for a big high powered
27-inch all-in-one of course you get a
little bit of flexibility with the
screen you go up like this you go back
down like this but that's really about
it this is not one of the new generation
of all in ones that either let's say has
a touchscreen or has an internal battery
so you can actually lift the screen off
and use it like a mega tablet that's a
that's a growing field but Apple is not
on board with that yet well they are on
board with however is an update to
Intel's latest generation of core i
series processors otherwise known as has
well that gives you some improved
performance in things with batteries it
gives you a great battery life we don't
have to worry about that here obviously
you also get 80 to 911 AC wireless
that's faster Wi-Fi speeds if you have a
router that also supports that faster
new standard we have the latest
generation of nvidia geforce 700 series
graphics cards that's great if your Mac
gamer it's still kind of a growing area
being a Mac gamer but things a lot
better than they were even a couple of
years ago and if you have a flash memory
module inside your imac you get a faster
PCIe connected flash module whether
you're doing an SSD hard drive alone you
can actually get those up to one
terabyte of SSD although that's very
expensive or you can get a fusion drive
which is what we have here which is a
one terabyte platter hard drive with 128
gig SSD all combined together to give
you a lot of storage but still really
good speed now if you have last year's
version of the imac i'm not going to lie
there's really no reason to upgrade the
experience is very similar but if you're
about getting an imac maybe have one
that's a couple years old at least now
you can get one that has all the
up-to-date components in it and you'll
be future-proof at least until the next
generation of intel and nvidia stuff
comes out sometime in 2014 i'm dan
ackerman and that is the 2013 27-inch
iMac</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
