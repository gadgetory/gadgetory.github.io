welcome to the Apple bite for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
it's official Annapolis sent out their
invitations for their next big keynote
on Wednesday September the 7th in San
Francisco at 10 a.m. Pacific time but
let's look deeper and completely
overanalyze this invite because I have
nothing else better to do now first of
all did you eagle eyes notice the invite
is shaped in a pattern that's the top of
the Apple logo see I did now secondly we
know rumors point to a dual lens camera
with DSLR type capabilities and the
invite features a background with a
bouquet effect found with DSLRs it
produces a blur in out-of-focus parts of
an image with the shallow depth of field
that's produced by the lens and for all
of you know it all that like to comment
I've heard people say bouquet or bouquet
it's like Jif or gif or the 8080 or at
at debate hashtag first world problems
now this is also a rare dark themed
invite from Apple that's black instead
of bright and cheery 22 low light
capabilities and see you a camera sees
you uh-huh yeah I told you I have
nothing better to do all right the idea
of DSLR like features is great but if it
ends up only limited to the larger 5.5
inch phone you know what I'm passing on
it now let's check out new tidbits on
the iPhone 7 a rumored leaked spec sheet
from Weibo could be totally real or
totally fake but it matches rumors and
shows the inclusion of lightning
equipped wired ear pods and a lightning
to 3.5 millimeter adapter that will be
included in the box Apple has also been
granted product certifications by the
Eurasian Economic Union for new iPhones
new Apple watches and a reference to air
pods the same name from a u.s. trademark
filing in October which still makes me
sad that they skipped on air buds now
we've always compared the rumored air
pods to the Braga - wireless earbuds but
there's a chance Apple might have
acquired or is at least working on a
partnership with Braga
that's because Braga has teased on his
Twitter one of the biggest announcements
in the company's history will take place
on Monday
September the fifth in Cupertino the
city that's also home to Apple now this
is big or they're just doing a hell of a
marketing tease we'll find out
there's also been a lot of chatter about
a deep-blue iPhone or a darker space
great color option for the next iPhone 7
but according to this latest photo from
Mac o Takara of alleged SIM tray slots
they believe the iPhone 7 will have a
five color lineup including gold silver
space grey one of your favorites of mine
rose gold and a new glossy black option
that is similar to the finish of the
2013 Mac Pro or takes me back to the
days of the iPhone 3G now I personally
love a glossy black to match my glossy
black chaps alright
that's a bad apple and I swear I don't
own a pair yet alright looking forward
the latest Bloomberg report from mark
Berman says Apple is indeed working on a
refreshed Mac lineup and is planning to
release some of those new Macs as soon
as October updates include the rumored
thinner MacBook Pro with the OLED touch
bar above the keyboard that can change
depending on the app you're using Apple
is internally calling this the dynamic
function row but the report says that
name may change a new macbook air will
bring multifunctional USB seaports and
imax
will have an option for a new advanced
graphics chip from AMD as well and for
all of you who have been asking about a
new Apple display the report claims
Apple and LG are collaborating to bring
a new standalone monitor to connect to
its computers with a high resolution 5k
stream yes a 5k Apple display is on its
way and with all of these Mac
announcements and the likely release of
Mac o Sierra in October what does that
mean for the iPad I've always thought
we'd see an iPad update this year but
according to Bloomberg Apple may roll
out new updates to the iPad line next
year the updates include software
improvements to the Apple pencil
potentially allowing users to mark and
annotate objects across multiple apps
new iPad hardware will include even
faster display technology for smoother
zooming panning and scrolling but the
report reiterates we shouldn't expect an
iPad lineup update until next year when
a rumored new iPad pro with a 10.5 inch
sized screen will also debut which means
I gotta save my money on
they release a true tone twelve point
nine inch iPad pro after they gave it to
the nine point seven inch one only four
months later and in a follow up to our
story about the iPhone 6 and 6-plus
touch disease a class-action lawsuit has
been filed by iPhone owners in three
different states against Apple over the
alleged defect where iPhone 6 and 6-plus
touchscreens have become unresponsive
and failed it's a real thing for users
but Apple still won't acknowledge it and
has turned away many out of warranty
customers until they do you know what's
coming for you that's a bad apple now
let's just hope this doesn't end up
affecting something like the iPhone 6s
because no one wants an iPhone 6s touch
disease or iPhone 6s TD yes ladies and
gentlemen I will be here all night and
before we go we wanted to reward Apple
by nation with our amazing scene at
sweepstakes that could get you one of
two brand-new Apple TVs go to the link
