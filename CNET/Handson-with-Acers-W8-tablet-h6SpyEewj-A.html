a look at the acer iconia w700 this is
one of those new windows 8 products that
got a touch screen it's primarily a
slate style tablet but there's a little
touch of a hybrid or convertible in
there as well I will say this is one of
the more polarizing products that we've
taken a look here at some people have
seen the design and really disliked it
especially the large set of l-shaped
bracket docking stand I happen to think
it's at least a little bit different
than a lot of the other products we've
seen it almost has a little bit of a
retro sci-fi quality to it so I'm
willing to give it a little bit of a
pass there I do like that this is a full
intel core i5 slate style tablet here so
it doesn't really compromise on
performance you've also got a 128 gig
SSD so every reasonable amount of
storage space it's almost like an
ultrabook except for the keyboard is
detached now it includes this wireless
Bluetooth keyboard and this docking
stand that gives you a free extra USB
3.1 it does not have any sort of mouse
or trackpad or any sort of pointer
device control like that you're going to
have to add that whether it's a mouse or
I used an external logitech click pad
and you can just sink that up and that
gives you much more of a traditional
desktop experience which is especially
important because even though windows 8
works a lot better with touch and has
this sort of tile based interface here
it's still not a fully satisfying tablet
only experience in order to do regular
productivity work you're really going to
want something kind of like this now
when you want to take it with you you
just pull it out of the dock like this
and then it becomes a slate style tablet
it actually is one of the better
accelerometers I've seen in these it
just switches orientation like this I
haven't seen any get stuck yet which is
pretty rare for a Windows 8 device but
then when you're ready to plug it back
in you just slide it right back in here
although every time I do it it switches
back to the traditional desktop view and
then I have to go back to the windows 8
UI a one other nice surprise about the
w700 really great battery life on our
fairly tough battery test it ran for
more than seven hours which is excellent
especially compared to a lot of the
other windows 8 products that we
test us i'm dan ackerman and then is the
acer iconia w700</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
