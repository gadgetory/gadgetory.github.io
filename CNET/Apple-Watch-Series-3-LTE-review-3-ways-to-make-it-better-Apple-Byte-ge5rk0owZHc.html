the apple watch series 3 LTE review and
this is not gonna be about specs this is
based on my experiences the things that
i really like and the things that they
can make a lot better so let's just talk
about it right now the series 3 LTE
watch you know that i'm kind of like a
hater on siri but I've got to say on
this specific watch Siri is great they
bumped up the processor it's so much
more responsive it talks back to you
yeah sure when you do text and dictation
it might miss a word here and there but
overall it's really good and you know I
am still the type of person that doesn't
like to talk in public directly to my
wrist but Syria is one of the highlights
of this Apple watch hey Siri how do I
meet girls okay what's up the other part
is battery life like I was surprised by
this I did everything from taking calls
getting text messages sending them back
and forth going to work out for an
entire hour listen to music and I didn't
try and force it to run down its battery
I just wanted to do what I would
normally do everyday
this battery held up I mean from like
9:00 a.m. all the way to 9:00 p.m. I
still had 22% left and that's really a
lot more impressive than I thought I was
worried about this whole one hour of
talk time you're not gonna talk in it
for an hour but it does last throughout
the day and I thought that was another
highlight
and the third thing working out like I
can't tell you this is amazing it's like
I'm listen to my music I can take calls
I can do text messages all from my wrist
I'm still connected and it's just an
experience that if you're someone that
wants to try this or you haven't done it
it really makes this Apple watch special
you may not be that person but this is
where it's at now let's get to the ways
that they can improve this Apple watch
Series 3 I started with the good stuff
because I know a lot of you think I'm
like a hater I'm not I just want to keep
it real with you but first up it has to
be about the connection from the watch
to the iPhone we know that Apple has
said they're gonna release a software
update to fix that they really need to
do it ASAP because I don't think you can
give a fair evaluation of this when it
gets hung looking for an open Wi-Fi
network and it can't connect and you
basically have no connection that's
still a problem so fix that first that's
got to be the top priority the second
thing that really needs to be fixed or
Apple needs to be clear about is
messages now we were given the promise
that hey this is gonna work with your
phone you can receive messages back and
forth okay but in the real world what I
found is when you have your phone
connected to you with your watch nearby
yes you're gonna get SMS you're gonna
get AI messages back and forth but if
you're on the go and your phone is off
and let's say you just want to use this
exclusively and this is exclusively
connected to LTE you can only receive I
messages and not SMS messages from your
friends that don't use iPhones Apple
never said that that's kind of a big
deal in being able to really be free
from this and we confirm this ourselves
with my use I got a lot of users to
confirm this and then Apple we went to
them and they said yes that's absolutely
true the LTE Apple watch only sends IO
messages if your phone is disconnected
and you're over LTE another issue here
is just getting your phone connected the
devil is always in the details right
Apple said it's $10 for you to add an
Apple watch to your current data plan
but look someone like me and many of you
who are on grandfathered data plans from
like 8 9 10 years ago they're gonna ask
you to upgrade your data plan in order
to use the Apple watch and what does
that mean your bill is gonna go up like
they told me I'd have to pay 20 more
dollars in addition to the $10 for the
Apple watch so a lot of this just being
able to just instantly use this with
your current plan it's just not true and
it can be really discouraging for people
that don't know this at all
the other thing about the Apple watch
here is really the actual speaker on it
is a week and what I mean that by that I
don't want it to be blaring out in
public but whenever you use it as a
watch phone or you know even when you're
in your car driving or just small
moments it's really quite like it just
has to be amped up just like a few more
notches I know this is nitpicking but
for those of you that are using this yes
most of time you'll probably have
headphones with it but there are times
where you don't and it just needs to be
a little bit louder - quick software
things if you talk about apps on this
right now there's not a lot of
third-party apps that work specifically
with the watch over LTE that don't need
the phone they need to get on that like
Twitter needs to get on that Instagram
needs to get on that just being able to
do apps exclusively on the watch that
don't ask you for the phone because it
kind of makes it less useful and the
other thing let's be honest here they
say you can read email on here but 95%
of the emails that I get they tell me to
go to my phone to read them and unless
you're getting just a simple basic text
email you're not gonna use this for
email pretty much at all
so what's the verdict on the Apple watch
Series three look I can confidently tell
you this is not for everyone but if
you're someone who has one and wants to
upgrade you're gonna love the
performance you're gonna love this serie
but you're also gonna pretty much use it
exactly the same way you do with your
Series one or your Series two connecting
it to your phone but if you're a person
who likes to go out and work out this is
where it's shined the most I have never
had an experience that was that
connected and that seamless listen to
music working out taking phone calls
text messaging just on my wrist
that was amazing so if you're that
person this is the watch for you so take
everything I said into consideration the
good things the bad things that's our
Apple watch 3 3 LG reviews and again it
shines the most when you're working out
there's a fly that just landed on -
right here
