man and make him very happy well I'm
here to help I don't know after all why
I am pretty clueless about what you want
and in fact some time I think even you
don't know what you want I know really
well what man we want and this day most
man among other things when a good solid
state drive like these SSD 720 here from
transept if you don't believe me well
believe me in fact you can give him this
drive on any day at all not just a vday
and it seemed quite romantic I guarantee
it so what's so special about this dry
well nothing in particular and I
couldn't help feeling romantic about it
that set is a very similar drive to
other I have review this one here
support the standard SATA 3 which offer
up to sick gigabyte per second it come
in the seven millimeter thick meaning it
will work in any computer including some
ultrabooks and for desktop it also
includes this drive-by converter and
enough screw for the installation in my
testing the drive here wasn't the
fastest but it was not the slowest
either in fact compared with hard drive
even still proved to be the biggest
upgrade in terms of performance for
either a windows computer or a mac and
for those who want to upgrade from a
hard drive it also includes a cloning
software to make a job easier as
mentioned earlier this SSD 720 here is
quite affordable costing well less than
one dollar per gigabyte these two and 56
gigabyte virgin here costs about to $25
or 88 cent per gig the draw is also
available in 64 gigabyte 128 gigabyte
and 512 bigger by capacities so pick one
that fits your budget for more
information on this dry and other check
out the food with us com or you can send
me question to my Twitter or Facebook
now the real reason why is to trust me
on man is because i virtually have ossd
on the market like this right here and i
still want more and i will have more why
you may ask that's because i'm dumb go
and this has been the first look as a
SD 720 solid-state drive from transcend
you not going to go anyway</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
