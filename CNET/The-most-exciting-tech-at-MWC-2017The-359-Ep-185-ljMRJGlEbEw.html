apparently was a thing last night Oh
fine you know kind of like who cares I
think yeah some people care I don't know
if any of them were in this room though
I don't I mean I watched it I thought it
was I thought it was exciting while I
was he good but yeah I mean like I was
watching let's get to the phone Frasier
I wasn't watching the Oscars okay old
episodes neither think of anyway let's
let's um let's see how much of this we

questions and comments Brian will get to
them at the end and yeah let's do it
alright everybody hang out we'll be back
to talk to you in the chat in three
minutes 59 seconds from 32
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Rubin am
I as the wolf actor Oh Mobile World
Congress he's going on in Barcelona with
a ton of major phone and unveilings the
biggest reveal is the LG G six let me
let me take off a couple of things here
about it 5.7 inch screen dual lens
camera it's got an older Qualcomm
processor not the latest and greatest
dust and water-resistant it doesn't you
can't replace the battery like with
other LG's are you excited about this
this is this is the biggest reveal so
far of Mobile World Congress and I don't
know that I'm getting that excited about
it I did the biggest problems that we
knew about all of this already eldress
teasing this like crazy their official
site on friday i was checking out on the
official site on the bottom and give you
all the specs already on their site
really yeah it was just in the little
gray on white font and like oh maybe
they're not noticing list at the duo 13
megapixel cameras on they're talking
about the water and dustproof stuff it
was actually on their site already
they're not as excited they're excited
people are paying attention to them
apples not in the room Samsung's guy
what did Samsung do Samsung's like hey
we are going to announce when we're
going to announce the s8 and we also
have a tablet that you don't care about
that we had to show you something
yesterday yeah the dog ate my homework
and now I only have an s3 tablet to show
you they do really who cares about the
tablet like who cares about tablets
period and is this an interesting tablet
like it's an android tablet it seems
very ho-hum to me it's got HDR potential
it's got an S Pen you can actually use
the S Pen honest if you're like just
longing for the note that's not it you
know available you can draw on this one
only not we're nine point seven inches
you don't have two models at the s2 so
is anyone excited no but they needed
something to capture the audience away
from LG because they have the biggest
phone at least a the most high-profile
phone right at the show which is which
is important because it is a big show
this is one of the phones that I really
like that I was super excited about we
reference this on thursdays show this is
the nokia 3310 this is a throwback phone
I love the specs on this thing 2
megapixel camera camera yeah right snake
game and month long battery life and
that is literally it that's like all it
does maybe it makes phone calls it looks
super bright there's a there's a red one
is a yellow one or the might be like a
fluorescent green under what cover that
that is and that original graphite
looking thing it looks good it supposed
to be way thinner right well 3310 so
people are you know they're gonna try to
stress test this thing because that's
Nokia's legendary at least the old
Nokia's legendary for like destroying
other objects with it because it's so
tough yes but there's like hammer and a
nail with that Nokia if you're ever on
reddit you've seen these things when it
comes to nuke is so the question is with
these versions will have that but people
are excited about this yeah what are you
too excited about the 3310 I'm really
excited about it first question though
about it is is retro tech back you know
we saw the that throwback Nintendo
people went crazy about it now we've got
this phone is this is this now a thing I
think it could be in the future so retro
is not back yet so retro will be a thing
is scheduled it's coming i really think
that your mining the old the old IP
stuff you don't really find a lot of
this stuff coming back i imagine because
there's only so many variants because
everything looks the same you look at
the g6 and you look at the s8 totally
it's like hey what do you have there oh
it's just a slab of metal and glass
right okay what do you have it a slab of
metal and glass yeah I got the 3310 this
is a gorgeous piece of plastic that
doesn't do anything there you go watch
out people all right we've got we've got
what 20 24 seconds were narrowly running
out of time should we mention the Oscars
yes we talk about something yes Oscars
mistake happened you care I I mean I I
kind of care i was excited about it when
I saw it I feel like I would be remiss
if we didn't at least mention that the
Oscars happen it's kind of like the
Super Bowl of something or other I think
it was a publicity stunt it could have
been it could have been staged who knows
but anyway all right we're out of time
if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on cnet I'm Ben Fox
Rubin Amaya's actor thanks for listening
so let's talk about the elephant in the
room or maybe more accurately the giant
indestructible brick in the room
everyone wants to talk more about the
3310 oh my god totally like yeah I
didn't see that coming I mean it's a
really it this is this is the other
question I wanted to ask you but we only
had four minutes was who would actually
use this phone you know like who is the
market for your kids you don't like they
were given to us in high suit like I
know that's what I that's what I
mentioned III has had an interesting
insight because his kids a little older
than my oldest back when my kid was
younger I would give him like android
phones and things like that because he
would use apps you know not gonna have a
lot of apps on this thing so once they
see dad playing with whatever on his
phone didn't why can't my like this and
I'll be like no no no really kids are
great i don't know when I was little and
I had the little red tykes you know
plastic car and my dad's car had a
stereo in it I didn't get mad I got a
car it's true but there's no licensing
process for receiving a phone or an ipod
touch or something doesn't have a sim
you don't need to have amazing parents
don't want to give their kid a
distraction appliance that's okay that's
true so I I totally agree with you but I
I do like is coming soon I like I at
this point that kids are very savvy one
of the first things my daughter learned
how to do was to swipe and pinch and
zoom I'm not proud of it but that's what
happened I suppose we had natural
interface and that really is natural
like it is it is and but it's it it to
me I would probably feel more
comfortable she's only four years old
but I would probably feel more
comfortable giving her that Nokia phone
as opposed to something else that you
know you you would know here's why
because that thing has the phone app up
all the time so they can dial people
much easier so you do want a kid
pressing button don't I'm serious think
about this that hard keyboard there is a
kid pressing buttons you don't want to
give a kid that I don't know come my mom
and dad about your grandparents then
that's also yeah yeah thanks for that
MMP oh oh geez mmk Cody says he'd give
it to his grandpa and I think that's a
good point because there are I if I want
to my grandparents if I try to give them
anything or like what the hell is this
devil machine ok so i guess at least
resembles a phone i think
really cool device i think the retro
check being back is really nice i think
there's really this great market for it
like yeah there's some kids they'll like
it there's older people who like it but
there's a lot of simplified phones out
there for this market already fact that
nokia is just what we remember all right
remember this was awesome it's like yeah
but here's the thing i'm really curious
if any of us who are like yeah this was
awesome but now we've got this really
cool things like you're not gonna go
back to your red drink okay you didn't
like i can drive a freaking car so i
don't need this thing it's a novelty
though what if you had it as like a
sidebar um i'm under this tracfone still
exists yes yeah so what you took that if
you're gonna go um let's say some kind
of dangerous expedition you're going but
rock climbing or something like that you
don't wanna bring a smartphone with you
and this one lasts for a month that's
actually a very interested you could
like save your fall for my sake total
guys what not wait here's the other
thing this is new getting that that's
always been the urban legend you
mentioned read it and how they the 3310
has been this indestructible like they
found them encased in concrete and they
still have power kind of thing like
years later will are these gonna be just
as indestructible or they're gonna be
flimsy machines like an iphone this is a
different manufacturer this is hmd and
they've got the license to nokia name so
nobody knows yet if these new 33 tens
are going to be as good the old 3310 so
what's gonna happen is you know people
are gonna take all three tens versus the
new one just has beaten them together oh
I would let her get her and hope for the
best we should do that we should just do
that alright we're doing it that's on
the docket we're doing it 3310 was mega
stress test side by side see which way
or the other model we can oh my god
let's have a sword fight with them mmm I
would do it okay either way I think
maybe he said it's a battery of tests
for this battery being the intended word
oh that was a punt I was good mr. right
over my own head right and what is the
price point on the 33 1049 year 49 euros
a really nice low price 49 euros is
probably it's pretty close to depending
on the day fifty bucks 70 bucks let me
check you say I don't I can't do
conversions in my head like that I don't
know what the going rate until I get a
dollar right now so we'll find out
Tobias does not want us to beat the crap
out of the phones come on
I mean party okay it's it's literally
like 50 bucks yeah so the euro in that
what they used to be too it's $52 and
five cents which means that you know as
a backup phone potentially especially if
you're like a really heavy smartphone
user but you have to make a phone call
emergency call whatever i'm not saying
everybody would use it for that but I
kind of like your rock-climbing example
the thing is is that it's such a piece
did um such a cheap piece of tech that
you could just have it as a backup
potentially yeah i would think that when
i used to juggle phones way back in the
old sim card days because they still
have them now but like I think people
might get used to that idea of popping
their sim out go if not using my iphones
and i'm using this thing because i don't
know where I'm gonna be what's gonna
happen like you want that kind of thing
going but that's that's um it's a really
old school mentality when I switchers
him I'm sorry I look at my smartphone so
often that it might actually be a pretty
brilliant way of like you know getting a
smartphone diet by just getting one of
those things and keeping it for a week
maybe feel worth with a SmartWatch it's
like okay the SmartWatch has got all the
brains now I never knew through my phone
now cuz it can't do anything yeah but
then I'm still looking at a screen it's
okay we should we should look at each
other we should talk to me and you well
I'm gonna talking to each other I invite
you to this tube megapixel camera i love
that the 2 megapixel camera so hungee it
seemed like that we have to go out of
their way to find a sensor to that small
I don't know there's no made powder you
do like it's like finding like old ram
for your computer like okay Ferg look at
Instagram everybody adds the filter on
it and you got this mad megapixel phone
and then that's why you do you rate them
to look stressed as my people by ripped
jeans for Christ's sake come on that's a
good point that's a good point where's
this where's the camera we're out of
circling around this whole retro tech
thing and a nostalgia is one of the
greatest motivators in the sales in
sales right now I told you agree we all
hate what's happening right now when we
want to remember a better time yeah but
then when you get this in your hand we
go bone it is it do it when my phone
sucked in my jeans were acid washed yes
absolutely that goes for great line
what's my phone when the phone sucked
and my jeans were acid wash you know
it's the internet we can change it
immediately Pamela's asking if buddy
knows when the pre-orders going up no no
idea I can find out you see I mean they
just announced a judge
announced that and I'm actually
impressed that they even included
pricing so we don't know when this is
going to be available quite yet black
doug Studios burner phone quote
Heisenberg yeah I mean but you can find
a lot of other crappy phones for that
you know yeah this one so on Reenie
bucks well it's an you know won't let
this one go you want to crap your phone
for that it can't burner an
indestructible phone that's a probably I
mean you just throw it out and have
somebody else find it so to answer the
question you can sign up to get notified
when the phone is actually available but
it looks like it hasn't yet it hasn't
yet been announced when it's coming out
you can go on nokia com and find a
little bit more information but yeah the
features are literally three bullet
points and I think we read them on the
podcast so your actual small of all
saying between April and June is alleged
time in the UK and glenroy says in
Jamaica they're advertising soon as well
so this has got to be a quick flip
around I mean technically the technology
is there yeah right and it's been there
for quite some time literally just
waiting for the boxes to arrive at the
store I don't think that they really
have to they didn't try to make new
phones they just found like a warehouse
stock it's a Oh marketing i bet those
who do better if they go these are the
classics are you but this original those
things these things are way too thick
how long do we wait until somebody comes
up with a case follow that out
approximately a week yeah that's me on
Kickstarter will be 3d printed
relatively soon and it's got somebody
the jack get to work on that right idea
I love that somebody we actually figure
out to make that a battery pack we
really have a video you really need more
battery for that yeah i'm gonna do that
you're gonna add the bulk why not
certify tens gonna outlive us all it's a
cockroach of phones yeah but a better
camera on it by the bat make it a whole
mod phone oh god this that was one thing
that we didn't get abilities by the way
we didn't mention that like there's
gonna be a mod phone there's a new mod
on the Moto z yeah that we wanted to
mention which is gonna have the Alexa
integrate its gonna bring the lux
tentacles devices and then yeah alexis
coming to other Motorola phones which is
strange because now Google is allowing
assistant on nougat and marshmallow and
yes the g6 is coming baked in with
google assistant as well LG g 6
moto g 5 is the other thing that might
get alexa in the future yeah so people
can expect to see more voice assistant
capabilities on their different bones
but you're probably going to have to be
in the Android world if you want to get
different ones yes yes definitely a good
one definitely a good one but between
Google assistant and Alexa seems very
likely to me that amazon or sorry Apple
is not gonna play that game I think
that's definitely I mean Jerry's
reaffirming this in the chat but there's
definitely a market for this this 3310
thing coming back I don't think it'll be
a novelty I think there will be some
legitimacy to it or but there's
definitely good stuff oh there's usually
they're definitely it's a novelty to it
but I think it could go beyond its gonna
be those kids with the America Online
t-shirts the 3310 you said like they're
selling a few dollar American $45
America a few shirt yeah the old logo
3310 nostalgia cells it's just what's
been happening that's that's basically
what created BuzzFeed was they did
listicles of transformers and that was
now they're neither bigger than Jesus
yeah hey we've got a loan we've got a
off-topic question um anybody know what
the price of the samsung galaxy book
samsung galaxy book are we talking about
the tab s3 no it's a different thing I
don't have it right now I'm gonna look
it up but I samsung just kind of was
just the word what's the word just
stalling for time it felt like stalling
four times and also like also we still
exists yeah but at the same time like
it's after the note 7 was such a poor
launch I think they want to make
absolutely sure that this is the right
launch and they can you know come back
with a full head of steam in the the so
the s8 is going to launch in New York on
march 29th yes when the announcements
gonna be the galaxy book does not have a
price yet okay we have some lofty
requests in the in the chat right now
Tobias wants a camera hub mod for the
Lumia 1020 for the 3310 Wow Lumia okay
doesn't that like didn't I already have
a 41 megapixel camera there's not one
talking about what we gonna do take two
and stretch it it's gonna be difficult
I was a good camera though I think it's
gonna be impossible to teach you say it
was basic one megapixel there was a
41-megapixel windows phone I think
that's the one he's talking about was a
bright yellow one and then we're gonna
add a mod to it to make me feel like I'm
listening but put that lens I think on
the 3310 is what he flew do I love that
idea that is like to be a while no way
to actually see that because of the low
res screen so you have no idea to the
more is there any on onboard storage on
these things it's kind of like I don't
know what five megabytes or something
like that's like you're putting songs
little and 41 megapixel photos on it I
think we're video one photo I think they
played it right though because they
could have crammed more tech into this
phone they could have made it more smart
phony and they decided not to yeah I
wish I were lying there to dirt cheap
yeah wish I could have been there for
that conference is like it's a phone
what to do calls and snake and that's it
there's gonna be back lashing is that
color snake I'm telling you yeah yes
it's not even like old original snake so
even though that snake is one of the
bullet points it's a modified version of
so we're gonna need a memory there's
gonna be developed a hub so that you can
plug the nokia into your dial up modem
so that you can download this app store
you make an app store for the nokia and
then you can get a retrograded black and
green version Wow but that'll be a theme
the black and green version of this of
everything yeah you can theme this is so
colorful doesn't like it has more than
for later this year I would like to come
back to this issue and actually see how
many of our viewers and listeners
actually bought this phone because it's
super fun to talk about but I do wonder
what the use case is what do you
remember like you'd have to carry a
phone and a music player yeah like that
stopped Louis you imagine carrying extra
stuff with you all the time with this
well this phone is like super fun but we
were talking before the show to about
like what about like bringing back like
a Sony Walkman or something like that
we're like a discman and it's like
that's not gonna play that's not gonna
wind hits the market place that might
work actually this vinyl came back on
these tapes and I never really went away
though direct but tapes you can make
they're still taped that come out every
now Johnson come
full circle but it's again a sheer
novelty because because the sound
quality is horrible but it's the
interaction is horrible as well every
day that was the first big step
backwards in technology ooh in my
opinion at least from listening
techniques and an optical disc could
come back like a CD right but there are
I mean there is just running a peak
efficiency it's not like you get better
quality between one or the other it's
the disc is still a fully functional
it's just unnecessary when you don't
need physical media right right so there
are limitations to retro attack like I
think the chances of a cassette tape or
cassette walkman coming back seem pretty
low but maybe at mwc 2018 shout-out
kamal hashtag bring back Betamax bored
of that bring back Betamax also black
those Studios points out that we are
gonna have to relearn t9 you will i'm
not doing by the way bring back Betamax
should have been our headline that
should have been that line Emile's got a
good question which old phone brands do
you want to see resurrecting now that
Nokia and blackberries back with an
Android twist right we didn't even
mention the blackberry very good
reference yeah you know it's it's a
keyboard blackberry made by TCL I hits
all the necessary blackberry points but
the problem is is like that's not gonna
bring back blackberry nothing else did
so far but and there's no nostalgia flip
phone yeah maybe if they did think he
was she yeah flip motivation for the old
one the v3 we all had that phone that
thing should be back one way or another
give it time now now that this Pandora's
box is open I mean let's talk we don't
want much time left actually we're
almost over but you know they had the
Nintendo classic come back like
everybody just kind of reliving their
their golden years let's make a wish
list real quick before we wrap it up for
the day what's uh what we think or what
we want to see come back a Teen Wolf
themed flip phone going with that I I
don't even know where so with that I'm
actually for from Apple I want that
really yeah you want the color box back
no that's a G 30 or with that the
floating Oh with the the arm telescope
next thing I didn't telescope but it
moved up and okay look like a lamp
right yeah well that's like man little
ding on the mac like it looked I would
hope they will update it a little bit
but I'm just saying like that would be
the design i want to see again I mean
that's simply design though they could
shove mom told Jenelle in there yeah I
mean he'll we could get we know people
we can mod yes classic isn't really
running like well Turk exact it's just a
box yeah so like yeah I want that design
but I mean though you're gonna have to
if you want authenticity that screen
resolutions gonna go down no I don't
want that nothing si si well I was Brian
it's your this also isn't running
symbian this in 3310 so I think it's
okay that they update it a little bit Oh
Joe Dreamcast remake he knows how I oh
nice Sony dreamcast come on Sega some oh
I'm sorry get out my mistake what letter
starts with an s pretty good it just
flattened his head wrong okay I did it
all by all the night guy who does need a
3310 let's be honest he's either way
they're Dreamcast what the Dreamcast
eyes were made I totally disagree it was
up against funny what was it up against
PlayStation to the PlayStation 2 and
what was the Nintendo one that wasn't
him came well after the gamecube came
after all right i did not like the
dreamcast but i understand the nostalgia
of it there are dozens of us muffins oh
man the sidekick in the chat i can't
pronounce your name because it's just a
mash of letters that's great i want the
sidekick to come back that would be fun
I mean steadily okay so here's here's
what's going to happen you're gonna get
to 3310 it if i get to 3310 I want a
Palm Pilot back so cuz imma need
somewhere to store the information
something should stay dead I'm gonna I'm
gonna go with that the moto razr flip
phone with a big screen and android OS
that would be a lofty i'm not that lofty
that's pretty easy to put it this bad
idea i like that especially if you're
updating the OS oh it's a little bit
slicker Nokia's back baby they're kind
of completely reformed taking over yeah
they're gonna kill Apple screw the
touchscreen all right we have to wrap it
up we're going long today alright cool
