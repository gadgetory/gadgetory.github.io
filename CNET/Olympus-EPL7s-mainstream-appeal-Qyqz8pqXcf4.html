pen line is the EPL 7 an attractive
full-featured interchangeable lens model
that should appeal to people looking for
a more flexible alternative to an
advanced compact I'm Lori groanin and
this is the olympus pen ep-1 at $700
with a 4/3 sized sensor the EPL 7
competes more with advanced compacts in
the same price range than it does with
DSLRs and their larger sensors and
larger bodies it's relatively small with
a nice retro design and some nice
features and a lot of control
flexibility the most novel aspect of the
design is the flip down LCD for selfies
and groupies by constructing it to flip
down olympus didn't need to sacrifice
the available tilting angles like some
cameras with the flip up displays have
to like the rest of the pen line BPL 7
lakhs of viewfinder plus it still has no
built-in flash and instead ships with
one that fits into the hot shoe it also
has the pen shallow grip which is OK
with small light lenses but not up to
the heavier glass overall the camera
should be easy enough to learn and use
for anyone who's used a camera before
but there's still the gotcha of the
hidden menu that you have to reveal in
order to change a lot of the settings
its performance is pretty good but it
doesn't grab and lock focused fast
enough to get quickly moving subjects
you know like a squirrel as for photo
quality it's good certainly as good as
an advanced compact but it's not great
like the aps-c based interchangeable
lens models you can get decent JPEGs as
high as iso 1600 and i did manage to get
some usable ones only for viewing scale
down at settings as high as ISO 25600
but in pretty dim conditions the tonal
range overall is pretty narrow though
and has a tendency to blow out
highlights a lot more than I'd like
and shooting rod doesn't seem to help
that the movies aren't as good as I like
either and they have lots of edge
artifacts and noise at mid-range
sensitivities but they really should be
fine for people used to cell phone and
cheap point-and-shoot quality video with
the flexibility of interchangeable
lenses
cameras an attractive alternative to an
advanced compact though the latter does
tend to come with much better lenses
than the kit lens you get for the money
