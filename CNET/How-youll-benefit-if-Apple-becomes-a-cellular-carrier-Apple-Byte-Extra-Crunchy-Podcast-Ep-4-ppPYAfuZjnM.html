this is episode 4 for all of you that
I've been hanging out with as my name is
brian Tong running the show mr. Steven
Beecham good morning everyone amazing is
useful for noon afternoon now just for
all of you that are listening for the
first time just kind of clicked on that
podcast like what is this what is it
maybe you know about the oven by maybe
you don't know you guys can check it out
here's the link where you can jump on to
it on iTunes because a lot of pretty
much most people like are going to
itunes to download their podcast these
days although i use downcast also i dig
that a lot we use that but what the show
here for is everything Apple good bad we
know you love to talk about we want to
hear what you think about it we have
multiple ways for you guys again in
touch right now we are streaming live
worldwide worldwide worldwide we've got
people checking in from all over the
world right now we got periscope we got
there's like eight ways to watch the
show right periscope youtube live stream
my stream ustream know a side note i
know not sorry anyways let's just get
into it because people are wondering uh
are you guys can actually start the show
yet let's do it okay Beecham first story
I think this one is a shaker and mover
Apple is in talks to launch its own
virtual network service in the US and
Europe okay you've heard of MV a knows
where you have some of these third-party
carriers that license or you know
they're they buy space some of the
cellular spectrum from the major
carriers and then put phones on them
like for example Cricket Wireless is one
of them okay is it would be like an mvno
we hit so check this out Apple is
experimenting and looking to do this and
why is this important well recently we
know that Apple has put in that
universal sim or they're working on you
universal sim as well with cell phone
carriers to put in their phones right
we've seen it in the ipad i believe at
least the ipad air three I think the
ipad air 2 had it where if you could
slot sign on to from multiple carriers
from a single device you don't have to
buy a sprint version a t-mobile version
an AT&amp;amp;T version so all these pieces are
starting to come together if Apple does
accomplish this and they're looking to
do this this is not a given yet but
they're looking to be a virtual carrier
imagine paying for your cell phone bills
directly through Apple directly through
itunes but I think this is the hottest
thing that could happen if Apple is able
to get spectrum from these telecoms
let's say AT&amp;amp;T Verizon t-mobile and
let's say you're in an area and let's
say you have one of these Universal Sims
it would give you the ability to switch
over to the best carrier in the best
location hmm so it's multiple carriers
you do some more error one it would
support multiple care
because apple would be buying this race
from the multiple carriers and they
would have the tech if this universal
sim goes through to enable you to get
the best signal from whichever carrier
they licensed space from see when you
when i was first looking at this article
and made me seem i felt like they were
positioning themselves to become a
carrier themselves which they in essence
would basically right they would become
of course would be a fee for this yeah
yeah this ain't free they say this ain't
no uh iOS upgrade for free no you're
gonna be paying for this yeah but they
would act and serve as their own carry
but I could definitely see the benefits
from this yeah I mean totally I don't
know if you guys like this for people
one stop shop Apple they control your
lives if you're okay with that for
people that are watching on periscope
and YouTube just let us know what you
guys think I'm curious if your gut
reaction is this is a dope idea I like
this it could be very interesting
anymore competition is a good thing all
the companies are competing price is
gonna go down that's a good thing we
already for example with apples
voicemails at the moment when you leave
a voicemail they're they're stored on
the carrier because they had to work
with the carriers and partnership for
visual voicemail or if if your call
visual voicemail didn't wasn't on
verizon initially it was only on AT&amp;amp;T
because of the technology that they had
now it is on verizon but the voicemails
are actually stored on the carrier side
so now Apple could also be storing those
voicemails I know some people like I
don't know if I want that or not but in
a weird way it might be good that
they're overseeing all of this I don't
know who do you trust what are those the
voicemails you get when you leave a
message on your phone or when you send a
text and you do the voice the ones only
leave on your phone okay anyways big
news they're looking they're in talks to
launch their own service mesabi on
periscope just said Bryan's home I don't
know I mentioned that I'm sabe was like
it was like two words mo the Kemosabe
that sure everything goes up maybe maybe
now these days everyone shortening
things I think this is
a genius idea I would sign up for it if
the ability for example here in Las
Vegas AT&amp;amp;T sucks in Las Vegas verizon
kicks booty a TV sucks everywhere that's
not true I didn't say that I'd say that
he said that I'm not afraid I invite any
AT&amp;amp;T representative right across any
bridge in the bay area with me see if
you can keep a signal on your phone even
on the bart right go doesn't allow you
get a black phone and just go screen
goes black we're talking about here
locally in the San Francisco Bay Area so
your results may differ depending on
where you all live but we know what our
results are anyways apple and talks to
be mmv i know i love this idea if they
can make it work this is not something
that's gonna happen overnight this will
be years in the making but it's
something that could happen maybe in a
couple years or so we will find out that
was a report from Business Insider so
we'll see how that rolls on the biggest
kind of rumor stuff photos over the
weekend iphone 6s parts display assembly
renderings everything you can think of
leaked out online this is for people
that are watching but also I can just
kind of tell you through this cad
drawings and renderings show off and
confirm indeed what has been rumored but
from other sources at the new iphone 6s
will indeed be point two millimeters
thicker now what does that mean for us
good thing most of our cases should
still work with this phone right so you
won't have to buy a brain that's a good
thing right great i hate fine having to
find a case for every new phone that's a
good Apple that's a good Apple all right
also though it leads more credence to
the fact that we are expecting and
potentially going to see force touch on
this phone this is the technology with
the long press we were talking about it
remember I was like we're talking about
in a show before yeah where you could
have to physically press hard on the
screen and enabled you get other aspects
of control that's cool other aspects I'm
going to open up doors for so many
different types of apps apps games
everything so you guys can check out all
the leaks online and everything you've
seen but you clearly can't ignore the
fact that also with the timing of this
the
iphone 6s around the time of when they
need to confirm the parts and the actual
form factors in the final designs before
they go into production this is the time
this is why we're seeing the leaks Apple
has doubled down on security right right
Tim you you're Tim is all over that are
we gonna hear about someone like
stealing a prototype from some like yeah
some bar in San Francisco maybe yeah
maybe it's speaking out on marketing
we're gonna take a little quick tendon
speaking of San Francisco and Apple
everyone is probably heard or don't know
that Apple it's official we can talk
about it there's nothing secretive about
it Apple is planning to actually rent
out space in this building in the CBS
interactive buildings crazy in soma in
the San Francisco area we don't know
which division it is we don't know what
department it is I'm not on their
payroll yet all we know is that they're
gonna be on what the second and third
floors and we are locked out of there we
can completely lock that ever now I
think I think I know what's top secret
division is gonna actually be here
finance HR yeah HR it'd be cool if like
marketing was there and we can see that
they can make like cool i phone
commercials around our building they are
gonna do any of that but trust me I will
be knocking on the door I will try and
sneak through them find out what I can
but Apple is moving into our building
there everyone first thought it was like
some conflict of interest it's just
renting space it's somewhere like sixty
six dollars per square foot of space to
rent in San Francisco oh my god that's
like millions of dollars yeah for two
floors of space crazy pretty crazy so
just want to throw that out there just
to educate the people out there what's
going on in that but let's also talk and
kind of jump back to the iphone 6s digit
times sometimes right sometimes wrong
they like to make up stuff too let's be
honest but with the launch of the
upcoming or so called iphone 6s or 6s
plus coming up they were the report rip
claims that Apple supply chain partners
have started shipping force touch panels
and limited quantities in June before
ramping up production of the
pressure-sensitive models this month is
this
right one this is the right yeah sure
okay good this is good does it have this
other one too what's this those are just
parts okay you know just part we always
see these every year it's funny other
Apple iPhone use this is something
that's going to be super useful this
will actually probably make your Apple
watch a little more a lot more useful
according to Business Insider once again
get a nice little scoop chunk of
information Apple is preparing to launch
a voicemail service that will use Siri
to transcribe your messages oh that's
cool so you can type a message she'll
read it too well here it's actually the
other way around say someone calls you
uh-huh and you I have some I honestly
sometimes just don't listen to
voicemails do you listen every voicemail
beard I miss them I like I'm same thing
yeah I don't like I don't listen I'll
call later I know you all out there do
the same exact thing right so this Apple
is testing this right now this service
with employees that would use Siri to
answer your calls if your way or you
can't get your phone and then transcribe
them into text that's great then display
them on your phone that's cool so you
could just read what the person said I
will give them credit Syria's a lot more
accurate than it has been yeah you know
tell 542 yes you do have to fix things
when you when you transcribe on you know
if you're sending a text you do have to
fix a lot of words you do what you did
it happens you know it's so it'll
suspected I don't even know what words I
could say tub tub 42 on periscope just
wrote zzzzzz the funny thing about it is
that dude or that girl is going to use
this the most he's like oh who cares at
I think it's super useful yeah so
they're testing amongst their employees
you know again we don't answer our
voicemails all the time that's just
human nature they're testing this
internally they believe that this
feature is expected to come out in 2016
sometime so we're still ways away from
there somewhere iOS 10 I think I would
use that yeah I would definitely use it
but you would pick up every phone call
from your wife right like everybody
array hahaha now she's smart she just
text me Oh show you're all your own
you're all text base now oh yeah boy
yeah that's that's that's actually
probably end of the way that thing works
huh yeah
right guys check this out probably one
of the more exciting advancements in
technology yeah there's a there's a lot
of cool stuff that happens maybe not be
the sexiest thing we talked about
skylake processors last week the
improvement from Intel performance
graphics import formats battery life
improvement will check this out this is
another piece of the puzzle moving
forward with all this tech that's coming
out Intel and micron recently unveiled a
new memory class they're calling it 3d
cross point all right and this is this
is juicy it's 1,000 times faster and
more durable than the current NAND flash
storage that we all use in our mobile
devices and solid-state drives it's the
first new memory chip to come to the
market in 25 years wow it's 10 times
denser than the current DRAM chips used
in computers which means more data can
be stored closer to the processor and
accessed quickly a thousand times faster
my friends 3d crosspoint Ram this is
again a partnership with Intel micron
this is insane the initial capacity is
128 gigs on that little chip across to
memory layers future generations they'll
be able to increase that as well it's a
really nice and technology though we're
not going to see this rolling out any
time soon there's going to be there
they're talking about how at least maybe
initially we'll see some of this 3d
crosspoint ram be used in conjunction
with current memory because of the cost
involved it this is maybe a couple years
out but this is what we're talking about
we haven't seen again a memory
advancement like this in 25 years I
think this is one of those things that
it will def will elevate performance
across machines not a lot of time you
see like a thirty percent gain or a
fifty percent gain we're talking a lot
more than that two hundred three hundred
percent type gains it's crazy so I love
this it's not coming to your imac it's
not coming to your macbook pro but again
give it a few years this is just kind of
that stuff that's coming down the line
that we should be excited about but also
just to educate you and let you guys
know what is happening out there and
what's coming down the line I did talk
about the imax just really briefly and
according to kg I they're expecting
an update for the imac line sometime in
the third quarter of this year so I
guess actually third quarter this year
is pretty much this is the right number
right yeah except I remember yeah I
expect that we'll see some more computer
upgrade announcements just because sky
lake is rolling out apple looks like
they're skipping the Broadway line of
processors only putting a few of their
models and just waiting it out until sky
lake is available we'll see if that's
true or if broadwell becomes more
readily available for them they might go
abroad well but just the way that
they're plotting this out I've got
imagine we might even see some computers
this year leapfrog the sky lake which is
what you want to wait for either way
people that keep on asking me every week
when should i buy a machine right now
this fall time just wait till their
announcements and then make a decision
don't do anything that sounds smart plan
there is that it is that the smart thing
to do yeah would you do that I would
definitely if I knew they were coming
out with some totally different new
faster plan or platform i would
definitely wait like I you know like I'm
waiting for the next iphone 7 Oh what
are you gonna get a six no I don't know
still in the five okay I think we need
to take it just a generic poll here if
Stephen has an iphone 5 how many of you
think Stephen should upgrade to an
iphone 6s if that phone is coming out
sometime this year then you get a lot of
Hearts dude a lot of hearts all right
just to call so kind of update you guys
on what's happening with the Apple and
the BMW or the Apple car you know you
we've heard all about Apple working on
making their own version of a car like
their own i guess i don't want to call
it a wannabe tesla but they want to get
into that game right yeah first of all
when you hear the idea of apple making a
car what do you think beach I think it's
gonna be very sleek stylish sexy easy to
use and you're gonna be able to plug
your iphone into it i hope i mean i've
seen some of those drivers out there i
hope they make I don't know driving is
can be easier to use well you know it's
like open your door everything's gonna
be like play school it's gonna look like
basically the Fox you're gonna walk up
your car door will unlock because it
yeah it talks you're you
use your Apple watch is your key totally
so exactly dude if you haven't have a
watch you've got to get an Apple car as
an accessory watch exactly yeah by far
that's the smart thing to do now Apple
and BMW according to this report from
Reuters Tim Cook went over to BMWs
headquarters last year with apple senior
executives and toured BMWs factory to
learn how they manufactured the i3
electric car but also some detect they
were looking at is how they made the
body in the chassis of this car carbon
fiber-based now they didn't say that
they were going to work together but
they also said maybe BMW because it is
taking a new approach of how its
building the body of this car Apple
could also adopt that technology may be
licensed that type of technology to them
they aren't working together but they're
definitely the two companies or the
company that Apple is talking to in any
idea of actually working the car apples
not talking to Tess lap pools recruiting
employees from all these different
companies for GM and Tesla to build
their car but that are only actually
talking to BMW hmmm I wonder why I think
it's a good marriage from a standpoint
of BMW does try to target that same
quote unquote high-end percent and not
one percenters but let's say 10 or 15
percenters yeah out there that's their
target market Apple is like that don't
make any mistake Apple is not trying to
appeal to the general consumer with
their prices not yet they're good
they've gotten better but that at least
from a mentality of the audience that
they're trying to track in their
different in their different products
that that would align hmm even
mercedes-benz is even more than that I
remember back in the day when we used to
work for apple retail they had a poster
because apple didn't have much market
share at the time yeah and so the kind
of let their employees know that yes we
are cool they had this poster that said
3 / you know Apple may have three
percent of the market share but so does
mercedes-benz we're weird we are making
the best products possible hmm and
everyone in there that walked in the
store be like yeah they're right there
right three percent baby three percent
so we'll see how this all shakes out
apples car is supposed to be coming out
or at least rumored to be released in
2020
that's a long time out I don't know if I
would get a long time I don't know if
well here's the thing by that see Tesla
is so far ahead of the game right now
and yes this is not a seed the thing
about it is when Apple came in the phone
game they put out a product that was
like two years ahead of everyone else
yeah I feel that's what Tesla's right
now they're 22 23 years ahead of
everyone else if not more so they're
gonna have to if Apple is going to try
and make something more compelling by
2020 they're gonna have to leapfrog what
Tesla is doing by two to three and five
years as well I don't know if they could
do that I'm just a little bummed that
they're not talking to American car
makers this apples American company
right yeah Apple is an American company
so why won't they deal with American car
or American cars not as cool apple
what's the deal with that buddy well I
mean what are you gonna get a GM a dog
or a BMW a dodge the I dodged the eye

you know I don't know I'm just dreaming
there's you know they're all they're all
they're all friends the Apple Honda you
know the thing about it there's gonna be
no original name about this thing it's
going to be called the Apple car yeah
hike Philly generic Apple car that's it
that's it ok guys and gals oh we do like
to solicit your voicemails on this show
1 800 61 62 63 8 is the phone number we
got a little message from our friend
kool keith so we're gonna listen to him
and see what he has to say or what do
you ask us hey my name is kooky and i
just want to know is by the Apple watch
it really really really worth four
hundred dollars for the sports model 42
model band or do I didn't need to hold
off or try to pebble times the whole lot
cheaper want to ask this question please
let me know decisions decisions
accession kooky I after hearing that
voice mail i think it might
kuki kuki not cool not cool key okay
kooky like he's kooky and ah this is
kooky kooky okay I like are we going
should he go for a pebble time because
the price uh I would I the hard thing
for me to say and I don't know what you
think on this Beach them is it's never I
never want to say oh this is worth your
money because everyone kind of wrote you
know uses their money in different ways
there's things that people that i buy
that people like why would you buy that
crap yeah like I don't care about that
now but if we're looking at the entire
landscape of what's out there the smart
smart watches based on how i use my
Apple watch and bottom line is I don't
like to get annoyed with all these
notifications everyone who's telling who
says that the Apple watch like makes
them use their phone less they might be
true but they're getting way less
information and they're you getting wait
there their interaction levels have
become very simplified I'm not one of
those persons that said Apple watch take
over my life I think the people that
like them should wanted that will watch
to take over their life in it maybe it
has maybe maybe but from a value
standpoint I don't think it the sport
watch for me is worth 400 bucks I don't
know I mean I smart watches in general I
think they're all like just too big and
there's not enough functionality with
them right now so I mean maybe save your
money till something like perfect comes
out in a couple years you know they're
only gonna get better look a polluting
some improvements native apps will be
the best thing about it current apps
that have to load from your phone take
forever forever sometimes as long as 13
seconds I know firsthand how long a long
time 13 seconds by that time I could
open my phone up play Angry Birds and
then finish around and put it back in my
pocket yeah you could so I'm happy with
my casio here Geo sha sha ji shack that
tells the time it has to date j shock
haha i also the fitness stuff i think
there is a survey of people that were
using the apple watch most of them
worked out a little more but for unless
you're committed to really drastically
changing life don't tell the apple watch
can tell what is that yeah the watch is
not the
only you were gonna do it exact getting
your butt to the gym like me and Brian
we try to go to the gym every day I see
him seemed you know it's not our watch
isn't telling us to go no it's not at
all and i'm not i turn off the feature
of my watch telling me to sit stand up I
can't doesn't if you don't stand up at
every hour it says stand up I don't need
that when you're watching a movie it
went off twice during the movie and I
said this is trash yeah turn that off
steps for any device are very are it's
not it's not actually you know so you
get a rough idea yes I get it but after
use it for about two or three weeks you
kind of know how many steps you take so
you stop really using that yeah um I
think just the watch category i mean
i'll say this forever until something
blows me away it still has a long ways
to go do I like my watch yes because I
like how it looks I'm still wearing it
but I don't you know it looks cool I
paid for that crap too though I didn't
Apple them buy this for me seen it in by
this for me I paid for this crap so it's
not it's not crap i'm just saying every
quote him on that he paid for this crap
i paid meme impact paid for this crap
yeah so I paid for this it's alright six
out of ten is mine is my honest opinion
of it six out of ten right now that's
pretty good so good not great probably
not worth it I think if they dropped a
sport down to 250 I think it's worth it
250 250 to 300 is worth for the sport
199 possibly that's my I'm 199 might be
a little too low just cuz it's Apple but
do they get a video camera on there you
can watch video oh no that model will be
five hundred dollars so and yes there's
an update coming uh it's just watch os/2
will be coming out sometime this fall it
adds a few new features you can I think
the funniest one is using your watch as
an alarm clock dude it's so small it is
so small you can't read you can't tell
me you're gonna reach over and hit a
button it like 6 a.m. in the morning
yeah now I totally use my phone as an
alarm clock do you use your phone oh I
totally use my phone no one uses alarm
clocks anymore no I actually actually i
scratch that i do have an alarm clock as
a backup like I literally do that's cool
it's alright ok let's get to kind of
some of the couple of fun stories that
we have lined up here for the show
oh you may have heard of this you may
have not everyone knows about the flight
gate Tom Brady so ridiculous I don't
even need to go into the details of it
but one of the aspects of the story that
makes it fun is the fact that reports
say that Tom Brady quote-unquote
destroyed his cell phone but there's
more to it ok no don't play the I
one playthrough okay don't play the
yeah we'll play this for several plates
for sound after this okay so according
to Tom Brady he said he actually ditched
his broken samsung phone and got an
iphone 6 he turned over his cell phone
records and everything the NFL asked for
him he didn't there was nothing
necessarily hidden on his phone and
honest and at the same time he doesn't
have to turn over his entire phone over
to the NFL by law he doesn't have to Jay
were subpoenaed where was it like a
subpoena or something yeah never asked
yeah they were asking for buddy you know
it was it this is not a criminal case
this was a private investigation by a
private organization okay anyways he
brought his said his samsung phone was
broken and his iphone wasn't so we
thought that because this is really
almost like goodwill falling in Apple's
lot maybe Apple should make some sort of
promotional ad for Tom Brady so let's
just see what we were able to put
together hey Tom you've won for soups
hey Tom you've won four Super Bowls
three Super Bowl MVP awards and two
League MVPs you know when your balls are
perfect and of all people you should
know if it's not an iphone it's
not an iphone yeah you should know when
your balls are perfect tom brady yeah
why didn't he know that his balls are
perfect now he knew he knew he knew i
was doing anyways tom brady has an
iphone 6 now just for all of you that
were wondering why he had a samsung
galaxy phone or why he didn't have an
iphone he's on board with team iphone 6
well i heard to add a little to the
story i heard that he break that he
destroys his cell phones regularly as a
security precaution he's smart right so
he went when they came asking for the
phone he's like oh I already broke that
like it's all good oh yeah he just
started destroying his phones after
deflategate regularly no I think he was
doing I've he's been doing it for years
it's just something he does so I wonder
how he does it you know does he have a
tool in his house like microwaves it no
that hammers is yeah does he drive a
spike through it or something microwave
to kill the circuits hammer and then
water that's a pretty efficient
combination problem we've got a
microwave that you got to kill the data
and then get rid of get rid of
everything on the clock yeah there's a
movie about that alright wrap this up
guys on the Apple white extra crunchy my
favorite story of the wii teen years oh
my goodness this is I'm so I don't I
don't know what you think about this I
so for example music listeners people
that like dr. Dre people that don't I
don't care who you are but if you like
him you're on my boat if you're down
with dr. you're on this boat okay so
he's had this album in the works called
detox long-rumored supposed to be the
follow-up to the chronic which is
arguably one of the most iconic conic
classic albums in traffic history yes
not just wrap history in so really it's
like one of the greatest albums ever
made who I was like our soundtrack in
high school man seriously amazing
amazing stuff so he is going to base
inspired by the NWA biopic that you've
seen ads for straight out of Compton he
is now releasing this new album 16 years
later Compton a soundtrack by dr. dre
it's what it's called was gonna play a
little sound bite of him making the
announcement because we just think this
is super hot it was announced on beats
ones radio during his pharmacy podcast

dre I was leaving the SEC coming to the
studio and I felt myself just being so
inspired by the movie that I started
recording an album let's keep it under
wraps come on the album is finished

Taylor Swift obviously now they're

all-white oye was that was a dumb was
that what we're next episode was on um I

we're just gonna wrap up the show here
so we are still here tada STW if you
guys have any questions you want to ask

the next couple minutes but then we have
to go but if you guys have any questions
that you want to just ask us in general
about life love apple nate dogg was on
that album then he died recently yeah he
did God and exhibit exhibit oh yeah he's
still around he's still around how do I
get my hair up who's asking that Michael
Seymour's nine natural natural natural
okay look oh do we hit we were just
basically at 30 minutes again huh yeah
you kind of hit it right on the nose
every time why don't you all put good
apples and the show well not every story
is good not every story is super bad we
only really called off its just like
idiotic bad i mean i'm not i'm not here
to kiss their but honestly I mean are we
fans of technology yes but do we have to
tell Apple when they're doing good all
the time when they already tell that to
the world no no no plans for googs extra
any plans for Google Isha's extra
crunchy no plans yet we're just getting
this ramped up do you think I OS 10 is
going to be called iOS 10 you mean well
they call iOS they call I OS X they
refer to it as 10 still it's not x do
you have to buy music when you're paying
for Apple music the answer is no as long
as the tracks are on the Apple music
service so what makes that tricky is
that you can pay for the 999
subscription but there are still songs
that are not part that you might find on
the itunes store that are not not part
of Apple music there's no defined list
on that so the answer is no do I use
Apple music right now I do because it's
free but when it expires I personally
will not be using it that much actually
I won't I'll have it for me I have to do
it for review purposes but because of
the way it deals with itunes match or it
basically matches your collection
replaces artwork sometimes you know
messes a lot of that up i'm no i'm not
willing to trust it and it's still
happening so i missed a lot of my
artwork up to I hate that pit that's
pissed me only sucks right yeah so did
you have a backup so that you can revert
back or you kind of just dealt with it
yeah did any of your system about a year
ago I just I went crazy and I organized
all my eyes that's what I did I went
nuts yeah like I'd super anal or got rid
of all duplicates like everything that's
what I'm saying and now it's like I'll
screwed up again I was I did before I
did the upgrade i did back up like an
XML file and yeah yeah that was nervous
about it it's good
yeah we did a price by matchup right now
we give Spotify the edge for sure but
it's more than anything two main reasons
Spotify has a free version of their
service you can't really beat that and
then the way that it deals with matching
your music Spotify integrates your
current music it doesn't try to replace
it or take control of it which is what
Apple music does and by default Steven
and I we've talked about it before we're
not we like having our own music I don't
I'm still not comfortable like what
sucks is if I stopped the service and
then all those playlists and all those
songs that I created are gone like
that's just lame I just like buying the
songs i really like hey i do use Amazon
Prime music oh you do yeah I love it
because you dumped off all your music
and they're stored it yeah I mean
because I only really use that on my eye
on my iPad but um you know it's just
it's really easy to search something and
there it is boom it's pretty late I gave
my kids a bath and I kept singing so
fresh and so clean you know I thought it
was funny can I open up Apple music
search real quick i had so fresh so
clean right away it was probably
listening to you dude yeah that's scary
that is super scary um where are we
gonna be next week at what time you mean
for this well I gotta figure out my
schedule I got to talk to you about that
figured out yeah we don't know if your
later Friday that might work better
because i have a shoot in the morning
I'm gonna be away from the office for
okay Paris copers thanks for hanging out
with this we're gonna shut this down but
we appreciate it appreciate all your
vacay ketchup I'm not gonna actually
answer that hey someone called me their
