technology blind people have been
waiting for welcome to what the future
today we've got a first in human bionics
a concept vehicle aimed at disrupting
modern air travel and robotic handiwork
like we've never seen first up from the
University of Minnesota this is time
lapse video of engineers building the
world's first 3d printed bionic eyeball
now what we're seeing is the circuits
being built on a glass hemisphere that
simulates the shape of an eye it's
essentially an array of receptors that
turn light into electricity this whole
thing took just about an hour scientists
say this is still early stage technology
so don't expect to see this anytime soon
but it's a huge step toward one day
helping the visually impaired now
scientists say the next big step is
finding a way to print on a soft
material that could be implanted into a
real eye
next up the tf2 concept vehicle the
company behind it
Terrafugia thinks it could transform
on-demand travel here's the idea this
road vehicle picks you up and takes you
and your bags in a detachable pod you
travel to what Terrafugia calls a burger
port nearby a vertical take-off vehicle
meets you there and carries your pod to
avert a port near your destination again
this is just a concept right now but
consider this Terrafugia has the backing
of its parent company gilli which also
owns volvo and Terrafugia is already
working on a flying car last month it
showed off the latest version of its
transition it's a combination hybrid
electric road vehicle and propeller
driven aircraft Terrafugia says the
first production model of the
transitions will be available next year
we've never seen dexterity on a robotic
hand like this it's thanks to a special
artificial intelligence from open AI
called dactyl most of the robots you've
seen are programmed to complete tasks
like opening doors and turning valves so
they can't adapt when something goes
wrong but dactyl actually learned to
manipulate this block here's how
engineers show dactyl hundreds of
simulations then they ask dactyl to
perform a task like putting a specific
side of the block facing up this wasn't
the first time open a I had put tactile
through these simulations but this time
they started messing with it they
challenged that bill by changing up
conditions like the size of the cube and
even gravity so dactyl could learn to
deal with the unexpected dactyl studied
about 100 years worth of simulations to
get where it was in this
so that means robots still have a long
way to go before matching the human
ability to learn things relatively
quickly it's question time Alper asked
us on Facebook how far the tf2 can fly
now the answer is a little complicated
because Terrafugia is considering two
motor configurations but engineers are
predicting a range of anywhere from 315
to 555 kilometers at max payload
depending on which design is chosen all
right what makes you say WTF leave your
question in the comments below that's
gonna do it for this show
I'm Andy Altmann thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
