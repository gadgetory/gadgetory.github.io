welcome a new droid I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update amazon is
refreshing its kindle tablets and
e-readers in time for holiday shopping
but there isn't just one or two new
kindles there are seven new models
ranging from eighty dollars to three
hundred and eighty dollars if you're in
the market for one here's an easy
breakdown first let's go over the black
and white EE greeters there's a new
Kindle voyage it's two hundred dollars
it's top of the line thinner lighter the
processor is faster and the screen is
brighter the front sides have pressure
sensitive buttons for turning pages
there's also an entry-level $80 model
simply called kindle and it now also has
a touch screen as for those color screen
tablets the top of the line is the
kindle fire HDX it's the most expensive
at three hundred and eighty dollars and
it's a competitor to the ipad air you
get a sharper screen with something
called dynamic light control it changes
hughes depending on the light around you
so the screen looks more like paper when
you're reading the tablet weighs twenty
percent lighter there's a better
processor so it's faster and it also has
better audio if you want a keyboard with
a trackpad amazon will sell one for
sixty dollars for the next level down
there's the kindle fire HD it comes in
many versions you can get a six inch
screen for a hundred dollars or a 7-inch
screen for 140 dollars the displays both
are better and you can get it in a few
colors they're loaded with the same
tricks that you find on the fire foam
there's Firefly for scanning products
and the ability to create family
profiles now if you want to get this for
a kid just add another fifty dollars to
the price and you get a bonus rubber
case cover a year subscription to kid
content with free time and if it gets
smashed in the next two years amazon is
going to send you a new one all are
available for pre-order now and will
come out in October now that's not all
that's new with Amazon in the future
amazon will have websites that end in
dot by amazon just purchased the dot by
domain extension for 4.6 million dollars
amazon hasn't said what it's going to do
with dot x but google was also trying to
grab that domain in the world of apple
for those
that download the new iOS 8 you'll have
to wait a little bit before you can use
some new features in your health and
fitness apps Apple reports that it's
working to fix a bug that prevents
health kit apps from working health kit
is the hub that keeps track of data from
your health apps and the data can be
sent to doctors apple says it could be
fixed by the end of the month and if
you're more of a droid fan keep watch
for a new motorola droid phone in
october from Verizon sources tell us the
big feature in this phone will be fast
charging an extra long battery life that
