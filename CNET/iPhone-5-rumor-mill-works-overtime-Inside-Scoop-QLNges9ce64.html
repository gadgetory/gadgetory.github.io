joined by senior managing editor kent
german to talk about the latest roundup
of iphone 5 rumors hey Dora hi all right
start off by telling us about sighs
we've heard for a long time that this
iphone could be bigger yes now we're
hearing that is going to be 4 inches
screen size so latest rumors that sharp
is actually in production so they're
making 4 inch screens we've heard a
couple different sizes tossed around so
if we it is for I think it's a good
thing we need a larger screen on the
iPhone and it could also be a little bit
wider sure could be a little wider which
would be little more comfortable for
viewing video that's a feature we're
seeing another smartphone so the GaPO
could step up their bigger to me just
means harder to fit into my pocket
that's not always a good thing is it
that's a trade-off sure but Apple could
make the phone thinner that's another
room where we've heard if it is thinner
than being a little bigger you still
might be able to fit in your pocket all
right so while the size make it bigger
the connector make it a little smaller
sure you don't have people for years has
used that 30 pin connector so that's all
the current products and yet we hurt at
first 19 pin or 19 pin connector so a
little smaller that would enable a
larger battery and now we're hearing a
small as a pin connector oh wow great as
far as being convenient yeah we'll make
up a larger battery but actually kind of
inconvenient because everything that you
have all your current plugs your current
chargers wouldn't fit you have to get
something new finally tell us about
release date when is this even hitting
the public well we still don't know that
but the latest rumor we've heard is that
we could have an apple event on
September 12 where we could see the new
iphone and we could also see an actual
ipad mini so the smaller ipad and the
way that apple is releasing products
these days as soon as they announced it
it's usually available within a week or
two yeah it's usually weaker we can have
later so if it is the sep tember 12th we
could see at the week the week following
or maybe the week after that but i
wouldn't say any later than that all
right well it's gonna be an exciting few
weeks leading us well thank you so much
