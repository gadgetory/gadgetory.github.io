Google issues for everything Google you
can think of and this week it's all
about our reactions from Samsung's
unpacked event now we know it will
always be about the Galaxy s8 for
Samsung and they delivered with one of
the best-looking phones we've seen to
date at least on the front see that
screen that screen that infinity screen
sure the 2 by 1 ratio is going to be a
little odd with bigger black bars on the
sides when you're watching 16 by 9 video
when you're not it's five point eight
inches of Galaxy s8 screen and six point
two inches of s8 plus screen goodness
the home button is part of the screen on
the bottom but the fingerprint sensor
has been moved to the back and one of
the dumbest design flaws that almost
anyone outside of Samsung could have
figured out like they put the
fingerprint sensor directly next to the
12 megapixel rear camera lens
welcome to smudge ville population all
y'all with a galaxy s 8 now who approved
that come on son now the good thing the
face unlock on the phone works like a
charm but you'll still have to align
your face with the phone to do it the
phone still looks amazing it brings back
a headphone jack and it's still just as
waterproof with an ip68 rating compared
to certain phones you know without one
iPhone alright I've also got to give
props to Samsung you can always go to
the easy battery jokes but they're
taking it head on with a new eight point
battery safety check system and even
making batteries better with claims that
they won't wear out as quickly and will
still hold 95% of its charge after two
years of use you know when you'll
probably have a new phone by then
anyways you can dock the phone with
Samsung's decks that turns it into a
desktop PC we've seen it before but this
phone has the power to back it up in an
optimized version of some Android apps
to give you a full screen experience but
come on how many of you are really going
to do that not too many but it's a nice
feature
mede Bigsby also the biggest unknown how
good will Bixby their virtual assistant
really be that's still to be determined
even with our early hands on it wasn't
complete and it's still a work in
progress now we know they're making a
lot of promises for it and it's trying
to make using the s8 a whole lot easier
but at the same time it doesn't look
near
smart for grabbing general information
or things you might ask Google and
Google's assistant still looks like the
best AI on the phone right now and it's
going to get better
now the s8 is a great phone for Samsung
fans I have major screen Envy but no
phone these days is really doing enough
to convince a large amount of users to
completely switch over to a whole new
platform true now the Samsung gear VR
gets a new motion sensing controller and
support for the new s8 phones it's a
nice add-on that others have but the
product I'm most excited about from this
keynote is the 2017 Samsung gear 360 the
first gen was one of the best ones last
year but you know a little awkward to
carry around because it was basically a
big eyeball round bulge if you put in
your pocket which I did the new one is
much smaller with the dual fisheye
lenses at 8.4 megapixels for each sensor
the battery is in the handle it's part
of the camera and you get two hours of
shooting in 2k resolution with
recordings on a micro SD card and yes
it's still dust and water resistant you
can live stream to YouTube Facebook or
Samsung VR 2 but will it work with
periscope come on some get on it now the
best feature you can use it with is the
newest 8 at 7 at 6:00 is a note 5 but
you can also use this with the iPhone 7
7 plus 6 s 6s plus + se with Mac OS
desktop software available for viewing
and editing I know which 360 camera I'm
getting on the go pricing is not set but
it will cost less than last year's 350
dollars alright the keynote was good for
Samsung users but the post keynote buzz
was really not that big of a deal I
threw out a poll and yes there's a lot
of people that follow me that use
iPhones but still of the 38 percent of
people remaining that our team samsung
only 12% of you can't wait to get one
now if this phone was really a big deal
for you all it should be a lot higher
than that but it's not now the rest of
you weren't convinced and even more of
you were turned off after the note 7 to
me and many of you the Galaxy s8 has an
amazing screen probably the best design
right now on the front but doesn't
really have anything else that truly
makes it a must-have phone we'll find
out you can email me at Google issues at
cnet.com or tweet me at Bryant on to let
me know what you think
about the s8 and we'll put some of your
feedback in the show next week and if
you write nice YouTube comments I might
use those too otherwise I'll just read
the ones that tear away at my soul and
break me down little by little day by
day thanks for watching now we will
catch you all next time for some more of
that Google ishes delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
