takes place in Berlin is well underway
here's just some of our favorite new
tech announced at the show first up is
the Samsung gear s2 this new SmartWatch
from Samsung goes head-to-head with the
Apple watch and lets you navigate
through menus by twisting this dial
Samsung is also promising two to three
days of battery life next how many
pixels do you need Sony's Xperia z5
premium smartphone has a 4k screen as
well as a 23 megapixel camera sony says
the phone will upscale your regular
video to 4k though there's definitely a
question as to whether that extremely
high resolution actually makes a
perceptible difference speaking of
resolution samsung has unveiled an Ultra
HD blu-ray player this player will
handle Ultra HD blu rays which is going
to be the next generation of disc based
media following on from blu-ray the
format packs a 4k resolution but we
wonder how popular it will prove given
the rise of streaming services like
Netflix next big brother is watching you
or watching the contents of your fridge
at least the Bosch series 8 light of no
frost refrigerators feature a camera
that lets you spy on your food the idea
is to let you take a quick peek remotely
and find out what ingredients you're
missing finally another smart watch it's
Motorola's redesigned moto 360 also
known as the Moto 360 fashion this
classy looking gadget comes in two sizes
and unlike the gear s2 runs Android wear
which is google's operating system for
smartwatches that's all for now but
there's plenty more to see from the show
so make sure you head to cnet com /
