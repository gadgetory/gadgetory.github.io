incandescent bulbs you're doing it all
wrong incandescent lighting is an old
outdated technology it's like choosing
to use a CRT monitor over a thin flat
panel display the main issue with
incandescent is their energy efficiency
ninety percent of their energy goes to
heat and only ten percent goes to light
it's time to switch to LEDs just a few
years ago LED bulbs could cost as much
as fifty dollars a pop so I get why you
didn't go for it but today you can buy
some of the best LED bulbs for less than
ten dollars and it gets better LEDs can
save you up to eighty percent on your
electricity bill thanks to their 20-year
life span that's like five Winter
Olympics and they're not just cost
effective they're also smart you have
empty on bulb so I can sync with your
nest thermostat and it can even be
controlled with series there's also the
Philips hue bulbs it can be controlled
with your phone and display a range of
color with so many options for LED bulbs
there's no excuse not to make the switch
and now you're doing it right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
