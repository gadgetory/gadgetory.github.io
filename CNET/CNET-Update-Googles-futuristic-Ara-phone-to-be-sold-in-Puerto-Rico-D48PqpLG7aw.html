soon be a snap I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update google has
released some details about its phone
that lets you swap hardware parts
Google's are a smartphone is a new
concept instead of buying a new phone
every two years you could just upgrade
individual pieces like a screen or
camera or processor by snapping parts in
and out like Legos the goal is to have
20 to 30 interchangeable parts that you
can choose from google will start a
pilot for the arra phone in Puerto Rico
and use that research data for a global
launch google has a few other projects
taking shape with a new app students can
phone in their homework so to speak
Google classroom has a new mobile app to
help teachers and students track school
assignments right now there are more
than 40 million students teachers and
staff using google apps for education
the classroom mobile app is part of this
and it lets students attach files to
assignments or use the camera on the
phone or tablet to attach photos for an
assignment so if you forget to bring in
your homework maybe someone at home can
take a photo of it for you and turn it
in with the app it's available for
Android and iOS google also officially
announced its update to the Google
Translate app that's rolling out over
the next few days for iOS and Android it
can instantly translate audio and text
into your native language so if you're
having a conversation with someone in
person that you can't understand just
hold the phone between you both and it
will translate each person back and
forth with less lag time skype also
recently rolled out a new instant
translation for voice chat so we're
getting closer to that world of Star
Trek for the universal translator
Facebook's also innovating although it's
arguable if you can really call this
innovation there's a new app called
Facebook at work you can create a work
facebook account that's separate from
your personal Facebook account the
things you share with a work account can
only be seen by other people at your
company and that means your company has
to sign up for facebook at work it also
takes away the fun of complaining about
your co-workers on Facebook wall at work
but Facebook is doing this to compete
with other workplace collaboration
messaging
tools like Microsoft's Yammer social
caste in convo but Facebook doesn't have
a way to share documents with your
co-workers at least not yet and speaking
of new things that aren't really new
things Nintendo is releasing its
extra-large 3ds to the US on februari
13th for two hundred dollars but it
doesn't come with an AC power adapter so
that doesn't make much sense it does
work with older chargers if you have one
aside from the larger screens the 3ds XL
has improved face tracking 3d a faster
processor a second analog mini stick two
extra shoulder buttons and built-in NFC
to work with those amiibo game figurines
