crowning glory of Samsung's vast array
of Galaxy devices in this special
episode of adventures in tech we explore
how Samsung forged its galactic gadgets
Empire
as the galaxy s5 becomes official
Samsung is the biggest smartphone maker
in the world in 2013 it was estimated to
have shipped 320 million of the
blighters the most ever sold by any
company in a single year the galaxy
brand has become a tech superpower but
thinking back to Samsung's first Android
phone that didn't seem like a likely
outcome the Samsung Galaxy had an AMOLED
screen and a decent camera but it was a
long way behind
HTC's hero or the iPhone 3GS in short it
was the kind of phone we expected from a
company best known for blu-ray players
and laptops Samsung surprised us though
following its first effort with the
galaxy s and then the stunning s2 in
2011 these high-end marvels focus
strongly on cutting-edge hardware and
shot Samsung to the front of the
smartphone race the Galaxy S and s2 was
so exciting but in retrospect perhaps
our attention should have been on
samsung's less fancy phones alongside
the s2 came four basic Android Mobile's
that were tough to tell apart more
followed including new tablets and as
2011 war on Samsung overwhelmed the
markets with a deluge of devices it
seemed a little over-the-top but then it
clicked Samsung had made sure that no
matter where you were in the world or
how much cash you had to spend there was
a galaxy gadget for you it did raise
questions though about how exactly
Samsung comes up with new phones
5:23 is the size on the screen but what
is the clock speed to gigahertz and
we'll call it the samsung galaxy legs s
Samsung got creative some experiments
like the projector packing Galaxy Beam
didn't take off others did though such
as the massive stylus wielding Galaxy
Note which at 1 million sales in just
two months
this manic production of almost any
gadget imaginable is the core of the
galaxy philosophy by building so many
different devices Samsung spreads the
risk compared this strategy with that of
Apple which only makes a few things a
year so can't afford any missteps by the
end of 2011 Samsung had overtaken Apple
as the world's largest smartphone maker
over the next few years
even more stars to its galaxy including
boundary-pushing high-end hardware
variants on existing products new types
of device entirely and of course more
budget phones today there are so many
Galaxy devices that animating them all
has killed my video producer yes I need
a new one because it's all just someone
quickly alright Oh see if you've got one
in blue because it will match my eyes
Samsung's rise to power wasn't without
casualties leaving the once-proud HTC
struggling for cash and also pummeling
Nokia which before Samsung used to be
the king of cheaper Mobile's as the
galaxy s5 becomes official Samsung
couldn't be in a stronger position the
s5 plays it safe in many respects with a
similar design and a screen that's only
slightly bigger than that of the s4 but
there's a hint of Samsung's quirky
typical Flair with the heart rate
monitor strapped to the back some people
will love the s5 others are bound to
call it underwhelming for what the
galaxy story teaches us is that it's the
bigger picture that counts the s5 will
steal the headlines but it's the sheer
size of the galaxy Empire that gives
Samsung its strength making it tough for
would-be rivals to find a foothold
Samsung needs to take care though if its
flagship phones aren't popular it could
run out of cash to spend on its legions
of other devices its galaxy here to stay
or our samsung's fortunes about to
change and what do you think of the s5
let me know and check back next time for
