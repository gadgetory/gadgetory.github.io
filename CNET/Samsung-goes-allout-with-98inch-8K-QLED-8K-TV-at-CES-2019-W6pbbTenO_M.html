hello everyone at Amazon Prime video we
are committed to growing our incredible
library of licensed and original content
we're also committed to improving the
picture quality of the content we offer
our Prime members globally just as we
did when we introduced HDR 10 plus
programming for the first time through
Samsung TVs for our customers globally
we believe these groundbreaking
advancements in artificial intelligence
will significantly upgrade how our
viewers watch their favorite shows we
couldn't be more excited to work with
Samsung to deliver our prime original
content in the most true-to-life quality
Samsung's AI codec with deep learning
algorithms highly compresses the
streaming video so we can bring great
content to more customers globally even
those with low bandwidth and constrained
at work conditions now more people can
enjoy 4k content today and in the future
8k content - as a result Samsung TVs
offer an incredible Amazon Prime video
