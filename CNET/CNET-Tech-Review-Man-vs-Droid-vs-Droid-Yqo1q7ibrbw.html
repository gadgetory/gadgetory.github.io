buzz report goes to comic-con apple
works its magic again HTC and motorola
face off in a drawing on droid
prizefight and I count down our top five
back-to-school tech pics it's all coming
up right now
hello folks and welcome to the cnet tech
review rounding up our hottest videos of
the week and telling you what's good and
what's bad in the world of tech and
offering up some tech wisdom in the form
of the bottom line I'm Brian Cooley in
from Hollywood let's start off with the
good stuff last week while I was filling
in on this show for Molly she was off
gallivanting around the San Diego
Convention Center covering comic-con for
the buzz report and once you see the
required outfit I think you'll be glad
that she went instead of me
hi I'm Molly would welcome to the bus
report special report from comic-con
comic-con is about so much more than
comics as you know there's video games
TV movies speaking of video games tell
us a little red Falcon Armageddon
and then of course comic-con is all
about promoting movies there's movies
that are coming out like Battlefield LA
Green Hornet kind of owns this show then
there's movies that are just cool and
geeky like transformers you've got
people getting in and out of pods for
aliens because it's coming out on
blu-ray and there's this nice big booth
for tron featuring the light cycle which
I think I'm totally going to steal
because it looks hella fast you turn
that off real quick TV big deal here at
comic-con lost was pretty much made here
true blood is huge CBS is premiering its
new show Hawaii five-o here and then AMC
has this new show called blocking dead
I want to go now can we go now are we
done also Big Bang Theory huge a comic
con who knew
in a hot dense state the nearly 14
billion years ago expansion started
waving ganna coolio trove began to drew
Neanderthal develop toes
another huge trend at comic-con toys
figurines and collectibles for example
collectibles for the very serious
collector what are you guys in line for
the Hasbro booth here as Bros toy shop
you needed a ticket all weekend but
right now there's no ticket needed so no
fight are there actually are there new
toys being released that you're excited
about yes it's a pre-release right yeah
they're doing a lot of the some special
edition toys and releases I'm the new
sergeant slaughter figure from GI Joe
they're debuting here and then I guess
they're going to be available on
hazardous website or that's what they've
done every other year so see and so
normally you had to get a ticket how you
actually I went to this yesterday you
have to go upstairs wait in line for
about two hours to get a ticket to wait
in line for another five hours to get a
ticket so it's really not worth it
unless you want to go put it on ebay and
make money but i just want sergeant
slaughter so I'm good
also turns out comic-con is kind of hot
as in horny it's Marilyn Monroe with
Mickey Mouse boobies and although it may
not seem like it anymore comic-con is in
fact still about comics actually super
serious comics we are currently in the
presence of greatness in Wonder Woman
greatness alone they have in this glass
case the first appearance of Wonder
Woman Wonder Woman's first cover and the
first issue of Wonder Woman plus in this
case there's like the first Superman
which is going to go on auction the
first Batman it's unbelievable and I'm
not going to touch anything because most
of this costs as much as my house
the other thing everybody will tell you
about comic-con is that it is all about
the unbelievable costumes
thank you you know yesterday I got my
picture taken a lot as Mollywood hosted
the bus reported buzz out loud but then
i put this costume on and everyone wants
to take my picture as Wonder Woman thank
you have I mentioned how much I love it
here ok so you got your movies your TV
your comic books your costumes and then
there's just everything else and that's
it for the bus report I'm Hollywood
thanks for watching just leave me here
I'm with my people
I like yes Jack Sparrow we get it we
like her too and we'll be glad when
she's back here on the cnet tech review
next week earlier this week Apple
announced a host of upgrades to their
imac mac pro and cinema display lines
that's all well and good and if you want
to see those reviews head over to cnet
TV com now there weren't any real
earth-shaking Apple developments but
there was one little peripheral that
really piqued my interest take a look hi
I'm Scott Stein senior associate editor
at cnet com and this is the new Apple
Magic Trackpad an apples made a lot of
multi touch devices recently the ipad
the iphone their macbook and macbook pro
lines with their tremendous multi-touch
touch pads that are also clickable the
people who are left out desktop Mac
users but not anymore Apple has made
this device to essentially take that
multi-touch click pad that's on a
macbook or a macbook pro remove it and
make it a bluetooth device for your
desktop that's pretty much exactly what
it is for $69 it's not exactly cheap but
it does offer some great feel if you're
used to using a macbook or a macbook pro
it feels exactly like that but even
bigger and it has inertia lulling which
is a new feature on macbook touchpads in
addition it has click zones it has touch
to tap it has three finger and
forefinger even multi-touch so all that
stuff they're used to in the macbook and
macbook pro experience one thing that's
really nice about the design is it lies
completely flush with the bluetooth
keyboard that comes with imax so it
really feels like a one-piece type
design you could put it right next to it
or split it apart I think it actually
looks nicer even with that keyboard than
without and that's pretty much it
accepts double-a batteries or
rechargeable batteries in fact apple has
released a battery charger addressing
the fact that you're going to be having
a lot of bluetooth devices between a
keyboard a trackpad and a mouse now
while this magic trackpad is meant to be
used on Macs and you're going to get all
that multi-touch support on max Apple
does say that it works with Windows
devices you'll have to play around and
see how it works for yourself you'll
also need a software update which should
be available now which enables all
the track pads configuration elements
you leave that in order to enable touch
to tap or click zones or any additional
configurations that you want to like you
have on your macbook and macbook pro so
for those of you who have never used a
macbook or macbook pro large trackpad
what you're looking at here this entire
surface is a multi-touch trackpad but
also it's all clickable the bottom part
and even the top part is clickable
thanks to the way this is seated just to
let you know so you can move across this
but you can also click on it anywhere
now this is meant to replace a mouse not
exactly although it could for many
people certainly all of the multi-touch
and clicking can be used to the capacity
that you were to use a mouse we really
do like a mouse for a lot of its
accuracy and we've enjoyed apples mice
recently quite a bit it's going to be up
to the user to decide certainly they're
aiming for this to become a mouse
replacement potentially in the future we
wondered it seen it will the minus ever
really die well maybe this is another
step towards it I'm Scott Stein and this
is apple's new magic trackpad goofy name
aside I like the magic trackpad in fact
if it works with my iPad and my apple
bluetooth wireless keyboard I can kind
of cobble together a next-generation
laptop sort of here's something else I
probably won't be doing this year
running out to buy an electric car but
that doesn't mean they're not worth
looking at maybe just a little further
down the road check out my test drive
now in the midst of ishii I'm ease its
cheeks look full of acorns its belly
full of lithium and it's on track to hit
us showrooms late in 2011 this
Mitsubishi is more proof that electric
cars are here or finally back depending
how bitter you are about GM's EV one
anyway let's get in the Mitsubishi I
meet and check the tech
let's walk the architecture of our
chubby cheeked little friend and it all
starts back here in the engine room
that's where pretty much everything
lives on this car underneath this cover
we find the guts of what makes an EV run
first we have an ECU an electronic
control unit that runs all kinds of
things from power output to the use of
power for heater or air conditioner
regeneration to power when you're
coasting or braking very important box
you've also got an inverter it takes the
DC power that comes out of a battery
turns it into the AC power that the
motor needs that motor by the way is
underneath here a 330 volt motor rated
at 63 horsepower and about a hundred and
thirty foot pounds of torque it's hooked
up to a transmission but it doesn't
change gears it's a one speed it's a
reduction box really now where are the
batteries those live around the side
actually the batteries are kind of
invisible part of the relative genius of
Mitsubishi she's packaging but they've
done is they've stuck them underneath
the floor in the passenger compartment
so you don't see them and that's good
now how do you charge those batteries
here's one way this is the fast way this
is the quick charge port that would
require a special quick charge device
that's going to give you an 80% charge
in just 30 minutes but more likely
you're going to charge on this side of
the car where we have the lower voltage
port in here you've got to hook up for
this charging gun that just clicks right
into place and it goes to either a 110
connection or you can take off the
adapter here and you've got a 220 plug
here's the problem you got to pack a
lunch using either of these 14 hours for
a full charge on 110 7 on 220 but at
least you'll find them in a lot of
places now even taking this car home to
charge up isn't problem free I had to
try three different outlets to find one
on a 15 amp circuit that had a light
enough load that it wouldn't throw a
breaker while the car was charging and
your garden-variety medium duty
extension cord not a good idea it only
adds to the bottleneck of getting
current into this thing carry a heavy
duty cord along with this car's fairly
short one
beside the eye whoa okay that's the
first weird things is a right hand drive
car Japan domestic market products
another indication this guy's not ready
for prime time in the left hand driving
part of the world yeah but inside the
car we have a modest amount of
technology this is not a cabin tech
story folks the radio will tell you that
and I mean radio that's a good old 1980s
era single din am FM CD that isn't the
point although you can get a double din
LCD in dash nav at least that's what
they envisioned for this car now under
the instrument panel that's where this
car gets really interesting left gauge
that's your charge like a gas gauge and
your gear indicator will get to the
gears in a minute well the gear in the
middle you've got your speedo and
kilometers in this case around it is a
mode indicator with a dial that needle
will show when you're charging on the
far left there let's regen either
coasting or breaking then you've got a
little eco band when you're driving very
lightly the way that it wants you to for
best range and then you got a big old
fat power area when you're really
getting into it and tapping the
kilowatts on the rights of multifunction
gauge I usually kept it in the remaining
range mode like you see there tells you
how far you got to go before you're
calling a cab now I have an issue
between that and the other gauge which
shows charge they don't really agree the
charge gauge right now shows what about
Oh 75% charge but that range gauge only
shows 59 kilometers which is about fifty
percent of the possible range so
somewhere these two were working on
different algorithms now on to that gear
lever pretty common stuff until you get
down the bottom of the gate so Park
reverse neutral Drive we all understand
that then there's eco then there's be
here's how these work drive gives you
access to the cars full power and
standard regeneration profile when
you're coasting or breaking eco gives
you very limited power and aggressive
regeneration be gives you access to the
power of D with the aggressive region of
eco is how it kind of sorts out 0 to 60
yes in about 13 or 14 seconds top speed
around 80 miles per hour range about a
hundred miles is the promise but after a
full charge overnight we only saw a max
of 80 kilometers on the distance to dead
gauge
okay what's it like to drive one of
these guys well the first thing you
notice is the quiet and not just the
quiet but the overall lack of sound you
don't have the engine revving and
running and vibrating you don't have the
gearbox with its vibration and harshness
you also don't have the gear changes
that are constantly giving you inputs as
phases of the engines operation change
all those things add up and you don't
realize how distracting and how noisy in
the broad sense a combustion car ISM
when that all goes away the electric
vehicle like this one feels very nimble
very speedy and very effortless on the
downside I find I'm always
second-guessing their way on using the
car because I'm concerned about
remaining state of charge so you drive
in a very shall we say Prius owner kind
of way which means you're doing good
things for your range but not
necessarily good things for traffic flow
you know I also was driving earlier
today it was kind of cold but I didn't
turn the heater on because I know that
takes electricity to heat the fluid that
goes into the heater radiator I said go
on a risk it you make friends everywhere
you go in this I mean I find partly
because the car is cute that Chevy
chipmunk look in the front is kind of a
heart melter at the same time people do
think it's awfully small even though I
don't think it's that small it's a hell
of a lot bigger than a smart fortwo but
it does print very sort of petite and it
prints very narrow to and generally
speaking aside from the powertrain and
the way that you behave to accommodate
it it's like driving what a honda fit it
feels like a very similar kind of car ok
let's price this little mitsui I'm Eve
as well as we can I love right-hand
drive born to be a mail carrier okay
about thirty thousand dollars is the
word very roughly for a rival in maybe
q4 of 2011 a full year after let's say
the Nissan Leaf but if that is the price
and if the 7500 dollar tax credit from
the feds is still in place we have a low
twenty-thousand-dollar car here that is
simply fun to drive and gets a great
public reaction folks think it's really
cute want to scoop it up and take it
home and give it a hot bath and a meal
if this is all true Mitsubishi might
have a hit on their hands now if that
little electric chipmunk didn't sate
your appetite for v's keep an eye on
cnet TV com for our upcoming video on
the nissan leaf which is coming to
market soon it's pretty impressive ok
folks time to take a break but come
right back to find out how to take your
iphone 3g back to the way it was right
after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV I'm
Brian Cooley continuing on with the good
the end of summer still a ways off but
for some parents the start of another
school year can't come soon enough
whether they've got wide-eyed freshman
or seventh year seniors I've got a few
tech suggestions for how to start the
semester off rights
you can't begin to help your kid pick
back-to-school clothes please don't but
give me a few minutes and I can probably
make you less than useless when it comes
to picking back-to-school tech I'm Brian
Cooley with a top five best
back-to-school tech products according
to our editors here at SEMA starting
with number five audio engine five yeah
I had a big WTF bubble over my head too
until I checked out the review these are
great sounding powered speakers plus
they have two inputs to their booming 50
watt per channel amp a USB port for
charging your portable wallet plays
through one of those inputs just overall
a great marriage of pc speakers and
stereo speakers and also a great
marriage of dorms and loud music number
for the sony playstation 3 now you may
think of this as the ultimate screw off
device but well it is the console itself
is now slimmer games are in hi-def
blu-ray movies since the get-go and now
adding netflix streaming often an HD
approach this guy as reverse psychology
your kid might get so sick of great
entertainment that homework will be a
refreshing change number three the
barnes &amp;amp; noble nook now in the time it
will take for the ipad to kill off this
entire category we think the nut can
earn off its low price the Wi-Fi only
version is under 150 bucks has that cool
color LCD for navigating has expandable
storage a changeable battery generous
book loaning ability and it handles PDF
and epub docks which at least makes it
possible for school materials number two
the iphone 4 is not our pick no we give
the editors choice to the competing HTC
droid incredible it's fast in every way
on a great network does a great job with
that android operating system which is
hot as a pistol these days and has an 8
megapixel camera and a bigger screen
than the iphone and it doesn't have the
cloud of funky antenna issues looming
over its head before we get to our
number one top tech product for
back-to-school a lot of folks email
here asking how the folks at cnet
editors and others got our jobs that
scene that what did we study well we did
a little straw poll here's what we found
out English is number one disproving at
least for the time being that you can't
get a job after that tied with that with
journalism and communications then comes
a big middle section of marketing
degrees Business Administration drama
and musical theatre that explains brian
Tong and art then you get to computer
science butting up against religious
studies okay now time to reveal our
number one tech product for back to
school it's apple's ipad now first the
bad news your kid will be late to every
class because they'll constantly be
stopped by people who want to look at
the ipad touch it ask them how they like
it it just hasn't lost its mojo yet now
the good news is the ipad is a netbook
an e-reader a gaming device a photo
frame and a large screen ipod music and
video all at once team that up with
apple's slick bluetooth keyboard and you
can really get some serious work done on
it that's the good news for the full
details on these top-notch tech products
for back-to-school go to back to school
cnet com i'm brian cooley thanks for
joining us for this top five
also be sure to check out Brian tongs
favorite back-to-school smartphone apps
on his latest episode of tap that app
that's up right now at cnet TV com now
let's move on to the bad when Apple
announced the iphone 4 and its new
operating system iOS four the company
was very upfront about the fact that
this new operating system wouldn't give
iphone 3g users all the same benefits of
users of the later models naturally that
didn't stop many 3g users from
installing the upgrade anyway and
quickly regretting it that's where
Beatty comes to the rescue and shows you
how to go back to the way it was a lot
of you iphone 3g owners may have
upgraded to the latest iOS four but if
you aren't really happy because your
phone seems more sluggish or you aren't
getting the benefit of multitasking
anyways you probably wish you could go
back i'm brian songs from cnet com and
i'll show you how to downgrade your
iphone 3g back to iphone OS 3.1 point
three
now big things to lifehacker for showing
me how to complete the downgrade process
this method has worked consistently for
iphone 3g users but as always proceed
with caution now to get started we'll
need to have a few things in place first
up get the restore file for the iphone
OS 3.1 3 now it still might be on your
computer's hard drive from previous
updates so on a Mac look for it here and
for Windows users you can find it at
this location on your hard drive if you
can't find it head on over to I
clarifies website where all the software
updates have been archived and look for
this specific file you'll need one more
piece of software called wreck boot it's
mac and windows compatible and you can
download it from this location it's a
utility that will help us finish the
downgrade process alright let's get to
it the first thing you want to do is
connect your phone to your computer and
then power it down by holding the power
sleep button and sliding to power off
once it's off hold the power button and
the home button together for 10 seconds
then remove just your finger from the
power button and remain holding down
just the home button for 10 more seconds
this will put the phone into device
firmware update mode now if you did it
correctly itunes will show a prompt that
it sees a phone in recovery mode and you
can press ok you'll see your phone in
the devices sidebar in itunes and make
sure you click on it then to initiate
the downgrade process on a Mac hold the
option key on your keyboard and press
the restore button with your mouse from
Windows users hold down the shift button
while you click restore now you'll have
to locate the iphone OS 3.1 3 firmware
file and select it as the one you want
to restore your phone with the restore
process will start and it takes about 10
minutes once it's done you'll probably
see an error message like this one and
your phone will show a connect to itunes
screen but don't worry guys this is
totally normal now open up the wreck
boot app we downloaded and click exit
recovery mode you're going to want to
wait a few seconds and your phone will
then get out of recovery mode and will
now be ready to sync with itunes with
the previous iphone OS 3.1 3 installed
now i want to emphasize this is
specifically for the iphone 3g this does
not involve any jailbreaking and you
might have different results but this
worked for us but that's how you
downgrade your iphone 3
from iOS 4 20 s 3.13 use it wisely okay
all in all not a terribly hard fix but
it's a shame folks have to do it at all
and the Apple could just install some
kind of master undo button on iTunes and
now it's time for this week's bottom
line with so many different flavors of
droid phones out there now picking the
right one can be a vexing proposition so
let's make it even worse let's pit two
droid phones against one another in the
prize fight ring to see which one is the
winner now the droid incredible has a
one in one prize fight record so far and
BTS back to show us how it stacks up
against it's cocky newcomer
what's up prize fight fans i'm brian
Tong and we have another blockbuster
battle for you it's a prize fight put
gel between the HTC droid incredible and
the motorola droid x our judges for this
fight our senior editor Bonnie boom-boom
chopped senior associate editor Nicole
heights coldly and you know who all
night long Tom will take all three
judges blind scores and average them out
to the nearest tenth each round the
final prize fight score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system get ready for some droid
on droid action first round of sexiness
and durability the droid incredible has
a compact and slender profile that fits
in your hand it's rubberized surface can
take a beating and even if the ladies
like the topographic design I'm still
not a fan of the triple layer booty now
the droid x has a whopping 4.3 inch
screen for its main attraction but this
phone is large it's not comfortable to
hold and it's even taller and less
pocket friendly than another prize five
favorite the evo 4G translation this
thing is huge the incredible takes this
round with the 4.3 and the droid x gets
a 3.7 next round his controls and user
interface the incredible features HTC's
Sense UI and its hands down our favorite
flavor of Android with its elegance and
customization and it really makes
Android less intimidating to newbies
even with its learning curve Nicole and
Bonnie didn't like the optical joystick
but it doesn't take away from the device
for me the joy tax to get some love here
for its ro physical navigation buttons
and the superhot swype keyboard option
built in but the motoblur interface
isn't as polished as the sense UI and
why did they decide to swap the home and
menu buttons that are pretty much the
same on all flagship android phones this
one's close but the incredible just gets
the edge of the 4 and the droid x gets a
3.7 after averaging two rounds the
incredible leads by half a point but
there's plenty of fight left round three
is features
these phones are almost identical under
the hood with 3g Wi-Fi Bluetooth and GPS
they bring all of androids goodies like
voice search batting cages GPS
turn-by-turn directions and voice to
text what's shakin bacon but the droid x
is the new kid on the block and being
able to use it as a mobile hotspot and
hook it up to a TV with its hdmi out put
it on top the droid x takes its first
round with a 4.7 and the incredible gets
of for next round is web browsing and
multimedia when it comes to web browsing
to multimedia these guys are almost
carbon copy clothes of each other
browsing is pretty smooth on both phones
and they feature multiple windows and
bookmark previews now the incredible
features HTC Sense UI media player which
is elegant and cleaner compared to the
droid x is standard player which really
needs some help but forget about all
that the droid x is 4.3 inch screen
enhances every experience by making web
surfing looking at photos and watching
movies that much better x marks the spot
and the droid x gets off / pick 5 and
incredible get 24 so after averaging
four rounds the droid x has gained
control leading by two tenths of a point
but this is still anyone's fight the
final round at the sides at all is
called quality and performance we've
tested these phones in different
environments from New York City to the
Northern California suburbs and San
Francisco the incredibles call quality
was mixed with Nicole and I experiencing
more clicks and fuzz compared to the
droid x Bonnie had a signal with no
flaws and it was pristine in the NYC but
I've heard better phones from verizon
now we were also able to squeeze out a
solid five and a half hours of battery
juice when talking over 3g and that is
impressive now the droid x was equally
as good in New York for Bonnie with
excellent call quality but Nicole and I
still heard a few pops and breaks over
here our labs were able to pump out
seven and a half hours of talktime on
the droid x and that's even more
impressive performance is king and in
the final round the droid x gets a 4.7
and incredible gets of four so let's
average out all five rounds
and in a prize fight where the
incredible took the early lead the droid
x kept chipping away and takes this
battle 4.4 to 4.1 and is your prize
fight winner both of these phones are
great pics for verizon but in this case
size and features matter i'm brian song
thanks for watching we'll catch you guys
next time on another prize fight
I'll get you some ice for that hand BTW
the bottom line this week this time
bigger is better bigger screen bigger
battery bigger bang for your buck of
course you may have to go to your tailor
and get some bigger pockets sewn onto
your clothes well that's our show for
this week everybody Molly's back next
week with an all new tech review until
