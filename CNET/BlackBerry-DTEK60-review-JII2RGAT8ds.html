60 the design based off the Alcatel idol
4s has the same lovely five and a half
inch 2560 by 1440 pixel AMOLED display
but the DTEC 60 has a faster processor
more memory and a higher megapixel
camera the DTEC 60 is slightly thinner
than the idol 4s and the edges are
smoother and more rounded some of you
might remember the BlackBerry detect 50
billed as the world's most secure
Android smartphone the Detex 60 like its
little brother makes security and
privacy a priority I like the security
gauge that shows you how secure your
phone is overall but the best feature
the battery in our video playback test
it lasted a little over 14 hours I also
like the fantastic on-screen keyboard
and the BlackBerry hub app that allows
you to have all your accounts and
notifications in one place then there's
the camera it's a little bit of a mixed
bag it has 21 megapixels and shoots 4k
video and good light it focuses well in
the images have good detail but the
camera lacks optical image stabilization
and in low-light images get quite noisy
there's also a customizable convenience
key to quickly open up apps like the
camera but I wish the convenience key
functioned when the phone's display is
in sleep mode like the Alcatel Idol 4s
it would just make things more
convenient look this is one of the
nicest phones BlackBerry has released in
a long time it's filled with useful
features and secure software but it
misses out on being fun if you're like
I'm using a scientific calculator and
maybe that's the point maybe this is
supposed to be the best work phone
because it will ensure you're using it
to be productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
