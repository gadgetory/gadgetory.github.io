welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
we've got news plus a special superhero
giveaway on this week's show to the
stories and more purported iPad 5 cases
have made their way online this time
from tactus com showcasing the mini
inspired design that even includes a
clear plastic mock-up of the iPad 5
engadget also posted their own photos of
cases leaking out of Hong Kong the gray
case is the ipad 4 and the blue case is
the alleged iPad 5 design so you can see
the subtle difference in size with these
pics and a possible thinner design now
that supports to see that article with
NPD DisplaySearch analysts that claimed
the iPad 5 may shed some of its
thickness by trimming LEDs and sporting
a thinner backlight the article says
they expect apple to also shift to a
film-based touch sensor which will
reduce thickness as well and the design
could be closer to the thinness of the
ipad 2 now the general consensus is
still a third-quarter target date for
its release also apples I radio service
is coming sooner rather than later after
a report from the verge claims the big a
has reached the final stages of
negotiations and is expected to sign its
first internet radio licensing agreement
with universal music group now warner
music is also close behind according to
their sources you know I'm just excited
that Apple has pretty much locked down
Universal so I can listen to great
artists like Carly Rae Jepsen now talks
with Sony Music Entertainment still
aren't anywhere close to a deal with
Apple so I'm sorry rkelly fans you have
to win
Apple's initial lowball offer was six
cents per 100 songs streamed or about
half of Pandora's rate but now the
report says Apple pay rates are nearly
neck-and-neck with Pandora all right
guys let's check out the app of the week
this week it's not a new app but it's
the new addition to the Facebook app so
if you're not tired of the social
network yet you can check out its new
messaging feature called chat heads that
was announced for Android recently it's
now been added to the iOS facebook app
you can get them by jumping into your
messages or chatting with someone their
chat head will appear and you can move
them around on your screen that's my
favorite part i also like throwing an
annoying person away goodbye now they
also added stickers in for free for a
limited time basically it's a bunch of
oversized emoticons and it's coming to
Android later so check out the update to
the new facebook app and the revamped
ipad version as well it's actually worth
using now alright guys and some cool
patent use Apple is filed for a patent
for flexible edge displays that will be
able to have virtual repurposing
controls depending on what the user is
doing translation think of it as the
sides of your phones could have touch
sensitive areas that morph into
different uses like virtual buttons
switches or scrolling displays depending
on what you're doing on the device now
they also showed an example of how
virtual buttons can be activated on the
edge display for gaming as well Apple
indicates the technology could be used
in future I devices even macbooks or
wearable computers like maybe one that
could go on your wrist now Apple was
also granted the patent for creating and
managing iOS folders with the jiggle
effect you know the effect where it
looks like your folders are dancing on
jello kind of like oh like this Yeah
right what
man danya's that's no fun all right to
the quick bytes long time Apple board
member Bill Campbell said at a recent
town hall meeting that we should expect
to see a lot of things going on with the
application of technology to really
intimate things now we used Google
Glasses one example the rumored iWatch
could also be another thing but kind of
makes me uncomfortable to think about
what jabra when you're working on also
funnyordie.com Steve Jobs movie called I
Steve is now available online it stars
just along from the imac ads and hurley
from lost but don't expect anything
serious here it's the longest video
produced by the site at 80 minutes the
script was written in three days and
took five days to film but I was only
able to watch a couple of minutes and
that's including skipping through and
finally if you guys and gals had 15
million dollars what would you do with
it well if you're Joe the Hong Kong
businessman you commissioned someone to
craft a solid gold chassis just you know
maybe add 600 white diamonds on it for
decoration and take a twenty six carat
black diamond that has been in your
family for generations and set it on the
home button honestly I'm not going to
hate congratulations Joe that's an
amazing phone and you'll still probably
get lost using Apple's maps all right
who cares about that phone if you didn't
know i love i love my video games and
I'm having a blast playing injustice
gods among us wear these top superheroes
and villains in the DC Comics universe

addictive as cotton candy so my friends

biters up with a copy of injustice gods
