editor her had seen it today were take a
first look at the LG optimus regard this
phone is definitely more in the
mid-range to low-end category now that's
not surprising considering it's come
from cricket wireless it's got a pretty
basic design not a lot of exciting
features pretty affordable as well 229
that's without a contract so that's
pretty fair it is also have LTE it's one
of the few cricket phones to do so so
that's pretty cool as I said pretty
simple design for 3.5 inch display I
found the screen a little cramped when I
was using the phone dialer or when i was
typing messages not so bad when you're
just going through menus but personally
i think i'd like something just a little
bit bigger also don't expect your great
screen resolution that's not really
surprising considering it's a mid to
low-end phone do you have a few home
screens which you can populate it as an
Ice Cream Sandwich phone of course you
can populate the home screens with all
the icons and features and shortcuts
that you like and then if you go into
the main menu pretty simple design you
just see that it has those three pages
you can customize as you like as well
down below be the standard touch
controls for getting to the menu also
for going back and also for going to the
home screen up on top you'll see there's
a 3.5 millimeter headset jack along with
a power control over in this side
there's a volume rocker or in the micro
USB charger port around back do have a
camera lens for the 5 megapixel camera
it's the main camera of course and then
a flash and then up front above the
screen is the VGA or actually at one
point megapixel camera and that is also
a sensor as well inside camera
application is probably the most
feature-rich thing we'll see on this
phone had a lot of options one that I
found particularly interesting was
actually when you press the camera lens
it will keep shooting photos until the
shutter actually closes so what that
does is it shows you up to six shots
then you can actually choose which
picture you like and save it so that was
a nice thing they do have the audio
camera shutter as well so when you say
something you can say cheese you can say
whiskey of all things and you can say
kimchi the phone will actually or the
shredder will actually close and you
don't have to press a button otherwise
we have a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor ram pretty well of course not
particularly fast if you're used to
something a lot speedier actually phone
has two browsers it has the standard
sir and a chrome browser Chrome browser
is nice because you can sync the phone
with the desktop or a tablet with your
tabs with your bookmarks so that's kind
of nice so about otherwise not
particularly exciting phone some
webpages especially full web pages like
that I've seen in it or American
Airlines took almost a minute to load
apps took almost two or three minutes to
download so if you really want a speedy
phone that's going to cover a lot of
places this is not for you what I really
like about this phone is does have that
LTE connection again one of the few
cricket phones to do so it's relatively
affordable within the 200 to 250 range
that's without a contract you just want
something entry level to mid range that
is Ed easy to use provides relativity
good performance the LG optimus regard
is a great option I'm Kent Sherman here
at cnet for the first look at the LG
optimus regard for cricket</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
