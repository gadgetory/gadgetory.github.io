look at the Walkman Z from Sony this is
an Android based media player running
Android 2.3 and price it around $249 for
an 8 gigabyte model 279 for 16 gigs and
329 for 32 unlike many Android devices
Sony doesn't include a memory expansion
slot on here so choose your capacity
carefully I think it's fair to say that
this is Sony's answer to the Apple iPod
Touch so what does it offer that the
iPod doesn't well the first thing is
obvious it offers Android you get the
full Google experience here with Android
Market Gmail and GPS powered navigation
you also get the full Android Market
stocked with video rentals music books
all that stuff in addition to the apps
and games you're used to Sony is also
offering a nice 4.3 inch screen here
which is noticeably larger than the iPod
Touch you get a built-in HDMI output
high quality headphones are included
there's a speaker on the back volume
rocker on the side and this interesting
W button right here in the middle this
button calls up a mini version of the
music player regardless of what screen
you're on you can even access it from
the lock screen it's also a reminder
that Sony branded this is a Walkman for
a reason the sound quality here is
excellent and Sony includes an
impressive suite of sound enhancement
settings to make your music shine
they've also included Sony's Music
Unlimited service which offers an
all-you-can-eat selection of music for a
monthly fee there are some drawbacks
there are no cameras no memory expansion
the screen brightness here is pretty dim
and Sony forces their proprietary
connection on here instead of a micro
USB port still as iPod alternatives go I
prefer the Walkman Z over the Samsung
Galaxy players I reviewed a few months
back so that's the Walkman Z from Sony
