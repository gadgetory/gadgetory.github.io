Veronica Belmont this is the show where
we talk about the wildest wackiest
craziest kind of gadget stuff that we
find on the internets and also on craved
cnet com so with me today is ryan block
managing editor of engadget and he's
going to tell us a little bit about some
of the cool stuff that is on your site
one thing in particular that I saw that
was crazy this week was that we laptop
yeah a lot of people really like that so
what's up with that where did that even
come from so one of our regular
columnist name is Ben Heck andorran he's
kind of known in the console modding
community he actually makes laptops and
portables out of old video game system
so he did so uh he's done like Ataris
he's done like I think you did Jaguar he
definitely he was really well known for
his xbox 360 live heard about master
yeah so um I wanted him to do a a wee
laptop and it came out really well I
really like it it kinda looks old school
it's very blocky and kind of hefty
looking is this really something that
you could take on the go with you or is
this just for fun uh it's both I mean
you could take it on the go with you but
I mean it's I think the novelty factor
is really high with it yeah I mean it
doesn't even it's not wireless is it in
what sense I thought like I thought you
had to plug in it yeah you have to plug
in there isn't a version without a break
yet oh well that's kind of disappointing
but I mean it would be fun to take on a
plane or something so what's the
distance you have to be away from it is
it different from a normal TV well
because he actually integrated the the
sensors up in the top of the display
it's much closer so you can actually be
like really I mean you could use it on
your lap if you want to go so right so
is there anything on the Cray flogged
that you've seen that was especially
interesting or weird yeah I really like
the ergo pod 500 the ergo pod 500 that
is yeah I noticed that today definitely
yeah it's this giant contraption where
you're basically strapped in no it's
it's good to use if you have a
disability or if your bed written for
any reason you can kind of lay and
comfortably have the monitor position
kind of like this it's a little awkward
looking you can understand how it'd be
economic well I mean you know for a
blogger like myself I mean getting out
of bed is the hardest part of the day so
I mean this way I could literally roll
over and start my work day in tough life
yeah real tough life anyway the one
thing I'd be worried about though is
we live in earthquake country and what
if suddenly just is huge like monitor
just fell off and like hit you on the
head that's not something that's not a
chance i want to take person get a flat
screen get one of those like light flat
screens you know you don't want a big
CRT or anything minimal damage yeah I
suppose minimizer well we're helmet wear
a helmet there you go we've been talking
about some really blinged-out gadgets
lately and i saw this mouse a twenty
four thousand dollar mouse with a
diamond flower and that's even the name
the diamond flower mouse by pat says now
pat says now kind of like right said
fred like they said yes in a blog post
exactly except not quite as cool and
shirtless anyway so this mouse but the
thing I don't understand is it's not
even a wireless mouse I mean I would
expect for twenty four thousand dollars
that it would need to give you a hand
massage or like kind of prevent carpal
tunnel or something really high-tech for
that amount of money no you know I mean
you have to work for that kind of beauty
that luxury yeah absolutely so I'm I
noticed that last week you actually had
a LED backlit Korean kind of disco
keyboard and what you guys like disco
lot here yeah we tend to err on the side
of disco more often than not this week
we have the disco funk phone phone
that's it has phone twice in the name
and it actually it looks like a platform
shoe and it's huge and the picture has a
girl probably about nine years old she
doesn't know what disco is that's way
before her time but anyway it has three
different disco ringtones also it's only
twenty bucks it's 1999 I would imagine
it wouldn't be more than toy duck are
you serious i don't i would pay way more
money for that i mean i would pay like
50 bucks for a disco phone this thing is
crazy it has a huge platform on it you
lift it up listen to your donna summer
and you're all set you're ready what
imagine it's kind of like the 70s
throwback Maxwell Smart I'm gonna have
to hold out till they got the the
goldfish version all right well anyway I
think that's all the time we have today
I'll see you guys next week for even
more disco gadgets possibly who knows

week and so if you want to see more
