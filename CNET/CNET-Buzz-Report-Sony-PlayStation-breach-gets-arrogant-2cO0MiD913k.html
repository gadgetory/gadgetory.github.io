Cooley in from Hollywood who's busy this
week burning everything she owns made by
sony first the gadget of the week it's
the blackberry 9900 no that's not the
wrong picture that's it didn't change
much the screen is now touched though
but still 2.8 inches so why bother it
runs BlackBerry OS 7 which looks a lot
like well blackberry OS six it's got 4g
support but given how Verizon's 4G
network rather famously bonked a few
days ago most consumers are kind of
waiting on that it is thinner just a
little thinner bottom line this is not
the reset device that rim needs to put
out there to affect trends like this NPD
data that shows that just fourteen
percent of new smartphones sold in the
u.s. in q1 where BlackBerry's Android
and iPhone or putting rim across their
knee you know on second thought gadget
of the week should have been paint for
cats kitty okay top of the news all week
continues to be the sony playstation
network and curiosity customer records
breach first of all it was 77 million
records at first then got revised up to
over a hundred million records that have
been accessed illegally sony says it
waited two days before contacting anyone
five days before meeting with the FBI
and flat out blew off a request to
attend a hearing on data theft at the US
house a couple days ago and still there
hasn't been official word one from Sony
CEO Howard Stringer maybe because he's
just too busy working parties as a will
ferrell look alike you see what i mean
it's not just me is it anyway this is
one of the big personal data hacks in
internet history and sony's handling of
it reminds me of something oh yeah the
way toyota bungled their unintended
acceleration situation now sony can
fumble away its dominance in
portable audio and more over the last
few years but when the ball they're
handling is my privacy dropping it is
not their choice okay I'm as tired as
you are by now of all the tortured
sidebar angles the media is fishing up
on the whole bin Laden story but I got
one to add the miscalculation he and his
crew made that got him killed was the
internet so think about it it's 2011 in
Abbottabad Pakistan a fairly modern
military city and what may be the nicest
pad in town has no internet or phone or
wireless signals coming out of it
possibly the only modern residence left
on earth that doesn't and we weren't
going to make something of that memo to
al-qaeda both of you in this day and age
the most conspicuous thing is not being
connected okay here's a story you have
not heard for at least 20 years fewer
American homes now have a television the
Nielsen folks tell us this they say a
hundred and fourteen point seven million
US households now have a television
that's down 1.2 million households from
a year ago and I bet this isn't the last
time we hear this trend going forward
you see a TV is not a device anymore
it's a behavior it's wherever you relax
and take in something that is more or
less long form more or less well
produced and whether that's a TV on the
wall or not doesn't really matter
anymore you might use a laptop or a
tablet even a smartphone that part of TV
doesn't matter and honestly the idea
having to take myself to this big flat
thing bolted on a wall to watch TV you
might seem a little weird just a few
years down the road and let me leave you
this week with one that'll make your
blood boil cuz that's always fun
rent-to-own Shane Aaron's is being sued
by a family the Boyd's that rented a
laptop from them okay that's all fine
and dandy but when they failed to make
the final payment on it the collection
dude from Aaron's supposedly arrived at
their door with a picture of the dad
sitting at the laptop a few days before
now where'd that come from well it turns
out Aaron's rent
them a laptop rent-to-own with software
installed on it that was regularly
taking webcam shots grabbing screen caps
and doing keylogging the family that was
spied on is obviously making this a
class action case if they can and if
you're sitting in an aarons rental
machine right now I imagine your bowel
just turn to water smile but the
stupidest move by aarons has to be
showing up at the door with a photo that
proves you had surreptitious software
installed on by the way the reason that
the boyd family's computer payments were
in arrears they say it's because Aaron's
bungled the final payment nice that's
the buzz report I'm Brian Cooley
Hollywood's back next week thanks for
