internet-connected coffee machines but
there's actually not many you can really
buy yet except for this guy this is the
be more connected coffee brewing system
it should be shipping soon and has a
whole lot of interesting abilities that
just may convince you that a connected
coffee machine is in your future if this
guy looks familiar that's because it is
essentially the same on the inside and
almost exactly the same on the outside
as one of be Moore's other Brewers the
raisin plus the main difference with
this guy though is that on the front
face you won't find a lot of the
old-school buttons and LCD controls that
come on the other version of this
machine instead there's a big brewing
button that's circled by an LED light
that actually changes colors depending
on the brewing mode that is in and
there's also electronics and a Wi-Fi
radio that connects this coffee machine
to the internet as well as enables it to
talk to apps on Android or iOS inside
the app you're gonna see lots of ways to
tweak the brewing process basically
you'll be able to say how much you want
to brew what the brewing temperature
should be you also be able to match the
brewing performance to the specific type
of bean or roast you want to brew all
that gives you tons of power in a device
that just the other day didn't have a
lot of these capabilities this
particular device we're looking at right
now is a prototype so it's almost but
not quite the shipping model we just had
a chance to take a look at it right here
right now and we wanted to really show
you how it works since we're pretty
excited about this and we expect to get
a review sample hopefully soon and the
product itself should retail for three
hundred and twenty nine dollars
