worried about everything from malware to
phishing but it's easy to overlook the
most primitive form of hacking simply
eyeballing someone's computer screen
while they enter passwords or read
confidential material if you've ever sat
in a crowded coffee shop or used a
laptop on a plane with someone seated in
the row behind you it could have already
happened to you
a simple privacy filter which makes your
screen near impossible to read from a
side angle it's a simple solution but it
requires you to carry around a big
floppy rectangle a filter material and
it often makes your screen harder to
read even if you're directly in front of
it
HP is adding what it calls the world's
only integrated PC privacy screen to a
pair of professional laptops the HP
EliteBook 840 and 1040 developed using
technology from 3m the privacy filter is
embedded in the screen itself but can be
turned off and on it will when it's off
the laptop screen looks as bright and
clear as normal then hit function + f2
and the privacy filter turns on the
direct viewed slightly dimmer as if you
had a separate filter placed over the
screen but from the side the screen is
nearly completely blocked out these two
EliteBook models are the first to add
this new feature but it's something that
could definitely come - more laptops in
the future</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
