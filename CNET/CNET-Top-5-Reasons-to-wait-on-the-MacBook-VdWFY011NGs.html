after first up I want to thank Donald
Bell first three years of top five best
of luck to you buddy and to you the
viewers I'll do my best not to let you
down
unless I've picked you up over my head
at which time you've asked me to let you
down then I'll let you down anyway let's
talk about Apple's newest MacBook it's
got a new style it's super thin it's
pretty it's really light but it might
not be the laptop to get right now let's
take a look at the top five reasons why
you might want to wait on buying the
Apple MacBook at number five is the
first gen butterfly keyboard the new
MacBooks incredibly thin how did Apple
do that one of the things it did was
design a brand new keyboard that uses a
butterfly mechanism the keys don't
travel as far when compared to other
notebooks so it might take some time to
get used to also this is the first
version Apple's ever come up with and
Apple's first generation stuff not
always awesome at number four is the
u.s. PC port the reversible USB C port
is the future of connectivity but this
is the present Apple's got a tendency to
embrace the future before it's quite
ready to connect anything you already
have you're gonna need an adapter from
Apple or third-party and there's only
one USB C port so get used to carrying
adapters for everything and number three
is battery life Apple mentioned that it
had to redesign the battery the packing
as much juice in the MacBook but this
thin and light notebook doesn't always
measure up the new MacBook doesn't last
as long as the MacBook Air or the
MacBook Pro real world test suggests a
MacBook will last about five hours
number two performance the MacBook uses
an Intel Core M processor instead of the
Intel Core i processors found in the
MacBook Air and MacBook Pro to put it
simply the core M isn't as powerful as
Core i processors apples done some
tweaks to the software to make sure OS
10 and Safari worked very well using the
processor but non Safari browsers didn't
fare too well Photoshop on this MacBook
won't be as pleasant as on other Macs
the number one reason to pause before
buying the new MacBook is the price it
starts at $12.99 Apple's own MacBook Air
and MacBook Pro computers at the same
price point offer better performance and
better battery life
additionally those notebooks won't need
a bunch of USB C dongles
make things work if you go outside to
the greater PC world there's stiff
competition at this price point and
apples first-generation notebooks tend
to be expensive take a look at the
original MacBook Air
it started at 1799 - featured one USB
port future generations were cheaper
with greater connectivity maybe the next
MacBook will follow suit all of that
being said this is one nice laptop and
for most people it can handle their
everyday needs in his review seen that's
an AK and we called it the perfect
coffee shop companion he also said the
new MacBook made the 13-inch MacBook Air
feel a bit like a lumbering dinosaur if
those reasons didn't dissuade you enjoy
your brand new MacBook and for more top
fives like this with a top 5 dot
