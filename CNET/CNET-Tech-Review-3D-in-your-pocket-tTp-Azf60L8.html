have a host of new handsets and tablets
from ctia 2011 do these retro headphones
recall the 80s or the aughts and
everything you wanted to know and more
about the Nintendo 3ds it's all coming
up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus we offer some unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's get started with the good
spring is in the air or at least it's
supposed to be so people from all over
the country packed up their sunblock and
headed down to sunny Florida to show off
their mobile devices at ctia 2011 people
this here the big stories at the show
our 4g 3d and of course tablets let's
start things off with a pair of 4g
phones including an old favorite that's
making a comeback hi I'm Ken German
senior editor at cnet com and here at
CTI 2011 in orlando florida want to show
you the Samsung Nexus S this is the new
version for sprint they're calling it
the samsung nexus s 4g two interesting
things about this nexus s it is the
first Nexus device to come to a cdma
carrier it also is the first Nexus phone
to be on a 4G network of course this is
French so it runs on wimax 02 first
really about this phone now it looks
exactly like the t mobile device we saw
last year it's pretty thin feels a
little bit fragile in the hand like we
saw last year but I think it's a nice
looking phone it is very slim I just
have that contour display so that means
you'll see a very very slight curve it
is a super amoled display so it's really
bright it's really colorful a couple
negative things about this phone this is
no LED notification so when you get a
message or voicemail and the
discreteness guard there's not going to
be any sort of light that pops up here
you see that a lot on Android phones
also the phone does not have a micro SD
card slot it does have several gigs of
internal storage so that should be fine
but we do like it external card slide
just for extra also as a personal
organizer doesn't wireless hotspot of
course I use that feature you will have
to sign up for the extra 2999 sprint
plan of 20
twenty-nine ninety-nine a month also
you'll have to get the extra ten dollars
a month for the score G service and
that's all on top of at least a 69 99
sprint everything plan so a little bit
of an investment when you get this phone
as far as the monthly plan goes it's
going to be able to April 199 with a
two-year contract but so if you like
that stock Android experience luckily
sprint hasn't ruined that gingerbread
stock android screen android paris
definitely a good phone for you i'm kim
Sherman at CTA 2011 with a samsung nexus
s 4g hey everyone I'm Bonnie tuck senior
editor at cnet com and we're here in
Orlando for CTA 2011 taking a first look
at the t-mobile sidekick 4G this is the
new sidekick and it's made by samsung
this time around they've kept some of
the old along with the new some of the
old features that will be familiar to
sidekick users are these four buttons
around here and it has a slight up
screen now but you get this great
keyboard fibro keyboard with dedicated
number keys and an emoticon key
I really like the keyboard it's very
spacious even though the buttons look
small they're they're really easy to use
in tactile the sidekick 4G is the first
sidekicks you have a touchscreen and
measures 3.5 inches diagonally so
tonight that you can also use the
touchscreen to navigate the phone in
addition to the shortcut keys as well as
this call joystick on back you've got a
3 megapixel camera and there is also vga
camera on front for video calls so
that's a great new feature of course the
big change here is that the sidekick 4G
is now running the Android operating
system they've made some tweaks to make
it more sidekick ish such as the
dedicated wallpaper also has enhanced
messaging features including group text
so you can
well as text which is a web app that
allows you to text and receive messages
from your computer overall the sidekick
4G looks like a great device
a little bit wary when they said they
were discontinuing the psychic service
but i think the move to android is a
good one
it's going to be available coming in the
spring pricing is 9999 was a two-year
contract with unlimited data
so the very fair price they'll also
offer it from 149 99 if you want
get the ten-dollar data plan which gives
you about 250 megabytes of data so we're
looking forward to bringing the t-mobile
sidekick for Dean and
I'm Bonnie Tyler 1640 it is such a
relief to see that the sidekick hasn't
gone forever and nice update as i
mentioned 3d phones or a big deal at
ctia this year and no that doesn't mean
you'll have to strap on a pair of goofy
glasses to use your new 3d phone but you
probably won't find yourself ducking to
avoid flying Angry Birds either take a
look I'm the Folies senior associate
editor Christina calm and this is a
first look at the LG thrill 4g the first
ever 3d smartphone to come to the US
this is essentially attn to use version
of the LG optimus 3d as you can see on
the front is a very attractive 4.3 inch
WVGA display and it's 3d when you press
the 3d button on the side here to enter
into the 3d app mode that lets you get
access to a variety of 3d apps Thank was
a variety of 3d games and apps and you
can also upload 3d video to YouTube the
3d on the thrill 4g looks amazing even
though you can't really see it on the
camera
it does will you pop out in real life
you don't need any glasses to view
Jess your own eyes will do on the back
of the phone are two five megapixel
cameras that can record in 3d we can
record 3d is 720p and 2d in 1080p the OS
is android 2.2 froyo but AT&amp;amp;T has said
that you'll be upgradable to android 2.3
gingerbread the LG thrill 4g as the name
suggests is compatible with 1880s hspa+
or 4g network the LG thrill 4g is
available later this year don't yet know
the pricing and availability however the
LG thrill 4g has a very speedy dual-core
processor I'm Napoleon this has been a
first look at the LG thrill 4g hi I'm
Ken German senior editor here at cnet
com i'm here at ctia 2 2011 in orlando
florida and i want to show you one of
sprint's new phones they're announcing
to the show this is the HTC evo 3d of
course it's an upgrade to the evo line
is the latest in that series few think a
few unique things about this phone is it
does record and play 3d video and that's
without the aid of glasses now we've
seen a phone like this before we saw at
Mobile World Congress from LG that was
the LG optimus 3d this is their very
much the same concept here in the back
you see those two five megapixel cameras
and on the front you'll have that 1.3
megapixel camera that can be used for
video chat also you can take
self-portraits with it as well but it's
really those two cameras in the back
that are the real star here on the side
there's a switch for changing between 3d
video and 2d video I'll see a camera
control here on the top comes with a
eight gig card it will hold up to 32
gigs and there's four gigs of memory on
the phone now the handset does run
gingerbread so that's on my assignments
to see more phones coming out with
Gingerbread but of course since it is
that 3d video I want to give you a
little demonstration of that so we'll
just choose we'll just use the gallery
here so the effect is going to be pretty
subtle here you won't really jump out at
you and of course 3d is supposed to do
that it's going to be very much like the
Optimus 3d it's going to be the things
will kind of float off the screen you
will see some depth of course you don't
need glasses as
so you just need a minute to watch so
I'll switch for doing photos and you see
it still looks like a still photo at
first and then we see that 3d effect pop
in I think it is kind of cool it's
definitely something that I can imagine
myself use and I can't imagine myself
using it a lot I don't think that it
really provides an experience that it's
just going to blow me away and just
going to change my smartphone experience
but I do think it's a pretty cool thing
it is really nice to have and it's good
to see some innovation in that way phone
is a 1.2 gig hurts processor so it will
be running pretty fast as all the
android applications you'd expect from
google has personal organiser of course
Wi-Fi Bluetooth messaging email instant
messaging so all of those things you'd
expect on a smartphone are going to be
here this really is about that 3d
shooting video so as I said shoot video
on the back with the 3d camera you don't
have to shoot 3d and you can take the 3d
photos with those lenses on the back the
I do like the effect of switching
between home screens it's sort of like a
cube so you can go like that you can see
that they sort of rotate around it is
running HTC Sense and agenda in addition
to Gingerbread of course that also means
that if you pinch you get the leak
feature which shows you everything all
the home screens you have you get up to
seven and you can just then go directly
to the one you want by clicking it so
it's pretty nice feature anything but
i'm here at CTI 2011 i'm kent german
with the HTC evo 3d
now yes some of the 3d effects might
seem a little gimmicky but i do remember
people saying the same thing when
regular old cameras started showing up
in phones in fact i was one of them
because i am old anyway before we bid
ctia ado let's check out some tablets as
Jessica shows us a trio of 7 inches from
ZTE and bonnie has her hands full with a
pair of galaxy tabs hi this is Jessica
Thalberg from cnet here at ctia taking a
first look at the ZTE light now this is
a family of three 7-inch tablets they're
all running android 2.2 froyo right now
but they may be upgradable to honeycomb
in the future there are three models
they go from basic basic + 4g and also a
more upscale model we're looking right
now at the LTE light basic model this
has a 3 megapixel camera on the back a
VGA camera on the front and a 600
megahertz processor the LTE late to the
more upscale model has a 1 gigahertz
processor plus DLNA support and a much
much better screen the model that I'm
holding right now has this glossy black
front and the sort of metallic backing
it feels pretty good in the hand pretty
smooth not too heavy and it's fairly
thin so this is definitely looking like
some of the other tablets that we've
seen and it does have that portability
although all three of these tablets have
been launched globally there is no
pricing or carrier information yet in
the u.s. so stay tuned I'm Jessica dual
cord and this is the VTE
family of tablet hey everyone I'm body
toss senior editor at cnet com and we're
here in Orlando for CTI 2011
bayo 2 new tablets the same
Galaxy Tab 8.9
and the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1
fortunately devices don't
I wanted to show you the tablets because
they are the world's thinnest tablet
they both measure eight point six
millimeters thin so that makes it
thinner than the ipad 2 which comes in
at eight point eight millimeters
just really beautifully designed tablet
has rounded edges so it's really
comfortable to hold and has a nice
weight to it and it has a nice creamy
and feel and like
sometimes in fact
a little bit plasticky I tend to like my
device is a little smaller so that 8.9
inch tablet really suits me I'm really
loving the design on this both tablets
will be running Android 3.0
on top of that they are going to be
using Samsung's TouchWiz UX user
interface which is the first
customizable user interface
android some of the features include by
panels where you do that widgets and
shortcuts as well as an app tray that
will help with multitasking also it will
have dual core processor so should get
some good performance out of these
tablets they will be available this
summer in the US as a Wi-Fi version
there will be 16 gigabyte model and a 32
gigabyte hspa+ version
and we are told that LTE and wimax will
come out later this year I'm really
looking forward to checking out these
tablets again this is the Galaxy Tab 8.9
and the galaxy tab 2
and I'm by nature from cnet com rest
assured I can confidently guarantee that
future versions of the galaxy tab will
in fact turn on eventually i'm pretty
sure i would hope all right that's
enough ctia news for one day for our
complete coverage from the show head
over to cnet TV com and let's take a
break but come right back for more tech
review right after this
welcome back to the Cena tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good it's time to
leave Florida behind and head to New
York City for the second half of this
week's show first up Justin you tends to
be a pretty hip guy so it's no surprise
that he's a fan of this set of editors
choice winning headphones that just
scream retro cool hi I'm Justin you with
cnet com with a first look at the cost
porter pro headphones with so many
headphones coming out these days it is
hard to commit to just one pair without
listening to them first but why not
choose one that's what stood over 20
years of competition a cost porter pros
actually came out in 1984 and they've
since become a cult favorite for their
unique design and they're excellent
fidelity and they also have a lifetime
warranty that makes their fifty dollar
price tag even more appealing so first
off there's no mystery about what decade
inspired these headphones they're
retro-looking ear cups may look weird to
you but they do actually serve a purpose
the main earbuds here are secured by
this extra padding up top by your temple
and there's even a comfort zone switch
on the side that lets you adjust the
tension against your temple now our
single complaint with a physical build
is that these two floating piece
headbands don't have a lock to keep it
in place so cost intended this piece to
cut out the complicated adjustment
process every time you put them on your
head it's kind of automatic when you
stick them on but it's also easy for
hair to get stuck in the metal sliders
and it doesn't happen that often but
just enough to where we can't quite
overlook it now the Porta pros also fold
up and clip together for convenient
storage and this tiny clip in the middle
here keeps the two sides bound together
and organized looks aside the reason why
the Porta pros are still being sold is
because of their upper tier fidelity the
retro look is a hit or miss but you
can't really argue with their ability to
pump out a ton of base a costs also
managed to find the recipe for an
impressively well-balanced headphone
that's suitable across all genres that's
with excellent clarity and an overall
sound that way slightly heavier in the
low end and although they're not
specifically designed for
an isolation the over the ear or circum
oral design does an excellent job of
blocking out ambient noise without
leaking your music to everyone else
around you best of all costs backs the
fifty-dollar Porter pros with a
no-questions-asked lifetime warranty we
actually tested this out for ourselves
with a broken pair all it takes is six
dollars to cover shipping and two weeks
later we received a brand new set of
Porter pros with a thank you note from
costs All Things Considered you can
certainly spend quadruple the amount on
a nice set of custom earphones or a pair
of headphones designed to compliment
your home theater but if you don't want
to spend a lot and just need a set of
durable dependable headphones and listen
to on the go or at work the versatile
cost Porter pros earn our solid cnet
editors choice award and are sure to
impress you as well you can read the
full review on cnet com but that's going
to do it for me I'm Justin you these are
the costs Porter pro headphones and that
sounds good to me in fact Justin likes
these headphones so much they've been on
the editor's choice list since he first
reviewed them three years ago that's
like a lifetime in the tech world sadly
I don't think we'll be able to say the
same thing about the laptop in our next
video it's time for a dan ackerman and
this week's entry in the bag
i'm dan ackerman and we are here taking
a look at the gateway NV 51b now listen
we don't really like cheap laptops but
we like inexpensive laptops the
difference is a cheap laptop is made of
cheap components and really
underperforms inexpensive laptop spins
its budget wisely using reasonably
priced components selling it to you for
a reasonable price and keeping your
expectations in check this is one of the
first handful of laptop so use amd's new
fusion platform which combines a cpu and
a discrete GPU usually we've seen these
in 11 inch ultra portables where they're
sort of a nice step up from that old
Intel Atom model better performance and
better built in graphics these in
battery life putting that kind of low
power chip however in a bigger 15-inch
laptop is potentially a recipe for
disaster we saw a toshiba not too long
ago that use the slower e250 version of
this AMD cpu and that was a complete
disaster this system however uses a
faster III 50 version so it passes that
bar remains a pretty usable 15-inch
budget priced laptop it's not going to
knock out as long as you keep your
expectations modest it's going to do
pretty well the first thing we noticed
even though it's made completely of
plastic looks and feels like a plastic
laptop there's kind of this weird
woodgrain pattern built right into it
you can see it here in the wrist rest
and also on the back of the lip it adds
a little visual flair not sure it's
really super necessary you get the same
sort of flat key keyboard that you find
on a lot of gateway laptops these days
this room for a number pad because the
chassis is nice and wide but you've got
this little rinky-dink touch pad right
here with the rocker bar instead of
separate buttons that's always a no-no
in our book we would have liked to see a
much bigger touchpad because this is a
fairly large screen laptop performance
wise as long as you keep in mind this is
an under 500 our 15 inch laptop you
shouldn't be too disappointed the
multitasking was a little bit slow but
those AMD built in graphics were good
enough for some basic casual gaming and
even streaming HD full screen video we
checked out some Netflix we checked out
some YouTube trailers and it played that
HD video pretty well which is not
something you can say about every sub
500
15 inch laptop so as long as you keep
your expectations modest and you don't
mind getting a little bit of an odd
woodgrain pattern in your plastic this
is one of the cooler budget 15 inch
laptops a category there are not too
many entries in these days that we've
seen in a while i'm dan ackerman and
that is the gateway NV 51b it's nice to
know that Dan can appreciate a nice wide
chassis but the takeaway here seems to
be keep your expectations modest hardly
a ringing endorsement alright with that
let's go ahead and check out this week's
bottom line is it just me or does it
feel like we've been talking about the
Nintendo 3ds for ages we have but as
much as we've covered it already it
finally goes on sale this weekend and
now Jeff Bakalar can have his final word
please settle in for Jeff's definitive
review of the new handheld what's going
on everyone I'm Jeff Bakalar for
cnet.com and today it is our final first
look at the Nintendo 3ds portable gaming
system now as you all know the 3ds is
the follow-up to the DS which believe it
or not is the best-selling portable
gaming console of all time they've sold
145 million units of this thing so
Nintendo had a lot of work cut out in
designing the 3ds 3ds is the first
portable console to ever display a 3d
image without the need for special
glasses now the big question is does it
actually work and yeah it does and it
works really well actually the best way
I've been able to describe the illusion
for people is to imagine those old magic
I images where you're sort of how to
cross your eyes to see the 3d image
there's no I crossing needed for the 3ds
but it does work and it works really
well now will it make you sick maybe it
depends on how sensitive you are to 3d
there's a 3d slider up here on the top
screen which allows you to adjust the
intensity of the 3d effect so if you're
feeling a bit nauseous maybe you have
headache and you're not really digging
the 3d just turn this off and the image
will go into 2d and you can play fine no
problem the 3d doesn't give you an
advantage over 2d you can't look around
corners or anything like that it just
enhances the experience so on the
outside of the 3ds it looks a lot like
the DS lite on the front lid are the two
cameras there point three megapixel
cameras same cameras you had on the dsi
and the dsixl kind of bummed out wish
they would go a little bigger with that
but they didn't these two lenses
side-by-side or what allow you to take
3d photos also has a gyroscope and a
motion sensor which is pretty cool on
the back you'll see the stylus the game
card port an infrared port left and
right buttons on one side is the
wireless switch and on the other side is
the volume slider and the SD card slot
on the inside once again looking a lot
like a nintendo DS lite except this time
around we've got an analog stick on the
left side of the unit which is really
cool there's a select home and start
button at the bottom below the touch
screen and the power button is in a new
location and it looks a little different
now to overall aesthetically speaking
that's all there is different in this
model it also comes with a charging dock
which allows you to place the D at the
3ds in a dock and charge which is pretty
cool online functionality isn't really
enabled yet but in May it's coming and
it will come with a virtual console
that's going to let you play gameboy
games Game Boy Advance games and
classics that Nintendo will redo in 3d
also there's going to be support for
Netflix not sure about 3d video but the
3ds can play 3d video so we would expect
some sort of marketplace where studios
are offering content and you probably
pay a price and download the videos you
want to watch also there'll be the 3ds
eshop so no more Nintendo points they're
going for a straight cash pay service
what we really like is connecting to the
internet with the 3ds is easier than
ever you pick your wireless ID you enter
your
you're connected it can save up to a
couple SSIDs so if you leave your house
where it's connected to Wi-Fi and you
come to someplace else where you have
inputted the information it'll know to
switch right over and you'll be
connected all the time and we really
like what they did with friend codes
even though they're annoying and you
will have to enter them they're 12 digit
code you only have to enter them once so
once you have a friend's friend code you
entered it into your friends list and
you're done you'll never have to enter
it again what we really like about the
system software is this home button down
below it lets you suspend any app or
game you're using and you can go and
check out some of the features that are
available in the home screen like your
friends list and something they're
calling game notes which essentially
allows you to take notes while you're
playing a game so if there's something
you don't really have pen and paper for
you want to write down about a specific
game you pop it in the game notes and
you can access that at any time the 3ds
launch lineup isn't amazing it's about
16 games not including the ones that
come bundled in we really like the pilot
wings resort game and also super street
fighter 4 3 d edition that's a lot of
fun to play as well now some games you
will be playing in 3d and you're going
to be button mashing and you'll realize
that you accidentally synced out the 3d
effect that's the problem the 3d viewing
angle on the 3ds is very sensitive so if
you're moving it around which some games
do require because of the gyroscope and
the motion sensor you're going to
sometimes take yourself out of that 3d
effect which is kind of upsetting
everyone knows the old nintendo DS games
came in a sort of a brown box the new
3ds games come in a slimmer white box so
just side by side the new 3ds game
cartridge as opposed to the old ds1 the
new one is grey and it's got a little
nub at the top that's really the only
difference overall the 3ds is a worthy
successor to the DS franchise but as we
all know the gaming market continues to
evolve and we're just not sure how much
longer Nintendo will be able to get away
with offering a device that focuses on
gaming only there's
not too much other functionality here
it's a music player and stuff like that
but it's not making phone calls anytime
soon so it'll be interesting to see what
the 3ds does in the mobile gaming market
now that it's become such a popular
franchise we're just not sure how long
Nintendo is going to be able to get away
with offering a gaming centric device
especially considering there's a lot of
competition and they all seem to be
making all-in-one devices so Nintendo
certainly has an interesting road ahead
I'm Jeff Bakalar for cnet.com and this
has been the Nintendo 3ds the bottom
line this week will it make you sick
maybe congratulations Jeff I think you
just found nintendo's new slogan for the
3ds and maybe all those 3d phones coming
out of Florida good times all right
folks that's our show for this week
we'll be back next week with a brand new
edition of cnet tech review until then
there are tons of great videos available
every day at Cena TV com see you next
time and thank you for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
