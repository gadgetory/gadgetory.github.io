s8 gorgeous infinity screen powerful
octa-core processor and biometric
authentication but could Apple do it
better maybe here for rumored features
on the iPhone 8 that could make it a
worthy opponent the front of the s8 is
83 percent screen and looks incredible
but there's a 17% window of opportunity
for Apple to make a truly bezel s
display on its next iPhone as seen on
this mock-up Apple is rumored to be
changing up its traditional LCD display
for a curved edge to edge OLED screen on
its tenth anniversary iPhone so it is a
possibility but a slight one why the
rumored manufacturer of these amazing
screens is Samsung so it seems unlikely
that the company wouldn't have
implemented on its own flagship before
handing it off to Apple there's
something else Apple could do to the
screen beyond the bezels that could
still one of the s8 embed the
fingerprint scanner and home button in
the display back in 2015 Apple was
granted a patent that allowed them to
place the touch ID sensor underneath the
screen panel using ultrasound imaging
paired with the current 3d touch
technology you would be able to control
the phone without a home button samsung
also got rid of the home button on the
s8 but had to move the fingerprint
scanner to the back of the phone next to
the camera lens but then again there's
other ways to unlock the s8 using the IR
scanner or face recognition which again
Apple may be able to do better
Samsung even admitted that the facial
recognition feature in the s8 isn't the
safest option Apple could improve this
feature by adding a depth sensing camera
to the iPhone 8 aside from mapping the
contours of your face this patent hints
at a camera that could map the world
around it giving the iPhone augmented
reality features similar to Google's
project tango
this has been a historically bad
category for Apple to beat but 2017
could be the year the iPhone drains the
s8 we haven't run any battery tests on
the s8 yet but we do know Samsung played
it safe by using the same sized battery
as on the s7 with the larger screen to
power even if the iPhone isn't able to
outlive the s8 it could still have a
better way of charging another Apple
patent hints at a new short-range
wireless charging feature that uses
coils embedded in tabletops computers or
even other Apple devices to charge the
iPhone and if all else fails they could
always bring back the headphone jack and
make the iPhone cheaper but who are we
kidding that's not going to happen</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
