your google issues and this week it's
everything you can expect to see at
Google i/o 2016 now we don't plan on
seeing any big surprises but the
headliner of the keynote no doubt will
be Android VR we've talked about how the
conference schedule has several VR
dedicated sessions and Google was really
the first big confident make VR
accessible to the masses with cardboard
but it's time to get more serious
reports say Android VR will launch as a
dedicated standalone headset and
according to tech journalist peter rojas
Android VR will be less powerful than
the HTC vive or oculus rift but a better
experience than the gear VR so you've
got to be curious to see how will really
fill that sweet spot in between the
latest release notes from the Unreal
Engine preview had references to Android
VR and this is going to be one of
Google's big pushes earlier reports from
the Financial Times also claimed we
might see a demo of it at Google i/o
with actual VR hardware to be introduced
some time in September now project tango
seems to be a logical companion that
could have some connection to Android VR
or will be part of their VR push as well
bloomberg reported that google is
planning on using their 3d mapping
project tango tech to offer detailed 3d
mappings of building interiors it wants
to digitally map buildings in 3d to
resolution of just a few inches with the
goal of allowing developers to take
these new tools and create new apps
services in past years Google i/o is a
showcase for Android end and it still
will be it's just going to be a lot
harder to shine with Android VR there
the Android end developer preview has
been out since mark so we pretty much
know what to expect it looks and acts a
lot like marshmallow so there are no
drastic changes but there are some nice
tweaks like the new quick settings pull
down split-screen mode that works on
phones but really is better on tablets
and yes its own night mode so we're
expecting to see this and a little more
from Android and also the merging of
Chrome OS and Android could get some
love at i/o this year google officially
said it's happening but we haven't seen
any new announcements from them reddit
user the wise yoda posted a screenshot
in april from chrome OS that gives you
the option to enable android
apps to run on your Chromebook showing
us one of the first overlaps between the
two you know it would be sweet to see a
hybrid of Chrome OS and Android that
might compete with Microsoft Surface
line now there's also a lot of Android
wear sessions planned this year we know
the SmartWatch market is still trying to
figure itself out in reports say we
might see a new piece of hardware from
acc at i/o for an Android wear watch
plus maybe new improvements to Android
wear so we'll look for that and
impossibly the coolest thing that google
could be working on outside of all their
secrets at Google X reports from both
the information and recode say Google is
working on an Amazon echo competitor
that has yet to be named but internally
is codenamed chirp reports say it
resembles the on hub wireless routers
that Google currently sells in I've been
a fan of google's voice tech from day
one the home smart assistant space is
the most intriguing consumer tech
products out there right now thanks to
amazon and google's could be really
special but amazon's third-party
partnerships have taken off with really
no competitors to the echo right now
recode also says it's unlikely the
device will launch at i/o but we might
get a look at it with a launch targeted
for sometime this year so that's the
highlights and everything we expect to
see at Google i/o this year you can join
us for our live Senate coverage this
Wednesday May the 18 starting around
nine-fifteen a.m. pacific time and we'll
also be taking your live calls in case
you need a friend to talk to that's
going to do for this week you can email
us at Google issues at cnet com or tweet

more of that Google issues Google ishes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
