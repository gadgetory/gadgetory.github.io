it's connected we want to make it rug
best on it tall and that means is
everything becomes smart and connected
so from the Internet of Things all the
way through servers as they become smart
and connected we want to be a part of
that we want to drive that technology
now what we do is we we develop core
capabilities so like real sense right
which started on the pc or our our cpu
capability it's starts on the pc and
then we're able to fan it out and use it
across and that's what I tried to show
last night is that real sense the same
module could be used from a drone to a
futuristic pc and it could be across
that spectrum so Intel not spreading
itself too thin then there have been
critics have said that yeah I don't
think we're spreading ourselves too thin
in fact I think we can drive even
broader with using that same core
technology approach maybe you could just
spend a minute telling people who don't
know what real sense is what it is and
what it means to tell so real sense is
is basically a set of cameras that that
include the ability through infrared and
other deficits and capabilities to see
everything with a depth perspective so
not only can I see you but I can get a
good measure of how far away you are and
what's behind you and I'm basically
breaking up the world in very thin
layers that's what it does is it takes
all of those thin layers and puts it
into an image and it allows us to do a
lot of things around what what can you
do with depth now that i know i can
change focus i could measure distances
and prevent myself from running into you
i can do all kinds of things with them
wearable still remains a big area focus
we had you had oakley on stage yesterday
so talk about where you think you are in
the wearable strategy our job is to
create silicon and technologies that are
partners can know then go and create and
innovate with and that's what you see
you know you don't see a lot of products
from Intel you see a lot of products
powered by Intel in the wearable space
and so what I want to do is go get great
partners who who innovate innovate
differently than
like opening ceremony I mean the mica
bracelet is something that's truly
beautiful I women tell me they want to
wear it whether it's on or off right
that's the wearable you want to have
it's something you want to wear and it
has this functionality to it and that's
what we're going and crate so that's why
we've taken partners like opening
ceremony and Oakley apostle these people
bring that that capability to us so tell
us what we're looking at so this is the
product we announced last night which
was Curie and we put it in a button just
to really be a form factor to just show
people what they could how they could
innovate how they could create but but
it's really much smaller Nick we can
make it in almost any form factor and
the idea here is again let her give this
to our partners let them go invents let
them go create with this let's see what
they do um I want to switch attack and
talk about another big announcement you
made yesterday and that had to do with
diversity we took diversity from a
project that HR or or some other part of
the organization owns to saying the
improving our diversity improving our
representation of women and minorities
is is part of our doing business and and
so like bringing a product to market so
like bringing a new technology to the
marketplace fixing the diversity issues
bringing inclusion into the workplace
we're treating it just like one of those
in which case then you set goals you
tell publicly what you're going to do
you invest in that technology or that
problem set and you set managers paid to
their performance of that it's how we
solve problems and so we decided to just
solve this as a problem that we would do
we are gonna put the smartest brains
that we have on this problem we're gonna
be inclusive and how we go about this
problem right it's not just us you saw
the Reverend Jackson at our speech last
night we've got a lot of allies to help
us go solve this now it's such an Adela
this year Microsoft one of your allies
have you had a discussion with him about
it I actually have had a discussion with
Sachin and and he's a hundred percent
behind this you
well it was a big year for Microsoft and
diversity is about that I think you know
one of the luxuries I guess so having a
job like this is that you can you can
have some level of personal agendas so
absolutely i have two teenage daughters
i want the world to be different for
them I want them to have an absolute
equal chance it's all about you know
your opportunities and chance I've had
great opportunities and great chances so
to speak in my career and I want them to
have that same list of chances at least
and then they'll make of it what they
want</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
