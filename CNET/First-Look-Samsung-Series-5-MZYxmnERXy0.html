the samsung series 5 this is a 14-inch
laptop looks and feels a lot like a lot
of other mid-size mainstream laptops
that we see it's got a 14 inch display
it's got an Intel Core i5 processor look
at that it's got an optical drive that
pops out of the side and it's got a 500
gigabyte hard drive wait a little bit
less than four pounds a bit less than an
inch thick not particularly thin in
light but certainly slimmer than some
mainstream laptops we've seen why is all
this important because this laptop
shockingly is being labeled and sold as
an ultrabook I know you're asking are an
ultrabook so sweet super thin super
light laptops kind of like a macbook air
this is certainly a fairly slim
reasonably small laptop but it's nothing
like a macbook air what's happened is
that definition for ultra because become
so large that it encompasses things that
are very slim maybe like the Dell XPS 13
of HP folio 13 but also larger 14 and
now 15 inch laptops that it may be just
a little bit thinner a little bit
lighter in fact this guy as we saw has
an optical drive and it's got just a
regular 500 gigabyte platter hard drive
the way it gets around that is by having
a tiny 16 gig secondary SSD good for
maybe a fast boot up but it certainly
shiz away from the spirit if not the
letter of the Ultrabook rule that says
you have to have an SSD in a laptop
that's called an ultrabook now if you
ignore all of that the samsung series 5
14 inch is a perfectly fine mid-sized
mainstream laptop performs on par with a
lot of the 13 and 14 inch ultra books
that we've seen with the core i5 it
doesn't have the the SSD hard drive that
those have but you do get more capacity
and of course it just has you know
regular integrated intel HD 3000
graphics so nothing special there if i
was going to carry around a you know
eight to nine hundred dollar 14-inch the
samsung series 5 is certainly not a bad
choice but if you look at that ultrabook
name you're expecting something a lot
thinner lots
is here then that's not exactly what
you're going to find here I'm Dan Ackman
and that is the samsung series 5 14-inch
ultrabook</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
