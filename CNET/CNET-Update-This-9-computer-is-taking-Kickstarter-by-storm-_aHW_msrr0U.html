computer just about anything I'm Bridget
Carey this is your CNET update you may
start to think differently about
computers after you learn about the chip
this is a nine dollar computer running
Linux that you can program to do all
sorts of things and it's blowing up on
Kickstarter raising more than seven
hundred and fifty thousand dollars and
just a few days after debuting on the
crowdfunding website the system promises
to be easy to learn how to program you
can connect it to a screen using
composite VGA or HDMI cables you can
surf the web over Wi-Fi or play games
with a Bluetooth controller it's
preloaded with the language scratch to
teach programming basics by building
games and animations there are a ton of
apps that you do things like edit office
spreadsheets or edit photos the
California creators also have a handheld
adapter called the pocket ship to give
it a small keyboard and screen on the go
together that's going to be fifty
dollars but you can get the chip alone
for nine dollars which is expecting to
ship by January before this tinkerers
look to another small do-it-yourself
computer called the Raspberry Pi that
costs $35 but the lower-priced chip on
Kickstarter packs in more perks like
Wi-Fi Bluetooth and onboard storage and
ship has a better processor than the
latest Raspberry Pi in other news Google
is taking away the ability to edit
Google Maps because too many people are
abusing the map maker tool its purpose
is to let the community help correct map
data but people are spamming it with
junk just last month someone created the
image of an Android mascot peeing on the
Apple logo well google now says it does
not have the capacity to review every
edit now that there's increased map
vandalism so it's temporarily turning
the feature off this is why we can't
have nice things also The Associated
Press reports three of Google's
self-driving cars have gotten into
accidents on the roads of California and
that's along with one other self-driving
car from Delphi automotive there are
nearly 50 self-driving cars driving
around California since September when
the state began issuing permits to test
cars on the road the AP reports two
accidents happened when the car was in
self-driving mode traveling at speeds
less than ten miles an hour
two other accidents happen when a person
behind the wheel was driving Google and
Elfi said their cars were not at fault
and the accidents were minor of course
you can expect a few bumps in the road
as they figure out this technology over
the next several years Google says it
wants to see these self-driving cars on
the road by 2017 the company has been
working on the project for five years
already the city Road testing though is
still relatively new that your tech news
