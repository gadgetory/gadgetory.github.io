year so on today's show we're reflecting
back on 2018 to look at some of Apple's
biggest wins and biggest fails of the
year we'll start with Apple's own list
the company released its best of 2018
roundup with the apps music movies TV
shows and more that top their charts
around the world now I'm not gonna go
through all of it and I'm just gonna
mention highlights but you can check out
the full list on Apple's newsroom
website now the top app of the year went
to youtube this year up from second
place in 2017 surprisingly Facebook
crawled up to number three after what
should have been the worst year in
history for the social media giant but
in terms of games no surprise here apple
says the battle royale style games aka
fortnight topped it charts in 2018 and
while some of you guys were battling it
out in the virtual world others took
this year to focus inward as according
to Apple the biggest app trend for the
year was self-care so apps like
headspace however when it comes to
highest-grossing iPhone apps meaning
which ones made the most money that
prize went to Netflix according to data
from sensor tower published in Business
Insider the streaming app made over 790
million dollars
thanks to our binge addiction which is
probably why Apple is eager to jump on
the original content train for next year
according to the rumors Apple is getting
ready to launch its own video streaming
service in the spring now moving on to
music Drake dominated the best artist
category this year but cardi B's I like
it took the top song of the Year award
according to Apple and in the TV
category it's unclear whether its
most-watched or best rated but the
number one movie spot went to
annihilation while the Americans wand
for best show although if it was up to
me I probably would have picked Black
Panther for best movie and Amazon's
marvelous missus nasal as that show
so now that we've gone through Apple's
best of list I have a few words of my
own to give out starting off with the
best apple moment of 2018 on August 2nd
of this year Apple officially became a
trillion-dollar company after a positive
earnings report the company's stock hit
the magic number of two hundred and
seven dollars and five cents putting it
at that trillion dollar valuation
becoming only the second public company
to ever hit the 13 digit mark however
that was quickly followed by what a lot
of people would call the worst moment
when Apple lost the trillion dollar
crown about a month later Amazon also
briefly reached the trillion dollar
milestone but neither of them seems to
be on track to close the year at this
valuation and now Microsoft is also in
the running to close 2018 as the most
valuable publicly traded company now
obviously the year hasn't ended so we'll
have to wait and see how this one plays
out now moving on to products my pick
for the best Apple product of the year
would have to go to the Apple watch
series for 2018 will forever be known as
the year the Apple watch finally came
out from under the iPhone shadow and it
actually stole the show at the September
launch event it has a sleeker look works
completely independently from the phone
and it comes with FDA cleared health
features that are already helping to
save lives by 2019 smartwatches could be
mainstream research firm emarketer
predicts that one in 10 adults will own
a SmartWatch in the US thanks in a large
part to these health features on the
Apple watch but of course if we're
talking about the best product we have
to mention the worst product of 2018
which in this case at least in my
opinion was the airpower bat because it
didn't even make it to the party
and unless Apple decides to launch it
between the weeks of Christmas and New
Year's it has been the biggest tease of
2018 it was rumored to have production
issues this year and it may still come
at some point in 2019 but we'll have to
see about that
and my personal favorite team cook
moment of the year his response after
the Facebook analytic a scandal in an
interview with recode Skaar Swisher and
MSNBC's Chris Hayes when he asked what
he would have done in Mark Zuckerberg
shoes his response I wouldn't be in this
situation
yikes and the worst Tim Cook moment of
the year his reaction to the prospect of
having a 10% tariff imposed by President
Donald Trump on phones and laptops built
in China but I want to end today's show
by featuring someone who's using Apple
products to literally spread the holiday
cheer and if you've ever had issues with
package fees I recommend you watch this
right now the video posted by mark
robber on YouTube who kind of has an
ironic name for this kind of thing shows
him getting the ultimate revenge on
package thieves by hiding a glitter fart
bomb in a home pod box after getting a
package stolen from his front porch the
former NASA engineer spent six months
developing this trap and the footage
captured in the cameras he included are
totally worth the time he spent
engineering this device because of
course there were some lovely people who
took the bait so that does it for a
20-18 award show over here but let me
know if I missed anything what are some
of your picks for the best and worst
Apple moments or products of the year
hit me up on the comments section below
or on Twitter and come back next week
for one more Apple core before the end
of the year and then it's on to CES
happy holidays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
