you how to set up your home rather like
a bro
basically the way I do it and my way is
a four-letter word T H a and T or that
not these but that so let's start first
up T
t is for TSA which is another corneum
and don't worry keep your clothes on and
hold on to that sharp object we are not
at the airport
tsa here stand for throw stuff away now
let's see what you can flow away of
course first is the plastic wrapping I
don't know why we actually need this so
up it go straight to the ocean and then
we have the CD
I mean who use CDs anymore and then we
have this quick start up guy seriously
the start up is so much quicker without
it so in the end we all need just the
router itself the power adapter and the
included network cable in fact we need
to taper for the job so I bring in here
another one and the box you can go to
you can throw all of these away and by
the way why throw away I mean you
recycle them now we can move on to the
second part age eight stand for hooking
up the hard way now hooking up the
hardware is actually very simple first
you have to connect the router to the
power using the power adapter if you
cannot do this you have a more problem
than even I can solve the second is that
you hook up the routers Ethernet port on
one port to a Internet source this port
right here is called one port because is
supposed to connect to a wide area
network which is with the long wide web
or the internet at home it hooked this
port to your DSL or cable modem but here
I have to hook it to the CNET copper
network with his wife that you this long
cable the next step is this LAN port is
click on LAN port because LAN stand
a local area network which means you can
connect devices and computer to the
router using network cable in this case
I'm gonna connect this macbook pro now
this is the same for most of the router
on the market all of them almost all of
them come with one one port and for LAN
port now let's move on the next part
which is a and as for access the web
interface now it's called the web
interface because you can use any web
browser for the job such as Chrome
Firefox Safari or the other thing for
Microsoft now this part can be done with
any router on the market except for
those from Apple and that's because
Apple is the only company that does not
provide a web interface for their
routers to access a routers web
interface we need two things the routers
default IP address and the login
information it's quite easy to find out
the router default IP address that's
because almost all the time they come in
this format 192.168.1 with X being
either 0 1 2 3 10 or 11 or on a computer
that connected to the router you can
find out by going to the command prompt
and use the command ipconfig here the
default gateway IP address is the IP we
want now for this particular router the
default IP address is 192.168.1.1 so
let's type that in the address bar of
the web browser now most of the time the
username is admin and the password can
be anything like admin the word password
the word default 1 2 3 4 or left blank
in this case I know the password is
admin the same as the user and voila now
we have access to the railroad's web
interface we can move on to the last
part of this guy the second T which
stand for tinkering now different
vendors have a different web interface
but they are all very similar and most
of all they're very easy to figure out
if you speak English which means if I
can do it I'm sure you can for example
here with this particular one you can
follow the wizard show you step and step
or you can go to network to change the
basic setting of your network or you can
go to while is 2.4 to change the 2.4
gigahertz Network I'll go to wireless 5
gigahertz to change the setting of the 5
Iike heard what is network very simple
now the reason I will encourage you to
tinker away because you can always reset
the rarer to the default factory setting
you can also backup the existing setting
and then restart that later to reset to
the default setting you can use a web
interface or you can use a small pin
like this and press on the reset button
of the router all of them has one just
press it in here for about 10 second and
the router will go back to the default
setting and that's mean you don't have
to worry if something goes wrong for
more detail information on this guy make
sure to check out the riot para ser comm
where you'll also find a list of the
defo I P address and default login
information for more vendors on the
market and after that you're allowed to
get yourself a customized P shirt that
reads I am Pro because I know I approve
that message and that's because I am
don't know and for the very first time
this has been a quick guy on that from
seductive
