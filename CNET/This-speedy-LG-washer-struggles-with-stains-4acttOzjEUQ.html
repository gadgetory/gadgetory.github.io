washing machine you want to know that
the model you're getting is a good value
and unfortunately that just wasn't the
case with this $1100 front load LG
washer there are some things I liked
about it it was pretty easy to use I
didn't love the cluttered display that
made it a little difficult to see things
from a distance I do like the aesthetics
generally it looks nice and a little bit
more premium than its 1,100 bucks with
the gray stainless finish but at the end
of the day it just wasn't a good
performer compared to all of the other
front-load models we've reviewed so far
this one actually got one of the worst
scores one thing it did get right though
is features so I wish the performance
had been better but it actually has some
pretty cool features for its price it
has a related app that lets you
troubleshoot the appliance to see if
there are any issues with it without
having to call customer service and it
has a really fast cleaning time both the
normal and other settings are a little
bit faster on average and there's even a
15 minute speed wash that I used on my
clothes that worked pretty well
unfortunately I can't recommend this
machine overall for its poor performance
so I would definitely look for other
front-load washers first</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
