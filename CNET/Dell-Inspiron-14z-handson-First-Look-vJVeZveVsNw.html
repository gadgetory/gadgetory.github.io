a look at the dell inspiron 14z this is
a new version of the inspiron 14z part
of a redesigned inspiron lineup and if
you're looking at it you might go this
doesn't really look like a dell inspiron
i remember those as being sort of the
low-budget the very mainstream line from
dale kind of big bulky plasticky laptops
this new series of Inspiron so I
actually think they're very nicely
designed it look pretty good actually
look more expensive than they are case
in point this is an 8 99 14-inch it's
technically an ultrabook even though
it's a little bit bigger than most
ultrabooks it's got an optical drive in
it's got a discrete graphics card in it
all these things that don't really say
ultrabook but technically they sneak in
under the line there you know it's part
metal it's part plastic when you pick it
up it feels a little more plastic than
it looks it definitely looks a little
more expensive than it is when you touch
it you can kind of say okay this is
inspiron not like the more expensive XPS
line for example that dell has it's got
a nice big touch panel ever even though
it's got the separate left and right
mouse buttons a lot of laptops now
moving to that singular click pad and
the keyboard it sort of Dell's variation
on that island style they always have
keys that are just a little bit more
rounded I found the keyboard to be a
little classy a little a little mushy at
times the keys at a little bit of wiggle
on two fingers but nothing that's that's
too too terrible one thing I was
pleasantly surprised by was the fact
that little ports on the side of the
laptop are covered up by flap so you
don't see him it actually looks kind of
nice and you get to USB threes you got
HDMI I got an Ethernet jack not even the
2200 dollar 15-inch retina MacBook Pro
as an Ethernet jack although it does
have DisplayPort / Thunderbolt ports
that this guy lacks but when you think
about that right combination of price
performance end design I think you do
well to at least take a test drive in
this guy right here that is the dell
inspiron 14z</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
