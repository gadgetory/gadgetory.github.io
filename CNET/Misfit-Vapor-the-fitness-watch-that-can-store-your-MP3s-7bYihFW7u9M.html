a funky place right now do you connect
to your phone or do you stand alone and
offer functions away from it the misfit
vapor which is coming out later this
year looks like a concept design for
wear misfit and fossil might go next
it's a round AMOLED display watch looks
really bright but it also stores music
four gigabytes of on-board storage it
doesn't however stream it from your
phone you have to connect via USB and
get mp3s from your computer that might
change by the time vapor comes out later
this year the hopes are perhaps that it
would connect other streaming services I
mean obviously you'd probably want
something like Spotify or Amazon music
maybe that'll happen we don't know but
misfit vapor also can connect via Wi-Fi
to download email and connect away from
your phone plus it's five ATM
water-resistant which is saying that
most watches can't do and it has GPS
interesting idea but as a standalone
concept it really suggests that a lot of
fitness trackers are trying to find
their way
now that fitness trackers and Watchers
are looking for the next new thing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
