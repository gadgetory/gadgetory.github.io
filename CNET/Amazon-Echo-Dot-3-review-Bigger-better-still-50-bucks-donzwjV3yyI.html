smart home today with the new
third-generation
Amazon echo dot and this is it right
here this is the refresh for 2018 like
you can see it's still kind of a hockey
puck type design a little bit bigger
than before and that's because Amazon is
promising better sound from this thing
so it's got a little more oomph to it
and it's also got the fabric rim around
the edge you can see on this black
version here and that's because Amazon's
trying to help it better compete against
the fabric body Google home mini a lot
of people seem to prefer that fabric a
design looks a little more premium and
softer and more appropriate for the home
so it's kind of a tacit admission from
Amazon that that might have been a
better way to go with the design other
than that though basically the same
product you've got the same four buttons
up top the two that bring the volume up
and down here and then a button on the
right to mute the assistant and one to
activate her I'm not going to say her
name if I can help it here and then in
the back here you've got the same inputs
the audio in if you want to make a wired
connection to an external set of
speakers and the powered jack which in a
small change is not microUSB anymore
it's now just a normal pronged AC jack
so this is the new third gen echo dot
we're gonna start testing it out let's
take a look at how it does
Amazon's first two ecco dots hit the
market without any real competitors now
the echo dot 3.0 has to contend with the
Google home Mini a popular alternative
that looks and sounds better than the
last dot did the new fabric rim and the
stronger sound of the new dot are both
obvious attempts at neutralizing those
advantages it's the first time the dots
really needed to play defense so how did
Amazon do well let's start with sound
quality Amazon tells us that the new dot
is 70% stronger than the old one and I
got a say if you listen to the two
back-to-back you'll definitely hear the
difference
all right so the sound quality pretty
obviously stepped up from generation to
to generation three but generation 2
wasn't as strong as the Google home Mini
which debuted last year with sharper
sound than the echo dot does the new
dock close that gap I happen to think
that the dot does sound a bit better
than the whole Mini at this point but
it's very close neither one is as strong
as a full-size Smart speaker but both
can fill the room and they're more than
capable of doing your favorite playlists
justice of course that sound quality
argument is a moot point if you're just
gonna connect the dot with an external
set of speakers which you can still do
via bluetooth or the oxide jack with the
whole mini you don't get knocks out jack
at all you can only connect to other
speakers using bluetooth another
potential edge for the new dot you can
pair two of them together for stereo
audio now I like the feature better with
larger sized echo and echo plus speakers
here it just seems like a way to get you
to buy more dots than you need but you
do have the option of adding in an echo
sub for boosted bass aside from that
there's not a whole lot that's
inherently new here aside of course from
that new design and to Amazon's credit I
think they did a really nice job of it
the black fabric is a clear step up from
the plain plastic of before and I like
that they ditched the Amazon logo to
plus by keeping things more or less the
same with those buttons up top
Amazon's maintaining a consistent
experience across generations a dot
wasn't broken Amazon didn't fix it
still the dot doesn't have
interchangeable shells like the echo
does and while those never really took
off it still would have been nice if he
could have gotten at least one color
option that wasn't a shade of gray
Amazon played it super super safe here
probably a little more than they needed
to in the end what's the most important
thing about the new dot even with the
improved design and stronger sound it's
still just fifty dollars and honestly
it's kind of hard to imagine a fifty
dollar smart speaker that looks or
sounds much better the dot isn't your
only decent option anymore but it's
still an outstanding choice and the
constant competition that Google means
that the steady stream of new tricks and
features shouldn't slow down anytime
soon it's a safer buy as ever and a
great start if you want to build your
smart home around voice
