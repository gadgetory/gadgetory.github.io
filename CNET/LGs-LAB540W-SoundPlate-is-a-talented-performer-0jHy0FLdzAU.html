speaker stand or a speaker base a
product like the LG L ab540 W is
designed to act as a stand for your TV
while also boosting its audio
capabilities hi I'm ty Pendlebury from C
net and this LG is somewhat unusual
amongst its peers in that it's also a
full home theater system with a blu-ray
drive and Smart TV most speaker bases
just accept an optical or HDMI input and
can't play any content of their own this
package consists of two units the
speaker base with four woofers and a
wireless subwoofer which pairs as soon
as you plug them both in this LG sound
plate features the same interface of its
blu-ray players with shortcuts to the
most used apps such as Netflix and
Amazon video and is fairly zippy in use
the blu-ray player is 3d compatible as
well
there's HDMI in and out in addition to
Bluetooth and an optical input the
remote controller comes with it is big
and clunky but fairly easy to use while
video playback is excellent the audio
quality is geared towards music rather
than movies the integration between the
sub and the plate is excellent which
means you aren't alerted to the subs
location every time there's a
low-frequency effect for example the
sound can lack a little warmth though
due to the tiny drivers and other
products at the same price have more
convincing surround effects but for
speech clarity and music playback this
little speaker is excellent while $600
is not a small amount of money the LG
sound plate is a very good choice if
you're looking for a system that will
play music well in addition to playing
back blu-ray movies this has been Tye
