a factory reset think again I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your C net updates
before donating or reselling an old
smartphone many folks will do a factory
reset to wipe everything off the phone
but the problem is a factory reset
doesn't really delete everything a new
study from the security software maker
Avast found that it's still possible to
pull up photos emails text and other
documents from a reset Android phone for
the study Avast purchased 20 Android
smartphones off eBay and in those 20
factory reset phones they were still
able to recover more than 40 thousand
photos including 250 nude photos they
also recovered 750 emails and text
messages 250 contacts as well as the
identities of four previous owners and
one completed loan application all it
takes to pull up old data is a pretty
basic software program now a factory
reset does delete everything on the
surface but to truly delete the data you
need to rewrite over it so after a reset
you could fill up the phone with more
documents to make it harder to find the
original data Avast also has its own
Android app that can help you delete
data you can find more tips on how to do
this at seen it and by now you probably
heard about this wild potato salad
success story a guy posted a project on
Kickstarter asking the internet for a
$10 donation so he could just make some
potato salad well the internet loved his
humor and honesty so Zack brown of
Columbus Ohio raised more than $50,000
as of this report funds have come in
from about 4,000 people from countries
around the world Brown says the he'll
throw a massive potato salad party in
his hometown and invite all those from
the internet that helped him reach this
tasty dream now some have said he should
donate the money although you can't
specifically raise money for charity on
Kickstarter what he does with the profit
is up to him so yes he could donate it
the story has spawned other food
projects on Kickstarter melissa w from
or
again wants to make some bacon cupcakes
and if you don't eat $3 to mark in Fort
Myers Florida
well he'll send you a pancake in the
mail now there are some ground rules to
how Kickstarter works you can't just ask
for money to pay for your rent but a
project to create something even just a
side dish is fair game
but this potato salad is not just potato
salad it's a symbol for the American
dream to push the boundaries and do what
some would say is impossible and to get
famous on the internet for doing a
stupid thing and then getting paid for
doing it that's your tech news update
