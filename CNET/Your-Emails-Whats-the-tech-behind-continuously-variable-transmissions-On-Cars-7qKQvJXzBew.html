taking another of your emails about
high-tech cars and modern driving and
this one comes in from william v who
asks could we explain the technology
behind a CVT continuously variable
transmissions and why they're not used
for more performance cars he says one
would think the ability of a CVT to
maintain an ideal engine power band at
all times would make it a perfect
gearbox for sports performance and
racing equipment it absolutely would
seem that way William and I'm with you
on that being able to keep an engine in
that RPM sweet spot is one of the Holy
Grails of performance but there's a
problem CVTs don't have really strong
positive engagement because they are not
made up of cogs and teeth the way
traditional transmission is or really
hard locking clutches and torque
converters they're kind of a constant
slipping mechanism as a result they
don't handle really high power all that
well that's not where they have found
their main role though they do maintain
the sweet spot in engines but mostly to
seek economy not to seek maximum power
and torque output a CVT as you probably
know is made up of a bunch of pulleys
and belts a variable pulley metal steel
belt that is able to slide between these
varying pulley flanges all the time
that's the nature of its slightly
slippery technology we did a whole
episode on transmissions back in May of
2013 it was episode 18 that explains
this really well I'll put a link in the
show notes you have to go hunting for it
the show notes for this episode over at
cnet on cars.com another issue around
cbts in performance cars is that they
don't sound the same a car with a CVT
tends to constantly be in about the same
rev range more or less it doesn't run
all the way down and all the way up the
way a geared transmission can or could
and therefore it's not going to be very
satisfying to the performance driver who
likes the sound of running through the
gears and a real transmission
