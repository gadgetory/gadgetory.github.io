welcome to google issues for everything
google that we can pack inside of a show
each week and Mobile World Congress is
wrapped up and really the focus is now
on HTC their official reveal for the
next HTC One is set for March 25th but
it looks like they've already been
scooped by a kid from schaumburg
illinois he posted a 12-minute hands-on
with the device nearly three weeks ahead
of HTC's own announcement now the video
shows a familiar leak design that
Evelyn's has posted as a still image the
video also shows off a lot of the next
sense six-point oh you I confirms the
dual rear cameras that could help to
enable optical zoom on smartphone
cameras or could be used to shoot deep
focus images and the addition of a micro
SD card slot it also brings a simplified
camera interface with six shooting modes
but it's a pretty darn good first look
and shows off a whole lot more than even
the teasers ACC is putting out on their
own right now but HTC really you guys
have got to keep this under wraps better
than that all right it's safe to say
Samsung had a pretty busy week last week
but they're bringing more with the
official announcement of their
Chromebook two series notebooks in two
sizes an 11.6 inch model at 319 dollars
and a 13.3 inch model that also features
a full 1080p display that will retail at
399 and its biggest design feature it's
faux leather stitching on the edges that
really make it look like a notebook now
you can expect to see these Chromebooks
available in April and a lot of buzz
around cars and mobile operating systems
this week after Mercedes Volvo Honda and
others announced that Apple's carplay
formerly known as iOS in the car will
become in 2014 now a recent job posting
revealed Mercedes is looking for an
engineer to work on a Google projected
mode for integrating content from
Android devices into an in-car system
now Mercedes will showcase an apple
carplay system at the geneva motor show
the sweet but they also won't be
platform specific and went on the record
to say they would also offer android
support as soon as Google brings its own
in-car infotainment system to the market
so it's good to hear
not that we're all buying a Benz anytime
soon but car manufacturers aligning with
just one mobile OS and not others
wouldn't be the smartest move but this
is a very young market so we'll see how
it figures itself out for consumers and
a lot of you asked or commented on the
Google Nexus SmartWatch last week that's
rumored to be revealed in March here's
something we're checking out from
android police after they put together
an article for the motorola prototype
watch that never became a real project
but was allegedly going by the name
google watch with the official codenamed
gem now remember at the time Motorola's
mobility division was still under google
before they sold it recently to lenovo
now these images were from 2013 in you
can even see the USB connector on the
wrist strap this doesn't mean this is
what the Google watch will look like but
Motorola Mobility even tweeted that they
will release a SmartWatch of their own
this year because who isn't and this
could be a hint of what's coming from
them all right let's check out some
quick hits stick you with Lenovo a
little bit they've announced that they
will be releasing a line of smartphones
in partnership with Ashton Kutcher you
know Ashton's a smart guy but yeah I
don't want a phone from him what about
mine dude also project are released a
new video to let people know what
they've been up to lately as their phone
blocks modular smartphone concept
continues to evolve they partner with 3d
systems to help build some of the
modules that will be part of the phone
and they'll also be announcing news for
availability of the development kit in
the near future and also the guessing
game for where Google's barge will
settle next after it was ordered to
leave treasure island looks to have
found a home in lovely Stockton the
rumored floating showroom which might
showcase some of their Google X projects
will finish construction at the port of
Stockton all right now we asked you last
week to tell us what you thought of
Samsung's announcements and here are
some of them ken says in a word lame due
to replace my s2 and was looking forward
to something innovative in the s5 but
nada now Ron Kerr writes in with I was
looking forward to the new Galaxy s5 but
it isn't what I expected the rumors on
the internet showed a full metal case
with no buttons in it looked awesome I
have an HTC One
it looks better than the galaxy now Ron
the reality is that rumors are rumors
and they might seem like they're facts
but that's why you can't get your hopes
up too high until you actually see what
a company officially delivers now zoha
says can I ask you to stop hating on
samsung I mean it's so obvious you are
not a fan I think the galaxy s5 was
awesome and a lot of people would buy it
when it comes out I personally can't
wait zoha I'm happy for you really I am
but I called the s4 the best phone last
year and did you forget that i raved
about the gear fit look you were one of
only a handful of Samsung users that
were so positive about the announcements
but most people were just let down
alright guys that's going to do for this
week's show email me at Google licious
at cnet com or you guys can tweet me at
brian Tong thanks so much for watching
and we'll see you guys next week for
some more of that Google issues
