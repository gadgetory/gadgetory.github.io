is the beats pill XL the bigger brother
to the standard beats pill Bluetooth
speaker we're little tardy and reviewing
it but the good news is that it has come
down and priced a bit from its list
price of 300 and now can be found online
for around 270 dollars in a variety of
different color options I wasn't a big
fan of the original bill which was
overpriced for the sound it produces but
thankfully this hundred dollar more
expensive jumbo pill is a far better
sounding speaker well it obviously isn't
as compact as its little brother
it weighs a manageable three point three
pounds and is a built in handle that
makes it easy to carry around
additional features include NFC tap tap
air technology for phones that support
it a USB charging port and speakerphone
capabilities if you can afford two of
these guys you can sync them together
and augment the sound or turn one into a
left speaker and the other into a right
speaker for stereo sound battery life is
rated at 15 hours which is good and the
speaker will automatically turn off
after 10 minutes of no signal detection
to conserve power the speaker produces
big sound for its size with relatively
strong bass and decent clarity and a
combination of the pill excels strong
sound excellent design and feature set
make it a reasonable value and its price
point that's the beats pill XL thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
