Francisco welcome to reporters
roundtable hey you know Facebook
obviously is becoming our big area of
social interaction it's our social
infrastructure it's where we connect
it's where we break up it's where we
interact is where we do all our all are
living with each other and increasingly
giving gifts is a big part of that
interaction so we're talking today about
one of the most important companies in
that space is called wrap w RPP it's a
new platform for gift-giving at least
here in the US it's been live for about
a year in Europe and Sweden in
particular it's far from the only face
book based gift-giving platform but I
think it's really interesting so I
brought in the CEO of the company on
their US launch day the el Mar wiinblad
into the round table to talk about
what's going on with rap first of all
congratulations on your US launch thank
you and thanks for coming in give us
first of all a quick pitch what is rap
and why as a socially connected Facebook
person should I care see if you have
facebook user and you have a smartphone
which is actually the most most people
today but wrapped us it's make it super
simple and easy to give a gift cards
digital and social gift cards of real
value and most of the gift cards are
actually free and if you want you can
then add money to that the free gift
card and you can actually jointly
contribute to those gift cards and send
them to your Facebook friends so if i
want to give somebody a gift card that
your partners will give me money to give
to them free money yeah that's the kind
of spin we have a trap is that a lot of
big retailers especially
brick-and-mortar retailers are spending
tremendous amount of money on
advertisement to draw people into the
stores and buy and the most most of the
kind of classic advertising methods for
brick and mortars are not very good to
target with I mean TV broadcasting and
and paper advertisement and direct
marketing and so forth so what they can
do with rap is that it can actually
offer me to give you a free gift card if
you fit the demographic that they
actually would like to reach and get
into the store oh wait so if I want to
give you a gift you have to have like
what a Klout score of a certain area a
certain
in order to qualify for the free
Starbucks or gap or whatever it is gift
that I want to give you now the way we
do is actually we use the same date as
Facebook use for their advertised but
you know they look at your social
profile which is of course you know
gender age and location where you live
and of course with a smartphone and the
apps that we have we can actually be
more precise with the location based on
you know the position you can get in the
phone so what we're doing based on that
data and the retailer's can then make
sure that we reach people that are
actually in the area that actually fits
the demographic they actually has as the
favorite customers so if that's the case
and that's a person you know that you
would like to gift a free gift card will
most likely pop up when you're going to
give that person so two things first of
all if I want to give you a gift yes do
you have to be a member of the rap
community no okay so the weight stars is
that you download the app and you can
start gift all your facebook friends
through our app on the smartphone
android platform and iphone iOS platform
and of course through the rap calm the
website okay but when I now go to give
you a gift or versus giving a Steve a
gift the gifts that are available for me
to give to you versus give to him will
be different yes it's fascinating so
they're different based on of course in
am I based in Stockholm Sweden and
therefore you're going to see Swedish
gifts and that retailers that would like
to target you know my my demographic
which is you know my age and gender &amp;amp;
where I live they going to pop up when
you're going to give me and even you're
going to give someone who lives in San
Francisco of course retailers who would
like to target those people that has
that age group and gender and location
will pop up is this really a gift or is
this like I'm giving you a sponsorship I
mean it sounds like it's it's kind of a
new concept of gift I mean when I want
to give you know my mother a gift it's
not like hey here's a five dollar gift
certificate from from the rug store it's
like this is a gift is from the heart
you know so the way it works i mean the
gift is free and it's no strings
attached oh it's a gift card value may
be five to ten dollars and can be up to
fifty dollars we have here in the US
when we
we have gift cards for free between 25
and 5 dollars from different retailers
and of course if it's to your mom and
maybe she lives in New York here you
kind of missed her birthday we just like
to say thank you mom for last week and
when you were here babysitting your kids
or whatever you can then actually start
with a free gift card and then add money
to that gift card so if it's not enough
for you if you don't feel a bit like
five or ten or twenty five dollars is
not enough you just add to that gift
card and you know grow it to twenty
twenty-five fifty dollars as an example
interesting so you've launched you said
about a year ago in Sweden we launched
November 15 so it's less than half year
okay sorry and and then what have you
learned from so we launched in Sweden
Sweden is not as mature when it comes to
gift coding us as the u.s. we don't have
the same gift card culture as here at
the first four months in Sweden we had
200,000 people actively you know
downloading and starting to wrap their
their friends as we say and 1.4 million
gift cards were sent in Sweden and put
that in context it's 4.5 million
Facebook users in Sweden's it's a small
country and roughly the combination of
Facebook and smartphones or Android and
iOS or roughly three and a half million
people so 200,000 out of 33 million
people in the first four months and have
a given 1.4 million gifts it's a pretty
good success that's interesting so what
hang on we have a gift card culture here
yeah gift cards aware ya know it's
interesting I was kind of surprised to I
mean us an average adult gives five gift
cards pre per year and which is a very
high amount I am falling behind hey and
it's interesting you know it's it's a
and and and and the size of the market
is actually a hundred billion dollars so
that's three times bigger than all
advertisement being done on internet
last year in the US and so yeah I based
on that numbers of a stun too and I can
realize that this is a gift card mark a
hundred billion dollars of pieces of
plastic with stored value that get lost
and discarded the the amount of
unclaimed value what that's called the
breakage I believe it must be immense
yeah it is and I think you know
threesome our business model is based on
really drive people into the stores and
our business model is aligned with the
retailers in that sense that we only
earn money if that gift card is used and
I think the gift card is it's a much
better place to have the gift card in
your mobile phone rather in the drawer
next to your bed that you can own you
know for coming about the mobile phone
aspect of it also rap is mainly an app
on your mobile phone then the not name
comes from rap an app so that's the
reason why we have two piece in in our
name and and the whole idea is to make
sure that people are interacting and
giving gift to each other you know on a
daily basis through their mobile phones
rather than through the web or or you
know buying piece of plastics in stores
so when I get a gift or wrap gift I then
I need the app or doesn't come as an SMS
do I have to have a smartphone order to
redeem my gift from from you or somebody
yeah so what we've done is that we are
focusing on the people that have
smartphones and actually have that as
one way to actually a target for for for
the retailers and make sure so that you
need to have a smartphone Android and
iOS device and on facebook so that's the
kind of the limitations in terms of the
reach we have with our with our
applications which is fairly big today
well there are a lot of people with
smartphones and and Facebook okay so you
know what people are giving to other
people is is there a privacy angle or a
potential problem here with me giving I
don't know a girlfriend a gift to a
jewelry store actually no let's strike
that I'm never going to give somebody a
gift to a jewelry store I want to give a
real gift yeah I think you know I think
that's the interesting thing if you look
at at at gift card in here in the US
actually give courses most thought of
the gift to receive by consumers in the
US five years in a row and I think one
of the reasons is that and I just look
at myself and I'm going to try to give
something to mind the waters as an
example I know they love hmm as an
excellent but I know they like fashion
but you know for me to buy something at
H&amp;amp;M to my 14 year old daughter is deemed
to fail so I think she's much more happy
to get a gift card from her dad and then
of course due to chopping herself and
decide the size color and what
would like to buy now I saw another
there are other businesses in this space
when I covered a while ago it's called
Karma have you seen that yeah I think
they have a very interesting take on
given social gifting yeah there's a very
different model that is I actually pick
out a gift for the recipient you know
but they don't have as far as i can tell
they don't have this kind of marketing
angle yeah that you've got I mean our
focus is to really make a win-win
solution for the consumer the consumer
has the opportunity to give away free
gift cards to to to their friends and do
it more on a casual basis you know not
just for birthdays but bike thanks for
great meeting yesterday miss your mom I
hope you get well soon instead of just
sending a thank-you SMS text message or
doing a facebook wall post we think you
know casual gifting is a very
interesting aspect and that's what have
grown our business tremendously in in
sweden and europe where we have launched
all right all that thought we'll be
right back after this gift of a message
from our sponsor
you
alright so you just launched here in the
US if who are some of the tell us about
the launch I mean who are some of the
partners anything you've learned in the
24 hours or so since you you want it's
not even 24 hours you lesson we launched
this morning have you slept not that
much I you know I slept a couple hours
this tonight yeah okay well good luck
with that but um tell us about who your
partners are and what they are looking
to get from this relationship with Rena
so we are working with the brands like
hmmm gaps fo right here in the US and
even Wall Street Journal's and angry
birds that's it it's a very interesting
kind of breath of of different retailing
so it's both digital goods if we can
call angry bird that and it's like a
with water journal it's actually their
digital edition plus the week in
addition and then of course more
traditional brick-and-mortar retailers
is it a difficult sell I mean do you
walk into the macy's or the sacks of
avenue and say I've got this new way for
you to reach potential customers and
sell gift cards how is the sales process
going for it for our company has been
out for a while the US launch you have
some impressive launch partners but it's
a relatively small number I I think you
know the number is usually when we
launched we launched with 528 retailers
that has a good mix actually we launched
with 15 here in the US and we have
another 30 actually brands and retailers
on his way in so usually we do launch
with some and then we add for every week
some additional brands that going to
come in to make it something that's
happening in the app and now it's a new
retail you can give I think when you
look at added from from from a retailer
perspective I think this is a great way
to drive sales at the same time you are
actually getting great brand positioning
at you know both on the facebook wall in
a friend to friend framework and and and
then of course the media for them is
free and that's the reason why they can
actually give away the gift card let you
give away gift cards to your friends I
get the pitch and it's a compelling
pitch but how is the sale I'm curious
how the sales process is going because I
see all these interesting new businesses
whether it's Groupon and I want to talk
about groupon
whether it's group on with their
different pitch or a karma to an extent
as we talked about or what's this other
one might but but but oh yeah keep which
is doing a engagement trying to engage
people when they're playing games and uh
how do you find the person to sell this
to I mean how much of the budget can you
get versus you know broadband
advertising a broad-based advertiser is
very focused marketing consumer
marketing you're doing here yeah I think
from a retailer perspective especially
if you're brick and mortar retailer
you're looking for much more efficient
ways to drive sales into your
brick-and-mortar stores and of course so
far they have not really found a good
Edward method for them that works
offline I think that the compelling
story about rap is that it's very very
good targeting opportunities within wrap
it leverage the social graph and the
smartphone in a very positive way for
the mobile for the retailers at the same
time it's building their brands and they
only pay when actually you as a consumer
goes in and redeem your card so the
whole thing is performance-based for
them so they don't have any costs
whatsoever until actually US consumer
are using your your your gift card is
there any danger of a Groupon type of
brand erosion I mean when when I buy a
Groupon I mean that the general thinking
is I'm now a customer of groupon not a
customer of the store and buying the
groupon for since you're giving things
away to people is there a chance that
people just take the freebie or give the
free bien and not build the brand which
is what the companies want I think note
and Groupons business model is attached
to brand to massive discount and
actually getting you are looking for DS
to buy that upfront and then actually of
course using that deal which is a
massive discount wrap is exactly the
opposite which is you are giving a gift
to a friend who receives a gift card or
in value if it's sponsored and free for
you it means it's still that same still
holds the same value for the one who
receives the gift card and of course the
context for the retailer here's they get
posted on your facebook wall by a friend
in the context of saying thank you
congratulations miss you and so forth so
that's something that is actually
brand-building rather than brand
illusion where they actually being
picked by someone looking for a great
deal and they're picked because they put
a big discount next to the rack do I
have to broadcast this can i just give
somebody a gift without putting it on
the wall or can i just give a private
gift of course you cannot try to give it
so i mean you can you can send it very
probably do a text message and but it's
interesting thing when you share share
it on the facebook wall you actually
open up for other people to contribute
to the gift and that's happening a lot
when you have a birthday or a holiday
season greeting or whatever where people
actually can add into the gift so you
give card let's say at the you know
sporting bike a company or whatever and
everyone knows that you're great you
really into bicycling it whatever i mean
you can actually see people group giving
into the gifts so the gift card actually
grow a lot in your wallet in your mobile
phone great well thanks for coming in
it's a very very interesting model very
creative very interestingly to make
money and help people connect with each
other and give gifts as well good luck
with that good luck with your continued
good luck with your us launch thank you
again that's y el Mar wiinblad from a
wrap WR a PP com you can get it on
