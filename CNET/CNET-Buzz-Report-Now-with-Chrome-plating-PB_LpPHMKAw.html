online information source for the
digital age
hi i'm molly wood and welcome to the
buzz report this week chrome arrives
rocking out with apple and science rep
but first it's the gadget of the week
the gadje of the week is the nikon d90
do out sometime this month the d90 is
the first digital SLR that takes video
in fact it takes HD video 24 frames per
second 1280 by 720 video DSLR that takes
video and the body only package will be
under a thousand dollars ring me up and
now for the news as you've almost
certainly heard by now google has a new
product out called chrome let's take a
look in a world where people are trying
out the change a revolution for
computing has arrived it's a product
that answers the desperate pleas of
people everywhere who need a new
beginning a new way to live a new
browser
we'll miss you don lafontaine anyway yes
a new browser yay and by most accounts
including mine chrome is fast sleek and
not even remotely ready to replace
Firefox for daily use but some pundits
say the browser wars have been reignited
by the appearance of chrome and indeed
thank goodness we've got another option
it was downright pathetic before with
only Firefox Internet Explorer Safari
Opera flock slim browser IE variants
like avant sue maxthon which is
apparently huge in China to name a few
there's also Omni web for Mac you can
still download netscape navigator 9
there's Firefox variants like tor Park
anyway you see what I'm saying we were
desperate for some choices well I guess
if you're on a Mac you are desperate for
choices but there's no chrome for mac so
keep up the desperate crying out for
change I guess good luck in other news
Apple has invited the media to an event
in san francisco on tuesday September
ninth the invite said let's rock as a
result it's widely believed that apple
will announce new versions of the ipod
including possibly the thinnest ipod
nano ever and a new ipod touch you guys
don't know anything dollars to donuts
this is steve's big reveal of the Apple
high-five two point oh yeah take it to
the bank also this week a man named
Steven Haywood offered up a live stream
of his wife giving birth to the couple's
child on ustream TV we have yet to
confirm later reports that after
Stephens wife recovered from the worst
pain she'd ever felt in her life and the
physical and emotional ordeal that many
have described as a kin to running a
marathon she beats Steven to death with
a diaper genie and now let's have a look
at what's clogging the tubes this week
it's the Large Hadron Collider rep Kate
calpine and will barras are tearing up
the YouTube with this rap video about
the Large Hadron Collider which comes
online next week and will according to
the rap make discoveries that will rock
your mind
funny cute and educational in fact I
wish it weren't quite so educational
because now I can't make jokes about the
LHC destroying the world by accidentally
creating a black hole that sucks in the
entire universe in a reverse the Big
Bang because I know better now stupid
science and that's it for this week's
show I'm Molly wood and this has been
