Roundtable I am Rafe Needleman in San
Francisco and this is the last reporters
roundtable at least by me it has been a
really great run guys
I however and I'm leaving CNET so this
is my last show and I'm going get you
will never guess where I'm going
unless you're ever watching anything
I've ever done because I'm going to
Evernote I'm gonna work help them build
out their platform and a lot of other
cool new projects and I'm really psyched
about that but what I wanted to do
before they shut off all my access here
at CNET is I've created for everybody
a Rafe needleman's I'm out of here
awards or the Audis because really this
is a show about navel-gazing these are a
bunch of companies products and ideas
that have really stuck with me all based
on stories I've written over they really
stuck with me over the years and I
wanted to talk about them because I
think they're fun and give some credit
to people in the industry who are doing
really amazing things and some not so
amazing things and the only way I could
do that without just droning on and on
myself is to bring in one of the other
great commentators the great commentator
here at Siena and that's Brian Cooley
aye I pumped a raw onion into the office
to tear up we were doing a Next Top Chef
thing demo here earlier that's all it is
yeah anyway Brian thanks for joining us
Brian of course does car tech videos and
we've been partners in crime for a long
time yeah the truth is I want to get
into the awards because I hate boring
farewells I care about them but I know
that you guys out there don't really
want to hear me get all teary but Brian
and I started pretty close to each other
at Siena and it was located in its
original building which a lot of folks
don't know was a soundstage that was the
original set for the streets of San
Francisco that's where the show was
originally shot and that's where our
original TV shows came from we were part
of that growing complex there yeah and
you are you
you were there early on and you giving
me the finger as you walked by my radio
booth it was great I was angry at times
yeah yeah I remember that I missed those
days that was 1996 if I recall its right
and then anyway I left like an idiot and
did some other stuff and then came back
about eight years ago so I've had two
stints to sense you know anyway thanks
Brian for joining me I wouldn't help me
anywhere else today helping poke holes
in my I mean I literally would not be
anywhere else today I'd nothing on my
calendar well it's nice of you to slot
us in to your otherwise solitary play
solitaire and you do the little sound
effects box all day but instead I'm here
with Rafe and of course Steven Beach
improving yes thank you it's been a
pleasure since like the first week I
worked here I was like wow this
reporters round table is an awesome show
and their previous producer Benito
Gonzalez series like hey man you like
that reporter try on table show right
I'm like yeah dude I love it it's really
good but it was a pleasure to work on
the show and good luck to you thank you
it's gonna be fun anyway you can follow
me on twitter at Rafe find me on
Facebook and Google+ and will you leave
me your Twitter handle
it's can you have my Twitter handle it's
not my name
but it's so cool I'll make it my name
why can't I just find out Brian where
was I one though that was available I
missed out on so much anyway I'll go to
blog that evernote.com for more
information my name - rape I'm gonna do
that I say I'm rave coolie he's got we
go we get mistaken for each other except
you're the one who has hair but anyway I
could do it we could swap if we swap
glasses right now it would freak people
out I just spray this we could change
the lower thirds and people would say no
that's correct yeah no III occasionally
get what female pitch emails from people
say I saw you covered the new Ford Focus
let's walk glasses come on just be full
of ask for this from de wine or filthy
oh holy look at this okay now all right
see a thing okay
Rafe you're an idiot I'm glad you're
leaving coolly I hate you
god you're a pompous ass
okay nice we finally accomplished
something that I've had on my bucket
list for a long time oh there we go
okay feeling good Oh alrighty so these
are without further ado the Audi Awards
yeah thanks for taking that pimple off
hey okay so here they are I have ten I'm
gonna give you a couple here you can
find the rest on the reporters
roundtable blog and they start with the
best customer experience that's a good
one to start with base I bar based on a
story I wrote about dealing with Dell
and Apple and one of those two companies
won the best customer experience award
and it was not Dell oh my god anyway um
and so I gave the award to Apple because
although I keep buying Apple products
that break literally railer out of four
out of six Apple products I've bought in
the last two years have broken and it
needed repair I keep buying more because
I'm an idiot
and they just they Apple just makes
everything easyy they're good about
taking care of the breakage though right
oh they're fantastic I take in a broken
product they say here's a new one and I
leave yeah they're really good about
replacing stuff that they know and they
don't tell you they know which I find
very nice I've had a couple friends who
go in there with phones that were very
clearly user error smashed yeah and
they'll replace them and say oh yeah
we've heard there's a number of they're
doing this no you're not you're being
nice so it's very smart they they if you
have Apple Care though right yeah it
depends know sometimes even without I
might have to get AppleCare my new my
air here before it because you're not
gonna company machine anymore yeah no
this is - yeah and then with that Apple
Care I know folks who've gone in there
with a clear let me know you bring in an
iPad with a dented corner and a broken
screen and they say oh yeah we heard
some of these screens were mounted
incorrect at the factory cutter you know
looking at the corner and ignoring it Oh
a couple stories like that yeah they
think it's very variable by Store and
who you talk to of course and if you're
a young female versus an old guy but
it's whatever plus so there's an Apple
tax but the other side of the Apple tax
is the Apple welfare welfare it's
perfect I'm gonna come along with a
follow up and I would give a runner up
to Amazon I've had the same experience
that Amazon is I think you have had with
Apple I have some Apple products I
haven't broken one yet so
gone back to them looking for their
largesse but Amazon gets on this list
much like you have your personal story
they sent me a thank-you card once that
was personally handwritten personally
addressed personally stamped the stamp
was on there crooked with some spit next
to it yeah I mean they actually the
database flagged me obviously as an
addictive Amazon customer but they took
the time to write me a note nice that on
top of the fact that I have never had a
bad experience in the Amazon or even one
of their sellers is just I'm blown away
I I have had Amazon send the wrong
present to somebody as a gift and that
did not battle sorry yeah yeah but I
still have Amazon so first that because
it was just a hilarious experience to my
sister for Christmas yeah I sent her a
DVD of some movie she wanted to watch
what she received was how to fix your
marriage her marriage is on the rocks
that makes it perfect well everybody's
marriages you know it takes work
obviously what are you talking about
and I called Amazon they're like oh but
tell you what just keep that DVD I send
you another one right Yeah right I'm
gonna keep it now we're gonna keep it I
haven't had one of those happen yet that
might change right but I will say this
about Amazon they do Netflix better than
Netflix in the sense of streaming or
discs in the sense streaming I don't use
this anymore they have but you can buy
that you can buy the discs on Amazon
faster than Netflix will loan you one
it's amazing with Prime it's like how'd
that get here I just I just let go of
the mouse button how can that be here
already
I love am i I'm using Amazon Prime and
Amazon videos now more than I'm using
Netflix I'm considering canceling that
I'm trending that way and you may have
seen the Consumer Reports research
yesterday that's a lot of people are
using Netflix but not happy with it as
much as they are with lower usage
services like Amazon interesting trend
so speaking of which I want to give an
Audi award to the best online retailer
which is everybody's refurb store
anytime you can buy a refurb absolutely
I'm with you I'm totally with you
there's no I got a refurb TiVo I got a
refurb harmony remote
I have bought refurb ThinkPads
in the past yep save a lot of money and
it is just the heck of a deal I by
refurb photo gear no problem ah I had
them on a Nikon d7000 came out a couple
months ago it when you couldn't get it I
bought a refurb it was absolutely not an
issue in a camera's delicate right a lot
of things can go wrong that you can't
always tell I mean how you know the
picture is not shifted in terms of color
or aberration is that just the lens or
is it a defective body right but I have
no doubts about it and I've had no
problem with the camera whatsoever you
know why I like refurbs in addition to
the fact that you can generally save a
few percentage points is that every
refurb the company stands behind us so
they're direct company sells generally
yeah we're talking factory refurb
totally right with many difference yes
then store returns that are checked and
resealed that's a different thing that's
the Frye's reefer those are those are
those are refried right yeah not
refurbished the thing I love about
refurbs is that these are products that
in addition to rolling off the assembly
line have something either went wrong
with them where they were just returned
they go back to the factory and then the
technicians have to hand verify each one
and really in detail and with a rigorous
checklist the factory again has put into
place they've been checked twice yeah
why wouldn't you want double quality
you're you're buying double quality for
less money or you can get less checking
for more money what are you gonna do
you're gonna go to get the refurb every
time again factory is the key though yep
not some other program where the
retailer's done it because they don't
have technology to check it out yeah
Apple has a pretty good factory story
rate refurb the discounts aren't as good
as you would like them to be but they're
still well with Apple they never are
follows here is my Audi award for the
worst growing pervasive can't get away
from it technology you know what I'm
gonna say 3d TV Oh mostly I hate 3d
because I don't see 3d so this is very
personal you're one of the 10% oh yeah
up to 10% yeah of the I'm a flat viewer
interesting yeah all right so here arts
you're biased
totally I see 3d fine and I still vote
for 3d and oh really why do you not like
it because I just I me gives me a
headache and because let me tell you
this because I have a six year old son
and all the kids movies are coming out
in 3d he wants to watch my 3d cars see
them that way
so I have to go okay we're gonna go see
you know a movie and you're gonna have a
good time I'm gonna have a headache
thank you so you see it what do you see
when you see a 3d film two images side
by side oh you're kidding mmm Oh your
life is a hell yeah oh no no that's not
good no wonder the Masters never worked
for me right you missed the whole slice
of American childhood no that's why I'm
angry and bitter and I'm with you on 3d
TV that work let us count the ways the
glasses yeah the possible headaches and
nausea or the lack of 3d viewing among a
large a significant minority of
population there's nothing to watch last
I checked on Amazon there are I think
maybe 300 3d blu-ray titles that's
nothing
I mean we complain about there being
what twenty five thousand titles on
Netflix streaming that's considered
small well then what's 280 it says
there's nothing to watch but kiss and
then there's the exactly and then
there's the whole idea that this
technology has a weird battle between
passive and active hmm they aren't
different enough in their quality to
make the decision easy it's real
frustrating and then of course
proprietary technology on the glasses
this is this thing is dead in the aisles
as any retailer will tell you yeah I
mean you get 3d technology for free
under need even a low-end TV that you
buy yeah it's not really an upcharge
anymore yeah or barely it's not it's not
perceptible but it's just yes so 3d
teeth through the but the upside of 3d
is a you get brighter and faster refresh
TVs because they will do they need to be
paid up yeah right but they would have
gone there anyway right okay so that's I
think yeah freebie the other freebie is
if you don't like 3d and you can go see
a non 3d version of a 3d movie there's
not community in the theater I saw I saw
avatar and Prometheus in 2d and it was
also because that's the loser the loser
nobody wants to go there there's there's
rave sitting there yeah with like you
know someone some other old guy or
something over there right it's the
eyepatch it's you and all the pirates
there all right the best new idea for
email because I'm making up my own
awards here the Audi for the best new
idea for email goes to self deleting
messages it's just something you
imagined or does it exist it's something
that this guy who works
in the email industry imagined okay the
the CEO of this company other inbox
which I really like yeah has proposed
this idea of commercial emails like you
get a coupon from GoDaddy or something
like that yeah and that coupon is good
for a week okay and it you probably auto
file it somewhere in your email box and
then no long past its life a year later
you go back and your coupons folder and
your email has 80,000 messages in it
that are taking up space interesting why
do they stick around so all you have to
do is put a header in the the inner the
email header those he calls it the ex
expires that expires for the date on it
and when you compose the message you
will as the sender if you're doing the
right thing right you'll date it out
yeah this will be for bulk email for PR
pitches in our business yeah I mean how
many times where I get a bunch of those
like I've gotten a chance to look at
them and while they're over now right or
anything that has a quantity that only a
certain urban people can attend or can
download or what have you white paper
downloads in there and once they've all
been done they can go out of my inbox oh
that's different that's cool cool too
right so quota based as well as time and
date based and oh make it go away
obviously nothing just delete it anymore
but go into the self delete box like the
spam box if these will go away in 90
days if you don't that's a cool idea
that's a very cool idea and it could
help manage a lot of the frustration
that we feel with spam that is kind of
quasi spam things that I want but I
don't want them to live forever yes I
love this idea I hope you don't pick it
up it was been a year or two since I
wrote the story and I haven't seen much
happening with it I like him I like it
now I want to give an Audi to the
simplest product out in there now this
is what's happening right now as I cover
startups and and all technology things
are getting easier to use the good ones
and the most interesting products that
are out there are things like Instagram
and interest
spero the email app instead of all here
to have been developed by a five year
old yes simple they look simple but
really they're not and there's a lot of
thought that goes into these new apps to
make them clear and easily graspable
and they look like what the startup
walks are calling the MV the least
viable the most
I forgot that I am the least viable
profile product okay
MVP I'm getting it wrong got it I'm
getting it wrong that's not that's not
right
it is the tendinous yes it is the
minimum MVP Minimum Viable Product oh
the least it has to be to be a viable
product Minimum Viable Product got it so
what are you whatever your desired of
lowest common denominator yeah okay
whatever you're doing strip it down to
its essence and give users that and
chances are not only can you get the
product out faster if you strip out all
the craft yep but chances are users will
like it more because it's focused and
they don't have to deal with the
intellectual overhead and this is a key
part of launching a product in
particular you can always layer in more
stuff once you get early digestible buy
him right from a large base who will
then evangelize but if you don't get
that initial base of evangelists which
is the typical misfire it's typically
because you have too much going on this
is the story of what I call transparency
and and intuition I it can be enough for
me to understand how to use it but I
have to first understand why to use it
and stripping it down off and makes the
message simple when this does that right
got it the worst example of living up to
the idea of the MVP is Microsoft they're
the opposite there they are just feature
after feature after feature after
feature and thinking that people buy
products because they're features when I
saw Microsoft ads for using PowerPoint
for a homeschooling mom and the kids
were saying I love the transitions that
is just such a gigantic misfire
yeah I love the effects options where I
can delay the start of the transition
before on click start of a looped video
yeah that's great right this is what
this is why power users love that but
you got a feather in with a Minimum
Viable products a great phrase yeah Oh
Apple gets the opposition I forget so
the iPod did less with a black and white
screen for longer than anyone else did
more with color right and don't own the
world my award for the simplicity the
simplicity Audi goes to this little app
that nobody has heard of called Trello
tre LLL never heard of it and it's a
task board it's like Pinterest for
things to do you just type something in
it and it goes upon that I gotta do this
this is in process this is done and you
drag things around but how do I
see it web-based yeah it's a web app it
is it mobile based yet I don't know
that'll check into so this is I have yet
to find a good to-do list I use my
calendar which is clunky yeah
and I'm always moving things ahead to
the next day when they don't get done
real messy if I use the Google Calendar
that's the best I've got I use wonder
list right now yeah Evernote Bolin I've
tried I've tried Google Tasks and I
don't know for some reason it doesn't
work for me Apple just had one but
Trello is good for groups as well and
it's just it's not simple like Instagram
is simple but it takes an incredibly
complex and painful task which is
organizing a bunch organ emultion izing
lists and makes it so unbelievably
intuitive it just it's I'm gobsmacked
that's a technical term
it is my next Audi and they're a bunch
here that I'm gonna leave in the blog
post which you can find on news com
government overreach best thing
government's done for startups you'll
find that in the blog post the most
anticipated product by you this is a
great one you got to read that one the
most anticipated by me mmm-hmm oh yeah
leave it for the blog I'm telling
everyone out there they got it they
gotta go see it it's a good one uh-huh
okay and best bargain app who doesn't
want to see that one yes it's not what
you think Brian you're good rapes
dialing it in just saying finally I love
number 10 just boy I got one too
the boy was he wrong award this is the
best I love these those two we don't
just look like we're both idiots
this moron yep rafe Needleman right
before the iPad came out I wrote this
post oh it was so smart why consumers
won't buy tablets ladies and gentlemen
raise Needleman thank you very much like
two or three tablets here's by the way
as a little side note here here's my tip
for what happens to you when you write a
post like this and you actually find out
that tablets change your life and maybe
a hundred times better which they do oh
my god what a second machine yeah go to
Staples or Office Depot and get one of
those those vertical file folders for
putting files in yeah that's the best
place to store all the tablets you
accumulate got that many yeah
wire-wrap yes for tab that's a great
idea they works beautifully a minute
yeah you don't you don't the open wire
ones you want the ones that are closed
and they have them at Home Depot give
they're like metal panels yeah oh
interesting what a great idea
yeah you are clever you're like you're
like Rafe Stewart Martha's long-lost son
all right I have one of these someday
I'll go dig it up although it would
mortify me too much probably five or six
years ago I remember a lengthy
explanation I gave on squawk box about
how the iPod has crested let's say I had
a little more Headroom after that
because because the windows what the
hell was the windows-based museum that's
what presume there first I thought it
was presumed anyway the Windows Media
Center tied creatives and others and
sanz's sandisk sansa were just coming on
fire and they look so good and so
affordable and so much freedom to move
around what was then non locked media
versus Apple's locked media right well I
had that one wrong yeah I mean the iPod
never looked back it never looked back
and I was sure I told him within the yet
well they do they 18 months apples to
Germany over media players is over well
not quite even
to our credit even Steve Jobs I mean he
probably does this intentionally and
Apple's current leadership Tim Cook yeah
get things wrong I mean Steve said will
never do a phone he said will never do a
color screen on the iPod he needs it he
said a 10-inch tablet is as small as you
can go yep and we know what's we think
is gonna go I'm not gonna say that now
because I can't come back on the shown
say and glance about later right your
your your gaffe will be locked in liquid
amber forever oh here at the scene that
Museum anyway this is one of the hazards
of doing this job is you know I only
hope that in writing things that end up
being completely dumb in retrospect that
I provide a little bit of things for
people to think about maybe some
entertainment reasons not to go into the
career of tech journalism all those
things provide great thing about going
to the career tech journalism is it you
can be completely wrong and still have a
job the next day I know it's amazing as
long as you turn the page that's why
we're still here yes that's if it was a
deaf game we would be out of here we've
had a few that we're off anyway that's
it for the awards see the rest at news
calm or reporters roundtable Tina calm
put the full list up Brian anything you
want to add to my list just want to
thank you for good work relations and
yeah our paths will cross as they always
do in this case sure they will thank you
yes Rafe yes I prepared a little video
for you Oh No retrospective I hate
though I hate those words I mean have we
made a video for you and your bowel
turns to water oh I hate this okay okay
some enroll this video space a final
frontier
these are the voyages of the Starship
Enterprise
its five-year mission to explore strange
new worlds to seek out new life and new
civilizations to boldly go where no man
has gone before
Oh long and prosper thank you so much I
had to throw in a little sexiness at the
end there yeah say the nannies for the
end yeah
good advice enlightenment anyway thanks
everyone for being with me for all these
reporters roundtables and for the entire
team at scene it who has made the last
eight or nine years I've lost track just
