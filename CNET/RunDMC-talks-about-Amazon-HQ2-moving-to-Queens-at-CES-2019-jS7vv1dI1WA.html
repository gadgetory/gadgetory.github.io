Run DMC where they're about to rock the
stage that seen its annual party about
new residents in New York I currently
live in Queens and I know that's uh
that's the home of Run DMC
can you explain kind of like I know it's
a different place now can you explain
the climate of what Hollis Queens was
like when run DMC was great first be
informed lower middle class suburban
area like Street line neighborhood so we
had to walk to the Avenue to be 42nd
Street 125th Street but she had a heart
hard-working parents tight community
everybody's mother knew everybody's son
and it was it was kind of like suburbia
meets the ghetto now I don't know if you
heard but Amazon announced that they're
opening their second headquarters right
there in Queens right in Long Island
City so what do you guys have thoughts
on that like do you think it's gonna
change the climate at all of Queens like
has changed any way I mean in Brooklyn
change Queens chance definitely not like
it used to be even New York City and in
New York City it was New York City they
took away all they took away CBGB's they
took away all the LA Music Venues owned
by them coming there what's gonna happen
is they're gonna start pushing a lot of
people that live in Queens out because
now like my house for instance there was
a one family house now there's people
living on every floor yeah yeah they
sell out the basement it's so loud I'm
out of gas crazy
so so as being a tech company I wanted
to ask about the origins of hip hop and
you guys really innovated and created
kind of like the sound of what hip hop
is today with the MC stepping in the
forefront and and the the rawness of the
beats with just the drum machines can
you kind of give some examples of how
hip-hop utilized the tech that they had
access to and kind of used it and in a
way to make it their own the rolling
drum machine I mean for me listening to
the cold crush brothers it was authentic
and then when Larry Smith came along he
took it it was reinterpreting what was
going on and then as it changed a little
bit when Jay started producing we
started sampling again so it's back to
what the cold press is actually doing he
went from the DMX to be stood around the
be stood around was just a Bob James
sentence right so yeah so it it
definitely changed from the drum beats
to using samples and utilizing machines
and then now you fast forward today and
you've got crazy access to everything
you know you can make a beat on your
cell phone right now how do you feel
like the current state of music and how
how people can make it now has changed
like is it is it good for the landscape
or is it kind of polluting it well
technology has made everything easy like
we're DJ's they don't have to carry
around crates of Records so it's made it
easy but now also you got people that
could just go buy a set up and get the
jobs that the real DJ supposed to have
now not knocking anybody also but
anytime they do an event or something
like that you should always have an
authentic DJ there so the people that
love tech could see wow they took
something that was alive breathing and
physical and put it in there
and is there a piece of tech that you
guys have that you just can't stand or
just can't figure out like a new wave of
Technology and that you just don't mess
away so my brother or ruckus was just in
Bali it's a different time of day
they're calling me and I'm looking at
their face to me that's to George Jetson
stuff like what do you mean I could call
home and see my wife in bed right now on
a telephone nothing to me I can't
believe I can call Africa right now and
talk to somebody it's a lot seven six
power change Emily's home and stuff like
that you know I'm saying but what my son
you know that it's no generation they
got a half a day like you wrong if you
got a seven you know have attained
speaking of kids I'm a new dad myself
and I'm trying to navigate through this
this new climate where I can't sit still
unless they have the iPhone in front of
them bad thing is you got little kids
you got little kids what two years old
pointed and you could give it to them
and they know how to scroll which but I
mean that's a good thing but it's just
so crazy they like to say okay go find
his own thing oh you're still in diapers
no give me the phone and no starter it's
crazy
but now I think the bad thing is be
making these eggs at three or four years
Oh like have heart attacks and tempers
if they don't get their iPads and stuff
like that Russia has a robot that's like
a terminator the only thing it is that
that the home the wives are still
connected now they have a robot with
guns like does push-ups I want to shoot
and kill us so one thing that technology
people need to know and they should add
this courses I know what show to had
seen that people need to get involved in
survival still because if when it hits
the fan you're gonna have to learn how
to live in a forest hey Christine yes
yeah thanks a lot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
