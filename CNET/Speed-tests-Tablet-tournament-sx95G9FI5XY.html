the cnet lab today and welcome to our
first-ever Tournament of tablets today's
tournament will be focused on honeycomb
tablets as well as the ipad 2 now in our
previous web speed test the zoom came
out on top the ipad 2 at second so let's
leave those two waiting in the wings for
now but to start the first round we have
the acer iconia tab the tmobile g slate
and the ax sous transformer let the
match begin first up cnet com and
they're off the acer is in a lead here
the g slice right behind a tree isn't
finished the display stares at they're
all about the same there that was cnet
com so that was really close the ACA
pulled out a win by the narrowest of
margins the acer will be advancing to
the final round to take on the zoom and
the ipad 2 now we have the ipad to the
zoom and the winner of the last round
the acer iconia and first up we're going
to go to giantbomb.com fine and they're
off
see the iPads in the slightly ipad stand
assumes on and they're all done ipad
loading dye bomb the fastest now New
York Times calm fact and they're off and
running
and looks like they're all stalled out
the ipad just pulled it out now the zoom
and now the acer is third so looks like
the ipad 2 1 that one now cbsnews.com
fine okay this is a much more stressful
tests usually all three are neck and
neck looks like the zoom just one and
now the acer was second and the ipad was
last on this test so it looks like the
zoom one that one cbsnews com while
going into this tournament the zoom was
the clear favorite here but the ipad 2
was able to pull out a win and upset the
zoom by winning two out of the three
sites the zoom did win cbsnews com but
the iPad one giant bomb as well as New
York Times comm check out for results at
krave dot cnet com and so ends the
tournament
