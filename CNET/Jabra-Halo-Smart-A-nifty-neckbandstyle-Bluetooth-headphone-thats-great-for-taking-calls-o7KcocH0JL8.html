headphone to the world the Jabra hallo
smart which retails for $80 what's
special about it well since its from
Jabra you'd hoped that it would work
really well as a headset for making
calls and it does with multiple
microphones and noise reduction
technology that helps tamp down
ambient noise like wind it's also
water-resistant and has very good
battery life with up to 17 hours of
talktime and 15 hours of music playback
3 sizes of ear tips are included but I
was a little disappointed that I
couldn't get a tight seal and secure fit
with any of them I had to pull off a set
of extra-large tips from another in ear
headphone I had lying around and those
worked well you are able to get a tight
seal and the majority of people should
be able to accomplish that with the
included tips this is a decent sounding
bluetooth headphone it lacks a little
bit of clarity but I found the bass
sample and it's pretty smooth sounding
and its price point the halo Smart has
plenty of competition and while it
doesn't do much to distinguish itself
from design standpoint it seems pretty
steadily built performs very well as a
headset and offers decent sound quality
for music and get a tight seal I'm David
Carney for cnet.com thanks for watching
