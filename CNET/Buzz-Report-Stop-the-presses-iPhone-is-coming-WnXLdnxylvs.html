Wood who still has her hands full with
little jars of strained carrots welcome
to the buzz report first the gadget of
the week it's the new blackberry curve
it just hits stores a few days ago and
generated lots of buzz could this be the
perfect blackberry folks were asking
it's got a wide body but not too wide it
excuse that goofy sure type keyboard
that afflicts the Pearl it has a 2
megapixel camera noise cancellation
technology AT&amp;amp;T music service and
TeleNav live map navigation sounds
perfect except they left out the two
great cornerstones of modern smartphones
no Wi-Fi and no 3g hell even the iphone
only screws up one of those two now the
news speaking of the iPhone Apple
finally set the date for its debut jun
29th that's it no new details but the
media went nuts is that jun 29 or jun
29th or jun 29th and does that mean
midnight starting on the 28th or very
early on the 29th or at normal store
open on the 29th and will they open the
doors or fling them open and how will
this iphone be sold in an eye on the
right-hand side of the store or on the
left the scrutiny is getting nuts and we
have weeks to go and the FCC has been
hammering TV and radio lately for
obscenities that get out in broadcasts
but a federal court this week told the
FCC to cool it some obscenities are
apparently okay like when share nicole
richie and bono have dropped f-bombs on
live TV lately that was okay because
those were quote fleeting and isolated
examples and didn't describe sexual or
excretory organs or activities yeah now
they were just reading from the Betty
Crocker cookbook well when the head of
the FCC Kevin Martin heard about this
ruling he went nuts and did so in an
official press release and I quote I
fine
it hard to believe the New York Court
would tell American families that are
fine to say on broadcast television
during the hours when children are most
likely to be in the audience unquote
let's hope those kids aren't reading FCC
press releases I've and youth wireless
carrier amp'd mobile generated lots of
buzz this week when it filed for chapter
11 bankruptcy protection apparently
hoisted by its own petard it's youthful
customers their bankruptcy filing says
fifty percent of amp'd mobile users
don't pay their bill so when Verizon
came too amped and demanded a
four-and-a-half million dollar rent
payment for use of the verizon network
all lamps could do was pull out their
pockets and run to BK court some
interesting news did come out of the
filing though they said the average
amped user downloads something like 20
videos songs and or games each quarter
which may be a record for the industry
so at least we know what their customers
aren't paying for i'm brian cooper this
has been the buzz report thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
