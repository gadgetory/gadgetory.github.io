like everybody's trying to put the
future on your wrist there are tons of
smartwatches and tons of upcoming
smartwatches and the motorola moto 360
is one of the ones that was supposed to
be a shining star is a round watch
running Google's Android wear software
it's futuristic looking it looks like
it's going to bring the world on your
wrist in a way that hadn't been done
before well after having used it for a
while the verdict is that it's not
really all that much different from
other Android wear watches have you used
an Android wear watch well there are a
couple already out there there are a lot
more coming and it runs Google's own
operating system for wearables you have
to have an Android 4.3 watcher later to
run it and what it does is you can talk
to it you can get notifications on it it
will also work with compatible apps just
like the Samsung gear live or the LG G
watch and others to come the difference
here is that Motorola is the first round
one there are going to be other round
smartwatches but this one has a very
elegant design Motorola took great care
to put a leather band on here there's
also going to be a stainless steel one
coming soon and the steel face feels
very clean and minimal but you know even
the gorilla glass screen shows that the
LCD watch face underneath and the screen
in general is a little less vivid than
maybe you were expecting there's also a
black bar underneath because of a light
sensor so it's not even fully round and
the battery life well it's about as good
as the battery life on other Android
wear watches which is about two days at
best so you're dealing with something
that's not super long battery life
although it does come with a very neat
inductive charging system so you can pop
this moto 360 right into your bedside
cradle and boom it becomes a bedside
clock that's great but keep in mind if
you're going to put that into a bag or
you want to put it into an airline seat
pocket that's not really going to stick
on my fallout so the Moto 360 is the
best looking Android wear watch but it's
no different than other ones it can't
make phone calls it's not fully
interactive with all of its
notifications and it can get kind of
confusing with all the weird ones that
pop up I would have wanted this to be
even better this is the best of the
bunch after only three but the Moto 360
is definitely grounded from that high
flying future
standpoint that we hoped for in the past
my favorite SmartWatch is the pebble
steel it's nice-looking it works with
iOS and Android and it looks good in
broad daylight has a long battery life
and notifications are easy to read it
doesn't have a touchscreen it's not all
that exciting underneath but it works
now the Moto 360 has a touch screen you
can talk to it it has a heart rate
monitor but it's hard to tell what
you're really judging other than heart
rate and the battery life is shorter so
maybe I like the design but doesn't feel
as all day and everyday useful of
something like this which would you pick
hmmm maybe you like the design here I
still prefer this a bit i'm scott stein

wrist</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
