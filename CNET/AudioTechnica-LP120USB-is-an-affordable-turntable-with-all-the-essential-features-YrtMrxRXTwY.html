first look at the audio technica at2020
chances are if you go into your local
record store they'll probably have a
bunch of these for sale and maybe even
one set up to listen to records and
that's because this is definitely a
worthwhile turntable for the price it's
modeled after the classic techniques
1200 s and if you're familiar with that
model you'll recognize the similarities
there's a few differences mostly in the
plastic construction of these parts but
that's what really keeps the price down
here the manufacturer doesn't cut
corners where it counts though it sits
on four stabilized feet and at twenty
three and a half pounds you won't have
to worry about vibrations messing up the
sound of your records just be sure to
keep it on a level surface and you'll be
fine this is a direct drive motor
turntable so there's no belts to mess
around with and its overall simplicity
really is the benefit of this system
when you take it out of the box all you
have to do is screw in the cartridge
that comes with a stylus pre-installed
calibrate the counterweight and
anti-skate on the back of the tonearm
and it's ready to play records if this
is your first time building a turntable
it's important to balance the tonearm
correctly and the manual does a great
job at explaining how to do it along
with the recommended vertical tracking
force for the cartridge now all that
sounds more complicated and then
actually is and the company even
uploaded a video online that lays it all
out a lot of modern turntables these
days sacrifice features for simplicity
or aesthetics but this isn't one of them
it's a full-featured turntable which
means you get to play 33 and 45 rpm
records and you can even play it 78 if
you pick up a compatible stylus you get
a target light to locate grooves and
dark places there's also a 45 adapter
included in the box and there's a pitch
lock and slider to control adjustments
you can even reverse the direction of
the rotation if you want you'll find a
pair of RCA plugs hardwired into the
back and while I wish they were
removable for long-term durability the
company makes up for it with a bunch of
adapters included that let you connect
the 122 powered speakers a receiver or
auxiliary inputs it's also important to
note that this guy has an amp already
built into it so you can just plug it
into a pair of speakers and be set or
you can flip a switch and by
to use your own setup you'll also notice
a USB port on the back that's used to
digitize your record collection for
music that you own but can't necessarily
find online there's a lot more to talk
about but it's easy to recommend this
for anyone shopping for a new turntable
Audio Technica hits all the important
markers that djs and casual listeners
will want in a record player for a
budget-friendly price tag be sure to
check out my full review on CNET but
that's going to do it for this video I'm
Justin you you just took a first look at
the audio technica LP 120 USB turntable
