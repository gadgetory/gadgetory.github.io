I'm Tom Merritt this is the show where
we give you the hot news movie releases
premieres in the world of geek
entertainment let's get started with
movies out this week is nims island an
adventure fantasy film based on the book
by windy or and starring Jodie Foster
abigail breslin and gerard butler it's
another child's imagination becomes real
or does it storyline but it looks like
it might be kind of cool and they're not
a sound cool too because the score is
being done by Patrick Doyle you might
remember him from scoring Harry Potter
goblet of fire or Henry the fifth of
course a new movie trailer appeared
online March 19th for Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are undead yes it's a
sequel of sorts to the Tom Stoppard play
but with vampires poor Julian Marsh
directs an off Broadway adaptation of
Hamlet that turns out to be written by a
vampire starring vampires and the
vampires are sexy can't beat that and
the Holy Grail is involved too what more
could you want IMDb says it's in
post-production but has no release date
yeah that to me suggests an Internet
campaign to build some buzz yeah
vampires are probably holding it back
too mm-hmm moving on to television did
we make it clear that Battlestar
Galactica is back this week last week I
really hope that we didn't gloss that
over last week in case you're the sort
of demented Philistine that it tends to
jump right into the show without
watching seasons 1 2 &amp;amp; 3 sci-fi has put
together a pretty funny little recap on
their shows web page kind of like that
lost in 815 recap that was going around
before lost return but Roslin wants good
boomer to lead them to the tomb of
Athena another TV news Hollywood
Reporter says the actor who plays
lieutenant Agathon aka hot helo on
Battlestar will join Eliza Dushku in
dollhouse a new show from Buffy and
Firefly creator jossa Whedon dollhouse
tells the story of several young male
and female dolls who have basically been
imprinted with different personalities
for various secret agent e-type
assignments helo whose real name is
mo penikett will play an FBI agent and
kind of a twisted romantic foil for
Eliza Dushku's character named echo Fox
green-lighted the show in november two
thousand seven for seven episodes but
then the writers strike got in the way
supposedly though josh's outlines are so
complete that they might speed up
production fingers crossed let's do a
little DVD news now in DVD release April
first the Tim Burton flick Sweeney Todd
the Demon Barber of Fleet Street and PR
kind of geeked out on this movie a few
weeks back with a pretty interesting
story about color correction in the
movies basically every movie these days
is photoshopped using what's called all
digital post-production color correction
so these guys at a company called
company three worked on Sweeney Todd and
lots of other movies they actually color
treated every single scene in the movie
306 madness how tedious you could kind
of tell yeah apparently Tim Burton was
originally opposed to digital color
correction but then went kind of crazy
for it not surprisingly he was really
into having everyone look extremely pale
shocking and then he wanted the blood in
the movie to look super scary red it's a
little messed up you'd think he would
have embraced that right out of the gate
mmhmm yeah finally a little news from
the world of books if you like me are a
fan of his dark materials trilogy by
Philip Pullman head on over and
pre-order your copy of Once Upon a Time
in the north it's coming out april
eighth and is a prequel to the trilogy
that tells the story of how Lee Scoresby
got to know York Barisan plus sounds
like kind of a shoot-'em-up Western on
an alternate earth of course also we
just got word that Neal Stephenson
author of Snow Crash cryptonomicon the
baroque cycle and of course in the
beginning was the command line as a new
book coming out in September called
Anathem about some monk types who will
be called upon to save the rest of the
idiot world from their infighting boom
and bust economy in idiotic selves or
something like that it should be awesome
though as most Stevenson books are big
fan big fan can't wait that'll do it for
geek pop thanks for stopping by we'll
see you next week
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
