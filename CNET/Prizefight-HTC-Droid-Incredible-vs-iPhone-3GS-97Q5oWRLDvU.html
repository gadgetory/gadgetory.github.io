Tong and this is a special people Choice
prize fight the droid incredible is out
and you the cnet readers and viewers
pick the Challenger it's a prize fight
push out between the HTC droid
incredible and the apple iphone 3gs our
judges for this fight our senior editor
Bonnie boom boom cha associate editor
Nicole ice-cold Lee and myself will do
the honors we'll take all three judges
scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth each round the final prize
fight score will be an average of all
rounds using the same decimal system
which phone pushes your buttons so right
because it turns you on round one is
sexiness the droid incredible has a
sleek and slender profile is display is
crystal clear it's rubberized surface
can take a beating but what's up with
its backside bonnie likes the
topographic design but I don't and all
they had to do is just smooth it out now
the iphone 3gs is still as minimalist as
it gets and its curvaceous booty still
gets me I know I need some help but it's
curved corners and clean lines can get a
little old and to see that staff wants
something new but it's still a sexy
beast this rounds at I and both phones
get a 4.3 next round is controls and
user interface the incredibles HTC Sense
UI is the best looking phone OS to date
and it's a snappy device say goodbye to
track balls and welcome the optical
joystick I found it easy to use but the
colon Bonnie didn't like it as much the
touch buttons were pretty responsive
multi-touch is here and unique settings
like different scenes for using your
phone and quick access to any panel
without having to scroll through every
page is slick there will be a small
learning curve that's easy for geeks but
not for my mom we can't say it any more
than we already have but the iphone is
the easiest mobile OS to use power users
might mock it and want something more
but navigating the menus and
applications are a breeze multi-touch
runs smoothly across all apps and we
know new features are on the way but
it's still just as easy as it was from
day one
3gs gets a perfect five and a droid
incredible jets of four so after
averaging two rounds the 3gs leads by
half a point and the incredible has some
work to do if it wants to live up to its
name next round is features both bones
have the core features like 3g Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and GPS but this is where the
incredible shines it still has the best
voice search and commands pigs feet
turn-by-turn directions a multitasking
pulldown voice to text integration hey
you want to workout and customization
with widgets and themes are unmatched
the only thing we're still waiting for
is hands-free calling now the iphone 3gs
is still running the iphone OS 3.0 voice
commands are here but they're not even
on the same level call arielle and
there's no voice search or text
integration we still have to purchase a
turn by turn GPS solution and
multitasking is limited to listening to
music while using another app and
customization goes as far as arranging
your app icons the iphone has all the
core features but the incredible kicks
it up a notch and it gets the perfect
five and the 3gs gets up for next round
is web browsing to multimedia the
incredibles web browser finally brings a
smooth-running multi-touch it's multiple
windows take a cue from coverflow and
it's bookmark previews have put it on
the level with Safari flashlight is here
but I didn't find any sites that worked
well with it HTC's Sense UI has done
wonders with the media player interface
that I actually enjoyed videos look
great with its high res display
doubletwist syncs your media and then
you just throw in an 8 megapixel dual
flash LED camera with video capture this
is incredible indeed now the iphone has
been the standard for entertainment and
multimedia on a mobile phone it's media
player is still one of the best movies
look great but it's iTunes integration
whether you love it or hate it is what
brings it all together podcast support
is extensive and a match its web browser
is still a top notch mobile experience
its multi-touch and zoom and accuracy
plus it's cut copy and paste is better
executed and it has a 3 megapixel camera
without a flash that's dated but
serviceable but the incredible
has finally stepped up its game for all
android phones and this round is a tie
at four point three apiece so after
averaging four rounds we are tied at 4.4
going into the final round which phone
has enough gas left in the tank the
final round that decides it all is
called quality and performance the joint
incredible is fast Bonnie feels it's the
fastest phone she's ever used it snappy
across the board and I had no issues
with lag then you talk about its call
quality on verizon's network that was
clear on both sides of the line and no
one experienced a drop call the iphone
3gs is a great performing phone that's
snappy in its own right but the
incredible showed off how fast the next
butta phones are compared to the 3gs
call quality wise AT&amp;amp;T network is hit or
miss depending on where you live there
are times where the call quality was
warmer than the incredible but I
experienced a few hiccups and then you
guessed it we all had the same issues
connecting calls or those lovely drops
so after entering the final round tied
the droid incredible takes this round
five to three point seven so let's
average out all five rounds and in our
first People's Choice prize fight the
HTC droid incredible comes out
victorious 4.5 to 4.3 and is your
people's champ we all know Apple's
newest contender is just around the
corner but take nothing away from the
incredible this is the best phone that
we've seen in this prize fight ring i'm

catch you guys next time on another
prize fight
