yes oh you're a good boy oh yes you are
after launching in Japan Sony's new
adorable robot puppy AIBO is strutting
his way to the US it's ready to learn
tricks take videos and photos play with
toys and just be a sweet little
companion Sony unveiled the first litter
edition for the u.s. at a press event at
its New York City headquarters you'll be
able to get it in time for the holidays
it goes on sale in September but it'll
cost you about two thousand nine hundred
dollars yeah the cuteness doesn't come
cheap but this is so not your average
toy AIBO is the future of robotics this
pup is packed with deep learning
artificial intelligence and sensors
detecting your facial expressions and
voice commands it's constantly learning
through your interactions a camera in
its nose will sniff out its owner but it
can make a lot of friends in fact it can
recognize up to 100 faces it also knows
the difference between a child and an
adult other pets and objects I will pick
up on your personality have you had a
hard day at the office
Ivo knows to be docile and don't bother
you if you've had a great day cheerful
and you come home this is what happens
you know it's dancing and jumping around
and just trying to give you love I bow
has a bunch of tricks that learns
through the my I bow app it will obey
your voice commands depending on how
well he is trained there's the typical
puppy stuff like beg and shake hands I
bow can play fetch by kicking a ball he
just may need a little time to get his
paws lined up properly but my personal
favorite was getting him to play dead
bang bang
oh he's playing dead now it's a very
dramatic oh you have to train i buh-bye
saying things like good boy or bad job
and give it some love with a scratch so
there's three places you can pet I bow
right under the chin oh yes and right on
top of the head and in the back he was a
good boy
but I bow can also be a girl you can set
that up in the app along with
customizing the dog's eye color and
voice it will also let owners take
photos and video from the dogs point of
view Sony is working on having AIBO
become a watchdog sort of like a home
camera on wheels where you can remote
control it from afar and see a video
feed from the app the back camera near
his tail is mapping your environment so
it's learning your home
that means it's possible to teach I bow
where the kitchen is and just tell it to
go there with a voice command but I bow
doesn't have to stay at home it comes
with AT&amp;amp;T wireless service so he'll stay
connected wherever you go this pup
really comes to life with its nuanced
body language the body has 22 points of
movement and the OLED eyes showed
different expressions with two hours of
battery life I bewilder turn to its
charging station when it runs out of
juice the AIBO robot first came out in
1999 but was reintroduced to the world
with this vastly advanced model since
the relaunch in january sony sold more
than twenty thousand of these new eye
bows in japan the US version includes
accessories and a three year plan to
keep it connected to the cloud sony says
updates over the years will keep AIBO
growing it's a pricey pup at $2,900 but
Sony executives say they've seen a lot
of interest in I bow as a companion for
the elderly when you think of it as
something to bring joy to someone who is
lonely the investment doesn't seem so
rough you're such a good boy
yes you are i bow is one cute puppy oh
yes it was to do tricks to Oh see he
performs on camera this is great</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
