taking a look at Lenovo IdeaPad y 480
now this is one of the very first
handful of laptops we've seen with
Intel's new 3rd generation Core iSeries
processors in it you may have heard us
talk about Ivy Bridge well that's what
that is in addition to that it's also
got one of the new Nvidia discrete GPU
it's the geforce 640 m so when you put
all that together it's kind of like
you've got a big 17 inch desktop
replacement or the power but crammed
into a very modestly sized 14-inch
mid-sized laptop now let's both good and
bad 1 you've got a lot more power than
you'd expect from a 14 inch laptop but
of course you're not gonna get the same
battery life this system actually got
really good battery life for a new Ivy
Bridge quad core Core i7 laptop but for
a 14 inch laptop it didn't do that
fantastic the other big problem we had
was with the NVIDIA GPU and the quad
core Core i7 processor you'd want to
play games on this thing but the screen
is has only a 1366 by 768 resolution
that's fine for less expensive midsize
laptops but this thing is a little bit
more than $1000 we'd obviously expect a
better screen resolution at that price
and if you can't crank the games up past
that having all this high-end hardware
is not gonna do anything for you now
that said the idea pants in general are
a great way to get kind of that Lenovo
quality design and build and the
excellent keyboard they have with little
keys that kind of curve out a little bit
at the bottom and all that other great
little stuff in something that doesn't
look like I think pad like that business
laptop and I like that they moved to the
bigger click pad style touch pad here
where the buttons are integrated right
in if you're looking for something like
a midsize gaming laptop you'd want
something with a higher screen
resolution and if you just like the idea
of this idea pad Y series I don't for
some more configuration options maybe
the ability to knock down the hardware a
little bit to get longer battery life
and a lower price I'm Dan Ackerman and
that is the Lenovo IdeaPad wallet 480</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
