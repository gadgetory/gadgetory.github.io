that's cultivated a loyal following
thanks to its high performing but super
cheap handsets just launched its third
flagship the one plus three now I'm
usually pretty skeptical of anything
that Garner's so much hype from its fan
base but I have to say that the
company's newest marquee device has won
me over
first one plus got rid of it's
invite-only system which it used to sell
its previous flagship s-- though the
strategy help build publicity it was
also kind of annoying and it frustrated
a lot of people who just wanted to get
their hands on the device this time
around however the phone is open to the
masses second it's got a new look true
the design isn't anything novel in fact
it kind of reminds me a lot of the HTC
10 but it's aluminum unibody
construction and subtly chamfer details
give it a premium look that we hadn't
really expect from oneplus my third
favorite thing about the phone and if
you've been following oneplus and you
probably know what I'm about to say is
how cheap it is given its specs this
device has all the hardware it needs to
stay competitive with other
top-of-the-line devices it's got the
Snapdragon 820 processor a 16 megapixel
camera and a crisp 5.5 inch display oh
and the phone has - charging which is a
charging technology trademarked by 1
plus basically it means that the
handsets 3 ampere hour battery charges
superfast and it doesn't heat up as much
like others do in our testing it got up
to 65% in 30 minutes and if full charge
took about an hour and 15 it's got all
that plus it costs $399 unlocked
compared to other flagships like the
google nexus 6p and samsung galaxy s7
that's about a hundred to two hundred
dollars less so yeah it's cheap and yes
it performs fast and reliably for device
has been so hyped up I have to say it
doesn't disappoint</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
