Mollywood and this is the buzz report
first the gadget of the week the gadget
of the week it's the corporate kitchen
remember these used to be a place where
you'd find some tap water a Dixie cup of
plastic fork and maybe someones leftover
ketchup pack look at the water the in a
way of uvf it's got an ultraviolet lamp
cold water hot water is 190 that's
hotter than the coolant in your engine
by the way and then you can get extra
hot by pressing both buttons did these
guys not talk to the lawyers at
McDonald's and learn a couple lessons
and what about that American icon the
coffeepot look what happened to it it's
this big ugly faux wood grain thing
although it kind of reminds me of the
last infinity we reviewed it's got this
touch panel deal here with a nice tote
background green LCD and a strangely
incongruous antique clock but what I
don't understand is what's going on
inside there it's too big to make coffee
there's a lock on this side that's not
for the beans because they live up here
and the water comes through a pipe in
the wall so who put this here the CIA
and check this out we have a microwave
and we have popcorn but no microwave
popcorn the folks here decided it was a
fire hazard so now we have to use this
thing like it's not it's a hot air torch
that blows straight up this may look
like a snack but I'm telling you it's
not it's actually an employee aerobic
program masquerading as a midday treat
now the news let's go to the dumb idea
file to start the show huh that wasn't
too hard a new service called same lane
allows you to call someone's license
plate number and chat with them on the
phone the company says it would be used
by people who want to share a good joke
or talk sports for example Yeah right
it's a singles bar on wheels you
register with same Lane you add your
license plate number to their database
link your phone number to the license
plate and then put a sticker on your car
that says hey everybody I'm up for being
hassled folks who want to do that call a
900 number
enter your license plate number and are
connected to your phone now caller ID is
blocked in both directions so that's the
good news the bad news is their
materials say same Lane quote is putting
adventure back into driving yeah in a
way don't go too much into that
adventure because when you call via same
Lane you're paying a dollar ninety-nine
a minute to talk about a ball game or
share a joke with a complete stranger
and we hear this week that Wikipedia may
soon start verifying the credentials of
contributors to that trusted online
encyclopedia to make sure they are who
they say they are so if you go to them
and say I'm a tenured professor of
theology and I'd like to edit entries on
religion they're gonna snoop around a
little bit and verify you have at least
a nodding education along those lines if
it turns out you're actually let's say a
24 year old college dropout who is just
gonna crib Catholicism for dummies to
write your entries you're not gonna get
in again yeah that's exactly what
happened frankly this problem seems
overblown to me I use Wikipedia all the
time even today in writing up this buzz
report and nothing about it raised any
red flags for me and the US government
just announced a voucher plan it'll help
consumers pay for the converter box
they'll need to let their old tired
analog TV work with the all new digital
broadcasts that begin in February 09
each household will be able to apply for
up to two of these $40 vouchers but get
this there's no upper income limit so
millionaires can apply there's no
process in place to see if the $40
voucher is actually more than you need
to buy a converter and there's no rule
against re selling that converter for a
profit on ebay I'm telling you this
feels like an 890 million dollar Kluge
we're about to deploy across the country
with tax money and finally a correction
last week I reported on a BMW lane
departure warning system that vibrates
your seat when you drift out of the lane
to simulate lane divider dots but in
fact we learned it doesn't vibrate your
seat at all it vibrates the steering
wheel this is disappointing to me
because not only does that not the story
out of my beloved cocktail party banter
cat
gori but I can guarantee you a number of
folks who drive 08 BMWs are gonna bring
them into the shop saying something's
loose in the front end and worse a fair
number of dealer mechanics are going to
spend hours trying to find the problem
trust me on this one at least if your
butt was vibrating you wouldn't bother
your BMW dealer with the issue I'm Brian
cooling this has been the buzz report
