been hard at work but on the latest
release of OS 10 our tenth release in
the history of OS 10 and this one is a
doozy we really focused on three major
areas in OS 10 some core technologies to
fundamentally accelerate the performance
of your Mac some features that smooth
the Mac experience and some great new
apps right let's take a look here at
Mavericks and of course the Mac has no
equal when it comes to a tool for
getting projects done I'm going to work
on a project right here and open up
pages and open up a document for a
mission to Mars and what's really great
now in Mavericks is that also have
access right here on my Mac to iBooks so
I have my book library here I can open
one of my books this is a textbook on
Mars of course you see these beautiful
interactive textbooks I can just use
multi-touch gestures to move between the
pages of a chapter just like this of
course there are these great
Interactive's there's a video here I can
play
it's really really nice it's a great way
to learn but it's also a great way to
work it's much easier to organize my
content as well with tags so you see
here I have the contents My Documents
folder it's a lot in here but I've been
able to categorize them by topic with
tags so if I want to see on my content
related to Mars I can just access it
right here so I'll drag an image out
that I want to add to my document just
like this that looks pretty good and
tagging your own documents really easy
as well I can just click here on the
title bar and add a tag so you can say I
can select from any tags I've already
created like Mars and I can also tag a
single document with multiple tags so
this one also has to do a school I'll
tag it just like that and you'll notice
it appears here under Mars as well as
under school now Mavericks is also
really great for keeping track of what's
going on even when I'm working so for
instance if a notification comes in like
this let's see Oh yep I can actually
respond right here to my wife let's see
okay well let's see
Phil is my fashion guru so you can just
respond right there really convenient
now we support a new kind of
notifications in Mavericks as well which
is website notifications if I've signed
up for a particular site I can see a
notification like this here we see Major
League Baseball sent me a notification
zoom back out here you can see I get a
story right here can read it like this I
have another notification from a website
this one for an item I'm following on
gilt get a notification that's available
that looks really like just what I need
I can buy it right now and what's great
is with iCloud keychain and Mavericks my
passwords are synced across all my
devices so I can log right in without
having to remember or type my password
while we're here in Safari let's take a
look at our great new top sites view and
on the Left here you see shared links so
I can click to view an article here's a
nice one about Apple's new campus
for one look forward to working in outer
space so I can just your back right to
my list and do searches so for instance
I can search for story shared that have
Mars in it I can click in like this and
we have a great new reader view as well
looks really nice and as I scroll
through the articles with safaris
accelerated scrolling I can go right
from the end of one article right into
the next just continuously it's really
just a fantastic way to read as you can
imagine this is about a good time for
another notification here's one right
here for my friend Nina who's just in
town and she wants to apparently meet at
Coit Tower
now with data detectors I can actually
just click on this and get a view right
of the time and appointment but what's
great is when I go into our great new
calendar app you notice it's also
extracted the location it's even shown
me a map of that location and the
weather expected for that time and
because calendar is completely location
aware it also knows where my previous
appointment is and it can actually let
me know how long it'll take to travel
from one spot to the other I can drive
or walk and it looks like it's gonna be
a nice day so I'll go ahead and walk you
notice it marks out the travel time
right here on my calendar and I can ask
to be alerted on my phone and computer
when I need to leave now I'm just gonna
click right into this map be taken into
our great Maps app so of course we have
multi-touch gestures we see quite tower
here I can zoom I can pan the map around
like this and we have a satellite view
with of course flyover and it just looks
gorgeous looking into the city here you
can see the route that I can travel up
to Coit Tower and when I'm ready to go I
can just go right up here to the share
menu and send it to my iPhone where it
appears in my lock screen I can swipe
right in to turn-by-turn directions for
my route so that's a quick demo of
Mavericks
so that's maverick it's a fantastic
release that extends your battery life
gets more out of your memory accelerates
your graphics has great features across
the system and some really fun new apps
but you know for those of us that work
on Mavericks what's most important to us
is seeing the software in the hands of
as many Mac users as possible we want to
get them all the latest technologies the
most innovative features and the kind of
robust security that's only possible
through deep infrastructural
enhancements and so in the last for the
last several years we've been on a
mission we've re-engineered our
development process so we can put out
regular major releases that renew your
Mac all the time and we've reinvented
reinvented the way we distribute OS 10
so now upgrading your OS is as easy as
downloading an app from the Mac App
Store but today we're going to
revolutionize pricing because the days
of spending hundreds of dollars to get
the most out of your computer are gone
today we announce a new era for the Mac
because today we're announcing that
Mavericks is free
three is good
so we're doing free and not a small way
whether you have our latest release
mountain lion or even if you never
upgraded you're still running lion or if
you're a complete laggard and you're
still back on Snow Leopard in a single
step update you can get to Mavericks and
we wanted this to run on as many Macs as
possible
so whether you have a Mac Mini
introduced in 2009 or even an iMac
introduced way back in 2007 you're
entitled to Mavericks and again it's
available for free and the best part
it's available today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
