to the all new Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and we asked you what do you think of
the new look of the show well Benjamin
bachelor said I love the new Apple bite
I'm a big fan of modern looks so are we
my car says the intro reminds me of us
Saved by the Bell episode it's alright
and Sergio Artie says by the way your
hair needs an update
yeah but surprise we can change the
intro colors to whatever we want
whenever we want
rose gold baby and your color
suggestions are welcome alright let's
get to the show in this week it's
everything we can expect to see at WWDC
2016 but do not expect the new MacBook
Pros
why would I say this that's because
CNET's own Mac and laptop editor Dan
Ackerman goes to all these events when
there's new hardware but he wasn't
invited this time and that's the
strongest indicator that this year will
be all about software and not hardware
think iOS OS 10 watch OS iTunes Apple
music and whatever else they give us but
maybe there's some hope after a Mac o -
car report says there's a chance that a
new MacBook Air with USB C may still be
unveiled this month and begin shipping
in June but that's just an update not
new hardware also multiple outlets have
been reporting that it will be a no
Hardware event and for those of you
saying it's a dev conference software
only duh well guess what Apple has
unveiled the MacBook Pro Retina updated
MacBook Airs and the Mac Pro desktop at
previous WWDC s duh so I'm not gonna get
too amped up about WWDC maybe Apple
changes my mind don't get me wrong I
love software improvements that can help
how we actually use our gadgets but are
you really going to get something
significant that we haven't seen yet
Apple needs to move the needle and more
than anything bring us something we're
talking about because the perception is
that they haven't had a hit in a long
time and we know perception is reality
alright sticking with software we've
talked about it before but iTunes and
Apple music appeared to be getting the
biggest overhaul and we expect to hear
about it at the conference digital music
news reports the revamp will simplify
the core function of the app for music
and clean up the relationship
between Apple music and the iTunes Music
Store 905 Mac reported earlier that the
iOS 10 music app will move to a more
black-and-white look allowing the album
artwork to be more of the focus mark
gurmann also reports the new iTunes for
Mac app will be shown off at the keynote
and will launch in the fall with OS 10
10.12 and will coincide with a
redesigned Apple music now iOS will be
getting new tweaks as well but the new
darker look to the WWDC app and the
Apple TV app has sparked speculation
that there could possibly be a dark mode
setting that's part of iOS 10 concept
images from I help VR help bring this to
life with examples of what it might look
like with the messaging app even what
the options form using 3d touch might
look like or using the split screen mode
for multiple apps on something like the
iPad now a dark mode sounds cool but
let's make it even cooler and call it
the dark night mode wait what did he
just saying plus we could finally get
the ability to remove stock apps like
Game Center and feedback in all that
other crap we never use and let's not
forget about emojis the Unicode
consortium recently approved 72 new
emojis that will be available June 21st
and you know iOS 10 has to bring them
into the mix including one of the
greatest gifts to mankind the bacon
emoji that's right the bacon emoji is
coming to iOS 10 now there's plenty
other things like new sea creatures but
I personally appreciate the addition of
the fortune cookie chopsticks and the
takeout box because this whole time I
didn't know what to do with myself and I
was really missing the chopsticks emoji
I now feel complete plus Apple pay may
also finally grow up and bring
person-to-person payments it's a welcome
addition but what's the incentive when
venmo is on every platform and everyone
is already using it we've also heard
plenty chatter about Siri coming to OS
10 and yes the name changed to Mac OS is
really a no-brainer but what we really
need to see is the next generation of
Siri it's already behind compared to
what everyone else is doing out there
from Google to Microsoft and we've shown
you viv a few weeks ago if it can
leverage some of its acquisitions like
vocal IQ last
to be context-aware with the ability to
process multi-layered queries then maybe
it will actually be a tool I trust and
enjoy using with AI assistants really
becoming the thing in tech right now
Apple needs to make a splash with this
and we might see a sneak peek at watch
OS there hasn't been much chatter about
it or they might wait until the next
Apple watch announcement but let's just
hope if they give us anything it's more
than just some new watch faces so there
you have it
all the things we expect to see at WWDC
maybe they surprised us but don't look
for Hardware this year it's all software
but at the same time it could be setting
up some monster product announcements in
the second half this year plus before we
go summer is here and you want to look
your freshest I know you do
so we're doing a killer giveaway from my
friends at speck products with their new
line of their candy shelling cases with
all new designs like this cactus pattern
pineapples which make everyone happy
when you eat them and this super cool
tropical pattern that really gets the
ladies attention all right oh and let me
show you how this is done okay okay okay
watch me hey Lexi what's up um I got you
something so all you have to do is tell

everything on their site using the promo
