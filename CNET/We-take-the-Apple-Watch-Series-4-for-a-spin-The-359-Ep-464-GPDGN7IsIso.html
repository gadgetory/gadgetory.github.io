with me is special guests and show
favorite Scott Stein hi Scott you've had
the Apple watch series for now for about
week yep so what are your impressions
what do you think well I think that if
you were looking for a larger watch and
a little bit of a design change that's
really nice I think that the possibility
is a possibility because I have not we
have not seen the ECG feature activated
but Apple has an electrocardiogram heart
rate technology on this
that's FDA cleared that's a that's a
first in any sort of a wearable in that
category so but what that's for we don't
really know in terms of like its it's
for you and your doctor and it's for
looking at it's looking for a rhythm
yeah so basically you know that that's
TBD the rest of the watches is a nice
upgrade I don't think a lot of the
features are really all that different
in everyday use including battery life
so the big question I have a series
three for folks who have the older
generation watches is it worth an
upgrade I don't think so and I think a
lot of people are really I'm really
excited about the size and the size of
those things when you look back the
series 3 now seems bulkier you know
classic looks worse in the rear view
mirror the new version is more of a
subtle but overdue upgrade the watch
faces there aren't that many new watch
faces there are a couple that are great
but complications not all of them hook
in yet and I know you're always you know
talking with the app the watch face
store yeah that's a cool watch play
store is still not here yet no there's
two things I really needed an Apple
watch one is a watch face store so you
cannot download any other watch faces
other than the immediately bit 25 which
is a lot that Apple includes that are
customizable but if you want to look for
anything new and different there isn't
anything else there were only two unique
ones to the Apple watch series for now
the other thing is battery life it's
about a day and a half right now and
there are other watches that are
striving for more battery life and that
equation has not changed so watch for a
story battery life and isn't that day
and a half that's pretty comparable to
last year's no the series 3 right yeah
it's very much the same I and and and
that means a solid day on a charge plus
but if you're looking for a multi-day I
mean Qualcomm is trying to work towards
that on its chips to get to you know
more basic functions over multiple days
fitness trackers can last a wee
longer I think for for health if you
want to put this on someone's wrist this
has now fall detection that we never was
test I was so is that available yet that
is available now so like how have have
you tried like falling to test it or no
I've not tried falling yet I'm going to
try falling we're trying to set up a
condition where I don't kill myself but
you know just like a real fall and it's
off by default you have to turn it on
hmm and it's the idea is that if you
fall and you stay down it will send an
SOS automatically like the same way if
you press and hold yes like help me a
phone I can't get up medical devices
right now Apple doesn't claim even in
the settings that it will detect all
falls and that's the thing if you're
looking for a hundred percent accuracy
in detection there's no claim there is
it better than not having that sure by
you know that that's a question as far
as I could you put it on and would you
trust yeah I wouldn't use it as a
replacement for watching somebody who
might be falling but it might be an
extra failsafe it's certainly are nice
direction to go into I mean they
upgraded the accelerometer the gyroscope
and the heart rate the question is what
other features will unlock down the road
for that right now it seems like a lot
of the basic functions including basic
fitness are all pretty much the same as
on series three there's extra battery
life if you're on runs but by about an
hour we're still testing that but it's
not a great leap there other dedicated
Fitness Watchers do a lot better for
that for GPS and what about running this
on just the LTE radio lonely because the
battery is still terrible or yeah
battery life drains quickly on that I
mean I think you're not gonna get a full
day if you put on LTE the reception is
improved and that they they replace the
the back made it all ceramic so that's
nice and so far it does seem like
receptions better and and do things do
seem generally faster you know already I
think it was perfectly fast on the s3 it
bridged that but now it's things are
loading ridiculously quickly to the
point where we used to complain about
that on the Apple watch and it is nice
to see that that now runs at iPhone
speed I feel with loading apps
oh there you have it for more on the
Apple watch coverage check us on CNET
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Scott Stein thanks
for listening
and thanks everybody for sticking with
us and be impatient when we're running
behind Scott is a very busy man but we
appreciate him being here now that being
said Scott still let's test this fall
damage shall we if you do it first time
ever yeah let's do it you do it on live
video that's the best time let's do it
let's do it this is the first time I've
done fault has I do it well I don't know
that was a joke I was gonna pretend to
come push you oh my god no I'm actually
gonna do it I think he's gonna do it
right do it now I got to make sure I've
got it on cellular I don't curious about
that would you would you be willing to
buy this for like you know a parent an
aging parent or an aging relative that
you know I guess would be prone to these
kinds of accidents possibly but the
thing is and between that like
walkie-talkie and ways you keep in touch
it's not easy to set up an Apple watch
so you'd have to set it up for them and
I don't know I feel like not Apple like
at all right the whole point is these
things are supposed to be easy to set up
oh yeah no no it's a it's a it's a
somewhat complicated process you mean
there is a way to instantly aim it and
pair it with your watch but then there's
like a whole loading process that takes
a while
it's faster than it used to be but here
emergency SOS so I don't know I would I
would I would talk to my doctor or nurse
for the person I was caring for yeah and
I would say what do you recommend that's
the same thing with ECG it's basically
like I would talk to my doctor and say
well do you think that would be good for
me like in a way has been a reviewer ECG
thing really I questioned the actual
purpose for you and on everyday basis
like I get that data is important for a
doctor to have but like yeah are you and
me taking a CGS of yourself like every
day no what's the point right ECG what
is a is a if you've never done it and
I've seen it
demoed on the Apple watch but it's not
available yet you take a 30 second
sample yeah stationary so this is not
like when you're out and about right and
then that is a more accurate sensor for
things like
heart rate rhythm irregularities it's
still not a replacement it cannot detect
according Apple it's not it will not
detect heart attack so it's like a three
lead ECG versus a one lead used doctors
have even more leads for ECG so real
doctors office ECG is more advanced than
this but it's a step we looked at one
last year kardia band that was an
accessory that does this um another
another solid step but yeah who would
use that basically someone who's
concerned that their heart rate right
might be a little weird and you might be
testing it but I mean I like the fact
that Apple is kind of normalized because
there are a number of people out there
with conditions it's really not that
dissimilar in my mind from somebody who
maybe has diabetes and has to have a
pump or an insulin I mean if there is
something that could be very seamless
and casual to just keep on your person
that will help you maintain your health
when you have very specific requirements
like that I mean I applaud that yeah
yeah as long as it works well is a huge
step to be FDA cleared and I think that
that was it was a surprising moment
because a lot of companies have been
dancing around it trying to get to that
point and Apple got there first compared
to competitors and so I think that
that's great it's not not cleared for
all functions that's for things like
certain things with heart rate so yeah
but you're right like it's like it's a
great move but it may not be something
that I think an everyday person is
really going to use yep so like it's an
applaud the effort in TBD right but I
would be hesitant to say go out and buy
the Apple watch series for for it
because also I don't even know how it
works yet we don't know how that ECG
works we have any movie but we have not
tested it but here I'm gonna try falling
okay how are you gonna do this I'm gonna
fall wait I'll detection I don't know
all right chair go ahead it's not gonna
work this is like not a real fall so
like what am I gonna do I'm just gonna
slowly fall okay all right camera angles
there here we go oh that sounded like it
hurt actually okay
I'm worried about your arms bracing
yourself for that fall at that point I'm
not ready to do another yeah yeah well
not totally work out the tests like
Kaiser like my knees are like wasn't
great no but did it give you any kind of
indication at all no no they said
something about it's more about the arm
movement like the flail yeah that
triggers it I just I just went down on
my knees and sure I was like the flame
you have to I think the watch knew
though you're that you're half-assing
that fall so the Excel or napple the the
accelerometer can now detect greater G's
great okay for so yeah so that's a lot
of it too is that I think it's when it
registers an impact of a certain amount
of G's met it well I don't know what
that is but it triggers it so you you
really have to have a you know like a
real impact right also apparently it can
sense motions of your hand that might
indicate something algorithmically for
what a fall would be so it could be like
if your hand splays out or just
something yeah I imagine has to it's a
couple of things yeah there has to be a
few criteria to me cuz then you'll have
a lot of false positives and it's just
then it's annoying
right so yeah so I mean yeah it's one of
those things you're probably not going
to notice and so interestingly to I
guess it's that it's for Falls it falls
off a bike it could be a possibility for
this detective guy and thought about
crashes no it is not is not set up for
that so I actually I started to think
about that I thought well you know as a
general impact detector that would be
useful but it won't it wouldn't even
short work for something like that in
the future that would be great because
if you got into a crash or something
something that would immediately send an
alert would be a great idea but I don't
know yeah that would be really difficult
to set the watch for detection right I
think so and then still at the point
where like Do Not Disturb while driving
goes on while I'm on the train oh yeah
for my phone and like you know I'm
always like no I'm not driving so yeah
there's a lot of I mean we're making
progress but and that's not that's up to
us Ari's burping it's hate radio
apologize there we go live live Bert
moments no
subtle burp I think I think there are
very important steps but they're not
ones that I'm obviously encountering on
a daily basis right well Brian do have
any questions yeah well first and
foremost we and the chat do applaud you
Scott for making the effort so thanks
for doing that we gotta test this more I
do really want to see this thing work
because it really could be a fantastic
implementation we want to do fall tests
yeah we'll figure something out
it's gonna happen it might be happen in
SF with someone who's fitter and has
like a I don't know why I'm saying San
Francisco has all the fit people I'm not
sure you're fit people oh yeah I yeah I
would just have to get ready you drugged
me and have me fall over if you have any
suggestions for how I could fall in a
video game mattress I would a detect
that you're landing on something soft
probably the watch would be like yeah
the chat was saying like if they knew
what was a quote-unquote Daddy fall just
like wimp yeah exactly that's what it is
life improvement did point out though
something that factored into the to the
lack of reaction and in this corner
quick test it's the fact you got right
back up again
I think they'd pointed out that it's
like if you fall and you stay down and
it knows you're hurt that's exactly
that's a good point yeah sure so that's
or something yeah I think it's I don't
know how long but it's so yeah there's a
pretty that's great point there's a
period of inactivity let's go through
before I think they start but I think
that's for calling your emergency
contact is they exactly right it is so
well so it's probably like hey wait what
oh wait nevermind you're fine yeah it
first calls emergency services then it
calls someone on your contact list okay
so it goes in that order with the idea
that the emergency calls the you know
the 9-1-1 is just important way yeah and
it sends says like i notifies that it
follows happened and sends your location
now did it go off on sunday was on
sunday first day of fall
ah no I have pun detection off those
like a Jets reference result yeah
thought so too I was like he's talking
about beer that was like I said fall not
fail my real the real fall when the gas
lost to the brand go bills anyways ok so
right off the bat we had a really
excellent question from Priority One
before we even got the show started yeah
he says I'm in a wheelchair would the
watch register every push of the wheel
and be interesting to see my miles a day
that we got to get apples attention on
this because if that isn't a meter that
they can read yet that would be a
fascinating addition to it no no it
already does that actually Apple had
made a big deal of this last year that
they have made and I have not used it
but there are fitness tracking does
recognize wheelchairs check on that on
their site but we have not done
accessibility you know testing for that
but that is something that Apple has
addressed so that's something that
should be in last year's Apple watch I
believe that's like a watch OS feature I
don't know how far back it goes but yes
it should give you credit I don't know
how that gets tracked and turned on and
believe it's it's a sub activity feature
I'm sorry I don't know the details on
that I should but I remember that that
was addressed it was a big deal I think
last at the last Apple watch event when
it was being discussed or watch os
unveiling so I believe you should be in
good hands with that like I think that
that's I think that that's a should be a
good support feature TBD from a big
thank you to DC for one four seven
saying look for someone who does Aikido
those people are trained so fall over I
think that's a great suggestion if I
want to do a real great fall test I
think I remember seeing something about
how a lot of stunt performers in
Hollywood they trained in Aikido on that
behalf I make a tell me if I'm wrong but
I think I remember that reference yeah
yeah sure I don't know I don't know
specifically which marshal I think that
sounds right that's something to keep in
mind when were like maybe we should yeah
maybe should go to like an Aikido studio
and like it's thrown around the throw
throw URL safely I guess and then we get
like three hours into it and realize
Scott forgot to put the watch exactly
that again okay more questions before we
run out of time from James I would love
to find out how well the ECG monitor
works and if it lives up to the hype now
you were just saying yeah we haven't
been able to spend enough real time with
the ECG later in a software update
I had kicked over the shoulder of
somebody showing a demonstration reading
of ECG just for demo purpose of showing
what it looks like but that's it yeah
it's not live yet Apple has not even
announced a launch date they just said
it's coming later this year whether that
has to do with final FDA clearance it's
it's going to be in the u.s. first as
far as like wear it well it's oh it's
another thing to keep in mind if you're
in an overseas market you may not have
that feature unlocked depending on
whether it's been been cleared for use
so I'm sure they're working on that but
I'm curious too I did use the cardia
band last year which is an already
existing Apple watch accessory they also
make a standalone that does ECG reading
basically it gives you like your
Hospital readout ping we're all of a
sudden you start seeing the heart rate
as you'd see it yeah you know like in
your in your TV movie that would be
hooked up we've been in the hospital so
it gives you it records that 30-second
heart rate apples will also analyze that
and make a statement as far as detecting
arrhythmia oh really
yeah we'll say something like not
nothing too too much of a a judgement
but it might say like we're detecting an
arrhythmia or there does not seem to be
an arrhythmia and the idea is that it's
all from there between you and your
doctor right by design a lot of these
are not making health claims helices
they're not making like health
recommendations they're not making a
diagnosis or recommendation that that's
part of the restriction of what this can
and cannot do so that it's something
that you record then send to your doctor
as a PDF to that's another interesting
thing so I know that you can send us a
PDF or have it going to the health app
and then you know it's one of those
things that they just want to see a
current reading or if you're like
I may need to come in here's my recent
reading I'm just curious if you'll be
able to move from person to person like
if like I want to give my dad an EKG -
can I take off the locks put on him and
just run it and then get those stats
where they serve is it personalized to
like your profile well it would be you
know like Apple health is all for you
and it's you know so like it wouldn't
change anything you would probably just
go into your own it would go to your
data file you can then delete the yeah
you could probably ting or you could
just send that off and okay I send that
file and say by the way this is I think
you could use it for that but it's not
but but the abstract was advice to be
liked by another Apple right why don't
you go in France yeah but it would not
like it wouldn't like the calibration I
don't think would change over time okay
it would who knows but um I think that
would that would work out okay I mean
there's no different user settings for
Apple watches anyhow it's like okay yeah
in order to change it to another setting
if to put on different device right
repair and set it up all over again like
the full set of all reinstall basically
kind of nice like you know if that's got
like relatives who may not have an Apple
watch like older phones I'd be like here
yo let's just see how that whole tickers
doing so absolutely speaking of that do
we think that that's gonna be a big
strategy for Apple because there is
concern like people who might need this
for the ECG for the fall detection etc
people who don't tend to gravitate
towards technology not to say there
aren't exceptions to the rule but let's
be honest my grandparents weren't
exactly rushing out to get the new fancy
phone um do we think that that's gonna
be a challenge how Apple is going to get
over that do you think people will
gravitate towards that naturally I mean
I think though well I mean especially if
they get like insurance copies involved
I think that that would help a lot if
all the son who's paying for it yeah
sure it's companies like if you wear
this Apple watch whatever we'll know you
you get this for free and you can knock
off five bucks from your premium or
something that's smart
yeah that makes a lot of sense yeah yeah
you've got the fall detector you've got
things that appeal to folks who may not
necessarily have considered an Apple
watch before but they they might or it's
more I guess like for me
I would be more interested in buying one
of these for my my parents as they get
older and and this is probably a device
that they wouldn't be necessarily
ashamed to wear as opposed to one of
those traditional fall detection devices
which have that negative stigma that's
true I I think that also the watch I
mean people are fine setting up the
Apple watch now I guess and many people
have them I still feel like the set up
is a little bit cumbersome you know it's
it's like you take so well or somebody
did you also need to have a phone to
make it work though is that I'm doing
yeah that's what I was about to get to
is that it would be really nice for the
Apple watch to be a standalone device
and it's not yet it could very well be
in the future like I mean I do remember
it at UPS the iPhone used to have to be
am I crazy that you had to plug it in
yeah you had to like set it up and plug
it in for iTunes and there was a lot
more connected pairing right the iPhone
is a fully standalone device that gets
its own music and its other things well
it was in of a later development it
worked as a phone but if you wanted to
implement all the smartphone features
get music on it yeah you had to use a
plug it is good to plug it in so and
then we look now when you go oh well now
you set up an iPhone used to have to set
up an iPhone first on a computer now
it's fully on its own you never you know
a computer never is involved about to be
fair it took about seven or eight years
for that to happen yeah in a while it
may take that little rabbit yeah blow
watches challenges because it's smaller
like things like battery things like LTE
radio things I can make it independent
are still fairly limited by the physics
right there physical restriction so in
battery life is part of that like I
still want to see it a better battery
life and that that is probably gonna
have to do with more efficient
processors than it has to do with
sticking a larger battery in there yeah
because the battery technology is not
gonna change right oh yeah for sure
alright we're running the one time
there's a couple really really great
questions I want us to get to does the
watch take advantage of the larger
display like a bigger face larger
widgets and how is the screen is
brighter great questions screen
brightness I think is about the same
larger screen I'm let down by how much
it's it's taken advantage of or not
everything is bigger which again that
could really matter for people you know
for me I didn't need it but you know the
very simple thing of text being more
readable etc there are only two unique
watch faces on this one the ones you
probably saw in the keynotes the
infograph yeah info graph modular
they're very like lots of things going
on in them I was let down because the
number of what the complications the
bits of information that tap in some of
them have extra nice little readouts and
features like the temperature range
where things others don't like heart
rate when I put heart rate on there
instead of showing what you think will
be there which is recent heart rate
reading or range resting heart rate
it just shows a heart icon which is a
shortcut so that's not helpful and some
of the complications don't even link
back to existing apps so third-party
apps or even first party apps like I
couldn't get text messages to show up as
one of the things for other types of
messages and there were only five or six
for one of the types that I could even
pick from on the watch and it's unclear
whether others will tap in or not and
the amount of customization on all the
watch faces to me is still lacking like
I can't add extra bits of information if
I wanted to right and you can't change
the watch display to be different or to
change the layout sometimes it's very
finicky lots of options but not always
the options you'd want mmm you need that
plus a watch face store liked it's all
about the time it's all about lanes but
in the watch face store come on Apple
make it happen come on I'm gonna lead
the watch face store team there you go
oh I just want her now maybe see that to
join not happening the actual watch just
I'm just a team yeah that's playing a
sport maybe that that's all the watch
face store team wears playing softball
that's what we're doing cool softball
name I just want I think that would be a
huge moment when that arrives and also I
just think more customization of watch
faces it's not happening fast enough you
know kinda like I feel about the iPhone
max the 10s max doesn't make enough of
the display for some of the apps where
you could possibly split up and make it
more on I mean I imagine that's the
dilemma they face today if they start
building so specifically for that bigger
screen size then they start to fragment
and then you
yes I mean no it is a very interesting
conundrum with that with the different
apples always kind of erred on the side
of controlling things right kind of
keeping things cast in uniform I mean
that's one thing one reason why I do
kind respect where OS right I feel like
they're a little bit more flexible when
it comes to watch faces or it's more
flexible although the watch faces can
can get very clunky on those like there
are more of them yeah but they really I
think apples are really nice in the
number of complications in general
versus the competition but they are
strangely rigid in the rules that they
yeah yeah but where West does does have
like I mean if you wanted to make
another type of watch face you could put
it on they do mostly tend to do similar
types of things there's a there's also a
wear OS update that's coming that's
gonna change some of the interfaces but
that's still it does make you appreciate
that apples is is very finessed oh for
sure
a limited number of well produced
polished watch face yeah but sometimes
you want that chaos right not everyone
wants that polish right I just want like
things I want to be able to make my own
dashboard and I still feel with the
Apple watch that I can't make it my own
dashboard the weight the way to which I
really want and what is that really like
who knows but it could be like looking
at little messages pop up on a feed or
it could be like sports scores and like
it's there but it's not it's still kind
of annoying all right you have any last
questions yeah real quick first and
foremost from me I hate that they call
them complications I I do too yeah it's
a Water Street open for discussion it's
stupid you know what it's not them so
that's a watch industry term that goes
back to like mechanical watches that all
those were complicated right well also
like they were they yeah they were
complicated and they were things that
you were almost like show off features
yeah the idea was like you've engineered
something to now tell the time like a
beautiful automaton that right as these
gears that complexity is and you're like
well yeah that's treated as a positive
like the term complications on a
SmartWatch I hate it seems yeah I want
to call it what do we so what do we call
it
widgets widgets widgets widgets the
little widgets that's not bad at all
were used to widgets
and basically they're widgets okay what
about seizures do we can this detect
seizures since that could happen to a
person who's not necessarily standing
there already down to detect that I know
there's been no claim of that they I
don't think they'd ever would even get
near that claim now that would be
there's so much more testing an FDA
scrutiny that I don't think Apple at
least now or anytime soon would consider
that I think down the road there's
always hope that these devices will with
more accurate sensors be able to detect
more things but yeah the point of which
you can make those claims and get
approved for it is is that's a long road
I mean it will again I think the
seizures is more about detecting the
fall if you have a seizure but it
wouldn't detect the presence of a
seizure at all there's nothing with that
maybe another really great one for them
to implement down the line okay home
stretch here
so proposed situation is if you already
have an elderly member your family and
you're thinking like oh this new watch
might be something very beneficial to
them but they're kind of stuck in their
ways and you've already got them into
the smartphone train but they haven't
upgraded in a few years let's say
they're running an iPhone 5 yeah will
this ECG monitor and any of the other
fall detection applet type widget things
will that function with older model
phones so yeah any any phone yes it'll
work with I don't know to what degree
going back that's interesting what to go
check but if you're if the watch is
pairing and the watch is connected and
it's running watch OS 5 that'll all work
is it's all on watch and the rest of it
just get you know like for sending a
message etc that just gets brokered the
way it would always happen via phone so
fall detection is on watch ECG is on
watch that's all that's all watch you'll
be available in the series 3 and older
no ECG is is hardware based that's an
election is all detection is also just
the new hardware okay so sorry that is
only on the new watch but working with
older phones it should as long as the
phone is paired sure it got and
connected because that's just about
relaying sending a phone call but but
yeah the fall detection is because of
improved accelerometer
that they say contect a greater range
ECG is literally an electrical circuit
right that has been put in there that
completes by holding up to the that goes
through to the crown mm-hmm which we
haven't tried out but that's basically
what you do good question I mean the
problem with all these things that
detect stuff that are supposed to be
lifesavers is you know it's like you
want it to work all the time so if I
were to get this for somebody I want it
to work all the time I don't want to
screw up and have a problem where and
this could be any of these things that
the battery life runs and yeah and the
connectivity is not there and it
couldn't complete the phone call or if
like it didn't sense the drop or just
all these variables that yeah the issue
things ever perfect the issue with it is
I don't know yet these other medical
devices you know they run you know for
days right this thing would have a
charge every day every other day like we
have to make sure as charging so that's
I think that's still a question mark
that's true too I mean the charging is
about it's about an hour to charge you
know or something you charge it at night
but that's the other thing at night this
brings up one other thing that we didn't
even get to these watches are not meant
to be worn at night right now they don't
do sleep tracking and they don't do
heartrate awareness at night now that is
something an apple has really not gotten
into not touched for obvious reasons
because the battery life won't last it
but I think it's a big missing link here
yeah and by all means when Apple does
make that move they're gonna make a big
deal out of it because all the other
wearables out there that they're
competing against have sleep tracking
right the Samsung Galaxy watch's sleep
tracking well where Wes no Fitbit has
sleep tracking garments have sleep
tracking like your basic wearables have
sleep tracking and some of them like
Fitbit are aiming to be much more aware
of heart conditions when you're sleeping
that Fitbit is still working on apnea
detection mmm now that's not there yet
but they're working on trying to detect
that it could be that Apple and Fitbit
arrived through the gate at the same
time on that but I think that there are
things like that about there are there
further roads to check out and if your
heart rate gets abnormally low which is
the new thing in the series for well if
you're not wearing the
at night then you won't necessarily know
Plus would you even be aware if the
notification went off right so yeah in
actual practice there are a lot of
questions I have and you agree
Imran their blood pressure watch which
is not out yet but they were talking
about how the goal there and say yes
back in January was that people don't
wear it don't recharge things yeah so if
you give it as someone who's elderly
like really elderly is wearing this you
know two weeks or a week or whatever
else because they're just not gonna
remember nurse won't remember so the
Apple watch doesn't seem like it would
slide well at all yeah into real elderly
care like where they'd have to they may
not be aware very much or they may need
care and you have to have the phone then
you have to have the phone set up and
say who's monitoring the phone who's the
phone plugged in is that charge is the
fun of the watch someone's gonna have to
look after that stuff yep so I just
think like it'll become a little bit
like talked ourselves out of this whole
this whole idea I mean health families
doctors so I think about this a lot yeah
it's a I mean you know it's like I think
about medicine I'm not a doctor but um
but I talked to them a lot and yeah I
know it's a interesting question I
haven't talking about of it but I would
say that the Apple watch series for
proposition is not an immediate slam
dunk right of like and I think the
bigger design is great but I would like
to see it taking advantage of more
battery we are out of time but we got
one last quick quick stressing quick
question from Waleed who's been
extremely patient Scott what do you like
to sport loop were the original black
oh wait sport what's the original black
the original black band comfort on the
band's Oh for the rubber support loop is
super comfy but it looks really bulky a
lot of the time the sport loop it
depends on the colors sometimes I feel
like I'm wearing like a like a kids you
know like slap bracelet or something oh
yeah and it just gets like very bulky
but there was one color spore troop
support loop I liked a lot it's it's the
easiest most comfortable one to attach
so but the but the band the rubber one
looks a little better I think and every
day is a little complicated to put on
yeah
but if you're like doing workouts and
stuff anything sport loop is is a good
one to get okay just go and then
reattach you have to make sounds like
that though yeah sounds
huh and then you readjust it the velcro
holds holds in there I think wearing one
for a year the sport loop didn't really
wear out all too much all right that was
one of the my more favorite Apple shows
we've done in a long time and I'm as you
know really sick and tired of hearing
about it
well that was why we have some really
tremendously excellent questions yeah
yeah yeah so thanks everybody and we did
think it go and thanks for being patient
with us we're running a little behind
today the floor yeah of course thank you
thank you and what is the full review
come on yeah the full review is not out
yet so there's a lot of a stay tuned
it's probably gonna come out hopefully
soon we're still working on what do
fitness testing so it was an ongoing
thing but maybe end of this week or
beginning in next week we really want to
make sure we get a measured reaction and
once ECG is available we'll be doing
even more so stay tuned for a lot of
that all right B 359 podcast is
available on iTunes tune in stitcher
