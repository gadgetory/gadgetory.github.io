bargain don't discount the Nokia 7.1 for
$350 this mid-range device for fall has
a pretty good roundup of specs for a
price you rarely see in the thicket of
super premium phones like the galaxy s 9
and iPhone 10's this is a Hershey's bar
not a chocolate truffle this nokia phone
gives you a notched 5.8 inch screen and
two rear cameras one a 12 megapixel lens
and the other a 5 megapixel lens for
depth
there's also software for taking
portrait shots from the front and rear
cameras enhanced bokeh mode lets you
adjust the amount of background blur in
your picture you also get a camera trick
called both e mode that lets you split
and adjust the screen to capture scenes
simultaneously from the front and rear
cameras the nokia 7.1 also comes with an
8 megapixel selfie lens the handset
itself has a solid feel and clean lines
shiny accents cut through the neutral
colors which are called gloss teal and
midnight blue it looks a little boring
to be honest but there you go it will
ship with Android 8.1 software at first
but is on track to receive its Android
Pi upgrade by November although the
nokia 7.1 has a glass back there's no
wireless charging or robust water
resistance and that's okay because it's
not something you would expect for a
phone in this range you do get faster
wired charging however and a rare
headphone jack inside is a nice sized
3,600 milliamp battery and a Qualcomm
6:36 chipset that should make the phone
up to 40% faster than last year's model
globally you'll have your choice of a 32
gigabyte or 64 gigabyte storage option
with a micro SD card slot to add more
space in the US you'll be able to buy
the 64 gigabyte version of the nokia 7.1
