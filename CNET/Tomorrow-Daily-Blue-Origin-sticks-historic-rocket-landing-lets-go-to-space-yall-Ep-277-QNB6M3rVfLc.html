the best geek talk-show in the known
universe
I'm Ashley Scott you're watching one of
our short episodes there will not be a
long episode this week because of the
Thanksgiving holiday here in the States
but we will be back next week with three
short episodes and one long episode just
for your viewing pleasure until then
let's hit the headlines we did it
everybody we did it Blue Origin finally
landed a rocket after flying it into
space this is a huge deal for the
commercial space industry as landing a
rocket means reusable rockets which also
means much cheaper costs for sending
supplies and if all goes to plan people
into space there's some specifics here
we should clarify and Elon Musk was also
happy to talk about this this morning on
his Twitter account so blue origins new
Shepard rocket made it into space
but getting to geostationary transfer
orbit or specifically getting a rocket
into actual orbit above the earth takes
a lot more speed than the new Shepard
was pulling we're talking about Mach 3
to get to space but Mach 34 GTO orbit
and SpaceX has actually been working
hard on the orbit side of things and
reusing a rocket so there's been a
little bit more velocity happening in
that process it doesn't make this event
with Blue Origin any less amazing though
and they should be commended for their
hard work and successful landing Blue
Origin founder who also happens to be
the founder and CEO of Amazon Jeff Bezos
tweeted for the first time this morning
saying quote the rarest of beasts a used
rocket controlled landing not easy but
done right can look easy
unquote oh snap Bezos are we under an
umbrella cuz I sent some shade in that
tweet oh my god you guys someone's
trying to teach robots to disobey human
commands what well before we all panic
let's let's take a quick look Tufts
University's human robot interaction lab
thinks it might be a good idea to teach
robots to reject orders from humans when
appropriate so what exactly would it be
appropriate for a robot to
disobey the second law of robotics and
say no to a human order well it can't
break the first law of robotics which is
injuring a human directly or allowing a
human to be injured through an action
and the third law says a robot must
protect itself as long as it doesn't
break the first or second laws the idea
here is to actually teach a robot to
understand what's being asked of them
and to comprehend how capable it is of
completing a task in essence Tufts
University is actually teaching robots
to explain to its human masters why they
cannot complete a task so that the human
can then modify explain or change the
command to fall in line with the robot's
obedience protocols
you know I'm oddly okay with this as
long as I never have to argue with my
Roomba about whether or not it feels
like vacuuming on a Saturday morning
okay our very last headline today is
about a hospital that is doing a
real-life version of surgeon simulator
Boston Children's Hospital is a major
advocate of practicing procedures before
actually needing to perform them on real
people and because of that they've
partnered with an unlikely collaborator
for surgery simulations fractured FX is
a Hollywood makeup effects house and
they're now creating more realistic
human organs and body parts for surgeons
to practice on in simulators using a
Hollywood effects house is kind of an
unorthodox method but if you think about
it it actually makes a lot of sense
since the FX team can create highly
realistic effects with anatomically
correct look feel and response to human
interaction such as scalpel work each
product is tested by actual surgeons and
then they give feedback to fractured
effects which allows the company to
create better and better products for
simulations so the next time you find
yourself watching a show like the Nick
and you feel grossed out at how
realistic the surgical special effects
are keep in mind that real-life surgeons
might be using those very same products
to practice operating on what could be
you in the future that's creepy
all right guys let's check out what's
new this week
coming up this week three movies in
theaters that look to all be pretty good
so Creed comes out this week Creed is
the story of Adonis Johnson the son of
Apollo Creed so rocky comes back
Sylvester Stallone and he is now
Adonis's mentor so that should be really
really good I'm hearing good things
about that also coming out this week the
good dinosaur from Pixar a story about a
boy and his dog except that the boy is a
dinosaur and the dog is a person and I
can't wait to see that it looks really
really cute and lastly Victor
Frankenstein a kind of retelling of the
story of dr. Frankenstein with Daniel
Radcliffe playing Igor and James McAvoy
playing dr. Freud so I can't wait to see
that either as for video games there's
not really anything compelling coming
out this week but who cares you're
already busy with Halo 5
rise of the Tomb Raider fallout 4 Star
Wars Battlefront Starcraft 2 everything
that's ever come out ever for video
games so we're all good there we're all
