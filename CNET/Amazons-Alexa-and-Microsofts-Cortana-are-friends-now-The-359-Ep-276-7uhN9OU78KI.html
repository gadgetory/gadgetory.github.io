what the hell are you doing Alfred it's
Wednesday my dude 276 I don't care
anymore yeah Roger do we have any real
news today not really no we what we
talking about more this wasn't part of
the plan but Microsoft and Amazon put
out a statement confirming that there
are two digital assistants we'll start
working together
Alexa Cortana best friends now robot
buddies exactly it's not really that
exciting to me either but it's kind of a
big deal as far as like AI goes it's a
good look it's a big deal many levels
we'll get we'll get into in the podcast
beyond that we'll be talking about
Naruto anime Iran yes we'll talk about
Alfred's experience running or as my
eyes everywhere call it Naruto
Naruto Naruto yes it's a Japanese
insanely popular Japanese anime based on
kid ninjas yeah who run in a unique
style that Alfred it running in ninja
style
it's not interests at all the ninjas run
with it's not how did just run talking
about the podcast I don't know why it's
a slow news day so buckle up yeah if you
have any questions about any of this and
Alfred's personal experience being
Naruto leave us a comment we'll get to
them in 3 minutes and 59 seconds from 3
to welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang
I'm Alfred hang Alexan Cortana or BFFs
Microsoft and Amazon announced today
that their two digital assistants will
start talking to each other so does this
mark the start of a new era where all of
our digital assistants start interacting
and start talking behind our backs I
don't know I think the whole talking to
each other thing is a bit overplayed
because like right now it's basically
saying like Alexa can you connect to
Cortana and then we can use Cortana or
vice versa or vice versa right I don't
think it's talking to each other it
sounds like when you're
like mad at your sibling or something
like can you tell my brother that I
don't wanna like say I mean you take it
such a pessimistic way I look at it as
it's a huge deal because this is two
large tech companies we're pretty much
on different sides of you know their
competitors essentially are working
together putting their digital
assistants together so they can actually
get wrapped in some sort of Jeff Bezos
actually made a really good point when
he like wanted to do this talking about
how the same way that you and I might
have like different friends that we go
to from recommendations and and things
like that he thinks he sees AI in this
perspective where basically like you'll
go to Cortana for your work emails and
organizing like your calendar and things
like that bow you'll go to Alexa for to
control your music or your small write
and things like right so I mean do you
think that this marks the start of maybe
Google assistant and Siri maybe getting
bored maybe all these media bixby I feel
like I'd be a lot more excited if it
were a Google assistant jumping on with
Alexa but I think because they're more
of a threat to Alexa and Cortana is yeah
because they really don't have a wedge
and an edge I guess in the in the smart
speaker space whereas Gregg does
something with Siri and Apple yeah it's
interesting in court on I mean Kota has
been around for a while and you know
Microsoft have put a lot of resources
the last few years into it but it's not
one of those voices this is that you
talk about as much as Alexa we've added
Siri it's mostly used on PC so it's not
as mobile and it doesn't have smart home
features yet which i think is it well it
was on mobile but the only problem was
the mobile wasn't on anything yeah yeah
well no one was using those phones
except for the NYPD and not anymore um I
don't think people were even using the
voice assistant on that right so all
right next up alfred you had a unique
day in the park on Saturday
tell us about your route or run so two
weeks ago I saw a Facebook event called
Naruto run through Central Park which I
like that ending on as a joke because
these have been popping up all over the
place where it's just like and if you're
not familiar with it it's from the anime
where you run like a wannabe ninja yeah
your hands are kind of you flung back
it's basically like wings that never
flap right right
supposed to I mean visually I guess it
kinda looks like you're going faster yes
Sonic the Hedgehog ran like that to when
he gets top speed right but it became a
running joke because the there were kids
that actually thought that this made him
run faster wait wait does it know you're
supposed to be pumping your arms then
what I've been doing wrong this whole
time it kind of became this running joke
where like people would like do that to
make fun of like like really hardcore
anime fans right so then they'd have
these events there's other events like
it where it's like scream like Goku
outside of ya Square Park or something
like that and there's several hundred
people committed to going but it was
only like 20 there's only like 20 people
showed up because I'm pretty sure the
other eight hundred or so people were
like this is a joke I mean you did
initially and then I heard about him
like you should go do this yeah so I
like the first thing I did when I saw
the event was like I Facebook messaged
like the organizer yeah this is real and
he like yeah I'm trying to make this
like a real thing so I showed up there
were only about 20 people which was kind
of disappointing on my end but I thought
it was really was super goofy yeah it
was really funny I had a great time just
like laughing at mice and I know people
are making fun of the anime make you
float Naruto but I mean there's a bit of
love in there too right like a lot of
people grew up with that anime right
yeah I mean I think that's why they all
know about and that's why they dressed
up like the character that's cool yeah
all right through these stories and more
chickens on seen it and I'm Roger Chang
I'm Alfred Inge
thanks for listening so by the way that
was like right on the for me tomorrow Oh
finally so I want to talk a little bit
about coming up the wrong graphics first
of all today
I need Mario teaches typing so with you
talk about Cortana and Alexa and I'm
sorry everybody for triggering
everything in your house right now if
they're gonna be friends isn't there a
lot of kind of late is is this a new era
in in crossover because we're talking to
see about cross play I saw yeah
Microsoft and PlayStation is this like
when the Power Rangers met the Ninja
Turtles that was awesome yeah wait they
did
it wasn't like the first Devoe's in
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers really it
happened like 1012 years ago I didn't
watch the show I didn't watch any of the
shows but uh I would say that's what I'm
hopeful for that I think digital
assistants do start to work together
like Samsung's Bixby starts talking to
alexa or google assistant talks with
siri like it's i feel like that that
would make them a lot more useful that
would actually help them all kind of
learn yeah cuz there's like almost a
shared dated and also under jeff bezos
like vision of all these like different
AI is that you consult with on a single
device like that makes a lot more sense
it's AI its software it can go on like
multiple speakers if anything i guess to
be play the devil's advocate though
would you want to be able would you want
to train yourself to ask for five
different yeah that's the only thing
that's like to me I'm like I feel like
at this stage there's nothing that
really differentiates all these
different a eyes for me for any to want
to rely on more than one cuz I feel like
it's just like crowding and to be fair I
think that this is a deal that Microsoft
benefits more from yeah price yes
Michael like everyone knows Alexa at
this point but and Cortana around I
think arguably longer than Allah has and
really I think so it's yeah years years
as Cortana came with Windows 10 s debut
Cortana came with halo excuse me yeah
yeah and actually use the same voice
mean them it's only point of pride but
yeah turns been around for a while and
they you know they tried to get it they
tried to I think it was in the phone
first it was in Windows Phone yeah that
sounds and because no one bought that
thing no we used it so that was I mean I
tried using it on my laptop and then I
just got when I got Windows 10 and was
just one of those things like this I can
just click I don't think I don't use
yeah I don't use Siri I'm at that just
seems stupid to me yes like I don't call
it out but hey Siri where am I going
I need a thing I only don't even use
Siri just like you said Irina for
everything
just cuz like set a timer and or alarm
just because I don't want to go to like
the clock app and I'm like oh you doing
all that yeah yeah yeah yeah that's like
literally the only thing I use here
before I actually why I used to do it
for weather
like it's so hard picking up haste but
yeah but the point I like Jeff Bezos has
been trying to make though with like the
whole you know you can use it for this
and then use it for this thing right I
don't like I don't I don't know how many
people use like Outlook I mean I'm sure
a lot of people use Outlook I don't know
how many people use the voice assistant
for Outlook still find it to be an
interesting novelty but yeah it's not
part of my data yet I mean I think this
is sort of a foundation for where it
will be eventually I I can see myself
way down the line dictating emails and
O's becomes like visual like your your
screen pops up in the air or something
like what's what's something that you
way far out features that you like that
you use Siri for that like you can only
get with Syria like you can't get with
some other voice assistant I don't know
I know with my with my echo there's an
app I used to play Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons
because I don't have any friends you
played now you can play with Cortana -
that's two friends oh yeah there's a
what it the the skill is called but it's
it's literally like a it's it's not it's
not copy written Dungeons and Dragons
but it's pretty much exactly that it's a
so you play with a like gee yeah oh crap
there's a skill for it look it up it's
it's not I can't I just can't remember
I'm gonna top my head but it's all
voiced I played Japanese you the story
she's a dungeon med master and then will
you interact that's awesome she rolls
virtual die and the whole thing the
whole like multiple voice assistance
thing though seems like really annoying
to have to deal with do you at least
like remember when Google announced that
I was putting the assistant on like iOS
yeah but like you still have to like
download the app and then like to click
on the app there's that it's so annoying
as well for sure alright we gotta get
into the chat because they're tired of
hearing us sorry guys why would you
first of all shout out to Abdul Mighty
Morphin digital assistants hey watch and
then great mr. lizard says I want to add
the Cortana is my favorite
I think that's significantly more
powerful than Siri I'm personally just
kind of interested in your experience
with that as we don't hear a lot of core
I use Cortana when I had like demo
Windows Phones it was it was pretty good
like it also told jokes it had a decent
personality it did use the same voice
actress as the original Cortana from
halo which is cool which is super cool
but my halo fan but just history lizard
indulgence takeaway is from I do
remember I mean it was fairly I mean
robust in terms of what I could most of
it is used on your on your PC though
right like it's not back Vani was yeah
it was phone yeah I haven't used Cortana
since it's made its way to the PC
because I used it a few but it was just
like it was really slow to respond so
I'm just gonna do this it made more
sense on the phone right yeah I guess
yeah cuz the microphone was way better
than what my laptop had mr. lizard said
is worth noting that Windows is used by
millions people every day of Cortana
could become useful for PC then it could
have a huge impact on the smart
assistant market there sure I think
that's a challenge yeah it's just not
it's nothing Windows is used by millions
of people but not Cortana I mean it's
it's on there's any way where it could
work into desktops it's on mo if you
have Windows 10 then you have Cortana ok
but I mean where would you actually
logically use it that's my question I
don't know
that's a shout-out to the chat where do
you think a digital assistant could be
useful in your desktop could have uses
and show you celery man ok alright sorry
Roger
anyway yeah I mean tell us how how you
guys would use Cortana and he's like
here's the thing though with digital
assistants in general like how much do
you actually use them like Alexa I use
her to check the weather news updates
play music for my kid that's basically I
set an alarm within our set along so
timer an alarm like really basic test
that you can do with any digital system
like is there anything more complicated
that we use it for I don't know hmm I
know it's just so it's kind of like tiny
I feel like computers are already so
fast on their own and you're already
looking at a screen like the reason why
I use a voice assistant is because I
don't want to
to screen or like go to all these
different things yeah it's like on a
phone it's like that's like five
different windows that I have to go to
or if I'm just walking around the
kitchen or something yeah I don't want
pull my phone for something that's one
of us yeah works on a computer though
it's literally like a tab away like yeah
three strokes like I've said it before
and I'll say it again the best part of
my the assistant situation is when I
come home with an armful of groceries
and I don't want to turn put them down
to turn on the lights to walk in my
apartment yeah yeah that's the peak of
it I set up a an echo in my living room
over the weekend and it's like next to
the window like when you walk in like
from the outside and I tried to see how
powerful it was so like I'm like unlock
my door and what computer play like you
know Danny Brown or something and then I
walk in and it was playing so only all
right this works it is awesome that just
means you have thin walls no I was
outside so it was like outside my window
yeah I see what you're saying
I like that Abdul still kind of running
with this Mighty Morphin digital
assistant concept he says if they all
combine it could be truly powerful I
have just pictured like a Megazord waist
assistant megazor yeah but they all do
the same thing that's true not makes B
Bigsby does something different what is
what they speaking of your phone yeah
yeah exactly so is the point Bixby is
the heart of that Captain Planet big
he's the one that you asked for if you
want like show me the photo frog no I
don't think we can do that that's the
problem
it can do it Josh boy does expand on
this I feel the Cortana and Alexa are
partnering to take on Google assistant
oh yeah that's yeah and that kind of
alliance it's like especially when you
dirty dark underworld
especially systems when you think about
like when Jeff Bezos was talking about
like all the great things about Cortana
like you can check your emails yeah yeah
you know check your calendar which we're
not that great at doing hmm I wonder
what other voice assistant does really
well with email and calendars yeah I
don't know yeah that's true
hint it's not Siri never Siri
Abdul says the PC could become the hub
for home automation but essentially one
of those speakers is your hub for home
automation more or less and Paul goes I
didn't pay $3,000 for a reminder machine
well you know I would pay 10,000 you pay
$3,000 for other stuff the reminder
machine comes on top that's just the
cherry or not I guess imagine soggy says
I wish we could pause or turn off Alexa
for a second of time using voice it
triggers every time someone says it but
I mean isn't that kind of a point you
could also just change the trigger word
or yeah the mic off I wish you could
just manually set trigger words like
true freedom to make it what are the
options for echo Alexa and Amazon Amazon
is the least popular one I'm sure no
sure but I think you can set like a like
a quiet period for for your Alexa you
tap the button on top you can mute it
yeah but I think like people want
something where it's like it's
automatically turned on in a certain
period of time in like overnight like it
wouldn't have that you know what I mean
oh that's an that's a good thought yeah
yeah or like when you're watching like a
movie or something where for some reason
the character's name is Alexa you can
turn it off during that like time I
think that's kind of what he's asking
for I can't check on my right now
because I literally have no reception in
this room but I think there is something
like that where you can set it off for
like a period of time no we're having a
few people in the chat indulge us with
what they use their voice assistance for
and it seems to be a lot of the same
stuff Abell says I keep Alexa next to my
bed set my alarm turn my lights off read
the news or the Bible I just I've yet to
really come across somebody who's come
up with a truly creative and interesting
yeah platform for it I think why the DD
thing that you said that it's okay so
it's turning lights off on and off when
I come into the apartment with an armful
of crap
yeah is play Dungeons and Dragons and it
is open a box of cats
to torture my cat
there's a skill called a box of cats you
can say computer open a box of cats and
it just starts making meowing sounds and
my cat freaks out really it's free
entertainment for me wow that's that's a
pretty novel use I I indulge the emails
that we get every week from you know
what's new with Alexa okay and okay find
new ways but I keep kind of struggling
it's like I don't need more recipes I
don't need more news
you can like schedule like
do-not-disturb times for the Alexa okay
there you go I is it a new skill you
have to install or know it's like it's
our period so you can set a like
overnight turn off at 9:00 wake up at
7:00 or so yeah yeah all right nice I
don't off the microphone also though is
the thing because like I think in
general it just means like you don't get
any notifications or messages or
anything like that because that's all so
it's still listening yeah so it's still
yeah they would still interact with you
but it doesn't necessarily mean it's
completely mute yeah yeah yeah all right
we got one more question let's take it
here from Watson do you think Apple's
version of the home pod idea will
overtake others in terms of competitors
I know it says speaker quality is a
defining feature but do people actually
care about that yes it will pretend like
they know yes and no there are audio
files who will pay up for us for better
speakers I'm not sure I mean we haven't
seen the home pod yet so will it
actually swing your decision yeah in
home assistant when you can wire any of
your home assistants into your preferred
speakers yeah that's the thing like you
can get even better speakers and why are
your echo to it maybe somebody's just
got like I have an absolute lowest
common denominator I can't go worse than
this and that's I guess yeah or just
general loyalists yeah they're good yeah
yeah I still feel like Apple has like
way better branding than you know
absolutely and people will buy it saying
oh it's like the best speaker even
though there's better ones out there and
those
you know there's better options out
there but people will buy it thinking
that it's the best thing ever
yeah sure I can't imagine too many
people relying on that as their primary
speaker system in their home now no
maybe in like if you got like a patio
out back kind of thing or you don't want
to do like a full system out there but
if you're in your home and you're
already an audiophile you've already
made your decision is smart experience
yeah I just yeah my whole point is that
like people will pretend like they got
the best thing ever
with you know a position yeah if they
aren't audiophiles it's the same reason
why Beats headphones are so successful
right
there's better options out there but
this branding is so powerful that they
yeah that's true
alright that's about where we gonna run
out of commentary for the day and you
got to get moving we gotta get moving
and questions about anime did you feel
that you moved faster definitely there
you go yes you felt it I bought it I I'm
moving faster I am moving faster like
the wind I did you if you notice in that
video there's a dude jogging and I just
I just flew right past the truth
there you go you were running the right
way maybe but check it out it's a fun
story it was fun yeah yeah when you were
trying to record yesterday I was like
are you serious with this and then I
watched it this boy is the car Brad you
bring his home alright if you like maybe
