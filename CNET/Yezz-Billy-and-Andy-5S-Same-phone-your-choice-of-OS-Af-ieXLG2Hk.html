CES 2015 with the yes Andy and the Billy
5s now this is quite an interesting
concept because they are the same phone
but they come with your choice of
operating system let's take a look so
the hardware on both these phones is
identical they're kind of reasonably
powerful but still mid-range devices so
for example they both have quad-core
processors you get 4G LTE onboard they
have a 5 inch 720p display there's a 13
megapixel camera on the back and a 5
megapixel camera on the front what's
different now is that yes is launching
these two versions of the 5s with two
different operating systems so on the
one hand you get Billy which is the
Windows Phone version that's going to
launch perhaps with Windows Phone 8.1
but yes as its hoping to get Windows 10
on there and then there's the Android
version which is appropriately named and
e5s and that's running KitKat at the
moment
but again they're hoping to get lollipop
onboard so in terms of specs these are
kind of mid-range handsets but I do
think that the concept is really
interesting I like the idea of choosing
the design and the brand of the phone
you like and then getting to choose the
operating system later yes is that both
versions of the 5s are going to be on
sale before the summer and they're going
to cost under 300 u.s. dollars let me
know what you think and check out
