put you in the game I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update sony is
working to bring virtual reality gaming
to the PlayStation 4 at the game
developers conference in San Francisco
Sony is demoing a virtual reality
headset prototype it calls project
Morpheus there is a bit of a Tron vibe
to the design with glowing blue lights
around the eyes when you look into the
screen you'll see a 90 degree view of
your surroundings in the game with 1080p
resolution it can track your head
movements to calculate your position and
rotation and it has 360 degrees of
movement even the sound is
three-dimensional what you hear depends
on which way you're facing this is a
project three years in the making but
only developers can try it so that they
can build games for it we don't know if
this will ever become a real product but
we are getting closer to the world of
virtual reality that we were all
promised in the 90s Facebook is working
on a new face detection technology
called deep face the name is
appropriately creepy because it can scan
through millions of photos to match
faces even if those faces are turned to
an angle it's almost as good as humans
at detecting and matching people's faces
and now i'm sure facebook is thinking of
a way it can use that technology to make
money from our mugs more on this
research will be presented at a computer
conference in June there's a new skype
app for Android and it says it won't
quickly kill your battery life by
automatically turning off push
notifications for group chat microsoft
says you can leave skype running all day
with no noticeable battery drain pandora
is raising the price of its commercial
free service starting in May pandora one
will cost five dollars a month instead
of four dollars and with that dollar
increase there will be no longer a
yearly subscription option just month to
month but if you already subscribe or if
you sign up before May you won't have to
pay more right now about 3.3 million
people pay to listen without commercials
that's a small sliver of Pandora
is 250 million registered users there
are a few things certain in this life
and they are death taxes and fighting
over the air conditioner temperature
with your family but thanks to
technology the battle for the AC
settings can be controlled with a
smartphone meet eros a window air
conditioner that can sync with your
smartphone it adjust the temperature by
learning from your schedule budget
location and usage and in the end it's
supposed to save you money with its
energy efficiency made by quirky and GE
it's available for pre-order on amazon
for three hundred dollars and it will
ship in early May just in time for
summer that's your tech news update you
can get more details at cnet com /
update from our studios in New York I'm
