tech showdown throwdown I'm Brian Tong
and we're here to find out who reigns
supreme in the battle between flash
based high-definition camcorders in this
week's prize fight it's a face-off
between canons Vixia HF 10 and Sony's
handycam HDR cx-7 let's get right to it
with round 1 we're talking design both
of these cameras feature a sleek and
shiny black chassis that are drool
worthy but when it comes to operation
that's a different story
canons hf 10 features a joystick based
control on the side of the LCD and its
physical buttons are larger and easy to
press Sony's cx-7 uses a touchscreen
interface that is cool in concept but
it's just not as easy to use and it's
buttons or smaller targets to hit the H
f10 takes it this round with a 4 um and
the cx-7 gets a 3 next up features the H
f10 brings all the connections you can
think of without the use of a dock a key
feature is the mic input that many
cameras at this level ignore and it also
has manual controls and a longer 12x
zoom lens the cx-7 touts XV color
technology but it's not a big enough
difference to make up for a lack of mic
input and headphone jack also it says
full HD but this camera only records at
1440 by 1080 resolution and not the full
1920 by 1080 high-definition to dock for
additional connections that are built in
to the hf 10 Canon hit Sony Boone in the
chin in this round the hf 10 hum gets a
4 and the cx-7 gets a 2 cannons up by 3
it's gut check time for Sony next round
is about performance
flash-based cameras are snappy when it
comes to starting up and start step
execution but autofocus exposure and
image stabilization are the real
indicators the H f10 has some of the
best focused characteristics in a
consumer camera that we've ever seen and
it has a solid fast focus and image
stabilization that works all the way out
to its 12x oom the CX 7 is just as good
it has a snappy autofocus with great
auto exposure its Zeiss T star coated
lens is superb and it has image
stabilization that covers the entire
lens range as well both of these cameras
bring excellent performance to the table
and we're handing out huh fours to
everybody it's still a three point lead
for the HF 10 and next round is about
compatibility both of these cameras
support AVC HD so how compatible are
they to work with
well the hf 10 was able to handle plane
and editing at both the full high def
and 1440 by 1080 resolutions it also
uses the more common SDHC cards to
record media now with the cx-7 we had no
issues with plane or editing in its
files but the main bummer is that it
still uses Sony's proprietary and more
expensive memory stick duo Pro cards no
surprise there with these two cameras
it's the media format that makes a
difference the hf 10 um gets a 4 and the
cx-7 gets a 3 the hf 10 leads by 4 going
into the final round it will take a
miraculous comeback for Sony to take the
lead but it's still not too late for a
knockout punch the final round is about
what we care about with our camcorders
video quality
camcorders of this caliber look great no
matter what but it's little things that
make the difference
the hf 10s video quality is very good in
bright and low-light conditions but its
inconsistencies in photo versus video
wipeouts make it lag behind the cx-7 the
CX sevens clear vid sensor produces
great sharp images as well but Sony's
attention to still image quality gives
it the slight edge over the hf 10 in the
final round we're giving the hf 10 a 3
and the CX 700 for the hf 10 is crowned
champion 19 to 16 i'm bryan song and
we'll catch you guys next time on
another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
