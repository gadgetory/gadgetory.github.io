the apple byte it's our 2012 predictions
show and we know rumors helped fuel the
fire but let's have a little fun here
and just make some really bold
outlandish statements I'll write our
first prediction at number one Apple
will not release a TV in 2012 now TVs
make their debut at the Consumer
Electronics Show and they start hitting
shelves around May June or July why
would Apple do it at the end of 2012
they won't and they'll wait for the
beginning of 2013 to upstage CES just
like they did with their first iPad
announcement and in an even bolder
prediction if they even decide to launch
one I really think Apple standalone TV
will be Apple's first new product flop
in a long time this year really was the
year to buy a new LCD or plasma TV with
the prices being lower than ever and
people only replace their TVs maybe what
once every five to seven years and
that's being generous now if you already
spent around two grand on a 55 inch TV
are you going to buy an Apple TV one
year later I don't think so but maybe if
you're an old rich guy named Daddy
Warbucks we don't know a single fact
about the TV how will change the game
will it you Siri and even if it does
will that be enough all right on to
prediction number two Apple release a
new ipad iphone ipod imax macbook pros
and airs in 2012 see I told you I was
good but 2012 will be the last year we
see a Mac Pro and they'll transition to
a powerhouse iMac and eliminate the
tower completely from the product line
rumors are they've been holding back on
releasing the new Mac Pro this year as
they evaluate how profitable the
division is for them now they kill the
xserve for the same reasons and we're
saying 2012 is the last we'll see of the
mac pro ok prediction number 3 let's
just put out a few small ones together
and first up facetime will bring
multiple user chat in 2012 with all
FaceTime compatible devices it's
something that should happen with apps
like fring already doing it so I expect
to see that also we still want to see
blu-ray as a build-to-order option for
apple's mac line get this if they
haven't done it by now they aren't going
to
it and finally we'll get the iphone
we've all been waiting for the iphone
4gs all right calm down guys you know
what I'm talking about you know and I
know an iphone 5 with 4G LTE
compatibility and a bigger screen has to
come in 2012 especially since the
Samsung Galaxy Nexus is one impressive
looking phone it also come in white all
right on our show today we'd like to
introduce to you a special futuretelling
expert going to take on life's questions
that I have no answer for so it is with
great honor that I introduce you to the
