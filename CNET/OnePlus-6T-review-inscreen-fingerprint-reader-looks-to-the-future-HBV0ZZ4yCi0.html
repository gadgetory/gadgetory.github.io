official statements Chinese phone maker
oneplus finally unveiled its latest
flagship the oneplus 60 on the surface
the phone looks similar to its one plus
six predecessor which was only released
five months ago in May but there are
important differences first the 60 is a
first widely available phone in the US
to have an in screen fingerprint reader
so you can scan your fingerprint on the
front of the display
to unlock your lock screen meanwhile the
phone retains its thin bezels all around
since the sensor is embedded underneath
the screen now I haven't really noticed
any improvements in my day-to-day life
with this change and while the scanner
works fast enough in comparison it
doesn't appear to work as quickly as a
dedicated reader on the back of the
oneplus 6 because of the fingerprint on
display the 60 is also the first one
plus phone to abandon the headphone jack
if you already don't own a pair of
wireless headphones there's a dongle
included in the box as someone who likes
her wired headphones though the whole
move is kind of a drag but so it goes
third the phone's notch is smaller it's
now a less obtrusive teardrop shape
instead of a black tab if you still hate
the notch though you can blacken the
sides for a more traditional look lastly
for us customers the 60 is certified to
work on Verizon's Network even though
oneplus doesn't have any commercial
relationship with the carrier oneplus
also slightly improved the 60s camera
though all hardware specs remain the
same there's a new dedicated night mode
that supposedly captures better
low-light pictures oneplus claims the 60
also handles lighting better for
people's portraits the phone's battery
capacity has also been bumped up in our
preliminary lab tests the 60 lasted over
16 hours for continuous video playback
on airplane mode that's an improvement
to the 1 plus 6 is 15 and a half hour
average keep in mind that the 60 s
starting price is slightly more
expensive now because it's baseline
storage increased it now starts at five
hundred and forty nine dollars for six
gigs of RAM and 128 gigs of storage but
the highest 8 gig 256 gig tier still
costs six hundred and twenty-nine
dollars
overall the one +60 delivers notable new
changes to the oneplus line while
iterating on the already excellent one
plus six and including Verizon customers
is a step in the right direction to
expand the company's reach in the US if
you're looking for an affordable top
notch Android consider the 60 but if you
already have the six don't feel the need
to update especially if you want to hold
on to your headphone jack
