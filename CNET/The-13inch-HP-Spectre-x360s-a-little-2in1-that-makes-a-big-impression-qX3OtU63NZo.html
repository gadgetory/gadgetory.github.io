Spectre x-360 13-inch model is the
mini-me of its head-turning 15-inch
sister it is an excellent keyboard
without the layout gaps of the yoga 910
plus it doesn't make the connection
compromises it has two full capability
USBC thunderbolt ports in addition to
the single USB 3.1 type-a which can
charge your devices while the laptops
powered off you do lose the SD card slot
and the HDMI connection in the 15 to 13
inch down size that's par for the course
and it comes with a pleather sleeve
which has a slot for the bundled active
pen it's a nice perk if not as pretty as
the system of course the first question
you have to ask yourself when
considering either system would be do I
really want such a small 4k display I
find more pixels are better because it
makes the interface sharper and allows
for better zooming into photos but your
mileage may vary plus the 4k model we
tested comes with two big trade-offs
battery life and price its battery life
tests out to about 14% shorter than the
close to identical HD model we tested
this fall dropping from about nine point
five hours to eight as for price at
$1600 you're paying a two hundred and
fifty dollar premium for the 4k Beauty I
find the size is more comfortable to use
as a tablet than the larger models the
hinge has good tension and though I've
read complaints about position of the
speakers when in tent mode I had no
problems hearing the audio while
streaming video all night that way
windows did seem to get stuck in tablet
mode more than I liked but that's an
easy fix</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
