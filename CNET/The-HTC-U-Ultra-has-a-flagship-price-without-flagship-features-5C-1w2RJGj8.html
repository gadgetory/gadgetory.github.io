great phone if the year is 2014 but it's
not and instead the Chris display high
quality speakers and sharp design are
overshadowed by curious decisions to
omit key flagship features there's no
headphone jack no wireless charging and
no water resistance but it's not all bad
the reflective glass body makes this one
of the prettiest phones I've seen in a
long time and while it uses an older
Snapdragon 820 one processor I still
found performance to be fast what the
phone does have is a two-inch secondary
screen that can show notifications and
quickly launch apps the screen will also
show the time date and weather when the
main display is off but it's not always
on and instead it will only light up
when a notification comes in or if you
double tap it the you ultra is also the
first phone with HTC's new sense
companion app this smart virtual
assistant will give you updates on
traffic recommendations on restaurants
and other nearby attractions and provide
general usage tips to improve your
experience with the device but the phone
also comes with the Google assistant and
I found that to be a much better option
now despite not having a headphone jack
HTC does include a pair of us bc
headphones that can create a sound
profile based on the size of your ear
canal it's an interesting concept but I
really couldn't tell the difference and
if you do want to listen to your own
headphones you will need a special
adapter from HTC and only HTC because
they block third party ones from working
overall though the you ultra is a fully
capable device the display is gorgeous
the speakers are loud and the
fingerprint sensor is fast while the
camera won't win any awards it performs
fairly well but it's also one of the
biggest phones on the market and it's
incredibly difficult to hold and operate
with one hand and the secondary display
and smart assistant don't justify the
high price tag this would be a different
review of the phone costs four hundred
dollars but instead it's priced at the
top end of the market at seven hundred
fifty dollars and that's just too much
to pay for a device that sacrifices
so much for more information on the HTC
