in the smart speaker space just got
hotter it's a prizefight push out
between the apples home pods and the
google home max let's get it on round
one is design apple's home pod looks
like a lot of things it could be a roll
of toilet paper or a cat scratching post
but in the setting of a living room it
looks a nice it's like real nice and you
could pretty much put it anywhere it has
this hard spongy outside but it's screen
at the top for the siri rainbow swirl
you'll rarely ever see it and it's tap
tap tappy touch controls for volume
instead of elegantly moving around in a
circle to turn it up or down is a Miss
now the Google home max is a beast in
size that takes up more than twice the
space of a home pot and it just screams
at you saying I'm a big bad speaker it
also has a solid weight and a smooth
rounded design its touch and swipe
controls at the top are nicer to use and
I'm a fan of its visual cue through the
speaker when you're talking to it
both of these look great in person but
if I had to pick one just on looks
I'm giving around one to home pod and
your cats are probably gonna like that
too next round is sound
when I first played music from the home
pod I was impressed a full sound with
deep Basin boom that you would never
expect to come out of speaker this size
it really fills most rooms and sounds
great
then I put it up to the Google home max
and although the home max may not hit as
low its sound was more balanced with
clear highs and details and vocal tracts
that you can't get from the home pod now
at times the home pod sounded just a
little muddier compared to the Google
home max the sound quality of a speaker
you like tends to really match the
genres of music you listen to but after
putting them side-by-side I lean towards
the Google home max overall even if I
love my bass heavy tracks the other
thing to consider is the home pod
delivers full 360-degree sound and that
sound quality stayed consistent no
matter where you stood that's important
if this is being placed in the middle of
a room the Google home max sound quality
changes once you move to the side or
even behind it because it's only being
pushed out from one direction if it's
against the wall well you know what that
won't matter if I'm gonna kick back
dinner party I'm probably picking home
pot but if I'm using this to listen to
music on a daily basis I'm going Google
home max so you know what this round is
subjective we're calling it a tie next
up round three is the voice assistant
I don't need to tell you this but Siri
isn't even remotely close to the level
of the Google assistant sure they can
both do things like weather sports and
general knowledge well hold on hey Siri
tell me more about Bruce Lee Bruce Lee
is a town in West Baton Rouge Parish
Louisiana United States hey Google tell
me more about Bruce Lee according to
Wikipedia lee Jun fan known
professionally as Bruce Lee was a Hong
Kong and American actor film director
martial artist martial arts instructor
philosopher and founder of the martial
art Jeet Kune Do one of the wushu or
kung-fu styles now Google home supports
multiple users and can identify
individual voices and let them manage
their own calendar flights to-do lists
and more the home pot is limited to one
person and one person only to make
reminders notes and checking messages
now if you don't turn personal requests
off other people can access those apps
of yours as well so you would think both
these smart speakers can handle
calendars that's easy enough right hey
Google at my basketball game at 5 p.m.
on February 28th alright basketball game
on the 28th of February at 5:00 p.m. do
you want to save this yes ok it's on
your calendar hey Siri add my basketball
game at 5 p.m. on February the 28th I
can access your calendar here sorry
about that
nope the Google home is smarter because
it has the brains of Google inside it
you can string two commands together it
can dictate recipes and wait for you
step by step and even tune a freaking
guitar and we still haven't even touch
on all the other things it can do like
support different streaming music
services with your voice like Spotify
and Pandora or throw content onto a
chromecast connected to your TV the home
pod is really an Apple music speaker
with a Syria that's not even as smart as
the one in your iPhone Google takes
round three by a landslide next round at
the smart home
we're not trying to beat up on apple
here but you know what they're trailing
once again Apple does support smart
devices with everything ranging from
light bulb to switches and thermostats
but it's not long enough and they're
still missing key partners that have
established themselves a long time ago
got a nest thermostat or been part of
the nest ecosystem for years that's not
supportive oh how about the logitech
harmony hub they'll let you control your
home theater switch between inputs and
tell you to do things from watching TV
or play my ps4 that's not supporting
either home kid is improving and has
moved away from forcing partners to have
a physical Hardware chip for
authentication to a software based
system that brought on devices like Life
X and even more Wemo is finally
compatible with an additional $40 hub
that talks to all your Wemo devices and
home kid but Apple is still behind big
time round 4 goes to Google the final
round that decides it all is features
we know there's no bluetooth streaming
from any non iPhone to the home pod
you can't even set it up without an
iPhone running iOS 11 apples the honey
badger of Tech and they don't give a the
Google home max lets anyone stream to it
over Bluetooth if you're talking ports
the whole pod has no ports whatsoever
not deaf the home max has a mic mute
switch a USB C port and a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack where's the 3.5
millimeter jack on the home pod
I'm actually more mad at myself for even
asking the question you can stream music
services like Spotify and Pandora and
more to the home pod through airplay on
your phone but the Google home max has
native support directly from the speaker
the home max already supports using two
speakers for stereo sound and also
supports multi room audio on its launch
we're still waiting for the same
promises from the home pod in Apple's
AirPlay to in the final and another
brutal round this one goes to the goose
so let's break down all five rounds the
home pod jumped out early you can really
call round to a toss up but after that
the Google went on a tear taking the
next three rounds the Google home match
takes this battle and is your prize
fight winner Apple delivered with their
promise of great sound but there's more
to it than that for Smart speakers and
Cupertino they've got a whole lot of
catching up to do so what do you want
from a smart speaker ultimately the
final decision always comes down to you
i'm brian tong thanks for watching and
we'll catch you guys next time for
another prizefight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
