highly rated sound support wireless
earphones and you're left with sound
sport free the company's new totally
wireless earphones that come in two
color options and cost two hundred and
fifty dollars yes that price is $90 more
expensive than Apple's air pods which
have dominated the totally wireless
headphone market and the wireless
headphone market in general but the
sound sport free are a compelling
alternative to the air pods because they
fit securely and comfortably deliver
rich sound and are as easy to operate as
the air pods with almost flawless
wireless performance my only gripe is
the same one levelled at the sound sport
wireless the buds stick out rather
conspicuously
from your ears while they aren't
equipped with Apple's custom W one
Bluetooth chip bose claims that like the
air pods they'll deliver up to five
hours of battery life and the included
charging case provides two additional
full charges for up to ten additional
hours of battery life there's sweat
resistant with an ipx4 water resistance
rating and there's a new find my buds
feature on the bose connect app that
displays the last time in place they
were used to help locate them should
they get lost the integrated remote is
on the right gear bud and I didn't have
a problem skipping tracks forward and
raising and lowering volume you can also
use the multifunction button to answer
and end calls it's worth noting that
when making calls the sound only comes
out of the right ear bud but it does
work well as a mono headset these are
fuller sounding than the air pods
delivering more bass and letting in less
ambient noise thanks to the more sealed
off design of the included State year
plus sport tips which come in a few
different sizes in fact like the sound
sport Wireless the base is a little bit
accentuated and may seem too pronounced
and loose for some people when listening
indoors in a quiet environment but these
are designed to be used outside or at
the gym in noisy environments where you
can lose some based competing sounds so
they sound more balanced when you're
walking or running with them outside I
personally like the air pods but they
don't stay in my ears as securely as
they do for some people who can even run
with them without a problem if you're in
the same boat these are an excellent
totally wireless alternative they really
perform like the sound Sport Wireless
but leave off the cord that's hard
to do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
