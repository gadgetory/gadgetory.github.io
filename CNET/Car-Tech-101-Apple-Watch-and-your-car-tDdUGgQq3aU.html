suggest that less their watch well one
day replace the keys to your car and
that elaborate wireless remote we're not
quite there yet however even in these
early days we're seeing a fair number of
apps being offered by car makers and
other car technology companies to
hopefully make driving a little simpler
a little easier a little better
because you're wearing something smart
on your wrist BMW's i remote was the
first Apple watch car app we ever saw it
came out on the debut day of the watch
and it works with the company's eyeline
of highly electrified vehicles you can
do what is basically telematics that
you're used to on your phone but now on
your wrist check the charge of your car
lock the doors unlock the doors get
guidance back to where you parked it
precondition the climate you can do that
easily cuts an electric car doesn't
really need to start the engine or any
sense and you can also see how the
charge is going to map out to where you
might want to go the car will even
through that watch app suggest the best
time to leave to use the least
electricity to get there but again not
really anything you couldn't do on your
phone already
ditto for Porsches app which is the same
basic basket of telematics although it
works in a broader more conventional
array of their cars they apply it to
Cayenne makan and a few others as well
as their 918 hybrid supercar but we're
basically still in the telematics area
Hyundai's blue link app is actually on
Android first since that was the first
SmartWatch platform of any scale but as
of our show today it's still in the
process of being ported to Apple watch
now automatics a popular app you put on
your phone it talks to an obd to
wireless dongle you stick up under your
dash and it gives you all kinds of
information about your trips your
driving style for economy or safety also
where you park your car and which trips
you want to tag as expensable for
business now in terms of their watch app
they've chosen to keep things pretty
lean and taken just those last two
functions where's my car and tag this
trip as business expense and port those
to the watch as the primary functions
they can bring everything there they're
just not sure it all belongs here which
i think is good savvy restraint now pay
by phone is one of the class of
connected parking apps that lets you
check your status of the meter feed the
thing find parking spaces in some cases
of these apps it seems like a natural to
have on your wrist that's when you're
away from the car but you want to have a
very quick glanceable reminder that hey
your time is running out and perhaps you
can extend the time right from your ribs
now you don't have to buy a new car to
use Apple watch with it and on
telematics makers like Viper for example
know that porting their existing phone
apps to Apple watch is a sexy headline
allowing you to go to your wrist to
unlock precondition or get the location
alerts about your car that you already
can get on their phone app and command a
lot of these things by voice again not
new but different
okay a couple of organizing principles
to help you think about where the watch
fits in your driving first they have two
basic locations one is wall driving
glanceable on your wrist which tends to
already be up high and in your view
while you're driving tends to be good
ergonomics and keeps your gaze roughly
where it should be
if those notifications are worthwhile
the other area is of course out of the
car when you're away from the vehicle
and you need something to very quickly
and cleanly remind you that if you need
to get back to your car time running out
on your meter or an easy way to get back
to where your car is if you forgot where
you parked it or tell you if it's
charging or needs to be charged and then
you've got two competing areas of
platforms that are coming to compete
with other perhaps augment the watch and
that would be things like apple carplay
and android auto which are going to
bring a lot of this smartphone DNA to a
richer fixed display in the dash that is
better integrated with the car you've
also got to keep an eye on head-up
display which car makers are going
headlong to adopt and that can give you
an extremely elegant presentation of
information right where your glance
already is and should be
and again highly integrated to the
vehicle either way the watch is showing
some early legs for the driver but as
with most of its modes that it's
promising it is yet to promise that it
is better not just different from how
we're doing things now more car tech
