out has become all the rage and this is
the blue ant pump $130 Bluetooth sports
model it comes in a few different colors
including this green one that has a
transparent housing hi I'm David Carr
noise and let me tell you first what I
like about the pump for starters it
seems durable and is totally waterproof
so long as you have the gasket in place
covering the microUSB charging port
while Bluetooth doesn't transmit
underwater you could wear these in the
pool if you keep your head above water
they also have up to a hundred foot
range which is more than the typical 30
feet that Bluetooth offers and battery
life has tasted enough at around eight
hours the headphones housing is a nice
soft to the touch field to its finish
and the controls are well placed in the
right earpiece and can be operated
blindly the play/pause button doubles as
an answer end button and the volume
controls SS transport controls allowing
you to skip tracks forward and back by
double tapping them a microphone is
built into the unit which allows you to
use this as a stereo headset for making
calls the pump is an in-ear headphone
and the tips are designed to be really
jammed into your ears to get a tight
seal you do get various ear tips
including a foam set that allows more
sound to penetrate so you can hear
traffic around you when you're running
or biking and blue it also provides
these little snap-on stabilizers which
help keep the buds securely in your ears
overall I thought the headphones fit
well and didn't move around all when I
use them on a treadmill in the gym
however I did need to use the
stabilizers to get a tight seal and at
times the top of the stabilizers dug
into my ears a little I thought it would
have been nice had blue ant gone with a
slightly less rigid rubber if you do get
a tight seal there's plenty of base but
the headphone just doesn't sound all
that clear or refined I prefer the more
natural sound the Plantronics backbeat
fit but that model does have an open
design and lets in more ambient noise
for safety reasons all in all while the
pump has a few shortcomings it's an
appealing wireless sports headphone that
should work well for a lot of people
ideally it would cost a little less than
its list price of $130 but hopefully
will come down in price over time
I'm David Connelly and that's the blue
ant pump thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
