have several decisions to make this
holiday because there's a third iPhone
to join the other two the iPhone tennis
and tennis max are joined by the iPhone
R which is coming October 26th this
phone feels like a combination of the
eight eight plus generation with the
iPhone 10 so let's take a look at the
back of the iPhone 10 R there's a single
camera here not dual camera but supposed
to provide portrait effects that might
still look somewhat like the portrait
effects you would expect maybe not the
same as the 10s for the tennis max for
the 10 we'll have to see on the front
the 10 R has a true depth camera so it
looks like an iPhone 10 it's a 6.1 inch
display but it's LCD and that's differ
from the OLED displays on the 10s 10 s
Max and the 10 it's a new type of
display that's edge to edge and right
now it looks really sharp I mean apples
LCDs plays have always looked good so
I'll have to wait and see how those
compare side-by-side there's no 3d touch
so if you push in here you're not going
to be able to get those pop-out things
that you might or might not be using
instead there's a haptic response that's
still on the screen which will stand in
for something so if you notice the
camera is not launching but if I press
in I do feel I have to click and then I
open the camera so that's
pressure-sensitive it's just not exactly
the same as 3d touch maybe you're not
using 3d touch anyhow so your mileage
may vary on that the HPL processor in
here it sounds like it's going to be as
fast as the 10s and 10's max so
performance wise sounds really promising
and if those two get an hour and a half
and we're battery than the iPhone 8 plus
definitely 10 are at 7:49 still falls in
the mainstream to high end territory for
phones but that extra savings versus a
$9.99 iPhone 10s might be interesting to
some people
how well performs it how much you miss
any of those extra features we'll have
to see but this LCD display in this
light here looks good one thing it looks
like the 10r lacks some of the extra HDR
features that are on the 10s and 10's
max and how good that looks in terms of
display and in terms of photography
we're still going to have to see the
prices for this 7:49 and up for storage
you're looking at 64 gigabyte 128 256 on
the bottom
no headphone jack joining the others of
course lightning and it looks similar to
the iPhone 8 an A+ in terms of the
aluminum finish the 10 are also comes in
other colors so if you want to pop this
out to go coral blue yellow project red
those are available as well in addition
to white and black do you get this phone
we don't know yet because it's coming
out October 26 and the real comparison
is going to be which iPhone do you get
but the feel is good the size feels very
iPhone 8 plus s and the display while
it's a lower resolution than the 10 s
Max and the 10 it's a pretty good dpi so
it still looks strong more to come on
that but your iPhone decision still
looms
