with electrodes shows the electrical
activity in the heart so that's an
electrical sensing technology so these
chest straps essentially have an EKG
lead right over the chest so it's the
same technology so we would generally
expect that to work very well where as
an optical sensor is not near your heart
and it's not sensing the electrical
activity within your within your heart
it's sensing the flow of blood through
your capillaries one pulse per each
heartbeat
in the beginning when these wristbands
came out they were essentially glorified
pedometers now we're seeing them
incorporate heart rate monitoring I
should be able to get a continuous heart
rate from this guy so far resting this
seems to be pretty accurate but we
should see how it does when I get my
heart rate up how was your so right now
my chest strap is sending signals to the
vivofit and it's reading 175 wow that's
spot on
that's pretty dead-on for this one it
comes in a clip and an armband so you
would have it on your waist then you
would take out the pulse okay so there's
the heart now I have to place my finger
over this optical sensor here so the
pulse o 2 is telling me I'm at 93 beats
per minute our EKG is about 50 points
above that at 146 so we know that's not
only not accurate it's way off our next
contender is the bassist carbon steel
and this one liked a lot of the wearable
heartrate monitors is an on-demand heart
rate monitor so you'll have to cue it up
to let you know what your heart rate is
I'm trying to get the heart rate right
now but it's not working and I wonder if
it just can't tolerate any movement
whatsoever okay we should stop and see
if maybe it's because I'm moving around
too much so I'm still trying to get my
heart rate it's all the way up to 170
and it's still not getting it
yeah it's about 130 by the old fashioned
pulse rate - and you do have a perfectly
strong wrist ball so
okay so sure what the problem is doc
says 130 carbon steel says 86 that's a
no-go for us here we've got the Samsung
gear fit and this one has an optical
sensor so when I enable the heart rate
monitor a light will illuminate my
capillaries and then a sensor will see
how often the blood is pumping is that
right Dawg okay so here we go I'm gonna
put it on first get my resting heart
rate okay I've got 110 the EKG says well
at the time it said 117 right now we're
going to simulate what it would be like
to exercise and then pause to get your
heart rate because this one won't let
you measure while you're in action let's
see how it performs when my heart rate
is really up so it's still unable to
measure a couple minutes have passed
since I stopped exercising when my heart
rate was up at 180 now it's down to
about 128 so we'll see if that helps the
fit measure my heart rate the gear fit
says 104 it finally got my reading but
the EKG says 141 so that's way too far
off our last contender is the Galaxy s5
and this one has a built-in heart rate
monitor right here on the back it's an
optical sensor it's kind of a wild card
lots of people think it's a gimmick but
now we can actually put it to the test
and see if maybe it's accurate I
launched the app I'll hit start and the
light illuminates my finger so it's
measuring right now it's asking me to
keep still and be quiet so I won't talk
anymore
150 EKG says 147 that's that's not bad
at all
right away all right I'll get my app out
start my finger can you see the red
light there all right 190 over there
193 excellent so far that's the fastest
and the most accurate and it's on the
phone now that's really inconvenient if
you're exercising the last thing you
want to do is carry around a phone this
large that's really the point of these
wearable devices but if you want a
pretty accurate reading that's pretty
dead-on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
