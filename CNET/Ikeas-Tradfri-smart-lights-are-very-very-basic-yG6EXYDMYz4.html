all the way through an entire IKEA you
might have noticed that one of the last
sections you walk through is all about
lighting and now you'll find smart
lighting options - IKEA calls it the
trod free line of smart lighting
products and you've got a couple of
different ways in big one is this smart
lighting kit that cost eighty dollars
it's got a hub two bulbs that change
between white light color temperatures
and a little remote gizmo that we
actually couldn't get to work despite
trying multiple batteries with it so
that was kind of a letdown the system
worked fine and was easy enough to use
but it's very very basic it feels cheap
the app seems cheap it doesn't work with
anything you can't use a LexA or home
kit or anything with these bulbs they're
just an isolated IKEA smart home eco
system that said I'm actually much more
enthusiastic about the less expensive
ways into the Trodd free system this one
that comes with a bulb and a motion
sensor you just pair the motion sensor
by holding a button and holding it next
to the bulb and then you can set using
little dials on the back how long it
takes to turn the light off after
detecting motion and turning it on
really easy very simple way to automate
a lamp in your bedroom or in your home
and it only cost $25 for the kit that's
a good deal it's about as cheap as
you'll find for a motion sensor and
smart bulb and if you wanted to add in
that tried free gateway later to add in
the app you could do that too the other
option that's kind of interesting is
even less expensive it's this $20 kit
that comes with a smart bulb and a
little magnetic remote accessory it's
just a wireless gizmo that you twist in
order to dim the light up and down it's
a little finicky it's not as precise as
I would like if nothing else maybe the
next time you're out at IKEA buying a
new bookshelf or entertainment center
you'll toss one of these 20 or $25 kits
into your car to sort of an add-on I
think there's nothing wrong with that
it's a good way to sort of try out smart
lighting in your home a little IKEA
