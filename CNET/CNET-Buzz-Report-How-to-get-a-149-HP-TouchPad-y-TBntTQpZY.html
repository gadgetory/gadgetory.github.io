to the buzz report the show about the
tech news that everyone is talking about
this week it's children and
revolutionaries on facebook plus a few
kiddies here and there plus the HP
TouchPad is back from the dead again
again but first it's the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is actually
a gadget of the week update a couple of
weeks ago we reported on the awesome
sounding new Galaxy Nexus running
android 4.0 much but I was nervous that
at the time of the announcement there
wasn't any release date or pricing
information danger and sure enough there
were reports this week that the Galaxy
Nexus release might be delayed in the
u.s. until after Thanksgiving it's
supposedly coming out november
seventeenth in europe but it's now a
little unclear what's happening
stateside uh-huh see Android is always
late I am NOT waiting on that guy
anymore that is it droid razr all the
way and now for the news a recent survey
found that there are millions of
underage children on Facebook and that
many parents are helping their kids lie
to get on the site The Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act says websites
can't collect personal information on
kids under 13 without verifiable
parental consent but studies showed that
a huge majority of parents are willing
to help their kids get on facebook
mainly in order to stay in touch with
them and because let's be honest
invading kids privacy is pretty much
exactly what parents want to do and
Facebook has that down to a science
google released a gmail app for iphone
this week which got everyone all excited
except that when it first appeared it
was a total buggy bomb that was so bad
google had to yank it from the app store
and even once it was working properly it
still seems pretty limited like you can
only have one gmail account on it at a
time and everyone was shocked that
Google would put out such a crappy app
for the iPhone because apparently
everyone forgot that Google has android
the app is a trap speaking of iphone
reports about the iphone 4 s's terrible
battery life had been rolling in since
its
you send as usual when something was
terribly wrong with a new iPhone Apple
wasn't saying a word actually a genius
at the apple store in New York City told
CNET zone david carr know that he needed
to turn off his iphone 4s more often
because the battery was stressed it
turns out that the battery does not need
a spa trip after all Apple finally
issued a statement this week saying iOS
5 bugs are the problem and that it will
issue a software fix in a few weeks the
company didn't offer any other tips for
extending battery life in the meantime
but maybe there's something to that
stress thing you never know just turn it
off and now it's time for a little
segment I like to call back from the
dead after the extremely popular $99
fire sale for the HP TouchPad best buy
has decided to revive the lust for the
HP zombie pad by offering it for just a
hundred and forty-nine dollars this
holiday season great oh but there's a
string attached you have to buy an HP or
compaq computer to get the deal yeah a
new computer is a string that's actually
not a string attached to the new
touchpad that's a new computer attached
to it no thanks and now let's have a
look at what's clogging the tubes the
occupy movement is officially clogging
the tubes for one thing every single
person I know is posting about it
constantly on Facebook but also it seems
like these days Facebook and Twitter and
YouTube seem to exist half for cute
kitty pictures and half for organizing
global protests in fact get this
protesters in Egypt staged a rally last
week to support occupy protesters in
Oakland California after police they're
cracked down pretty violently on their
makeshift camp now that never would have
happened without the internet also if
Egypt thinks that your crackdown is a
little harsh that's kind of bad I'm just
saying Egypt they're all damn they got
some hardcore cops in Oakland plus the
protest seem to be working as a
this week several US senators were
seeking to overturn citizens united that
supreme court ruling that gave
corporations the power to contribute
pretty much as much as they want to
elections good start from Arab Spring to
American spring brought to you by the
power of the Internet and that's the
buzz report for this week everyone I'm
Hollywood and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
