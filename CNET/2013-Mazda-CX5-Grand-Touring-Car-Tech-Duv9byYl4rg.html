to argue that things have gotten a bit
stale over at Mazda I mean the Miata is
almost ten years old
the cx-7 and the cx-9 have dashboard
experiences that are probably older than
that and let's face it nobody really
liked that big goofy grin that's on all
of their current models so in many ways
the cx-5 is an opportunity for Mazda to
totally reinvent itself with a new model
that has a new design language a whole
new dashboard experience and a new
skyactiv engine technology that helps it
to get a bit more efficiency I'm Antoine
Goodwin with cnet.com let's take a look
at this 2013 cx-5 Grand Touring and see
what it's all about
underneath the cx-5 s hood and powering
the front wheels is a new skyactiv-g
gasoline-powered engine the 2-liter
four-cylinder mill now we're usually not
fans of plastic engine covers but I mean
the blue paint on this one that
indicates that this is a SKYACTIV model
is almost lickable that's not really the
important part though what is important
is how the direct injection technology
in here helps this engine to get 155
horsepower and 150 pound feet of torque
now that's not a lot of power but
outright power isn't the SKYACTIV game
what we're looking for here is
efficiency a combination of lightweight
materials used throughout the vehicle
low friction components in the engine
and a couple of aerodynamic tweaks
helped the cx-5 to get a fuel economy
rating from the EPA of 26 in the city 32
on the highway now you can add an
all-wheel drive system for a bit more
sure-footedness at the expense of a
couple of mile per gallon in each
category or you can step down to the
decon tinted cx-5 sport model which uses
a six-speed manual transmission to get
about three more mouths per gallon on
the highway for total of 35
now our cx-5 is a Grand Touring model
that means most of the tech in the cabin
is actually going to come standard that
basically includes this 5.8 inch color
touch screen and of course a nine
speaker Bose audio system in a full
cachet of digital audio sources USB
connectivity with iPod playback you also
got an auxilary input for analog
playback there is Sirius XM satellite
radio and of course HD radio and
bluetooth for hands-free calling and
audio streaming now the Bluetooth audio
streaming is a bit wonky it seems like
it only really wants to play back when
the player or audio source that you're
listening to displays metadata check
this out
we've got our Android phone right here
and right now we're on the stock audio
player that shows metadata now if I jump
over to Spotify and start playing
something there it stops I can jump back
to the standard audio player picks back
up again and then finally Pandora you
get nothing like nothing of course your
phone may report metadata on all of the
apps and I hope that's what works for
you the navigation system in Mazdas used
to be so bad that we'd often find
ourselves telling you just skip the
whole thing and get a Garmin or a TomTom
seems like even Mazdas taking that
advice these days because they've
switched over to a TomTom powered
navigation system give that automaker a
couple extra hundred bucks and they'll
get you the Grand Touring tech package
which amongst other things get you this
SD card reader down here and a little SD
card that's filled up with TomTom map
data this navigation system benefits
from tom toms excellent IQ routing
software which basically takes into
account their HD traffic service to give
you the fastest most efficient route
between 82 points
that basically means that a trip from
home to work at 9:00 a.m.
may yield a different route from the
same trip planned at 11:00 a.m. or even
5:00 p.m. based on historic and current
traffic trends
so around town the Mazda cx-5 is a
little bit rougher than other vehicles
in its class that a little bit of extra
roughness kind of gives you the illusion
that the car would have some sort of
really good road handling chops and I
mean that about regular around town you
know zipping down an off-ramp you know
quickly cutting around a corner type
speed it's not bad now the biggest
problem that I think a lot of people are
going to have on their first outing with
the cx-5 is that well under fifty five
horsepower doesn't sound like a lot on
paper and it's not a lot of horsepower
in practice you're going to have a hard
time just hanging onto 50 mile an hour
without really dropping down into fourth
or fifth gear but the six-speed
Automatic transmission actually isn't
that bad I mean aside from a tendency to
jump all the way up six gear thereby
leaving you out of the power band when
you do actually need it to give you a
little bit of extra get up and go it is
happy to downshift and it'll drop down
into fifth if you give it just a little
bit extra gas you know for those
situations where you need to go up hill
and those shifts are crisp and quick not
really smooth and sluggish and you loose
like you will in a lot of other
transmissions the 2013 cx-5 starts at
twenty thousand six hundred ninety five
dollars for the basic sport model with
its manual transmission that's going to
get you the best fuel economy now if
you're even thinking about getting half
of the check that's available on this
car go ahead and skip the Touring trim
level and jump straight to Grand Touring
which is going to get you all of that
for twenty seven thousand forty five
dollars then go ahead and add one
thousand three hundred and twenty-five
dollars for the tech package which gets
you the TomTom navigation and HID
headlights
