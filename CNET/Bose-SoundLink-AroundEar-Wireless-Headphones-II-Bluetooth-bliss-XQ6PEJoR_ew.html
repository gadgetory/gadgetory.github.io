headphone available today well that's a
tough question to answer but at least
Bose is saying this is it the sound link
around your wireless headphone to those
did have an earlier around your wireless
headphone tae 2w which had a somewhat
awkward looking bluetooth dongle
attached to it but as you can see there
are no dolls with this model everything
is integrated and the headphone comes in
black or white for $279.99
as you might expect from a bose
headphone it is a very comfortable fit
and relatively lightweight design with
plush memory foam equipped ear cups the
controls are integrated into the right
ear Cup and easy to operate by feel the
headphone folds flat to fit in its
included carrying case which has a
pocket to store the USB charging cable
and a headphone cable to use in case the
battery dies and you want to listen to
the headphones in Wired mode that cable
doesn't have an integrated microphone
but the headphone does it has dual mics
in fact and it works well as a wireless
headset for making calls battery life is
rated for 15 hours which is quite decent
and as a quick charge mode that gives
you 2 hours of battery life with just 15
minutes of charging like I said it's
pretty hard to definitively declare a
best sounding wireless headphone because
everybody's ears and audio tastes are
different but what I will say is that
this is one of the best sounding
Bluetooth headphones currently available
the sound is clean and well balanced
with ample but not overpowering bass
you're not going to get that little bit
of extra Christmas and sparkle that you
get from a really good pair of wired
headphones but Bose tends to focus on
delivering smooth pleasant sound and
these certainly fit that sound profile
the company's sound like on ER bluetooth
headphone also sounds good but you get
slightly fuller more open sound with
this model for those waiting for bose to
do an active noise-cancelling wireless
headphone this isn't it
but at least you get a decent amount of
passive noise isolation from the around
the ear design I'm David karna from
