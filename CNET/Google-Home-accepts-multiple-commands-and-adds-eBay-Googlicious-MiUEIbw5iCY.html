welcome to Google issues for everything
Google you can think of now it hasn't
been officially announced at the time of
our recording but we expect the release
of android 8.1 to be available for
android owners to update this week
now it's an incremental update to
Android Oreo with new features like
unlocking the pixel visual core for
better photos with third-party apps and
other optimizations and fixes including
a corrected hamburger emoji with the
cheese on top of the meat patty finally
now there's a corrected beer mug that's
now filled all the way with the foam on
top instead of halfway with foam which
made no sense and the cheese emoji that
previously had a line through the holes
in the cheese it's fixed so totally
worth the update now the new 1 + 5 t
phone is getting some good press after
was found to have the fastest charging
times out of any phones with USB C
adapters on the market beating out the
LGB 30 and the iPhone 8 and 10 the chart
it just says it all after 30 minutes of
charging the 1+5 team reached a 59
percent charge and after an hour it
maintained its fast charging status with
a 93 percent charge
good job oneplus alright Star Wars the
last Jedi hype is about to hit an
all-time high over the next week and a
half you know what's coming and the 1 +
5 T is also offering a really cool
exclusive paint job and unique colors
for the software in line with the last
Jedi now the phone will go on sale on
December the 14th but pretty much none
of us will be able to get it because it
will be exclusive to India bad job
oneplus like I wasn't gonna get one
anyways alright lots of Google home news
let's start with the bad and worth to
the good stuff reports say a Google home
subreddit and Product Forums
claim that the Google home Mini has an
issue where the Mini just completely
reboots when music is playing on it and
the volume is turned up too high
that's a Boogle now the exact level when
the reboot occurs is unclear but songs
played at full volume often result in
this error and it's something that
Google needs to fix
especially when it's one of the steals
of the holiday season at 29 bucks a pop
now Google home products are getting
some really cool new features
- it can now accept multiple commands at
once so you can say something like hey
Google turn off the bedroom and turn off
the living room now my smart home peeps
know how useful this is going to be it
doesn't work on phones just yet
plus you know it's a little picky right
now and doesn't work with a home command
and a chromecast command together but
you know what it's a start and you
should all check it out
and eBay has just jumped on board with
the Google assistant and home to find
the price for items on eBay so here
check out this video clip they're
showing off as a demo and it will even
narrow down options for you like I use
eBay a lot and this is just an awesome
feature that will then send the final
listing to your phone to check out so
it's pretty sweet as well and if you're
waiting on the Google home max a Best
Buy listing earlier on leaked that
December the 11th would be the release
date for the speaker now retails at 399
I heard an early version of it at a
Google pop up experience and reps kept
on telling me it was an early version
because I wasn't really impressed with
the deep bass and even its touch
controls were buggy and not working at
the time I still have high hopes for it
and we're expecting it before the end of
the year this timing would make sense
and check this out a recent teardown of
Google photos 3.10 has revealed that
object removal is indeed coming - the
Photos app thanks to Google's computer
vision CEO sundar pichai demoed it at
Google i/o 2017 saying it would be
coming very soon and they use an example
of a fence in front of a person being
able to be completely removed code has
shown references to this coming soon
including 4k capture in the photo app
which is a little odd faster processing
thanks to the GPO and a new themed movie
option that would be different from the
current one and the Santa Tracker app is
back and updated for 2017 with 24 days
of games and activities now you'll have
the obvious Santa tracker and there's
other fun things to do including a
minigame where you can fly around the
world and take elfies with famous
landmarks so go check it out it's
available on android right now as well
as Chrome and iOS all right that's gonna
do it for this week you can email me at
Google Isha's at cnet.com or tweet me at
Brian Tong they torture watch it will
catch all next time for some more of
that Google issues
