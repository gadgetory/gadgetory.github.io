everything Google that we can pack
inside of a show Mobile World Congress
is here after we've been teasing you
about at the past few weeks and a
bajillion things have been announced but
the two standouts for me came from LG
and Samsung now really the most
innovation has to go to LG with the LG
g5 sure it's super sleek unibody design
stands out but the g5 looks to be the
first modular phone that will actually
be available worldwide we saw everything
from the LG Chem plus accessory for
physical camera controls that also adds
battery juice to the hi-fi Plus that's a
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen digital to analog audio
converter they even showed off their own
LG 360 VR headset that connects to the
phone and the LG rolling bot that can be
used as a toy for people and pets for
video surveillance and can even interact
with smart home devices now Samsung
finally packed everything you can think
of into their s7 and s7 edge with the
most refined galaxy to date with a touch
pressure sensitive screen ip68
waterproofing that protects it for 30
minutes underwater and even better
camera with lower megapixels but better
focus and image quality and most
importantly better battery life and the
return of the micro SD card slot now if
you're a galaxy fan this is arguably the
most complete phone on the market to
date and if you order between February
23rd of March 18th you'll get a free
gear VR headset as well which leads us
to this the other trend for Mobile World
Congress virtual reality and 360 cameras
now LG released one of their own with
the LG 360 cam and Samsung announced the
gear 360 each one includes two
180-degree cameras that stitch a single
360 image together with software now 360
content is getting its big push right
now right alongside the push for VR and
you don't even need a VR headset to
enjoy this stuff and really 360 content
is pretty much my favorite thing in tech
right now and I can't wait to see it
explode also at MWC ACC announced their
vibed VR system will officially go on
sale in April but is taking pre-orders
on February the 29th for the price of
$7.99 now the vibe will also support
incoming call notifications and
answering from Android and iOS phones
Android phones also deserve some love in
this show and the Android based cyanogen
OS is launching a new platform they are
calling mod this is not to be confused
with the CyanogenMod but this new mod
platform will allow deeper integration
of apps and services that have otherwise
been off bounds for a while in the OS
you'll be able to get Skype integration
for Colleen access to Microsoft's
Cortana or instagrams hyperlapse will be
accessible right inside the normal
camera function now this new mod
platform is expected to roll out with
users with a cyanogen OS 13 update
that's coming next month and in a
development that might have the biggest
impact on all of our devices in the
future california-based semiconductor
company Anna logics semiconductor
announce their new chip that will enable
4k video at 60 frames per second output
through USB C and will work with any
future smartphone or tablet really the
biggest application for this is a
no-brainer virtual reality which we've
already seen everyone jumping onboard
but it can also be used for big-screen
TV output as well and C I know you just
can't wait for a future that looks just
like this it looks amazing
alright that's gonna do it for this week
you can email us at Google is just at
cnet.com or tweet me at brian tom thanks
for watching we'll catch you all next
time for some more of that Google issues
