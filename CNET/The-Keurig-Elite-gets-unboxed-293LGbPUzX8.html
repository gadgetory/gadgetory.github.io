Buy get the right gift at the right
price all at your ultimate holiday
showroom this is a pretty big box and
inside is something that might kick up
your caffeine addiction we're unboxing
the Keurig elite b48 and it's time to
rip this thing open doesn't my coffee
more packaging not eco-friendly we've
got a cute little welcome book with lots
of instructions
hopefully brewing coffee is not
complicated Oh a variety pack No
they did not make this easy for me
here we go
Wow
I'm going to have to leave the recycling
man a note our Keurig elite oh and this
thing is pretty it's got that glossy and
matte look let's see how this thing
works here is where your K Cups go one
at a time we've got the drip pan for the
water aha so there's our water reservoir
which is great because you don't have to
fill it up every time you want a cup of
coffee okay so on this side of the
machine we've got some sort of alert
system so here tells you to add water
tea ting an auto-off button that's great
and then three cup sizes okay so the K
cups that they've provided are right
here look how cute they are
my one complaint though would be that
this is kind of a waste you're throwing
away plastic at least once a day but
nothing beats the convenience of this so
we've got our water filter some
step-by-step instructions here it looks
like you probably have to soak it and
rinse it
this will need to soak and then this guy
looks like oh that's kind of neat it has
a little tool that tells you when it's
time to replace it so it looks like this
guy kind of goes in here yeah all right
and now we finally get to try this thing
it already smells good let's see what it
tastes like oh that's good
and it's hot so convenient through the
coffee in under a minute after the
warm-up plus I've got all these other
flavors to try from so for coffee lovers
Keurig elite pretty good pick</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
