phones have trickled into the market in
recent months and Jabra has entered the
zero wire frame with its $250 elites or
Wireless sports air buds what makes the
elite sports so elite for starters the
buds are fully sweat and waterproof
there's also an integrated heart rate
monitor that provides it in your fitness
analysis and as you'd expect from a
Jabra headphone they work well as a
headset for making calls with built-in
noise reduction technology according to
Jabra the earbuds analyze external
sounds and automatically switch to the
earbud with the least amount of
background noise what impressed me most
about these guys was their ability to
maintain a steady hiccup free connection
and stay in my ears while I was running
they also sound decent you'll have to
try out a few of the various tips and
fins that Jabra provides before you
settle into a fit you're satisfied with
on the downside they are somewhat beefy
and while they should fit most people's
ears pretty well and fairly comfortably
due to their size in the shape of my ear
I didn't find them super comfortable
like competing products battery life
isn't great they're rated at just three
hours of music listening but it's easy
to get extra juice by slipping them into
their charging case which has an
integrated battery that gives you two
additional charges you can use the
headphones with your favorite iOS and
Android running and fitness apps but
Jabra has its own training management
app called Jabra sport life that's good
too and gives you in your coaching and
feedback I'm not going to do a deep dive
into all the fitness aspects of this
headphone but I will say this is one of
the stronger early entries in the
totally wireless headphone arena it's
not without a small flaws it could be
slightly more comfortable the battery
life could be better and the price could
be lower but they do work surprisingly
well
and hardcore athletes will appreciate it
they have a three year warranty it gets
failure due to sweat oh and if you lose
one but Jabra will give you a good deal
on a replacement bud or so the folks
there told me I'm David Carr now for
cnet.com that's the Jabra elite sport
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
