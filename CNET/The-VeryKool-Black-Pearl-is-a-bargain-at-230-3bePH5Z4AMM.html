is a first look at the very cool black
pearl if you never heard a very cool
before you're not alone the brand hails
from San Diego based company info sonics
which makes affordable unlock phones
that can be used nearly anywhere in the
world it's premium model the Black Pearl
costs two hundred and thirty dollars but
doesn't sacrifice a lot for that price
this Android handset has an all black
exterior and smooth matte rounded back
cover size-wise it's about as big as the
samsung galaxy s4 but not as thin it
weighs five and a half ounces which
gives it enough has to feel sturdy in
your hands remove the back cover to
reveal the battery microSD and full size
dual sim card slots you have to take out
the battery to swap out any of the cards
which is a huge minus in my book there's
a volume rocker on the left side of the
phone which has raised nubs that are
easy to press on top you'll find the
power button and headphone jack on the
bottom there's a micro USB port for a
budget phone the Black Pearl has a nice
screen the 4.7 inch diagonal HD 1280 by
720 display looks crisp colorful and
bright it's also easy to read in direct
sunlight the phone is running Android 42
jelly bean and while it looks like a
vanilla version of the OS it has a few
modifications one of them allows you to
pop out a web page from the browser into
a smaller window that can hang out over
your home screen or other apps very cool
also included a few third-party apps
such as a notepad a video player and an
advanced setup app where you can manage
the SIM cards in the phone there's an
eight megapixel camera on the back with
an LED flash while it has auto and
manual focus the camera struggles to
take clear close-up shots wide landscape
photos and indoor portraits turn out
better the camera can also record 1080p
HD video which looks sharp inside the
phone is packing a 1.2 gigahertz
processor which is slightly smaller than
competing phones but still performs well
opening apps feels fast the black pearl
handles mobile games well it doesn't
have support for LTE so depending on
your carrier browsing websites and
downloading apps can be slow but this
has something to do a processor the very
cool black pearl may not have
top-of-the-line up-to-date specs but at
two hundred and thirty dollars it's a
great value for its price
if you're in the market for a
budget-minded smartphone it's definitely
worth a look you can read my full review

been a first look at the very cool black
pearl</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
