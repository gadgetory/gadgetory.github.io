super fast and packed with features
chrome is the no-brainer choice to get
you started here are five super useful
tips first use tab syncing this is a
feature where if you're browsing on your
desktop you can pick up exactly where
you left off on your mobile device so to
do that the first thing you want to do
is to sign into Chrome with your Google
account on your desktop browser then
when you head to your phone go on over
to the menu button and hit other devices
the browser will ask you to log in and
from there you'll see this list of other
devices and which tabs you have open on
them in that same menu you have two
other super useful options the first is
request desktop site this is great
because sometimes on mobile optimized
web sites you lose some content so hit
that and you'll see the full desktop
version of the website this second
option here is new incognito tab when
you're browsing incognito none of your
history is saved and when you close that
tab all of your cookies will be deleted
so you're totally under cover now here's
another one that you might only discover
by accident gestures there are two types
in Chrome the first is the one that
allows you to move between tabs by just
swiping on the edge of your screen now
the second one is in this tab view here
you can close tabs by just swiping them
away
and finally a truly convenient feature
pre-loading web pages you can find it by
going to your settings then swiping down
to bandwidth here you have two options
the first is to have it on only when
you're connected to Wi-Fi so it doesn't
eat into your data plan and the second
is to have it on always which is my
choice because I really like to save
time alright with these tips you should
be well on your way to mastering Chrome
but if you have any questions or tips of
your own hit me up on Twitter and check
out how to see Netcom for the written
guide to this tutorial for cnet.com I'm
