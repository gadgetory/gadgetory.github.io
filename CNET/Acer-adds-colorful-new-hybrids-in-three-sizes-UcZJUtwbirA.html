of you back to school hybrids from low
end to high end we're going to take a
look at some of them right now one of
asians new hybrids is this guy it's the
Aspire r11 if this sort of style looks
familiar it's because you've seen a lot
of these fold back hybrids we call them
that can fold into a tablet shape or
stop in kind of a kiosk mode or flip
back to a traditional clam shell laptop
this is going to be you know a lower end
model 1366 x 768 screen pentium or
celeron processors but of course it is a
touchscreen and is covered with Gorilla
Glass so it should be pretty sturdy
that's going to come July for about two
hundred and fifty dollars now this is a
more premium hybrid to see switch 11v
you know it's got metal construction
it's got an IPS screen again gorilla
glass and like the other switch systems
it's got a magnet that keeps the two
parts together I find this is probably
the best way to do a pull apart hybrid
with a magnet stuff like a physical
latch much like apples 12-inch MacBook
and a couple of other small slim systems
we've seen lately it's going to run
Intel's Core M processor although we
don't have the price or release date
just now on the less expensive end is
the switch 10 it's a 10 inch version
comes in a couple of different colors
it's also got that gorilla glass screen
this one runs an intel atom and again
the magnetic hinge here which i think is
a definitely the easiest way to detach
and reattach a hybrid hinge this guy is
coming in july starting at 279 acer also
has a slightly more upscale switch that
mimics one of my favorite acer laptop
the Aspire s7 and that model like this
one had this gorilla glass overlay on
the back of the lid it made for a very
slick sophisticated look now you can get
it in a switch 10 now this machine also
has an intel atom processor and a 1920 x
1200 resolution like the other switches
of course you've got that magnetic hinge
i like so much this guy should be
available in august for around four
hundred dollars
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
