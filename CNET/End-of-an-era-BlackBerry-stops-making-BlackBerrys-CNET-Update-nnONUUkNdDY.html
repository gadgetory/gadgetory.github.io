announced it will no longer make its own
phones the announcement is a nail in the
coffin for the long struggling Canadian
company instead of building hardware
blackberry said it's gonna save money by
relying on other companies to design
build and sell the devices but
blackberry already started backing away
from building phones
the most recent blackberry phone the D
Tech 50 it was actually made by Alcatel
and it ran Android it just had some
BlackBerry apps pre-loaded on it and
before that was the BlackBerry Prive a
high-end Android phone with a slide-out
keyboard and some extra security
features but that also failed to take
off long ago blackberry was the king of
phones for a mobile white-collar
workforce in the early 2000s its
keyboard was what made people fall in
love with the brand to the point where
fans call themselves CrackBerry addicts
over time of course it was dethroned by
the iPhone and Google's Android phones
just think back two years after the
iPhone came out blackberry made up 1/5
of the mobile phone market today it's a
fraction of 1% that's according to
Gartner as for now blackberry is not
going away completely
the company says instead it's gonna put
all of its focus on software there still
could be some value in the BlackBerry
brand when it comes to security
applications such as ways for big
businesses to manage email that's it for
