four G's get ready for foam tastic
episode I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update the windows phone 8
operating system will come to new
Windows Phones this fall but if you
already own a windows phone you won't be
getting this upgrade so if you bought a
nokia lumia 900 yeah i guess you were
just a beta tester for the windows phone
8 system it's because the upgrades
require phones to have better hardware
like multi-core processors with built-in
support for NFC the next system will
also have Nokia's mapping technology
maps are becoming a new battleground for
mobile phones but there is one update
coming to older Windows Phones the new
look to the home screen live tiles now
you can cram more moving spinning tiles
into one space with a new smaller size
option if you're into that sort of thing
you can still keep things looking simple
if you like the samsung galaxy s3 is
landing thursday at Sprint and t-mobile
it's the hot new android phone that will
soon be available at all major US phone
carriers I have one here from sprint
it's Samsung's follow-up to the flagship
galaxy s2 the best selling Android phone
oh 2011 lots of goodies packed in
android 4.0 a strong 8 megapixel camera
Samsung did try to take on Cirie with
his own voice controls but well be sure
to check out the full review to see how
it compares if you're watching the cnet
interactive player just click the link
over there verizon speedy 4G LTE network
has long been the largest LTE network
and it's still growing verizon added 46
more 4g markets and an improved coverage
in 22 existing areas now let's just see
if anyone still wants to pay for it
after verizon rolls out those new family
share plans on jun 28th i got tons of
comments from viewers about the new
plans and people are not happy i present
i have an iphone 4 with an unlimited
data plan and I'm not too crazy about
this tiered pricing that verizon's
coming out with so my idea was to buy
and unsubsidized iphone 5 and keep my
unlimited data plan but trying to buy
that on a teacher salary thanks yeah
that's one way to bypass the new
and just by a phone at full price or if
you're due for an upgrade do so before
next week and you'll be able to hang on
to that old unlimited data plan for
another two years and today's appt to
watch is wazi a free app for iOS and
Android that helps you avoid bad traffic
jams it's now added in gas prices and it
will give you directions to the cheapest
gas stations wozy is free because it
relies on users to submit data about
prices and traffic that's your tech news
update for today for more on the stories
