a soccer mom its self-driving car has
morphed into a chrysler pacifica minivan
thanks to a new partnership with Fiat
Chrysler this is the first time that
Google has worked directly with a car
company even though the existing
self-driving vehicles look like the
regular versions you'd see on the road
they include a toyota prius lexus rx450h
and the adorable bubble car prototype
100 vehicles equipped with the
self-driving system will be designed and
manufactured in michigan and the first
few are expected to hit the road at the
end of the year minivans might not be
the coolest cars around but they
certainly are practical google said the
design will let them test a larger
vehicle it's easier for passengers to
enter an exit thanks to the hands-free
sliding doors it certainly seems like a
car suited for the tech company with
features like a built-in vacuum cleaner
12 power sockets and H USB ports for
those who would rather do the driving
yourself the regular pacifica that was
thrown off at the detroit motor show
goes on sale in the US later this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
