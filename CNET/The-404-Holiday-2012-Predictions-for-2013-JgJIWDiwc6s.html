episode a Yuletide episode of the 404
show on cnet I'm Jeff Bakalar I'm Justin
you I'm Bridget Carey I mariela nunez
today we're going to be talking about
our tech predictions and overall tech
enthusiasm predictions for the year 2013
this is when we gaze into our crystal
ball and trying to figure out just what
the hell's gonna happen next year
looking at our score sheet from 2011 Oh
went 0 4 130 so we're not doing too well
yeah hopefully they can help you out
with say so we so this year hopefully we
can do a little bit of a better job
because Bridget carries here and she's
going to hopefully help us out and maybe
help us break 500 so no I am a little
psychic yeah that's what I've heard
about you so you're gonna be able to do
this for us I'm hoping mm-hmm all right
brilliant um but let's really get down
to it what what are we looking forward
to next year I feel like CES sorta is a
good indicator of what's coming down the
pike arm and the word already is that I
feel like televisions are going to be
again one of the bigger things this year
just because and I know everyone's heard
me say it a bunch but just because 4k is
finally starting to not necessarily come
down in price but enter some realm of
practicality or what about the
vocabulary of it all and getting people
to even know why they would need it or
want it or or you know everything was
always 1080p HD now I think about a 4k
what's a 4k that's going to be whole
hurdle yeah I feel like uh they they
should really just stick to saying super
HD is that something everyone can HD +
HD exactly that but that's seriously
something that every
one can swallow and they'd be like I can
wrap my head around this 4k I don't
really own it it's really like four TVs
in one right just asking for trouble I'm
still not really clear on the
differences between LCDs and LEDs still
I'm still really confused about the
terminology with TVs to add another one
is not sure you should be mitting that
is the TV guy I'm just saying that you
know well look at blu-rays a simpler
technology we can get our head around
and they're still selling movies with
both the DVD and blu-ray in it because
we're still on that point where we're
not really fully committed to jump in
yeah um so you know I'm rethinking
samsung is gonna have a really big
announcement with 4k TVs they might I
feel like the thing this year's going to
be like who can bring the first 4k TV
that's affordable yeah and you know who
can have the first one under ten
thousand dollars where it is but is it a
matter of who has the better image or is
it the matter of who can do more with
their TV I I know it seems that what
maybe strikes consumers more is what can
I do with it now you know and not so
much what you're I can barely perceive
unless you have you know special you
know tech to really see what's a better
screen well you got imagine they're all
going to come with the I guess basic set
of features that we've come to take for
granted and TVs now all these smart TVs
these internet connected TVs but then
going ahead and being like all right
here's this amazing picture quality
thing that we're that we're doing who
can bring it down to a price that's
that's realistic you had a bunch of
things that you're Justin looking
forward to a really quick with tears
though I wanted to bring up the apple TV
rumors that have kind of come back into
the mix recently yeah again and again
yeah I know it keeps popping up this
latest news came after Tim Cook talked
about the made in America imax and
people are speculating that maybe those
new displays could mean 2013 will see
the year of the apple TV finally coming
out we kind of thought that 2012 might
be that um but it ended up just being an
ipad for do you think we'll see an apple
TV later on this year so good question I
have to get their act together to make
it something different than what they
already offer on that thing that's
called Apple TV the box so it's about
like can they break through its i'm
going to say no i'm going to vote
no because it's too hard to break
through to that cable operator madness
of how it already exists with making
profits from you know the commercial
licenses of everything I think what
you'll see is pressure to improve what
you can do maybe with an add-on box but
an actual television may be the best it
will be is probably an apple TV built in
the current Apple TV product built into
a television maybe that mean you won't
well that's what I thought it would be
anyway yeah I know I think what they
want to do is really shake things up
like to do with music like offer
something a little bit more than just an
app to watch Netflix and some some shows
to buy wood you can do now right so
there's no incentive without something
more innovative maybe it'll be a
nomenclature thing maybe instead of
calling it the apple TV it'll just be
the ipad XL and it'll be a 30 inch
screen that you can carry around with
you that also happens to be with the TV
where you can touch right your portable
30 and 30 it's going to have facetime
probably some sort of weight I mean what
we saw at CES last time were these
add-ons that you just put on you clip on
top of your television to give yourself
a way to video chat in a living room
which is what we all want to do so I
think you're asleep IDEO chatting things
it'll be it'll be like exactly giant
iPad yeah I really do think there will
be an apple proper television next year
yeah just because and the only real you
know I guess glimmer of doubt i have is
because they seem to not necessarily be
botching this whole thing but it is the
one consistently unreliable apple
product that's been you know floating
around for the last two years um I feel
like I'll if you told a lot of people by
the end of 2012 there is still no
official TV you know if you told them
that three years ago they'd be like
they'd be shocked but I I do think you
know this is probably the year it's
going to happen just because I think
apple is starting to get a little too
fragmented and they're going to continue
this this sort of trip and make a lot of
products that you know we all
necessarily don't want or need and I
think they will come out with a
television and bridges right they have
you know if it's just a TV just like any
other TV what's so special about a while
I'm I buying
it'll probably overpriced anyway uh
maybe if they build in something that's
indispensable that something people
really find themselves not being able to
live without right or something weldon
with with with their game systems that
makes you think differently about how
you're getting content what are they
gonna build into this television the
Apple roadmap has gotten a little bit
easier to predict I feel like as well
you know in years past maybe roadmap mid
2000s yeah it was starting to get a
little difficult people were predicting
that iphones would have keyboard like
physical keyboards attached to it in
twenty twelve people predicted the ipad
mini almost to the T all the rumors came
true oh I'm getting better at this Apple
needs to put all its resources into
fixing maps yeah you said roadmap I was
like they have a bad road by the end of
2013 will people still continue to die
as a result of relying on Apple maps yes
or no I think yes if so if they put on
apple TV before they fix or at least
clean up to an extreme measure their
their map situation that they don't have
their priorities straight yeah there's I
do find a tiny sliver of the light in
knowing that how screwed up that map
thing is yes but we don't want anyone to
die course not being clear on that
course now we are endorsing death map
related death no we are not so ipad 5
think that's a safe bet six seven eight
nine ten ipad all releasing in 2013 ipad
mini uh I think they'll call like ipad
mini HD something stupid like that over
the ren display retina display ipad mini
a new ipad mini right the new iPad Mini
3 s HD iphone iphone 5s iPhone this
could be hard to read write 500 s is
that one I would say the trend would be
say yes yeah yeah they might I just
totally mix up because it's too hard to
just say 5s focus focus so maybe they'll
do the iphone 5 tea or something even
more ridiculous more letters yeah I just
bring on the letters I don't think you
think they're gonna change the form
factor anytime soon though I feel like
this was a slightly major update it's
every other one this is not gonna be
it's going with the same yeah I'm
excited to see where android phones go
I'm excited to see the next evolution of
ang
beyond jelly bean and all that good
stuff I want to see where we go with key
lime pie wherever the hell it's calm all
that good stuff I'm excited about that
samsung galaxy s4 I'm sure we'll be
hitting sometime soon do you think the
next iPhones gonna have mobile payments
NFC something that like actually mobile
payment cuz the whole thing is that
mobile payments Google Wallet can't even
get successful when you girls behind it
well it's so does it have to have iphone
behind it to have any success in the
marketplace or people to go I'm gonna
pay with my phone now people don't do
that yet I think I think the next iPhone
will probably have I take it back i
think it will have some sort of mobile
payment think it'll be NFC arm but
you're right it you know but there are
more people who have android phones and
have iphones so but not all of them have
NFC technology so I think that Apple
needs to shake it up everyone's beating
them on the technology and there have
been kind of cool like it's okay where
Apple we don't need it right now yeah
but maybe that's going to change up over
the years maybe they do need to be
cutting-edge more like Android is I
totally agree they are definitely not
what they were a year ago and it's
amazing what can change in it and look
no one's worried about Apple I am not
worried about them if I own stock in
apple I'm not worried about that they
are just not really where they were
maybe 18 months ago they were everyone
yawns now at press conferences welcomed
it because it's the novelty is over as
far as I'm concerned those keynotes
they're just not doing it for people
anymore maybe it's steve jobs not being
there I don't know and you know a lot of
its psychological maybe I i don't know i
don't want to say they go Steve Jobs
duds no apples in the crap no it's not
how that's not that again just to get
back to the mobile payments thing do you
think that the concept of mobile
payments is even take off I mean you
need to have the concept as a foundation
there and you need to have a lot of
people adopting that concept before the
hard way it comes out if there's one
thing that I've learned from self
checkouts at the grocery store it's that
people really aren't good at doing
things themselves and you can see that
in taxi cabs in New York to you can pay
with your own card just by pressing
against the machine people take forever
to do that it also doesn't cash may just
be a better faster solution and simple
too it's about the tech not working i go
to i go check out a self-checkout it's
beeping because i brought my own bag to
have someone come over right approve
that I didn't steal something you know
it or the taxi doesn't register it as
the internet connections off you know so
yeah everything's always gonna be faster
if you just take out a credit card still
right I don't know it their hat what's
the motivation it's got to have a point
system rewards system i can i can get
more you know credit for my 10th
purchase that might get me to do it but
i'll tell you one thing cash is
definitively not the future okay so uh
it's got to be there needs to be some
sort of universal solution right you
have all this fragmentation with NFC
with google wallet with passbook that's
the problem everyone has to get their
freaking slice and their cut of this
stuff and we can't all agree on one
universal format right it's in every
facet of technology there is dock
connectors and proprietary cards and
flash mayer and stuff like that if we
could all just shut up for five minutes
and get on board with the same sort of
mobile payment system things would move
a lot almost got to be a leader in that
and someone's gotta drink drag others
into it you look at my wallet my wallet
is like this thick right now because if
my phone had everything i needed in it
than that may be right but what the
answer to that though who has to step in
you're gonna see the government has to
step in and formalize some sort of thing
they formalize the the internet now you
have a leader like apple or google no
but i don't think that's necessarily the
answer because google is not a leader in
that and Apple is not a leader in that
it's to fret and then you have all the
carriers who want their cut on the
entire people looking at music as the
example how did that get changed up on a
unified way because Apple got in before
anyone else even thought to do it and
it's not a few chefs name for music
right if you want to buy an mp3 can get
that but you can get it from so many
different source course all these
different lockers now but that seems to
work out okay I think a physical like
the tangible idea of giving your phone
to someone or scanning something that's
the thing that needs to be streamlined
maybe it's the register companies I
don't know but someone's got to figure
it out because I am so sick of having
this competition impeding progress yeah
and everyone trying to sue each other
over crap how about this no more suing
yeah they go no more suing let's get to
making some more stuff mama I don't want
to care about these lawsuits it's what
you
you said than done but it's getting a
little ridiculous yeah obviously
referring to the patent suits with apple
and samsung that's gonna happen more
it's gotta be fixed though man patent
patent law must be reformed in my
opinion so let's get to your list of
stuff before we have to go because I we
you know we wanted to make this as a yes
or something that we've kind of talked
about in the second half of this year
life monitors I think are going to be
really huge in 2013 in 2012 we saw the
emergence of Nike FuelBand and things
like the Jawbone Up that kind of monitor
your fitness they track your steps as a
pedometer and then you can go online and
look at your progression and your health
in that way you know they even track
your nutrition if you want to write that
information and I think that with things
like Google glass coming out because
name times invention best invention of
2012 today so I think those life
trackers are going to be really really
big I read something about the memento
kickstarter campaign that's basically a
box that clips to any part of your
clothing and that snaps a photo at
increments that you choose and then will
stitch together um basically a time
lapse of your life that you'll take with
you and you can upload it whenever you
want you can do on a daily basis or look
at your month and video snapshots to
kind of cool stuff like that I think is
gonna be very very big in this next you
people actually physically and digitally
tracking their lives so you have to clip
this thing on somewhere you do yeah I
it's kind of like a snapshot version of
a GoPro and that's that's another thing
that I've been seeing too is like people
just digitize in their lives seeing a
lot of uh bike riders on the street with
GoPros attached to their helmets I'm
sure you've seen it in your hockey team
stuff too um yeah people just really
really want to take their entire life
online so they not mean so they can do
what that I still don't get that yeah I
still don't get documenting every last
thing you did just so you can look at it
again temos later you know we'll look at
the the Paleo diet we talked about it
with that anytime that you're you have a
representation of something on the
computer you're able to look at it more
just the idea of uh being the details on
something of your life and having that
once your prediction is that we don't
backer be with that we become even more
self-obsessed hundred percent
they were getting more comfortable with
that concept to be able to buy you do
because it's been out for what to some
years now well like I have a scale where
I walk on it and it and we've ever want
to see the trend oh like I get the
number in front of me but if ever want
to see the trend it's on a nap with the
little wiggly line in right things that
can maybe make it easier to to monitor
if you want to but yeah you got the
chart when you have more gadgets to
recharge you start getting into a messy
territory I've been trying to use like
11 pedometer that lets me how active I
am yeah and the reward is that I get
points in a game this is a new thing by
strife and I don't always have the
motivation to recharge it and then it
kind of just falls by the wayside so
everyone is trying to find what's what's
the motivation to get you to wear it and
charge it right right but the
gamification thing I'm sure is going to
be really big dude this year I started
using a cycling app called stiva it's
basically a social network you can
download this app for iPhones or
androids and you can post your route
your favorite routes in your city and
then the gamification comes in where you
try to beat everyone's time and so they
have leaderboards to wear all these are
like the fastest people that have done
this route that's really cool i think
we're going to start seeing more that
too creepy well well for squares getting
rid of their gamification maybe there's
no really well there's trying to be more
of a useful tool like yelp and less
focus about being mayor of somewhere so
you have that trend where they go it
only lasts for so long then you have to
actually have a real use right it's like
how long can we just float on on venture
capitalist money before someone's going
to ask for a little bit in return yeah
is its it is scary though because it
brings up the idea of just giving away
your privacy people are volunteering
this information is right and then at
the same time they'll get paranoid
because up someone installed a camera on
a bus that can listen in to conversation
how is that not the same thing it's the
line between opt-in and and your own
personal privacy is getting really
blurred well yeah i think we kissed
privacy in which people 30 years ago
understood it we kiss that goodbye yeah
about five years ago smartphone um once
once you had your Instagram yeah and a
GPS tie to your hip every day yeah
that's true that's it's a it's a creepy
new world to that we must all brave what
else do you think is going to show up
what are one of us up that you know
that's not really an evolution of
anything like brand new
you know new stuff brand new stuff what
about driverless cars that was something
that was big this year I believe google
got it approved and in California
Governor Jerry Brown actually said that
he's going to allow licenses to be given
out to these cars in two years so we're
not going to see it in 2013 but the DMV
is in California are definitely going to
be starting to pave those roads so
they're giving out licenses to robots
understand well that uh jbrown approved
a bill that let the DMV get two years to
figure out how they're gonna issue
licenses to drivers that want to operate
driverless cars you say the driver seat
yourself to be in the drivers have to be
so response you can't sit shotgun and
just sort of be like make a left just do
something yeah I would like that it'd be
nice all right so speaking of stuff that
you you'd want to see I think in terms
of traffic is I think Google is soon
going to figure out traffic I think
they've been collecting data for what
feels like a decade mm-hmm people
figuring out I think they're really
going to get down to it and do something
fixed traffic yes traffic is one of
these problems that we've had in this
country for decades and no one there's
never really been anything besides
widening roads right or what I mean
that's really all we can do right is it
isn't traffic just a symptom of small
incremental mistakes that build up
across really big distances so the way
you get rid of that is driverless cars
it's human error right so i think that
combined with some sort of app or some
sort of service that google is i mean
think about it there's I understand
they're collecting data to help people
navigate and tell people be aware of
where maybe not to go but I think then
taking a next step is inevitable of
curbing traffic getting people more in
the know and to eliminate traffic time I
just think they're they're definitely
working on something and I hope 2013's
the year they debut something Google
carpool maybe or whatever it is or like
Google fast route ever whatever it will
be they are working on something yeah
and hopefully 2013 we find out what it
is alright closing thoughts what uh what
do you really
is there something that you personally
selfishly perhaps I really looking
forward to uh yeah I want to see more
activism and I know we hate that word
it's it's really annoying for men to
whatever but uh in 2013 i'm hoping that
activists set their sights on North
Korea and that's a problem that's been
going on for decades now it's a little
under the radar I don't feel like
government has given enough attention
but we're starting to see cell phones
getting smuggled into North Korea from
parts of China now so that tiny tiny
little exposure is getting wider and I
don't think that 2013 is going to be the
year of the Arab Spring for North Korea
but I'm hoping that hacktivists
anonymous and otherwise really really
focus on that Wow Justin on the show
right here has declared a call for arms
yes call to arms hey we need it no it's
uh it's not out of the realm possibility
i think uh anonymous is up four times
person of the year yeah an honest a lot
this year and good guy anonymous too
good guy anonymous I feel like they
definitely improved their PR in 20 they
did they did I think I feel like the
thing with Israel may be sent set him
back a little bit yeah yeah a lot of
people were upset with how they were
approaching the Israel situation but uh
yeah we'll see what happens with them I
think they are you know and and in the
most amazing thing is that they still
are not being compromised in any
capacity that we're aware of so it'll be
interesting to see where they go luckily
for us they seem to be on the good side
of me yeah and they seem to mean well so
that'll be interesting what about you
Bridget what are you specifically
perhaps selfishly looking forward to my
selfish wish will never come true
because of business and business must
grow and and it's it's just it's this
problem you come across when you got a
Samsung television and and ipad mini and
a google phone it's it's this I just
don't make me buy all of your same
product to live a happy life because
it's not going to happen I just wish
sinking got easier without a million
different hiccups and roadblocks in the
way because I think the one you know
complaint I have one when you have those
moments like oh why can't I get this on
that yeah that happens still too much
and too often than it should it doesn't
have to be I'm sure you're definitely
not alone in that struggle and
there is a possibility someone could
come along with a third party thing to
make another box to make another thing
and then and then that box only works
with this box yeah for me I'm look it's
getting better it's getting better just
not right we're just not there yet for
me selfishly I'm looking forward to the
next generation of games mmm you can
have a new xbox most likely you're most
likely gonna review PlayStation let's
see where that goes you know it's a lot
of movement lately yeah 2013 I mean
physical gaming oh yeah I hope we
completely stray away from that nonsense
and get back to what matters and that's
good compelling unique unique refreshing
ideas for brand new games I read a rumor
today that Nintendo may be thinking
about buying Sega I think that could be
a possibility of happening in 23 that
one do anything it's a software
acquisition right Sega doesn't make any
hardware yeah so that would just be a
software thing it'd be good yeah i don't
know i think what needs to happen is I
think the antenna needs to make a phone
mm I think Justine we'll see we will see
these are our predictions for the year
2013 in tech please check out the show
