Apple watch I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your seen that update Apple pay will
soon work with all major US credit cards
discover announced it will work with
Apple's tap to pay service on the new
iPhone 6 models and the Apple watch in a
statement discover said its credit and
debit cards will work with Apple pay in
the fall and that also includes in-app
online purchases made on the iPhone 5s
and the latest iPads it's only been a
few days since the Apple watch
officially launched but not all those
that pre-ordered have received their
SmartWatch in the mail yet research firm
slice intelligence suggests that only
twenty-two percent of Americans that
pre-ordered receive their watch and the
group says that leaves 1.3 million
Americans still waiting many without an
estimated delivery date these are not
exact numbers but the firm is basing
this estimation on a survey of two
million online shoppers in the US and
when consumers do get an Apple watch
there's one type of app you will not be
able to use on your wrist Apple is not
approving any fart apps for the watch
the makers of the sound effect app fart
watch report that their program was
rejected with Apple telling the
developers quote we do not accept fart
apps on the Apple watch many fans of
flatulence are expressing disappointment
online some say Apple really blew it on
this one and who says someone like
Beyonce doesn't want her $10,000 luxury
item being used as a digital whoopee
cushion this is just a limitation on her
artistic freedom but her husband jay-z
may have a bigger issue with Apple on
his mind the rap artist and entrepreneur
has been defending his new title music
streaming service from critics ever
since it launched less than a month ago
jay-z launched title in partnership with
many big-name musicians but there was
something tone-deaf about several mega
millionaires all taken to a stage
telling their fans to pay more for their
streaming music even though title has
only been out for a few weeks jay-z took
to Twitter to defend the paid service
saying that title has over seven hundred
and seventy thousand subscribers and
that title needs time to
ro jay-z also tweeted that title pays
more without Mittleman giving 75% of
royalties to the artists title costs
subscribers ten dollars a month and if
you want a higher CD quality sound
that's going to be twenty dollars a
month there's no free ad-supported
option the artist known for dealing with
99 problems maybe adding apple to his
list in a few months it's been reported
that Apple is working on its own page
streaming service to challenge title if
artists give exclusive streaming rights
to title or to Apple that could
determine which service wins out that
