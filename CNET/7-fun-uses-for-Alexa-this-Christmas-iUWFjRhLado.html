you have to do is ask her that's just
one of the many fun things you can do
leading up to December 25th and here are
seven other fun things you can do with
Alexa for Christmas one of the most
obvious things you can do is stream
Christmas music as if we all haven't
heard the songs over and over and over
and over assuming you're an Amazon Prime
member alexinnz played all sorts of
Christmas music but if you're an Amazon
unlimited subscriber or you have Spotify
Premium the list of Christmas songs
albums and playlists is even longer
there's also a skill called Christmas
radio that can play all sorts of music
without any sort of subscription and you
can also just ask Alexa to sing A
Christmas Carol we wish you a Merry
Christmas we wish you a Merry Christmas
we wish you a Merry Christmas in
addition to singing Christmas carols
Alexa can also recite the night before
Christmas in its entirety though one
could argue that unlike her singing the
reading lacks a bit of warmth twas the
night before Christmas when all through
the house not a creature was stirring
not even a mouse for a more lively
version you can also ask her to play the
poem as sung by Peter Paul and Mary one
simple trick you can do this year is
make your Christmas decorations smart
just plug any strand of lights into a
smart Alexa compatible outlet and then
you can say things like Alexa turn on
the Christmas tree lights you can also
use the Christmas kindness skill which
will suggest a random act of kindness
that you can perform on those around you
such as letting the stress stop mom in
line at the grocery store jump ahead
just to make a day a little better if
you're tired of listening to the same
Christmas songs on repeat year after
year maybe try the Christmas sound skill
this skill once you enable it in the
Alexa app will play Thematic Christmas
sounds such as clapping homes Christmas
carolers and much much more you can also
track Santa using Alexa using the NORAD
Tracks Santa skill open the Alexa app
find this skill and enable it and then
just ask where Santa will get an update
on his location and its current status
and you can also ask NORAD about their
Secret Santa files and finally you can
play Christmas trivia with Alexa who
apparently knows quite a bit about the
holiday and the man in the big red suit
you can ask things like is Santa Claus
real or say stuff like tell me
Santa's reindeer for more tips and
tricks and other how-to news be sure to
