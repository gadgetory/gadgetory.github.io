version of the Amazon echo smart speaker
and sources tell cnet that Apple may put
a camera in its version this camera
could detect who is nearby using facial
recognition technology so it would
theoretically switch to my music and
lighting preferences when I enter the
room and have different profiles for
other members of my family but there's
one big problem Apple will have to solve
if there's a camera in this smart home
hub well people get freaked out over how
Apple could see into your home and know
everything you do can we trust the
all-seeing eye of Tim Cook privacy and
consumer trust our major hurdles tech
companies need a tiptoe around while
innovating for the smart home back in
2013 you remember when people freaked
out when Xbox one was going to require a
Kinect camera to function so Microsoft
backtracked and made the camera optional
even the successful amazon echo launched
with criticism over how the speaker is
always listening for you to say the
keyword Alexa to wake it up similar
uneasy feelings are brought up with
televisions that are listening for your
command leaving you to wonder if your
conversations are being recorded or
where that audio data is going if we are
getting more comfortable with voice
commands a camera does take concerns to
a new level those familiar with apples
plans tell seen it that Apple could
abandon the idea of a camera and the
product may not come out until next year
a few days ago Google revealed its own
take on the Amazon echo smart speaker
it's called google home there's no
camera but it also responds to voice
commands and it'll come out later this
year that's it for this tech news update
before I sign off I have a quick
programming note i am going on maternity
leave no surprise for those of you that
have seen my belly in previous video
reports but while I'm away on leave
you'll still be getting updates the
reports in great hands with ayahs akhtar
and Jeff Bakalar and I want to thank the
viewers that said to their kind words of
support as they venture into mommy land
I'll see you all again in a few months
I'm Bridget Carey thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
