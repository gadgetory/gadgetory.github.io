Google licious for everything Google you
could think of it's been over a week
since the first reported issues of the
Google pixel to excel screen but have we
heard a peep from Google after they said
they were actively investigating the
reports yeah
now instead the big story this week that
got the attention of Google CEO sundar
Pichai is the Google cheese burger emoji
now writer Thomas baked tail was the
first report on one of the biggest mess
ups in emoji history like even bigger
than when Apple almost decided to change
the peach booty emoji in iOS 10 beta
that was a big deal now big don't tweet
it out a comparison of apples
cheeseburger emoji and Google's burger
emoji that places the cheese underneath
the burger like you can see Google's not
the only one with burger emoji boo-boos
Samsung puts the cheese on top of the
lettuce before the burger but I guess at
least it's on top now what is this world
coming to in a tweet sundar pichai said
we'll drop everything else we are doing
and address on Monday if folks can agree
on this correct way to do this yeah
that's great sundar but anything about
the pixel to excel yet like anything
okay now the googs might say something
after we post this show but until then
prioritizing an emoji over the to excel
that's an easy boo-boo but the race is
on like what will we hear about first
addressing the pixel to excel screen
that has a one week lead or fix the
burger emoji what do you all think
Google will do first because I know you
read the comments like I read every
single one of them like this one from
Josue gtz that said last week's show
should have been called Google issues
like I get it Google is just Google
issues that's clever and he makes a
point there was even a story where
Google accidentally shipped a Google
pixel to 128 gig unit to a customer with
a note in the box that said it had
failed its quality control inspection oh
man like I know fluky things like this
do happen but come on that's another
Google
and I don't want to pile on but to add
some insult to injury we know the pixel
two phones do not come with any
headphones but instead a USB C 2 3.5
millimeter port dongle in the box
according to Verizon customer Lukas
Everett he posted photos of packaging
and documentation that didn't match the
other pixel twos and could indicate that
Google had actually considered including
headphones in the box at one time okay
I'll just throw it out one more time
because I feel like it Google alright
there's still plenty of other Android
phones with buzz the new one plus five T
and it's loyal following has been leaked
by you-know-who mr. Evan blasts
featuring its super slim bezels and a
large 18 by 9 6 inch display and I mean
loyal after they released the 5 earlier
this year that didn't have the near
bezel as trend that many phones are
doing and then they decided to go for a
refreshed 5 T in the same year they'd
like to do this now we're expecting the
phone to drop any time but I'm not a big
fan of this flagship phone refreshed
twice a year even if it gives you an
extra bump of media buzz because we're
doing this story basically twice now
YouTube TV is also expanding not only is
it getting tons of air time during the
world series with TV ads galore and by
the way how ridiculous was that game 5
yeah previously you could only access
the services through a chromecast
but it will now be launching apps for
Android TV devices like the Nvidia
shield and Xbox one in the next few days
with Apple TV LG Samsung and Sony coming
soon after that
also it's YouTube's live TV service with
40 plus channels and it's currently
available in all of the top 50 metro
areas covering two-thirds of the US with
a free child if you want to check it out
alright and the Google assistant is
showing some love for iPhone users and I
know there are actually Apple users that
watch this show Apple music is now
getting integration with the assistant
and you can enable this through the
Google assistant app settings you can
control tracks or play a specific song
our album on Apple music whether it's
purchased tracks or any music you're
streaming through the subscription
Android devices can already control
Apple music but they can also use
commands to control its streaming radio
stations as well something that iPhone
users can't do with the assistant right
now all right that's gonna do it for
this week you can email me at Google is
just at cnet.com or tweet me at brian
tom thanks much for watching we'll catch
you all next time for some more
of that google issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
