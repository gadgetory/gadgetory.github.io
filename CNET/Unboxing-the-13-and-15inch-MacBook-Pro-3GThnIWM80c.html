couple of freshly wrapped packages from
Apple inside these bags I have the new
13-inch n 15-inch macbook pro these are
the laptops with the retina displays
they've kind of shunted the old non
Retina Display MacBook soft into the
retirement home so we're just going to
call you the macbook pro now we don't
have to use retina display every time so
inside the bag I've got the 13 inch box
and I have got the 15 inch box and we
are going to unbox them by lifting off
the top a typical apple style here not
much new in the packaging they've still
got inside the laptop wrapped in plastic
packed neatly behind that is the power
supply and the extension cord for that
and yeah a little bit of documentation
they still have in these there's
something a lot less than there used to
be especially when they used to give you
a CD of the operating system monitor
even the USB key now it's just a couple
of pieces of paper so all you do to get
started is you break the seal on your
plastic pull it out and you are ready to
set up your brand new 13-inch MacBook
Pro I guess as soon as you take off this
little piece of tissue paper right there
and of course the same thing goes for
the 15 inch version box is a little bit
bigger but the same style that Apple's
had for several years now here is our
15-inch MacBook again we break the seal
and here's that all ready to get set up
same design as last year new components
inside and of course you've got your
power cable and your paperwork right
there that is our unboxing of the new 15
inch and 13-inch apple macbook pros</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
