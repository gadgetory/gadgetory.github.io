Tom what's up everybody welcome to the
show hey we got a make up we got to show
love for you a lot of people are
disappointed we didn't have a show on
Friday because we have this thing called
July 4th week break Independence Day
Independence Day here in the US Steven
Beecham was enjoying his time with his
family you have a good time bro I had a
blast I missed you but you know what
guess what we have lives outside the
show I missed you too bad yes we love
the show we do it all so you guys can
gals are here welcome to Apple byte
extra crunchy this is episode 91 we're
almost hitting a honey good Lord but
again this show is all about you it is
our complimentary piece to the Apple
byte video podcast more in depth more
new information just stuff that we can't
fit into like a five six minutes show
even if we force a horrible skin in
there that you guys may or may not like
this is here where you get all the other
the goodness so if you want to be a part
of the show this is where you guys make
this happen call in to our line leave a
voicemail the number is
always this theme of iPhone 8 there's a
couple new recent little nugget stories
and we're gonna dig a lot deeper into
this whole talk about we'll touch ID
really go away with the iPhone eight but
let's quickly just hit two of the latest
topics that are buzzing right now in the
iPhone 8 rumor world the first one comes
to our leaking Twitter buddy Benjamin
guest skin who has really been the king
of every physical / video / render leak
that we have seen with the iPhone 8 so
he just dropped kind of to jump and
piggyback on an earlier report by Keiji
eyes Ming Chi quo talking about how the
next iPhone 8 right the high-end bad boy
5.8 inch OLED screen phone will come in
potentially four colors one of the color
options according to Gaskin is a
mirrored option so think of like the
iPod Touch back in the day that mirrored
metal and if you scroll down a little
bit you can actually see his actual
tweet he showed off an iPhone case from
from a previous model but just to really
illustrate the idea of from what he's
heard a mirrored silver mirror are
basically a mirrored option will be one
of those potential colorways for the
iPhone 8 we will see that's the one I'm
gonna get man I want the mirror option I
want me or that man oh yeah
I'm a mirror that also of the other
quick blurb about the iPhone 8 is we
know wireless charging has been a
rumored feature for a long time what is
now being reported out of Jerry
fireballs John Gruber who has his own
podcast as well as really tight
connections within apple of kind of the
latest and greatest going on in there he
says that he's heard the inductive
charging will a be sold separately so
it'll be a separate charger hey I'm
really I'm just delivering the news okay
bro don't kill the messenger and B might
be late waiting for iOS 11.1 that's
crazy think about this as if you
remember with his example as portrait
mode with the iPhone 7 came out like a
fifth a few months later after they
revealed the the actual feature you
software update he believes that it
might be similar where they'll make this
power adapter or inductive charging
adapter right a plate where you could
drop your phone on available later which
that's alright I just make it just have
it come out when it launches I mean
there's also rumors that the actual
iPhone 8 might be pushed back in
development meaning we'll see it
sometime maybe in October November not
September Wow
so here's the thing that I'm seen is is
this gonna be another air pod situation
yeah that's it's already feels right
going that direction you know if this is
a report and Gruber is reliable let's
again daring fireballs John Gruber is
reliable so I'm gonna take it for what
it is I heard the air pods are still on
a six-week backorder I ordered a pair
for my lady love you Shawna
shoutout but it took still still took
six weeks to get them Wow and so this is
after I guess what now we're talking
about they announced them they were
coming out in December they were
supposed to come out and fall so we're
maybe almost about a few three months
over about nine months deep and there's
still at a six-week backorder and we're
almost to the next iPhone and you still
have that's what I'm talking about crazy
man but the wireless charging seems like
it's something that is a huge deal for
Apple and feature to brag about - yeah
it needs to be released with the iPhone
thank you leave as like is like part of
the whole package not something that's
separate even you know exactly so again
these are the two latest stories coming
out that just dropped on this Monday
about the iPhone but really the big the
big meaty news and the stuff that's
worth talking about to me this kind of
released at the end of last week because
we couldn't have a show but let's talk
about the potential of Apple completely
getting rid of the touch ID physical
button whether it's still on the front
or some renders have showed that it's
placed on the rear according to
Bloomberg and Ming Chi quo they both
have in reports that are saying that
Apple has already been testing 3d face
scanning to unlock the next iPhone now
it's not a
we have iris scanning with the Galaxy s8
we've seen 3d or how about this just a
face scanning and general use used as a
biometric yes so according this
Bloomberg report from mark Berman and
friends they have been testing an
improved security system that allows
users to login authenticate payments and
launch secure apps by scanning their
face this is according to people inside
Apple it's powered by a new 3d sensor
and is also added that the technology is
still in development they're also
testing eye scanning to potentially
augment the system meaning that it could
use a combination of 3d face scanning
and iris scanning combined wait so the
new like you know we've all gotten used
to this
using your fingerprint which either
which I'll I purchased some which I like
now we're gonna have to learn a new
behavior right so you want to purchase
an app you're gonna be like oh I'm gonna
purchase the app push purchase and then
stare at your phone well here is the
hope is right they bet it'd better be
faster than that according to the report
also the phone using apple's system that
they are testing the phone can be
unlocked within a few hundred
milliseconds and allegedly works even
when the device is lying on a table
which means but your to your point if
again these this is true to your point
if you got to hold it up like this you'd
already be able to pretty much face scan
you before you hold up like this yeah so
you could just like put your face over
the table it's gotta stare at my phone
real quick yeah yeah that's yeah i could
see the potential of that that could be
pretty cool the other detail about is
that people might not think about is
that it's said to capture more data
points on your face versus a fingerprint
scan which is just a fingerprint but
again you basically have to the way that
touch ID works right now you can't just
chop someone's finger off and use touch
ID yeah you have to actually asked you
have it it has to have a blood blood
flow like it senses that this is a
living object although although i wonder
if you can if you did take a layer of
someone's finger and then put it on
yours if
detect that fingerprint but still be
able to tell because of just your your
fingers through it through this thin
layer of skin that it is still a finger
that actually we haven't tested that yet
that's a very song Silence of the Lambs
way of thinking but silent I wonder if
your eyes have to be open for the facial
scanner because if it's using both iris
scanning and face scanning probably
possibly yeah because I could see you
know people can unlock other people's
phones while they're asleep or something
so I think this is really interesting
because all these renders and rumors
about the iPhone 8 have been oh there's
a rear touch ID and everyone's freaking
out like I hate the rear touch ID I
don't want it on the back i from the
start whether it's true or not never
really complained about it because using
a google pick so i think it's in the
perfect spot using the earlier LG phones
that first had it it's in the it's in a
sweet spot you don't you don't you're
not looking for a per se i wasn't a fan
of samsung putting it next to the camera
lens because it does get it smudgy right
i'm not a fan of that i'm a fan of it
kind of in that middle lower area but
now it's kind of funny because guess
what now you see comments of people
complaining about face scanning instead
of touch ID right it's like guess that
this is the whole thing about this we
don't actually know 100% sure what
exactly it's going to be but if it's a
lot faster I don't think you're gonna
care that there's no touch ID button
there yeah I think well well I don't get
over that pretty quickly actually you
know if it works if it works good yeah
and if it works in the dark right yeah
that's a good question is it gonna work
in the dark I'm gonna do that you're
like in a nightclub
yo what's gonna happen it better it
better not work with your eyes are
closed because if your ladies like want
to check your phone at night and you're
like sleeping she like takes your phone
and holds it up to your feet like you no
one wants that
hell no don't don't look at mine I have
nothing yeah we got another night but
that is kind of weird I mean who knows
eggplant eggplant eggplant scores course
so we know that emoji string you guys
you guys have used it before don't lie
we know that there are bad people out
there and they're constantly trying to
figure out ways to infiltrate stuff so
you know who knows who knows where
that's gonna go so we don't know again
here's the
anything also we don't know exactly
what's gonna be implemented if they're
still in testing they may completely
scrap this it could determine what
physical design Apple ends up going with
because we've heard and from all
indications there are obviously a
variety of different designs about what
the iPhone 8 is I think everyone ideally
wants it to have you know perfect clean
glass no buttons no sensors anywhere
yeah and if that's what you get and the
facial scanning with iris scanning works
then I think you'll feel happy about it
again these are technologies that have
existed on other phones I'm not gonna
pretend like they're not but we'll see
how the total package comes together
yeah and here's where it gets
interesting though okay so we have all
this information about what may or may
not happen literally like a day after
this report dropped about them working
on it a new patent filing was brought
into the light that Apple has been
working and improving on their own 3d
facial recognition system that would be
available to work for the iPhone as well
as Macs including this thing they call
present presence technology and I
thought this was interesting because the
way it's described and kind of
diagrammed out is that they're Apple's
recognition system isn't just a face
recognition system it also looks for
skin tone as well as movement so holding
a still picture reportedly won't be able
to trigger this off oh I see right it
has to be you it basically has to
somehow within those milliseconds prove
that you're kind of like a living object
of a person with a face man they think
of everything seriously like I would not
think of that if I was a designer or an
engineer I'd be like wait we have to
stop people from using a photograph yeah
and crazy may be face skin may be the
skin tone has to do with it remembers it
so it identifies someone with a maybe a
more specific skin tone I don't know how
that factors in on-the-fly this is just
a patent filing that Apple has but it's
their own kind of version of advanced
facial recognition that would work not
only for their iPhones but for future
Mac's as well and that kind of added on
this layer of okay this is actually
starting to come together from mole
angles rumors actual reports and patent
filings it's great because it's pretty
good sign that they're journalism
bye-bye all and this was published on
July 6th so just like three days or four
days ago yeah they're like oh we better
get this in the can right away
it came fly so you know it finally came
to light so I thought that was pretty
interesting uh just to kind of bounce
around just temporarily in another
patent filing this is not related
specifically to the iPhone 8 or whatnot
but Apple is released or revealed based
on the US Patent and Trademark Office
published they publish an Apple patent
application relating to potentially the
company's upcoming home pod speaker now
this is really more specific to an
invention that covers this how the home
pod produces sound based on its
surroundings it's described as a method
of equalizing and optimizing loudspeaker
output through the use of microphones
digital signal processing and advanced
computational algorithms so really what
this comes down to is Apple's own
microphone system that is internal like
internal and external microphones that
basically are sensing the location of
your home pod which Apple kind of
alluded to they didn't break down the
technology when they revealed the home
pod they just said that it has a system
with microphones that's able to optimize
this but right when you put a speaker Li
you know this when you put a speaker in
the corner of a room yeah right that
sound bout it just feels down everywhere
right it bounces everywhere you put it
kind of in the center of a room your
your it at least your normal standard
speaker it's not gonna produce that same
level sound that feels like it really
fills out the room yeah and different
types of sound do different things like
low-end they call it low-end because it
fills the floor of the room well I like
subwoofer based stuff yeah exactly and
like high-end it's like you hear it up
higher I mean like literally like I'm
talking like height you know what I'm
saying so that's very interesting like
it's almost like they're gonna program
it to be always be optimal wherever
you're walking in a room or something
you know so like oh he's over in that
corner so let's direct all the sound in
that corner like that's that's that's
pretty interesting but that's that's
pretty amazing
you know it's also interesting if you
didn't realize that I raised my seat so
I could get a better eyeline with you
just you're talking yeah most of the
time I look at you and the monitor over
here so when you're looking at me you're
talking to me but I'm looking over here
talking to me so it's a disconnect but
it's funny yeah I would we're in the
same room sometimes you can be in the
same room with someone but feel so far
away so that's a patent filing another
patent from Apple just describing the
whole pot I'm still really you know what
I'm not obviously I'm one who's not sold
on the home pod but again I will buy and
try everything I'm just curious how it's
going to be how the general consumer
audience is really going to respond to
this product I'm gonna buy it but you
can never again we always say this and
again you can never underestimate the
power of the Apple brand and the
ecosystem is the marketing team is just
I mean you could make a giant
marshmallow that plays music and
someone's gonna buy it like there's
their market the hell out of that a
giant marshmallow with an Apple logo on
it they should have called it the i'm
i'll i mellow I'm mellow and put it on a
stand that looks like a barbecue steak
if you want to have it like for your
stereo sound all right just some other
quick things iOS 11 beta the third beta
for iOS 11 and MacOS hi Sierra
hi Sierra their third betas have been
released for both of those at least if
you know if you're a developer it from
what I gather at least right now I
unless I didn't check recently I don't
think it's available on the public beta
right now the public beta typically
tends to tray a little bit from the
developer builds that come out but we
just don't want to let you know that it
is continually continuously evolving but
the betas are out so if you're someone
who took the risk of putting it on your
products that's fine I do feel for some
you know I get sometimes a few tweets or
messages from people saying oh I don't
like this it's kind of buggy
it's yeah there's it's it's a beta for a
reason to get rid of the bugs and uh
from what I recall so a gentleman had
hit me up about putting the bay
on the on his Apple watch it's like oh
it's draining away more power on both
the phone and the watch obviously it's
not optimized but from what I gather I
don't know if you can personally
specifically for the Apple watch I don't
know if you can revert your Apple watch
to an older Iowa older iOS after you've
put it through a developer beta if
something tells me you can't
specifically with the Apple watch I'm
not talking about the iPhone the iPod
I mean iPhone iPad I could be wrong but
yeah I was like um I think you know you
might be Sol right now if you want to go
back yeah I've never seen like a how-to
or like you know cuz even when you're at
your Apple watch gets trashed or messed
up the only people that Apple basically
based on their warranty they they say
like oh you have to bring in the store
and like we have access to the
diagnostic part to do XY and Z but you
don't at home on the Apple watch
down baby basically so we'll see we'll
see how that all plays out the other
thing is also what's cool is the Apple
TV public beta oh yeah you can get in on
that they that's not something that
they've typically made available to the
public but if you want to check out
there just go to do you really do
general search you run the risk of your
Apple TV getting janked I mean to a
screwed no matter what if you're playing
with beta software you're always gonna
risk something like that yeah so it may
not work perfectly sometimes it might
crash more often than it's supposed to
that that's the type of stuff that
happens maybe certain apps aren't
compatible but overall you can you can
kind of check it out if you want to go
and get the public beta you do have to
sign up through Apple's website just
search like Apple public beta program
and it'll guide you through all that
stuff the other thing here if we're
talking about video content right Apple
TV play around with this I thought this
articles really interesting it was
originally published by The Wall Street
Journal Amazon and camp Comcast's have
been able to take a bite out of Apple's
digital movie business so if you look
back at iTunes the store write really
one of those apps at the forefront of
pushing digital media content and
consumption way ahead of time before
people are even comfortable
about it right if you want to call say
what is a disrupter iTunes was one of
those things
oh yeah big-time but if you look like if
you look at a decade later Amazon and
Comcast as well as others right we have
a lot of people that have shifted to
streaming behaviors but it's also cut
into Apple's market share so according
to this report the Apple now claims 20%
or somewhere around twenty to thirty
five percent of digital movie rentals
and sales but if you look back in 2012
they were at 50% oh wow I mean I used to
I used to rent movies from Apple all the
time and like TV shows and stuff it was
easy to do but now it's kind of lost a
little bit you know well they have so
much going on - yeah now they say taking
a bite out of Apple share is Amazon
which does also rentals and sell selling
of movies and they have their own
content right there Amazon Prime service
but Amazon claims now about 20% of the
market share according The Wall Street
Journal Comcast's accounts for about 15%
of the market I got to say like Amazon
Prime video was always kind of like a
redheaded stepchild
but and then just in the last few years
it's like really like growing up a lot
and it's a lot easier to use and there's
a lot more content and that's those are
the this article is about the two main
things I use Amazon and Comcast is
Comcast streaming services kick-ass -
you know like you get all your TV shows
oh yeah whatever and they have a lot of
movies on demand like when they make
deals with movie companies but um this
is this this article does not surprise
me at all here's the other thing when I
see this story and I wonder what's going
on here look I think that Amazon has
been able to get people to purchase more
shows directly when we talk about why is
Apple has lost you know this market
share first of all people are now
streaming on more devices that's gonna
be one aspect of it but Amazon has
original content and shows that people
actually watch yeah like transparent is
one of them and so when you're creating
original content like Netflix like
others that are people are actually
watching people are more likely to use
that product just in general and then
because they're using that product and
they want to make a purchase they just
happen to be already on their fire TV or
whatever it is
because they're watching these other
shows that are part of their service and
then they buy them and that's why I've
still been frustrated of hey Apple if
you're gonna get into this exclusive
content you're really gonna put it
behind the Apple music paywall way that
makes sense it doesn't make sense and
these shows that they're putting out
right now aren't compelling enough to
even convince anyone to really say okay
I'm gonna put down ten dollars a month
for the Apple music service because I
saw this show that I have to have I know
Apple is building this this is not gonna
happen overnight quite honestly for them
to get enough content that is compelling
look how long it took Netflix to do but
that was something that Netflix was
doing from the start right it probably I
felt like I took Netflix maybe at least
maybe two or three years after they
started getting popular to start
actually putting out real original
content shows that people started to
then go to as a destination spot yeah I
feel like even longer like yeah I've
been five or six years maybe the DVD
sharing yeah that's true that's true
like that's that's a long time to build
a business yeah so maybe like ten years
yeah it took a while so so also they
have to get the right producers and the
right directors and the right content
you know yeah Netflix isn't afraid to go
through $20,000,000 exactly how many guy
and a comedian or you know some producer
to go make something and then completely
be out of their way yeah I mean just
give them money go do what you're gonna
do we're not gonna say apples like
almost doing the opposite you know we're
gonna make a show about apps on Apple
and you know and other things like that
and I beats music stuff you know it's
it's very niche to their audience oh
yeah I almost like commercials for there
and that's what I remember when Eddy Cue
talked about the content they're like
we're only gonna work on the stuff that
strategically makes sense for Apple yeah
it's like how about making good shows
that people even care about a funny
comment and the periscope was DC Fox
said carpool karaoke greater than
transparent dot dot dot said no one it's
transparent won an Emmy I
karaoke win an Emmy it's it's the thing
also I mean if we talk about content so
I'll go on a little tangent here and
everyone can relate
so Netflix right Netflix is starting
just have so much content like I was for
the first time I was kind of hanging
around it was a hot weekend I'm like I'm
just gonna stay inside and just chill
and you have a choice to watch like a
really super in-depth potentially
depressing documentary or a light show
so avoiding the heavy documentaries
lately but I feel I feel like I don't
know if how everyone else feels about
this you guys can even callin about this
if you want but I feel Netflix is now
opening the floodgates with content some
of these documentaries that I've been
watching and yes you could say
documentaries by nature may not
necessarily be a two sided story but I
felt like this one I call saw what the
health was so skewed on one side of like
this is everything you can't eat tell me
they didn't tell me I got an hour
through it and they still didn't tell me
what I could they just told me I can't
eat chicken red meat lunch meats eggs
and fish I'm like yeah how am I gonna
keep this tight if I can't that's a
problem with some documentaries too is
like you know it's like really the
producers point of view that's what I'm
saying right and people have made that
claim on many documentaries some of the
best documentaries you've ever seen
suffer Michael from Michael Moore right
people have been complaining about that
as well yeah so but when you start
having like all these documents you feel
like where's the other side of the story
is it just cuz Netflix is now such a big
machine they're like we would want
content just pump it Pump It Up pump it
out so I don't know it's awesome so we
just had a Netflix conversation in the
Apple Apple buy show yeah people are
calling this the Netflix cat cast in the
chat room now you know we did have some
do you want to take like a couple
follow-up questions from yeah yeah I
love that yes please do I love it when
you jump in with this stuff we did have
one about the let me see if I can scroll
back sorry just interrupt me sometimes
they can write them out again yeah I'm
trying to find there was a good one
about the
you know what I'm not being able to find
it right now but there was a good one
about give me the gist about the
facial-recognition unlocking your phone
yeah and they're wondering like what if
you get a suntan that was the funny way
yeah I don't know just it'll be up to
Apple III again I don't know if the skin
tone is a true indicator that is
prevents you from getting in or not
I don't know this right again it's just
one of the aspects of their facial
recognition system we don't know exactly
how it's gonna be implemented yeah and
then we give you a white pasty skin you
think your dead body and it doesn't work
I don't know a cold dead body I don't
know
and then like totally just jumping
around people were making a lot of calm
comments about the home pod and like
we're talking about how expensive it was
and some people are saying like if it's
under $300 maybe like 350 s too high
it's under $300 maybe I think when you
look competitively with what is out
there knowing that Apple puts a premium
on it I think there are those borderline
people that are still curious are
willing to give it a spin at like a sub
300 price like 249 doesn't seem like
something Apple do you find $2.99 but
we'll see
III they're gonna stick to this 349
price we'll see how we'll again I'm
really interested in I don't see how
it's gonna play out long I think it's
gonna I think they'll force it through
and make it stick around but I just
don't know how many people can actually
buy it yeah yeah sometimes Apple like
gives in pretty quickly
yeah and one one more thing I just
wanted to mention that guy said that was
useful was restoring your Apple watch
yeah Kenny I know there's a tool called
IBUs that lets you connect your watch to
iTunes and restore it directly
that's from Mota not a-- m but it's not
an apple it's not an apple I know it's
not an Apple song I don't think of
someone else helped put it together okay
yeah that's good that's good check that
out that's just the three things I saw
in the chat room that I felt worth
mentioning
sounds like a BuzzFeed video three
things three things I saw in this video
worth mentioning
yeah all right you know what let's just
jump into the phone calls and just see
what's shakin bacon we have a couple
this week but again to be a part of the
show the number is 1-866-376-8255 even
Ohio and I had a question for Brian I
I'm thinking about buying an Apple
MacBook Air 11
I don't like newer models and don't buy
the port let me know it's a good idea
not ok have a nice day bye
I this is a tricky one because its heart
we get a lot honestly we get a lot of
calls about people asking like what
should I buy based on this
and we don't want it the good thing is
that we didn't have the many calls
because we didn't do a show last week
yeah but it's hard for me to always just
throw out a complete recommendation not
knowing exactly what you want to do with
it but if you're not impressed with the
touch bar stuff quite honestly and
you're just looking for phone that can
surf the web and do email and word
processing so like you know basically
school - you know work type stuff and
you want to be portable
I'm down with either and based on your
budget if you're talking about the
MacBook Air I'm down with that even if
you want to move a little slimmer and
you have the extra change to drop on it
the MacBook is finally to me powered
enough where I'm like hey you know what
it's a more than capable machine the
super slim MacBook but when we're
talking about the MacBook Air 11 it's
that is one of my favorite form factors
that Apple put out of a laptop Oh check
this out there's a few for sale one on
YouTube Apple certified refurbished oh
this is great on 11 inches 11.6 inch
MacBook Air for 929 that still seems
very expensive to me it is for a 2004
pretty old which one it doesn't say the
year on it 2015 that's exactly what
she's looking at that's what she's
looking at huh so the since you just
brought this up in my mind yeah
obviously go to Apple's store and go
look for refurbished the reason why if
you're looking for an older machine when
you purchase it it is still covered by
the same exact warranty which would be a
year standard warranty that comes on the
machine it's all covered by that so it's
not like you're buying a machine that's
not covered in it the way that they do
their reverbs it's it's like having a
brand new machine so you're covered by
the same as I can warranty is a brand
new one and it's cheaper I think that's
the way to go quite honestly if you
haven't thought about that already
that's definitely the way to go do that
definite well you're in that if you're
not I thought she said 2010 that's
that's going back a little too far I
think like I don't even know if then
latest software would work doing works
you can try you can try but it won't it
just want to hang so this is the deal
right here 929 baby 929 you out of your
mind oh yeah you're mine 50% off not
really alright beats I think that's
gonna wrap it up for this week next week
we're gonna have a sit-down interview
you with one of my good friends Joe
Chaplin skeet yeah we're gonna talk
about apps the app store the current
state of Apple with how they're treating
its developers and also just like I
gotta talk to him about the iOS 11 App
Store layout I'm just like yeah nah bro
no one has any questions please call and
dial this number and leave us a message
to ask him questions I'm sure he can
answer a lot of great question but again
we'll take all your calls on everything
as normal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
