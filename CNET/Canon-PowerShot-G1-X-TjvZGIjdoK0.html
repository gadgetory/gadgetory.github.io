CNET and this is the canon powershot g1x
what'd you think about the g1 X depends
upon whether you view it as a cheap
alternative to the fujifilm x100t to a
lot of other fixed and interchangeable
lens models because the price of the
camera sets it apart from the crowd as
much as its largest sensor and despite
delivering on image quality and having a
pretty nice shooting design the lens and
to a lesser extent the shooting
performance hold it back from being
worth the price its bigger heavier and
boxier than the G 12 and it uses a
pop-up rather than a front-mounted flash
but the g1 X nevertheless looks and
feels quite similar to its older sibling
overall I like the design though the
function button behavior can get a
little frustrating unlike other cameras
which automatically hide the menu when
you press the shutter button
tannaz remains until you press the
function button again as a result I free
only found myself scrolling around the
options when I thought I was changing
the shutter speed I like the flip and
twist LCD it's bright and big and then
the optical viewfinder is quite small it
is still useful to have the buttons and
dials feel responsive and well laid out
many of the new features like the multi
area white balance and intelligent image
stabilization launched with the s100 and
they only work in auto mode the
intelligent image stabilization auto
detects what type of stabilization is
necessary in both still and video modes
and the updated white balance does
better scene analysis the camera also
introduces face recognition and can
store up to 12 faces with some limited
associated metadata you'll also find a
bunch of multi shot modes including a 5
shot HDR mode though I find canons
implementations just ok like the G 12 it
has a built in neutral density filter
which I like well the camera gets high
marks for photo quality it's not
significantly better than cheaper ilcs
like the olympus EPL 3 or the Sony
nex-5n one advantage that Canon does
retain over its rivals is its excellent
JPEG processing and noise reduction
which allows it to produce
dream we clean photos as high as ISO 400
and seriously usable ones up through ISO
3200 color and exposure looked great as
well the lens has good Center sharpness
but it's not that great on the edges
movies look fine for casual shooting
they've got decent sharpness and
exposure with minimal rolling shutter
but there's quite a bit of aliasing and
there's a relatively narrow tonal range
unfortunately the g1x gets relatively
low marks for performance in part
because of its sluggish shot-to-shot
speed it's even slower than the G 12 and
in part because of some really
disappointing lens characteristics the
camera doesn't feel a sluggish to shoot
with as the data would imply but also I
probably didn't notice because I spent a
disproportionate amount of time dealing
with the small aperture lens and it's
bizarre focusing distance constraints I
really would expect a wider than f/2
maximum aperture on an $800 camera but
more important I expect it to be a lot
faster than f5 8 at its longest
telephoto not only does that compare
poorly with similar focal ranges on the
less expensive olympus XC 1 and Fujifilm
x10 but it's worse in practice it's only
f28 at 28 millimeters by about 30 1.5
millimeters it's already jumped to f3 2
and it narrows about halfway down the
focal range and that's it and that's
only one problem the other is the lenses
minimum focusing distance it can only
focus as close as 7.9 inches and that's
in macro mode and standard focus it's
more normal 1.3 feet also annoying the
camera can only auto switch between
macro and standard focus modes in
complete auto that means unlearning
habits about lens settings and spending
too much time jumping in and out of
macro modes a lot of people think that
canons missing out by lagging in its
interchangeable lens camera development
and it is the g1x targets a growing part
of the market which is composed of
people who don't really care about
changing lenses and just want better
photo quality but ironically it's
disappointing lens makes a better case
for getting an ILC
this price segment than for buying this
fixed limbs option I'm Laurie Brennan
