today we're gonna be taking an inside
look at how different kinds of light
bulbs actually operate what do I mean by
inside look
up first this incandescent light bulb
that I just obliterated is the classic
light bulb of Thomas Edison and it works
by way of a tungsten filament inside of
the bulb and a tungsten is a very dense
robust chemical element and when
electricity passes through it it gets
really hot and really bright putting out
the light that you get from Aleppo the
problem there is that a lot of that
electrical energy gets released as heat
not light the tungsten filament can
handle it because it's so robust but it
doesn't make for a terribly efficient
process and that brings us right to our
next bulb the halogen now halogens are
basically just the same thing as
incandescent but they have an extra
trick inside to help bump the efficiency
up let's take a closer look now see the
filament it's enclosed in this little
chamber or at least it was before I
smashed it there we go it's enclosing
this little chamber that's filled with
gas usually bromine or iodine that gas
helps to recycle the Berghof tungsten
back onto the filament and then extend
the lifespan and help it put out more
light using less energy now if you want
something even more efficient you might
consider a compact fluorescent light
bulb like this one here now compact
fluorescents are filled with a mix of
kind of harmful fluorescent gases that
you don't want to inhale so forgive me
for taking a little bit of extra
precautions here now they work because
the electricity coming in excites
mercury vapor inside of the bulb and
that in turn emits light that process
called fluorescence is what makes CFLs
more efficient than incandescent or
halogen but enough talk let's smash this
damn thing
now CFL bulbs are never see-through
because they come with a special
phosphorescent coating on the inside of
the bulb that white powder you see is
basically the same stuff it's a mix of
rare earth metals it aids in the
fluorescent process and helps the bulb
emit the right amount of light when you
clean it up you're gonna want to sweep
everything you can into a sealable
container like this one and then ideally
drop that off at your local recycling or
Waste Management Centre and don't use a
vacuum if you want to sweep as much as
you can up by hand first and then vacuum
if you have to that way you avoid
kicking things up into the air
unnecessarily now if all of this seems
like way too much of a hassle for you
then consider an LED bulb like this one
it's a much more efficient option than
that CFL and it doesn't contain any
mercury either now LEDs are usually made
out of plastic and thus a little more
durable than other kinds of bulbs but
fortunately for us we've got one here
that's made out of glass
now LED stands for light-emitting diode
and the diodes in question are these
little yellow guys inside the bulb right
here there are actually little junctions
with two notes when electricity passes
through it jumps from one node to the
other and that releases light in a
process called electro luminescence it's
dramatically more efficient than the
bulbs of Thomas Edison and though it
cost a lot more upfront it'll save you a
lot over the long-run well thanks for
watching us smash the light bulbs hope

bulbs and feeding our LED reviews and
