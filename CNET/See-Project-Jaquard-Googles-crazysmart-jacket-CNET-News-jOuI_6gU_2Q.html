great formal modifications the forms
have been adapted to be most useful for
the cyclist for example little things
like the backs a little longer than the
front so you don't have that unfortunate
gap when you're in your bike stands it's
also got a full
flex extension in the back so you've got
maximum range of motion and localized
venting to keep you cool and comfortable
on your ride it's got a knit storm cuff
right here so that it holds close
against your wrist and doesn't let wind
come up your sleeve when you're on your
bike but the real magic happens over
here on this sleeve so uh yeah I hope
you can see you can see fully responsive
to the touch of the wearer against the
it's just the fabric so there's a bunch
of different things that can do so
Yvonne let's pick a few that this will
yeah so this is kind of this is
application whoosh install the jacket
right now it's clothes 45 bird counter
they'll thank you I don't know Bertrand
City so we have music we installed music
and compass for you so you can control
this music encompasses pretty much all I
need I'd love to listen to music at my
bike I don't listen to this song right
there we go
that's my bike job ok now my next
meeting after this is gonna be over at
Levi's Stadium I know how to get there
but I just like to know how long it's
going to take yeah that's a good idea
your ETA is 41 minutes you should arrive
by 11:01 a.m. all right I gotta go okay
I gotta go I'm gonna make that ride I
got to get out of here alright thank you
much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
