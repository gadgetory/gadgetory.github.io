with toys I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update the annual III video
game trade show continues in Los Angeles
and a takeaway is that Sony's the clear
champion of the conference well at least
for the more serious gamer crowd Sony
had more to show off to persuade you to
buy a PlayStation 4 compared to
Microsoft's Xbox one presentation and as
for family-friendly Nintendo the company
is doing a barrel roll to keep the Wii U
fly-in with a new starfox game and
interactive toy figurines that are
similar to Skylanders but let's start
with Sony which has new products and a
new service to stream games later this
year you'll be able to buy a PlayStation
TV which is a small set-top box that
takes the PlayStation games you would
play on your portable Vita and streams
them to a television and if your penis
for us hooked up in the living room well
the PlayStation TV can stream those
games to a second TV set in the house
like say your bedroom it was launched
last year in Japan but now is heading to
the US and Canada for $99 Sony is also
making a white version of the ps4 and in
September you can buy it bundled with
the game destiny PlayStation now is a
new service that lets you stream video
games the beta testing begins July 31st
and Sony hasn't set the prices yet
Microsoft didn't show off any new
hardware services last year Microsoft
faced a backlash over some Xbox one
features so this year it took a humble
tone and avoided any mention of the Xbox
one system or its abilities instead it
only highlighted games so if you were
undecided over which system to buy so DS
presentation was the better self
no contest Nintendo had a few fun game
announcements that could help boost
sales of the Wii U there are collector
toys called amiibo and just like
Skylanders these amiibos have a chip
inside that when you place it on top of
a gamepad controller it'll load your
character into the game and data is also
saved onto the toy now
first work with Super Smash Brothers on
the Wii U and it will also be available
on other Nintendo games like Mario Kart
8 Nintendo also announced that in the
new Super Smash Brothers you could fight
as your own Mii character there's going
to be a Mario maker game in 2015 that
that'll let you build your own 2d Mario
level and starfox is returning the
popular Nintendo character is getting a
Wii U game where you'll have to move the
gamepad around to fly
that's your tech news update you can
find more in three news at cnet.com
