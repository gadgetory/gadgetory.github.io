and edward norton the movie revolves
around an actor trying to revitalize his
career after being typecast because he
played the superhero in a movie if you
haven't seen this building you really
should all around amazing performances
by everyone and the movie is shot in a
way unlike any movies and it popped up
in recent memory if you're a fan really
good cancel television shows check out
serenity and the Veronica Mars movie
they're both available starting on the
first start in august eighth catch the
hobbit the Battle of the five armies the

about itunes now apples getting plenty
of first-run movies in August but we've
got a highlight cop car starring Kevin
Bacon it arrives at theaters and itunes
on august fourteenth the plot seems
basic enough bacon plays a sheriff
trying to track down to kids who took a
cop car out for a joyride it looks
pretty intense and points to bacon for
that mustache look at the bacon stash
look at it let's get to your feedback in
a previous episode we mentioned a Wall
Street Journal report that's in hulu was
looking into an ad free tier of the
service that could cost between twelve
and fourteen dollars here's what you had
to say about it racing lova says I like
Hulu and all but the fact that we pay
for the service and there's still adds
annoys me i wouldn't pay more than eight
dollars per month for hulu i even
conducted a poll at google plus and
asked would you be willing to pay twelve
to fourteen dollars for an ad free hulu
here are the results 240 votes and
sixty-nine percent of you said
nope thanks to everyone for your
feedback as for my opinion I can see
paying more money for ad free content if
it were downloadable for offline
consumption I guess we'll wait and see
for a complete list of what's coming and
going on HBO now and what free TV shows
in first-run movies you can get it
itunes head on over to cnet com / net
