iPhone 6 or 6 plus and love taking
photos I'm going to show you a few ways
on how to get the most out of the camera
plus some apps for better looking photos
and the best part is that most of these
tips will even work on older iPhones as
long as you've upgraded to iOS 8 let's
start with some basics if this is your
first iPhone then there are three ways
to launch the camera one from the lock
screen swipe up on the camera icon to
tap on the app icon and three swipe up
from the bottom of the screen in any app
and hit the button take a burst of
images by pressing and holding the
shutter button down in photo mode or you
can press and hold the volume button
instead this is also going to help you
keep shots stable when shooting in
landscape orientation
change the direction of panoramas by
tapping the arrow like so you can also
take them vertically or horizontally
shooting in bright outdoor situations
use your hand to cup around the lens
like so in order to reduce lens flare
and the amount of light entering the
camera for the video lovers out there
you can switch the camera to shoot at 60
frames per second rather than the
default 30 head to settings and then
photo and camera and turn the toggle on
on the main camera screen you can adjust
exposure compensation by simply tapping
anywhere to bring up this box and then
sliding up and down the sunshine icon to
adjust the brightness as you like if
you've already taken some photos you can
fine-tune thanks to some new editing
options find your image and open it up
and then press edit in the top right
hand corner here three icons across
you'll see it controls I'll tap this and
then you'll be presented with a whole
bunch of different options such as
highlights shadows brightness and
contrast and then you can adjust these
as you're lacking and save it to a new
image
there's also heaps of other apps
available that let you have more serious
exposure control two of my favorites of
the ESCO can and manual can both give
you control over aspects like focused
white
and exposure remember that because the
iPhone has a fixed aperture lens you can
only adjust the white balance and the
shutter speed not your f-stop finally if
you've got two iOS devices you can use
one to trigger the camera in the other
download the camera plus app and install
it on both devices turn on Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth on both and then choose the
err snap option on one phone select the
name of the other device on the screen
and then you'll get a live view of what
the other camera is seeing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
