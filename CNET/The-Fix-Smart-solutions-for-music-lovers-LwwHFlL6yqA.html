episode is all about music it's crazy to
think about how much music technology
has changed over the past 10 years with
CDs than with iPods and smartphones
leaving tablets pretty soon we're all
gonna be streaming music straight to our
Facebook goggles but we're not there yet
in that spirit going out with the old
and in with the new we're looking at new
ways to hear music you waste a fine
music anyways to kiss your old CDs
goodbye first up we're taking a look at
the best ways to hear music from
subscription music services in this post
iTunes era if you've never used a
subscription-based music service before
finding the one that works for you may
feel a bit daunting but I'm going to
show you some of the ins and outs of
this convenient and affordable way to
listen to music so why would you want to
use one of these services anyway well
for one they offer access to multiple
millions of songs also you won't have to
worry about any kind of music library
management since it's all organized for
you in the cloud in addition most
services offer free trials lasting
anywhere from a week to a month with no
long-term commitment so what's the
downside well you don't actually own
this music you're basically renting it
for a while and when you in your
subscription your playlist and the songs
you've chosen go away unless you re
subscribe also you won't find every
single song on these services The
Beatles for example are largely
unavailable and new music isn't
immediately available on these services
in addition to artists that actually
make this music don't make much money
when you listen to their streams salt
you want to support your favorite band
or artist there are much better ways to
do so overall there are way more perks
for these services especially if you're
a music fan so how do they work well
Spotify for example is one of the more
popular music based services and it
works on your tablet your phone or your
computer
now you can download it for free and
once you're signed in you can start
searching for songs or artists you want
to listen to as long as you have an
internet connection now you don't have
to pay to listen but if you go to free
route you won't have as much flexibility
as you would if you subscribed you can
search for individual songs albums and
artists but if you're not subscribed
you'll have to listen to periodic audio
ads geico 15 minutes could save you
fifteen percent or more also the free
version of spotify on your tablet or
computer will play any song you can find
now if you're listening to on your phone
you won't actually be able to play
specific songs and you could really only
play albums or playlist in shuffle mode
if you subscribe you won't have to
listen to ads and you can play any song
you can find on any device paying the
fee also lets you download music to
listen to later other services like
radio work much in the same way giving
you some access for free but then
opening up all available features once
you actually start paying there are
plenty of music services out there and
they each have their own advantages and
disadvantages but the great thing is
that you can try most of them for free
and determine which one works best for
you it all speaks to how we consume
media these days paying the monthly fee
to have access to tons of content that
may not work in every medium but for
music it seems pretty tailor-made it has
never been a better time to be a music
fan all that music just right there at
your fingertips it's time for a quick
break and when we come back we'll be
cranking up your new music on some
wireless speakers
you
welcome back now if you're still living
in that CD or iTunes era chances are the
sound in your home still revolves around
a home stereo or maybe some awful
sounding clock radio but it doesn't have
to be that way without spending a bunch
of money or running cables all over your
house you can get sound in every room of
your home cuz honestly so you've got
Barry White playing in the bedroom truly
haven't lived if you want a way to
stream music from your phone to multiple
speakers throughout the house there's a
new product that lets you do just that
it's called rocky and each one of these
devices is forty nine dollars and you'll
need one for each speaker you want to
stream to but what's great is that you
can use speakers you already own here's
how to get started first plug in a rocky
device to each speaker and what's great
about Rocky is that you can get these
colorful covers to either match your
speaker or help distinguish one rocky
from another in this case I got green
pink and orange lots of fun colors in my
collection okay so you just plug in a
rocky through a line in port then turn
it on using its little power button here
and once it's on you'll see the LED
light here and you should hear a voice
command telling you it's ready to be set
up I've successfully started hotspot
mode there you go now you know you're
ready to set up everything else in the
app but first I have two more speakers I
need a set up I've successfully started
hotspot mode I've successfully started
hotspot mode great all of my Rockies are
in hotspot mode which means I can move
on and finish the setup in the app
basically how rocky works is instead of
using bluetooth it sets up its own
private Wi-Fi network that's how you're
able to control multiple speakers
through one phone there you go I have
three Rockies and I'll just set up each
one one by one
I know that it's talking about this
rocky because the LED here is red so
i'll set my color that's my green rocky
pick a name green now i'll just select
my Wi-Fi network I've successfully
started hotspot mode all right my first
rocky is set up now i'll set up two
other speakers I've successfully
connected to your Wi-Fi router cool my
Rocky is set up now I'll do the next one
all of my Rockies are set up and I know
they're ready to go because when I tap
the green bar at the top of the app I
can see every single one of them now
before I start streaming music to them
I'm going to go set them up in each room
so all of my Rockies are set up
throughout the house and now I can
stream music to them one thing to know
is that right now rocky only supports
music you have stored locally on your
device but more streaming apps like
Spotify and Pandora are coming really
soon for now I've got a little Aloha
screwdriver here so first thing I want
to do is tap the green bar choose my
rocky I've got my green rocky right in
front of me hit play and I should hear
it straight into that device
nice now I can do the same thing for the
other speakers tap the top bar choose my
speaker pick a song and it'll stream to
that speaker too
now anytime I want to pause play or
choose a different song for any rocky
I'll just head to the top I'll choose
pink one in the kitchen and then from
the left menu here I could just choose
another song or just pause it all
together Rocky is great because it's
really the first of its kind and
currently the only device that lets you
stream music from your phone to multiple
wireless speakers but we should see some
competitors come into the mix in the
future all right so now you know all the
best new ways to stream music and play
it around your house but what are you
gonna do with that box of CD is that
still in your closet well you got to do
something a lot of new computers aren't
even coming with disk drives anymore to
play those things I'm going to show you
how to rip those into your computer and
kick those CDs out of your house
there is no reason to be holding on to
your CDs anymore between iTunes and
Spotify and about a hundred other
services anything you've listened to can
be downloaded again or streamed at your
convenience but there are some
exceptions you're probably holding on to
a box full of rare sentimental mix CDs
that you haven't yet gotten onto your
computer and let go of I'm gonna show
you how to do that quickly and
painlessly so here's what you're going
to need you're going to need a computer
with the CD Drive and itunes on it could
be any version of itunes you're gonna
need your CDs and you're gonna need a
smartphone the first step is to take a
picture of your CD now this one is a
great example this is a CD I got from a
friend in Japan this cover this is what
I'm sentimental about so I'm gonna take
a picture of this and if you can put
this into square mode that's gonna
really save yourself some time and some
cropping take the picture boom and then
email it to yourself so now the next
step is to get the CD into your computer
now once the cds in itunes is gonna
automatically try to pull down any
information that it might have about the
CD it's gonna try it's best to identify
the tracks and the titles but in this
case because this is a one-of-a-kind CD
itunes is gonna draw a blank it's gonna
give me a generic listing called audio
CD and generic tracks called track 1
through 14 so the trick is we need to
identify all this information ourselves
to do that hit the CD info button i'm
just going to put my friend's name on
here the artist album is going to be CD
from japan that's probably how I'll
remember it
alright the next step here is to import
the CD you go and hit the import CD
button in the top right corner you're
gonna get a box that will let you change
how you're gonna import the CD for me
there's more about sentimentality than
about audio quality I'll go with an AAC
at about 128 kilobits per second it's
gonna give you better quality than mp3
at about the exact same amount of time
if you're really gonna go crazy with the
steps can go all the way up to lossless
audio quality but after you do a few of
these you're gonna realize that speed is
much more important than audio file
quality
all right now I've got the CD in our
library with album artwork one more tip
though if you want to add more images
than just that one to your album you can
go track by track hit get info and add a
separate image you get creative alright
so that's the entire process for
digitizing your CDs into your iTunes
library now for an extra added value you
can take advantage of Apple's iTunes
Match service where for 2499 a year you
can upload all the stuff to the cloud
and have it backed up and be able to
stream it back to any of your Apple
devices that's it for this week's show
we hope you learned something or at
least got inspired to listen to some new
music let us know what you think about
the show leave us some feedback let us
know what you'd like to see in an
upcoming episode you can leave some
feedback over on Cena's blog or you can
tweet me at Donald see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
