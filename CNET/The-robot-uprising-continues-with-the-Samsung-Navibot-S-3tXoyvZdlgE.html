comma taking a first look at this and
that nanobot s robot vacuum now this
robot vacuum is only available in Korea
right now but Simpson says it might make
its way to the US and what makes it
unique is that it uses something called
visionary mapping technology it's
actually that Hydra camera on the top of
the vacuum that spans the ceiling of
your room to figure out what the best
route is to navigate that room
it also has 12 sensors around the device
to figure out where and the furnitures
in the room so doesn't bump into those
things now what blew me away about this
device is that you can actually remotely
access the camera from your smartphone
so if you're away from home you can see
what the vacuum is seeing and if your
dog is hanging out on the couch where he
shouldn't be you can actually send an
audio message telling him to get off the
couch it's only 3.5 inches tall so they
can actually slip under couches in small
spaces where a lot of dust flux and if
the robot detects a lot of dust it'll
actually spin around three times to make
sure that area is really clean there's
also an option to purchase a docking
station so it's a Navigon detects that
it's completely full of dust it'll go
over that docking station empty itself
and then continue
there is no pricing and of course we're
waiting for it to become available in
the US but we'll keep you updated when
that outfit before for cnet.com I'm
