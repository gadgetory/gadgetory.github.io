a look at the brand new Dell XPS 13 this
is of course Dells first ultra book
you've seen us talk about this a little
bit at the very end of 2011 and then
more detailed hands-on look at CES just
a month or so ago well now we've
actually got the final product here and
it really is Dells version of that ultra
book super thin form factor that's
becoming so popular now and of course as
you can see just by taking a look at it
it's very macbook air like they're
really not even trying to pretend it's
something else there is one big
difference between this 13-inch laptop
and the 13-inch MacBook Air the Dell XPS
13 actually has a smaller footprint if
you look at it compared to some other
13-inch laptop to go well that's really
small Dell claims it's closer to an 11
inch laptop footprint even though they
crammed in the 13-inch screen
it's really somewhere in between this
thing is bigger than the 11 inch MacBook
Air but it's smaller than the 13-inch
MacBook Air and because it has the
bigger screen in it with the edge to
edge Gorilla Glass over the entire
display it actually feels a little bit
denser and heavier than you're thinking
we're just looking at it they're a bunch
of other cool features that we liked on
here backlit keyboard always welcomed
big glass click pan again something we
really expect to see on an ultrabook
these days you are gonna find not quite
as many ports and connections as you
maybe used to on a 13-inch laptop
there's one USB to one USB 3 I'd Lee
they have DisplayPort for video output
instead of HDMI and no matter how hard
you look there's no SD card slot on this
even Apple has an SD card slot on the
13-inch MacBook Air although not on the
11 the Dell XPS 13 run standard Intel
Core i5 and core i7 CPU is the basic
$9.99 version we have here has a 128 gig
SSD that's really where you want to be
with an ultrabook right now and you
could trade up for a few hundred dollars
more and get a faster processor and get
a 256 gig SSD I did like especially the
little battery meter on the side that's
something we used to see in a lot of
laptops you don't see that too often now
I like just being able to take a look
and see how much battery power I have
left so Dells come a little bit late to
the Ultrabook game in a way I'm glad
they waited because they put together a
very nice system there's not a lot about
it that's really gonna jump out at you
and go you know in your face look at me
I'm exciting instead it's well-made it's
got the components that you want they
got the price right $9.99 that's really
where you want to be in an ultrabook
these days and of course I really love
that they got the bigger 13-inch screen
into a smaller body I'm Dan Ackerman and
that is the Dell XPS 13</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
