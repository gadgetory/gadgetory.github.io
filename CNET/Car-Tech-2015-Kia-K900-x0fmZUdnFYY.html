bit pause get used to the concept of a
phrase you probably never thought you
hear a $66,000 PM we drive the 2015
all-new Kia k900 the flagship check the
deck
now I think you'll agree with me I'm
seeing a lot of jag XJ and XF in the
vehicles face and even in its side view
and rear 3/4 which is not a bad
benchmark but kind of an odd one overall
the design is not audacious daring or
cutting any new direction for sure I
will point out one thing though you do
get standard LED headlights which remain
pretty exotic if you get one of the v8
cars let's get inside
and of course the Kingdom and Hunter
will be a non-starter if it wasn't
basically LCD everywhere 9 inch screen
up here in the centre stack great big
12.3 LCD instrument right in front of me
the LCD IP however is part of a special
VIP package you don't get that on every
single one of these and something new
for kia their first HUD their first
head-up display out there which looks
pretty good it'll give you speed your
next navin as well as blind spot lane
departure indications things like that
now let's go to the head unit first of
all let's start with our media sources
nothing too surprising here all the
things you want like satellite radio HD
radio broadcast radio USB aux jack
things of that nature it's all here
bluetooth streaming also it does a
pretty good job of bringing you the
information about the source you're
listening to and doing it in a way that
is very digestible by the way this is
not a touch head unit it's voice or knob
only but touching the screen will get
you nowhere
oh note this when you're on satellite
radio you've got a pause play in this as
well something we saw in GM cars a few
years ago there's no haptic feedback on
this controller says click click click
there's no handwriting recognition on
there like some of the recent outies
navigation screen quality is very good
tight dot pitch good labeling everything
is quite readable entering destinations
is not difficult at all by all the usual
ways that you would do so and of course
as I mentioned by voice 235 second
Street San Francisco please one quick
and painless easy to enter an address
via voice and it seems pretty good about
recognizing them that said there is no
live navigation search to destination or
open search on here apps in this car are
nothing to write home about they include
Yelp support and more importantly
Pandora but the latter oddly enough only
on iOS devices and only by a cable
so let's go to the UVO services this is
their idea of a connected telematics
base it's not that impressive though
it's basically OnStar on a little bit of
steroids maybe you've got roadside
assistance vehicle diagnostics and
repair information the parking minder is
fairly interesting let's say I just
parked the car I push this button and
it's now connecting to the U of L app
that's running on my phone and it just
sent this cars location to the phone I
can also go there and set up a timer to
remind me when the parking here runs out
my Pio eyes lets you send Pio eyes from
the internet from Google Maps let's say
so that they're ready right here in the
car but again I don't like to maintain
two basis of anything media destinations
I've already gone on my destinations on
my phone in my cloud services I don't
need to repopulate a set in my car so
this to me feels dated already
now of course car like this was a backup
camera on sensors on the bumpers but
notice what we have here also because
we've got this guy trimmed up all the
way you hear all my sensors going live
you can see that I'm getting graphical
indication on this overview map a
surround camera as well as many other
views I can select down here and they're
very easy to get to this is one of the
better layouts and actual expressions of
multi camera surround view out there now
the k900 boosts standard heated rear
seats with access to HVAC controls a
power sunshade and some panoramic roof
it stretches back there if you get the
VIP package you also get reclining back
seats cooled rear seats and a bunch of
other niceties in this case they're
benchmarking the Lexus LS blessedly they
don't have any dumb DVD rear seat
entertainment system standard or
optional I approve now here in the
engine bay is where you can clearly
realize that Kia understands you enter a
category like this of two luxury cars by
first establishing your baseline bona
fides this engine is a good example you
start off with big displacement no
trickery five liter v8 no turbo no
supercharger mounted longitudinally in
the engine bay driving those
the numbers are pretty impressive 420
horsepower 376 pound-feet of torque
0-60 happens in a spritely five and a
half seconds consuming this car weighs
over 4,500 pounds before you get in it
and the mpg is not bad at 1523 no
all-wheel drive variant is offered yet
though you can see that being perhaps a
market necessity down the road
now all that power comes back into the
car through a single choice 8-speed
automatic transmission with this shifter
here that is rather BMW like the top
three gears are overdrive by the way so
in a sense it's a five-speed for actual
involve driving you've got three drive
modes you've got eco normal and sport
and you can tell from a little info
graphic up here that eco handles
drivetrain tails it back normal is gonna
put you in your baseline mode sport is
going to amp up the response of the
powertrain the shift points as well but
also change a little bit of the assist
on the electric hydraulic steering rack
none of this though affects the
suspension this car does not have an
adaptive suspension sport mode also puts
you into a different gauge cluster up
here that I don't find this very
interesting I don't need both a dial
indication of my tach as well as a
readout of the RPM it's kind of just
silly interestingly when you're in sport
mode this car doesn't have a real sporty
interface on the controls you do have
the ability to shift over here but this
shifters kind of kind of fiddly in a way
and then there are no paddles on the
wheel either so getting this car in
sport mode doesn't get you far down the
road to sport ok under way you find out
right away this vehicle is aimed at
Lexus LS more than anything else that's
my estimation because it doesn't have
the sharp sort of broad enos sort of
Jacques in the three-piece suit kind of
DNN you find in BMWs and Audi's fairly
often it's even different than a
Mercedes this is definitely a lexus LS
field vehicle for example the power is
substantial you've got plenty of but
it's a little bit sleepy you've done a
unbundle a lot of gears no matter what
mode
to get that power to deliver once you do
you really want to shift this thing and
as I mentioned you don't have any
paddles so it's even harder to tap into
the goodness of this super silky be
enemies the smoothest riding most
comfortable cars I've driven there is
not a note of imprecision to it but I
want more guts sport mode helps of
course but it's not dramatically
different the ride quality as I said is
so unbelievably buttery it's very
impressive on the other hand it's got a
certain amount of this a certain amount
of gels in it that is not going to
please everybody and a bit of a bit of
body roll to it that I wasn't really
expecting however when you dive into a
corner on a twisty road it doesn't plow
the front end I've done a nice job with
the front end geometry so it doesn't
have this big sliding sloppy oversteer
but we are just floating along here yeah
like riding on a big puffy cloud okay
let's price RK 900 with the caveat that
when you're in this class of car there
is no right answer whether it's worth
the money or not because a lot of what's
going on in these kinds of vehicles is
image and prestige and that's a personal
call that said here are the numbers
sixty thousand four hundred delivered
for a v8 car which is pretty well loaded
there's only one thing you'll add to the
sheet to take it fully CNET's down
that's the VIP package here's what it
includes it bumps up a rear camera to
include those surround cameras you get
adaptive cruise control to go with the
blind spot and lane departure tech the
instrument panel goes from gauges to LCD
as we saw in this car
you also get Kia's first-ever head-up
display and you get more seat
adjustability as well including a big
bump in the rear seats which includes
the reclining the power lumbar the
active cooling ventilation to go with
the standard heating back they're all in
about 66 for who knew a Kia would ever
go there and do so pretty successfully</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
