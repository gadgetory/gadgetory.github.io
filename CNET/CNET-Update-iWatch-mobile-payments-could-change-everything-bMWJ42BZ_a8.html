for mobile payments I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update Apple will
reveal the next iPhone on Tuesday and
we're also expecting Apple to show off
its SmartWatch which many are calling
the I watch multiple news outlets report
that this new iPhone will have
technology for mobile payments and the
wall street journal reports that the
iWatch will also have this ability with
an NFC chip it would be something where
you can just tap your device to the
register to pay instead of swiping your
credit card this is not a new concept
for android owners who could do this for
years with Google Wallet on their phones
but the real game-changer here is doing
this with a watch forget the phone the
truth is it doesn't save you that much
time to take out a phone than it does to
take out a wallet you're still having to
pull out something from your pocket or
purse but SmartWatch payments are a
different story if Apple does this right
it actually would save time and make the
process seamless when you simply extend
your wrist forward to pay that my
friends is what will be the aha moment
to using mobile payments and if c-tec
can be used for other things too what if
you could unlock the front door to your
home with a watch tap instead of
fumbling with your keys when you're
carrying groceries or pay for train
tickets instantly when you hop aboard
seeing a text message pop up and how far
you walked yeah that's cute but NFC
payments will be the x factor that shows
the worth of a SmartWatch but will
people trust Apple with their credit
cards when celebrities can't trust to
have naked photos on iCloud Apple has
been criticized for its iCloud security
and to answer those critics Apple CEO
Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal
that changes are coming so that you will
get an email alert and a push
notification when someone's trying to
upload your cloud data to a new device
or change the password or win a new
computer logs into an account for the
first time many of these celebrity
accounts were compromised because
hackers could guess their security
questions but back to smartwatches
Apple's iWatch will only be a
game-changer if you don't need to keep
recharging it three times a day so
battery is going to be a big
dr. too along with style it's a
challenge that's also faced by the new
hero of the Android watches the moto 360
Motorola Smart Watch is now on sale for
two hundred and fifty dollars but in our
early time spent with it the battery
lasted about a day it also looks pretty
big on a thin wrists like mine but
according to the New York Times Apple
may be addressing that problem by
creating two different sizes for its
SmartWatch that's your tech news update
you can get a closer look at the Moto
360 and other smartwatches at cnet com
and we'll be covering the apple
announcement live on Tuesday at ten a.m.
Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern from our studios
in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
