is your first look at the Samsung Galaxy
appeal now this is an AT&amp;amp;T go phone it's
a prepaid phone and one of the
interesting things about it is it is a
texting phone with a keyboard right here
keyboard is spacious and roomy which is
great but unfortunately it wasn't very
comfortable for my fingers when I
started composing longer messages I felt
like I really want it to stop
there is definitely a virtual keyboard
on here you've got a couple choices
there swipe there's the Android keyboard
and there's the Samsung keyboard as well
screen size is fairly small it's 3.2
inches which makes it compact I'm just a
basic screen here the specs are pretty
modest there's a 3.2 megapixel camera on
the back there's an 800 megahertz
processor running the show it is 3G only
it's also powered by Android 2.3
Gingerbread so it may not be upgradable
to android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich one
thing I noticed about the camera which
has no flash and no autofocus is that
you can get some pretty good shots out
of it if you get really lucky and set to
focus yourself also if there's an
abundance of natural light
but you might just end up with some
pretty bad photos as well the galaxy
appeal is gonna cost 148 dollars and
eighty eight cents on June 5th at
Walmart and it will cost $149.99 at AT&amp;amp;T
stores on June 15th
I'm Jessica Dahl Courtin for Cena this
is the samsung galaxy appeal in a dainty
gopher</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
