here and instead of burying the lede I'm
just gonna come out and say it
the fourth generation iPad is our
favorite tablet of the year how does it
compare to the new iPad you know the old
one released in March
well this latest version of the tablet
has an upgraded front facing camera and
a new a 6 X processor that's it what the
iPad lacks in new features it more than
makes up with older awesome features
like its premium build quality that app
store and a deep and robust media
ecosystem supporting the best in movies
music TV shows games books and apps its
speed and performance has also
noticeably increased thanks to his new
processor app selection is still the
single most impressive iPad trait if
there's an app worth having it'll likely
be on the App Store before anywhere else
from cool finance apps to tons of
educational cooking and productivity
apps to a whole fraggin section of apps
for healthcare professionals if you're
interested in doing things on a tablet
you know like useful fun things this is
your place now given the iPads graphical
capabilities I really wanted to single
out games
I'm not what some would call a casual
gamer I play console games and I still
game on the PC and yet I still love
playing games on this thing like with
general apps the iPad has the most best
and best looking games of any tablet
platform while you eventually find some
of these games on Android the vast
majority of the time the best version is
the iPad version some of my favorites
that really show off the system's
horsepower are Nova 3 wild blood and
meat for Speed Most Wanted now the iPads
resolution isn't as high as the Nexus 10
but the iPads deep black level superior
color reproduction and overall higher
polygon pushing horsepower more than
makes up for that I also love just how
smooth and zippy it performs when
navigating from menu
across screens and when opening apps
there's just a quickness here that
really outshines anything else at an
average brightness that iPad lasts over
14 hours playing a local movie at 720p
which again no other tablet has been
able to rival the iPad is an excellent
tablet but it's not perfect if you want
deep OS customization options you'll
want to look elsewhere namely the latest
version of Android jelly bean
specifically the Nexus 7 or Nexus 10 and
for getting any real work done on the
tablet the iPad pales in comparison to
the Microsoft Surface with its
comfortable keyboard cover and the
inclusion of office also at 500 bucks
for 16 gigabytes you're paying more for
less storage compared to other leading
tablets and speaking of storage there is
no microSD option still when it comes to
speed battery life and an incredibly
large and very App Store media ecosystem
the iPad has no equal once again this is
