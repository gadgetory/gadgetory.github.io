today and the first one is iMovie for
ipad and we have a long history of video
editing we're the largest supplier of
video editing software in the world we
think and I movie for ipad is in that
tradition it's got a precision editor on
it multitrack audio recording this is
not a toy you can really edit movies on
this thing it's got new themes you can
air play your video right to apple TV
from the application you can share your
videos in HD with some really popular
sites and it's a universal app so what
will also run in the iphone when we
start out the app you can see our really
nice new home screen with the old-time
theater really gorgeous display here you
can see each of your projects has its
own little poster there's a thumbnail of
the movie and the poster is based on the
theme that's in the project you can just
scroll back and forth between these
works great in portrait it also works
really nicely in landscape and this
looks really great on the retina display
of the iphone 4 on the ipod touch as
well let's go ahead and do a little bit
editing so i'm going to scroll down here
now i can actually use there's a camera
button on the right that i can use to
they used a camera of the ipad 2 2
record directly in the timeline or i can
go for my video bin now i can just press
and hold on a clip and i can skim my
finger back and forth to take a look at
the video before it's been placed into
the timeline or i can just tap on a clip
and then i get two handles so i can
actually choose the segment of the video
that i want to put in and we have two
different clips here I'll put in a piece
of that one select the second clip
another shot of that the girl going in
the water so we'll pick kind of a
corresponding position there tap that
drops into the timeline and we've got to
cross dissolve between if we want to do
a more precise edit for the ipad 2 we
have a precision editor so i can do a
reverse pinch apart bring up the
precision editor and now i can see all
the content of the clip on the left
before and after the edit and all the
content for the clip on the right
i also have full control over the
transition we can double tap and we can
set that to none so that will make a cut
I can press and hold on the top dot and
that allows me to choose the point
within that video where we want to end
so we'll pick a spot kind of which she
goes out over the water now i can press
and hold on the lower dot and do the
same thing so we can make this kind of
look like just a cut in the same shot i
can press and hold on the center dot as
well and i can roll the edit i can add
and subtract frames from both sides
simultaneously when I want to take a
look we just back up a little bit and
hit play really easy to keep going and
adjust your edits to get things just the
way that you want and with a pinch we
close it up</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
