the Honda Civic there's a whole new one
that was just unveiled and is on the way
so let's get a taste of the final
chapter of generation 9 as we drive this
si sedan with all the tech toys and
check the 10
this generation began as the model year
2012 here in the US and it was kind of
let's not put it softly hated people
gave it knocks for bland exterior
styling a cheap tacky plastic interior
and boring driving dynamics nothing to
work on there in the thirteen and
fourteen model years Honda really rework
the Civic while keeping it on this same
generation and now it's ending its life
as we just got the announcement of the
tenth generation 2016 but that's another
video now this si level has always been
basically Honda's answer to lets
analogize it to a VW GTI affordable
reachable good everyday car but sporty
fast and fun this remains the top of the
stack until that next generation arrives
when for the first time we'll also be
able to get the Civic type-r stay tuned
for that
now the first thing you're gonna have to
deal with when you buy an SI is that no
matter what color you get on the outside
you've always got red seats with black
bolsters doesn't really work for me but
maybe you're 20 now the SI models have
the same basic - structure as any other
Civic but of course they lose eco assist
which is a greenie training gauge and
other civics have and instead they get
that rev limiter and shift indicator on
the upper left of the eyebrow display
you've got a 5 inch what they call a mid
helper display over there with several
different menu modes and of course a
giant tach right in front of the wheel
very si
now all these sis are gonna come with
this 7 inch touch head unit up here
which is very much like a single glass
panel they've eschewed a lot of knobs
and buttons you have some down here for
climate but basically nothing for
infotainment everything is via touch
whether it's the home button the volume
slider or the submenu
now having navigation in this head unit
is optional and with that comes
satellite radio HD radio a multi angle
rear camera and a bunch of other things
we'll look at that in the pricing see if
it's worth it
but even if you go stripped on an SI you
do get a rear cam you also get this guy
over here which is what they call their
Lane watch camera standard I find it one
of the best things Honda does with a
camera gives you a very useful look down
the far side of the car when you either
make a right turn signal or just press
the button on the stalk now the
navigation system seems like it hasn't
changed since Nixon was in office and
it's never impressed me it's perfectly
serviceable but honda have nothing to
write home about it is of course voice
command able and has live traffic by a
satellite radio which is bundled in with
the navigation option even if you go
without it though and lose Sat radio and
HD radio I think you might do okay
you've got basic bluetooth streaming you
have a USB port here you've got another
one in the console there's an HDMI jack
down there which is kind of exotic and
of course you have AM and FM radio and
there's an optical disc slot as well
these guys are on board with carplay and
android auto but you won't see it in
this generation we're gonna look for
that later on down the road perhaps in
the 16s drive controls are real simple
on this car primarily because it only
has one transmission choice the 6-speed
manual there is no automatic of any kind
on an inside
now if you buy an outside products the
biggest motivator is because you're
gonna get a Honda VTEC engine in this
case a 2.4 liter sidesaddle in line for
that breathes naturally no turbos or
superchargers in these cars they're
pretty basic stuff but boy do they run
nice and high and super smooth 205
horsepower 174 pound-feet of torque all
out to the front wheels of course by the
way through a standard limited slip
differential
now this Si Sedan weighs just a hair
over 3,000 pounds that's light by
today's standards so 0 to 60 is pretty
readily accomplished in a nice tidy six
and a half seconds your mpg of course at
the Honda is not bad 22:31
and an SI does drink premium standard
civic caddy with lady first thing you
notice about an inside there's a green
engine at VTEC mouth drain this thing
stays on cam and breathes readily at any
point on the tack the clutch feels
really good not too light not
agonizingly heavy on the other hand I'm
not a huge fan of the gearbox which is
gonna surprise a lot of folks the first
half mitts pretty good and then it
starts to get real kind of tight and
under Gosha below Veron 4 5 and 6 not a
gating that I really like to be honest
you got to think to make sure you're
gonna hit fourth and not second on some
of these down shifts or third versus
fifth the space in here is very good the
Peugeot is excellent in this cabin I
love this two-tiered dashboard always
have on these civics and everything is
sort of plain that you in a way that's
easy to reach easy to see the car corner
is nicely predictably and quite flatly
in a way that doesn't bring any undue
harshness with it I do find some torque
steer more than I see in many cars
everything in this cabin by the way
feels really solid if you haven't driven
a Civic in a lot of years you think of
it as kind of a cheap car kind of stuff
being that quite a while ago now a
couple things to note about its freeway
behavior for those of you that commute a
lot first of all the things geared
pretty low I'm gonna get this up to
let's see 60 here let me go to fifth and
I'm at 3400 rpm and even in sixth I'm
around 2,700 kind of a busy set of gears
for long freeway cruising just bear that
in mind
the other thing is we've got this very
linear very responsive steering rack but
you do have to baby it a bit to maintain
straight on those long boring freeways
this isn't one of those cars that kind
of sits into a groove and Nestle's there
it will wander very easily with a little
steering input on the long straight now
pricing the last of this current
generation Civic Si is a little bit of a
torn situation for me I like to load
them up seen that style you know that
but the bass here is a little under
24,000 I might just leave it at that
because for 1500 more you guess you can
get that nav system I find an uninspired
you add some media options that maybe
you're obviated to have but what you're
doing on your phone and you get a multi
angle rear camera which I don't think is
any substantially better than a single
angle saving that 1500 bucks on that
option package
saved you over 6% on the overall price
of the car because it's so cheap to
start with I might keep this one based
si actually spells see that's how I'll
take it
