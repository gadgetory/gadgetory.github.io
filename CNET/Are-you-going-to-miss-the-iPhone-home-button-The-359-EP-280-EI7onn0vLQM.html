7th from the scene at New York studios
it's time for the episode 280 of the 359
you can call me Bing what's up of
boobies good
that's catchy big surprise iPhone that
phone's just really at this point a
little less than a week away I'm gonna
talk a little bit about the the
controversial rumored removal of the
home Bund and how that might affect our
lives I think it might be you know it's
more significant you think then
disagrees some what we'll talk about
we'll talk about it we'll also talk
about Amazon going after some scammers
from Kindle scammers right yeah
self-publishing and we'll talk a little
bit about text text the tech industry's
attempt to save Daka
or at least say the dreamers and pushing
for some legislation so lots to talk
about so let's just get right to it you
have any questions live in the comment
section Brian will pick up the best and
we will get to them in three minutes in
a few 9 seconds here we go for the
recording of the podcast see you back in
the chat in 3 2
welcome to the 359 I'm runner tang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon the iPhone is nearly here
what the controversial rumor changes is
the removal of the home but the physical
home button the home button we've if
you're an iPhone user you've used
basically a billion times a day at least
that's that's a rough average what do
you think how is this do you think this
is a big enough change that's gonna mess
with the way you use your phone yeah but
don't you think that like ultimately
we're making a really big deal about but
what's ultimately a fairly minor design
change no you know like this is this is
like gonna be heralded as like such a
big deal it's gonna launch like so many
hot takes oh my god and like I've
already got my heart ache preparing
button come on here's the thing yes
they're getting rid of the button it is
I think about how many things do you do
with that button you multitask you
triple click to get the camera you know
you're constantly
went back to home I mean think about and
I kind of jokingly say we click on that
thing a billion times but we click on
that home button a lot right and to
remove that bun and have this sort of
virtual button floating there to me at
least suggest that there's gonna be a
bigger change in the user interface you
know it's gonna be you know we've
already sort of seen hints that there
might be more of a dock like the iPad
where I'll be sort of longer role of
rows of icons so it could be it could
mark sort of a bigger change in how we
use or I thought that could be the
biggest that could throw people for a
loop I get that I get that from from a
habitual perspective more often than not
you're gonna hit the home button just to
kind of get your day started to like
delve into your phone maybe sometimes
you press the power button but a very
least you know that's where the touch ID
exists but at the same time I do at
least when I mentioned that Samsung
already did this yep in March yep we're
doing it again where maybe we're giving
Apple too much credit for being second
potato I'm not saying that this is a
this is I'm heralding them for their
innovation I'm just saying for users who
are used to this like you might have to
be ready for a big change and you know
so what steps I did Samsung users aren't
generally iPhone users so it's there to
almost two separate groups right so you
know most of the folks were looking to
upgrade to this new iPhone or iPhone
users all use of physical home button so
I don't know could be a big change I'm
starting to get it I I understand what
you have I soldier not entirely I mean
when when what was it the iPhone wait I
read my hot take really awesome gonna be
super hot when when the iPhone 7 came
out and then switched to a haptic button
I was like I'm not into this right and
not on boy you know I I mean I was the
same way and I kinda got used to it I
think overall in the end you will get
used to it just it's a weird transition
one of the things too just to throw it
in there I don't even know how people
would actually be able to find this
button because if it's all one flat
surface how are you gonna get get I
think that's the challenge especially
when the screen is off like how do you
hit the home button like yeah well I
await your heart ache we'll see all
right next up Amazon has some news Ben
yeah Amos on
is continuing its effort to go after
scammers counterfeiters or alleged
scammers on its site on Wednesday
yesterday it filed five different
arbitration briefs to go after a bunch
of people that were trying to scam the
Kindle self-publishing platform to try
to make some extra money so they would
either jack up the best seller like jack
up their books on the bestseller list or
they would put in fake reviews fake
reviews as obviously like a very try the
other way to like scam ways of getting
people to buy stuff yeah there was
another guy that would reach out to
authors to try to he had a way of like
increasing the number of page views
because you actually increase your
royalties for the number of page views
you got on certain books oh wow so okay
they're gonna continue doing that
alright well lastly Maggie ririn has a
nice piece on text attempt to save daca
or at least maybe not duck in the way it
is now but in terms of trying to get
Congress to introduce a bill to save
so-called dreamers these these
immigrants who are part of the daca
program so her story is interesting
because it notes that tech has been
actually pretty successful in political
realm you know in terms of stopping
sober that was the online piracy act
getting that neutrality passed back
under the Obama administration but when
it comes to actually introducing new
policy texts really struggled this and
and a lot of the experts that Maggie
talked to suggested that tech would have
a real uphill climb here just because
information is such a controversial
topic here right this is also in many
ways a social issue not a tech issue
I understand obviously a lot of dreamers
have tech jobs and the tech industry in
general has had a more I guess I would
say lacks or more you know broader view
on memory say they're the most vocal
party right now in terms of supporting
doctors and they've been increasingly
supportive of a lot of you know liberal
and progressive efforts basically since
the Trump administration's absolutely
yeah I don't find this too surprising
that they were know that that they were
trying to save doc I think what was
surprising has given their influence and
their history of success but the
challenges that they face
fact that it's still gonna be really
tough even for companies as powerful as
Apple absolutely at Facebook so alright
these stories on more chicks on CNN I'm
Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks for
listening so I have a question before we
jump right into the chat do it cuz i
neva tably everybody's gonna be talking
about this iPhone crap okay
if Apple decides to kill the home button
I don't know if this is an if question
anymore I probably the wrong phrasing
here but without the home button in the
iPhone do you think that's gonna follow
suit on an iPad that's a good question
hey there's more real estate on an iPad
yeah I actually kind of like the bezel
the frame around the iPad because I
don't want to get my finger print that's
a good point good I like having a little
bit like Ivan iPad air and I like having
that frame to hold the screen with it
screens fairly large already like I
think the whole idea with the iPhone is
you want to kind of keep it compact but
you want a bigger screen hence removing
the bezels and getting this whole
seamless look I don't know maybe they
will maybe they'll to kind of put
everyone on the same kind of common
platform they'll actually removed the
iPad but I don't know I think Apple is
never a while Apple likes to make
changes to make the people that bought
the product last year feel like idiots
so maybe I would say that's not true
that's true that's true but I wouldn't
put it past them to remove the home
button just so you kind of feel a little
jealous of the guy the button yes I mean
I look at like when I'm on the train I
look at someone with a galaxy has eight
that's pretty nice oh it's a nice phone
it's a nice phone oh yeah so send in
some shoutouts all around the world
today Seattle Paraguay Vietnam yeah all
over the place thanks everybody for
joining us we lovable readers
let's go ahead and jump into some of the
chat questions
Nehemiah asks will the iPhone come with
two day battery life I'm so sorry
but no I don't think it's also no tooth
fairy
I mean there are some special purpose
phones that
longer than others but yeah like an
iPhone will get you a day of use if
you're lucky if you're not a heavy user
I would love for Apple on stage next
week to make some sort of reference to
battery life oh yeah I really feel like
they're not gonna do they often do it
when it relates to their lives that's
always number one on the wishlist we're
a lot of people's like better battery
life better battery life like every
mobile device has a year Apple is really
not I mean they just sort of give that
blanket like oh it'll last you your day
or whatever like if you don't use your
phone at all missed you I could never
you know what tweaks me out though and
like now when I'm out and about in the
city
you see those info panels that have been
kind of jumping up all over the place
like NYC yeah Lincoln I see people park
there yeah yeah charger charging and
charging and it's like okay I'm not
gonna discredit New York that's a really
nice commodity that they've provided to
the citizens but Wow
are we really that dependent that we got
a park in charge and yeah sure yeah if
you go to an airport gate like there's
like a crowd around every outlet right
like a sort of they all just got came
from home you know what a use up their
attacks whenever I go there I like
protect you like boom there you go
people
that's right back into the chat expert
games they could put a button on the
side power button or the home button on
the side like the volume rocker they
could but they won't
there they won't yeah I love that idea
though by the way I'm very into that
idea Jessica dual court when she was
here and she said that they're really
good like they actually well the thing
of it is that was less of a home button
more a button it was more for like
turning unlock and you can unlock the
phone yeah maybe the home button does
more than that right like it gets you
back to the home screen
but yes - Jessica's point and I tried
this out with the the Robin phone that
next bit phone let's get the side
fingerprint sensor works like remember I
just never know what ever uses it though
what is what is the next bit Robin
alright that's great mr. lizard liked a
lot a second potato-y a second how did I
miss that what it was a phrase at the
time of the past at the second of the
podcast it was afraid loss the legacy
asks did Apple move the rear camera so
that people stopped recording video in
the portrait orientation hmm
congratulations Giant Bomb I kind of
wish I was there instead of here anyways
anyways videos vertical instead of
horizontal very like increasingly
popular thing yeah definitely I mean the
the way it's angled now you'll go from
so the layout was horizontal now go
vertical
so it'll it'll cause you to adjust yeah
this way maybe I mean I like that theory
using I mean I think they I also think
they just move it around because they
had it better fit more components in
there mm-hm and so I don't think it's a
orientation thing I think it's more just
that's how they designed it that's how
they fit more components into the phone
so it's meant to score over snapped yeah
I mean look I don't think it's gonna
affect or it's gonna hurt your ability
to take either portrait or landscape
mode video or photos regardless the
orientations people are gonna continue
be dumb I just hate that I hate the
vertical video thing I know it's drives
me nuts I know you know they're they're
creating whole like content now was the
whole idea code 90 except they I'm gonna
thank ya I'm plugging go 90 the hell
with it your you'll be the first person
to plug code ID so but look I I've used
go 90 it's actually pretty decent stuff
I don't know they had a transformers
cartoon on there I thought was pretty
cool okay I can get it then I stopped
using it completely so after the show is
over is like all right go back to
ignoring go 90 ouch alright back in the
chat
Abdul's got a great question will the
volume buttons being
next he says momentum arm off it's true
right we lost a headphone jack on the
home bun we're just losing everything
just the volume next thing to go the
whole phone yeah they just sell you air
for like $700 and people would buy yeah
yeah would be nicely packaged air like
you over the box there guys are
ridiculous well I'm still trying to wrap
my head around if that's even possible
like would you have a gesture controlled
volume you could say oh well we have
like a yeah like you could almost like
swipes on your phone maybe to control
the volume perspective I don't I don't
know I went I went to a interesting idea
it's a Sony product presentation with
David Carr Noi last week or two weeks
ago I honestly forget at this point but
they showed off the version it is not
okay no no we published a review on this
already they've got their own version of
the home pod coming out yeah and it has
just your volume controls you literally
like gift this coffee cup let me see if
I can get a better camera angle here if
this coffee cup was your actual voice
assistant speaker and you just spin your
finger around it clockwise and counter
clockwise you hold the cup up it's just
my coffee so yeah you just yeah like
what Ben's doing this is that story the
coffee fan that's doing controls not out
of the question
no totally I am like I said that babies
look really stupid you swipe up or down
I'm not saying you have to do no no no I
think it would be it would be more like
this yeah just a gentle gentle caress
who asked that question of duo come back
again come back again I like your cry
like that was a great question it does
kind of fit with the original vision
that jobs I've had I was like basically
like a singular block of just a seamless
a thin sheet of glass right or aluminum
really was like they feel was the
doubles as a razor blade in your pod
like no but there was like no buds at
all like they you know to kind of be
completely minimalistic that's that's
how you do it right yeah yeah it may be
evil down the line we'll see just bring
back good
no I Jackson cannot cover that you and
me both brother
next question Watson asks will iPads
eventually phase out as phones continue
to get bigger and use full screens on
the surface of the mobile interested in
your thoughts that's a great question
we've definitely considered that
possibility for many years and I think
bonds are gonna get bigger iPads are
gonna get smaller and they're going to
swap like Freaky Friday well and they've
been more like Pro versions you're
supposed to get them with a keyboard
that's how they're trying to
differentiate the iPad line yeah is to
make them more similar to a laptop so
they're not necessarily looking for
average folks like you'd be buying them
it's more at this point like businesses
for business use I think they're pushing
the business side and education like
schools I'm not an average folks by the
way sorry I'm a tech fluent sir so oh my
god I expect you on the show business
card yeah we got a question okay all
right so directly answer the question I
think the iPad makes way too much money
as like a segment yeah no no they're
gonna keep trying to find like in area I
don't think there's gonna be that
migration we're like is that your phone
gets bigger to the point where replaces
an iPad it's isn't it more likely if
they did the iPad what allegedly or any
tablet will continue to get more
powerful and yeah come to replace
notebooks before a phone would replace a
tablet it's possible it's just it's
weird fast because that kind of sits in
this website on the dark the iPad
tablets in general Tsin that weird spot
where they're like they're not I mean
your phone's a lot more usefully spend
more time with it if you want something
really powerful your iPad your tablet's
not quite as powerful as a pc yes and
that weird no-man's land
yeah but if they actually start I think
it's more likely that a tablet would
encroach on PC territory before phone
within Chrome yeah I think that's sure
especially as processors get faster
analogous capabilities got better do you
have more space to do stuff yeah yeah
totally
we got a question here from what will
become Ben's new nickname benster
Baxter that's like a sitcom benster
sure I don't know what do you think the
iPhone Edition will ship with air pods
no no no those theropods expenses they
want all your money yeah and there's no
way they would you know they like 160
there are over a hundred or terrible
with backs they're not sure odd in the
meantime is at 160 you're right 160
thank you
in the meantime sherrod are we expecting
the iPhone 7s to come with wireless
charging well the new phones come with
wireless charging pad included iPhone 7s
7s sorry yes yes I believe that the
wireless charging capability is rumored
to be on every one of the phones and
they should because the only way to kind
of drive mass adoption is to get every
single one of these units using the same
capability it's been around I mean while
charging has been around for a while
it's very mature is very stable at this
point so it would just it would it would
shock and actually frustrate me if they
didn't put wireless charging in the 7s
models okay I have some late breaking
news about farmer bro I wrote about this
yesterday him again no no so he can I he
put the one and only whoo tang clan
album up on eBay
yeah and $3,000 itself so it's a it's
over a million the last time I checked
last night he bought it for two million
dollars back in 2015 I asked him a
question because one of the things that
he said was out of frustration he said
he might consider breaking it you know
there's two million dollar one-time
thing so I said I asked him and murder
him it's his he can do whatever ones
with mine Tang would kill him being the
reporter that I had nothin to F with I
went and I asked him through the eBay
listing and great said this hasn't been
like I didn't ask him in person so take
it with a grain of salt but I asked why
would you be frustrated and break this
item I just got the response back from
him like just now his response was roid
rage so there you go oh he's on steroids
now he's just ridiculous he's a
ridiculous booty if that's the case he
needs more that's
a little physical living embodiment of
control he's really fantastic I'm a
living embodiment of an aborted fetus oh
my god I recommend everybody check out
the Q&amp;amp;A s on the eBay listing they're
really funny and I'm glad I am now
included in them so thank you very much
for we can get back to them feel like
you need a right story about that sure
all right
oh I I talked to this farmer I don't
know no their story should just be over
QA like the weird stuff that's not a bad
idea all right look at the skin stories
generated you know double duty this is
work Italy on topic - I know way off
topic so we're almost out of time let's
throw in a couple more questions Lost
Legacy and several others are asking if
the new iPhone will support the Apple
pencil and how that's going to put pan
out in the future oh that's a question I
don't know it seems doubtful yeah and it
seems like the pencil is really geared
towards the iPad purloined mm-hmm and
that kind of helps differentiate what
the iPad pro does so I don't know maybe
if they have I mean one of the rumor
names is an iPhone Pro maybe I couldn't
see why shouldn't ya like the the
brand-new third one yes the iPhone the
top-tier thousand-dollar I thought that
would clearly be stealing a page from
Samsung again oh yeah what the guys did
idea of big phone that's price but isn't
the iPhone 8 not expected to be that big
I mean still big ish no no I'm just
saying general the idea of like of
stealing stuff from Samsung totally the
big phone thing was yeah we'll look for
that but I don't I don't think it's
possible father knows best best asks
will the home button be integrated into
the entire screen as in you're gonna
touch anywhere to activate it and what
are your thoughts on that that's a
question I don't know how they're gonna
I think you think I have like a small
home button where normally would have
been ideal real estate like the lower
third of the screen like anywhere here
in this sweet spot kind of thing I don't
know that's
it kind of cool if it was the
intelligence would be yeah but you need
a touch ID functionality somewhere so if
you were gonna do that just to wake up
the screen that's one thing but to
unlock the phone and use any other touch
ID functionality it would have to be
limited well that's the thing I think
we're not sure if touch ID is gonna work
with a button right like it could be
facial recognition hasn't that been
proven to work horribly so far Samsung
it does right maybe Apple has found some
new way to make it more secure time will
tell just a couple more we're gonna
squeeze in here Josh boy 2 asks how long
until the lightning port is axed Wow
amputating this isin this is a very good
questions no we're just gonna get rid of
the cameras has set that precedent where
it's like we're going to minimize until
there's nothing less yeah but you know a
German architect you're like the best
Dana Carvey impression no I see little
any important stink sticking around if
anything I would want to switch to USB
see that would be not gonna happen that
can happen but no the lighting port will
be around they make too much money
selling the license to companies that
want to make accessories but I think you
would agree that we do see a future
maybe five years in in the five year
time span that they are gonna get rid of
the Lightning port maybe and convert
completely don't like charging yeah I
don't know that's real good question I
think someone brought the point like the
NYPD is getting iPhones you like no
windows phones anymore with the
downgrade and you know the idea of
switching them all to lightning or to go
Bluetooth would be for first responders
who absolutely need like a hard-line
connection that seems like a hard sell
right good point
I mean to remove the lightning poor
would be even worse right yeah just
Bluetooth you'd be forcing people also
to buy here air pods
not really that doesn't seem it would
probably sell some cheaper version of
their Bluetooth headphones that
but that just seems really awkward
especially now we just got done talking
about these charging stations and
airports and on the street in urban
areas and if you're only dependent on
wireless charging you're screwed yeah
I'm gonna do carry around a block
underwear I mean that's the idea is that
you know we spent the last five or six
years trying to see the market with
wireless charging stations around the
city right it's it hasn't really worked
out so well here but in other places if
you go to a Starbucks if you go to
McDonald's you can actually do while you
to place your phone on the table and
charge it there yeah but that weird we
just started getting around to actually
putting about cable charging stations
out yeah and yeah but I mean I mean
that's I think the hope for from
companies like Apple and from other OEMs
or basically get the world covered in
wireless charging stations and then you
know then people will actually let's say
they see the that's there you're talking
to a studio engineer here I hate cables
yeah bane of my existence but they still
work better at transferring data that
yes faster than Wireless faster than
Bluetooth we still have them yeah I
don't think that I don't think it's
going away let's squeeze in just a
couple more really really good questions
here coming in at the eleventh hour
jarred topping says do you think the
iPhone 8 will come with better speakers
and then everyone kind of rallies tunes
phone speakers always sound bad but I
would say there's something to be
considered there being that Apple put so
much energy behind the audio fidelity of
their home pod and they have a lot of
energy about audio quality and it's
subjective what you take away from that
but they seem to have an energy in it
they seem to have an emphasis on it
teaming with Beats they're not had they
also played up the fact that the iPhone
7 had those two like like stereo sound
yeah they have the the top right which
oh that's something louder doesn't mean
it's better
well no it's it for me it was great
because like you know if you hold your
phone like this you're covering speakers
right inevitably so like to have it
especially you're playing games so like
to have speakers on both ends it's kind
of nice but yeah their neck rate yeah I
thought they CC one actually had decent
they had front-facing boom sound
speakers that were actually pretty good
yeah
let's see if a package up there I don't
think so it's no need to now that's true
last question this is a really
interesting thought without the home
button will there be a new way to hard
reset the phone and that's coming in
from Irwin that's a great question I
don't know I think well that's one of
the things we'll to find out that I just
cooked my brand yeah that would be
really funny if they mentioned that on
stage how you harvest and we know the
phone sucks sometimes so this is how you
hard reset yeah I don't have to like
press both volume buttons and the power
button at the same time and twirl around
pirouette so we'll see Tuesday I'm sure
we're gonna do more iPhone stuff before
the actual events really probably I
don't know I don't know anyway shout out
to Farmer bro thanks for answering my
question no no shout out to farmer bro
