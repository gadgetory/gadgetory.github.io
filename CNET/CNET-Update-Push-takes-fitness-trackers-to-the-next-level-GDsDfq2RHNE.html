your workout a push I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your CNET update fitness
trackers are quite trendy these days
there are dozens of devices that you can
strap on your wrist to track your steps
and movement but there's a new type of
tracker that's for a more serious
athlete
it's called push and it's a new armband
designed specifically for strength
training I met up with the co-founder
and CEO Rami al Hamad who gave a demo of
how it works at the Sports lab gym in
New York City you wear the push on your
forearm and it measures your performance
as you do different strength training
exercises it tracks how many reps you do
in a set how much weight you're lifting
and with that it can calculate the power
of your lift to get started you create a
profile with their training goals and
then you pick an exercise and enter in
the weight that you're lifting press a
button on the armband and it keeps track
of your sets when you're done you get
data about your performance and
suggestions on how to improve based on
your goals if you're fast it'll suggest
that maybe you should add more weight
and if you're not consistent during a
set and you're slow it can tell you're
probably doing your max and that you're
tired but how tired you get can also
help calculate the most weight you can
lift at one time which is important to
know for athletic training you want to
keep pushing yourself further without
going too far and hurting yourself
the point of all this isn't to motivate
a couch potato to get to the gym
rather it optimizes your training most
fitness trackers measure data ten times
a second the push measures data 250
times a second that's as accurate as
professional sports lab equipment and
because of that several pro sports teams
are using it for their players including
NFL's Washington Redskins and the hockey
teams Dallas Stars and Philadelphia
Flyers those who pre-order now can get
it for one hundred and fifty dollars and
it will ship in August you can expect to
hear more about different wearable
gadgets like fitness trackers and
smartwatches all throughout the week
because the annual wearable tech Expo is
taking place now in New York City
