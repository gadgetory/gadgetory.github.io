big for the last few years the natural
solution has been to choose a sharp it's
still the only company with a 90-inch
television hi I'm ty Pendlebury and this
is the sharp LC 60 le 650 this is the
company's newest mid-range television
which dispenses with some features most
notably 3d in order to deliver a large
screen for about $1,500 while the
company has updated the appearance and
made some tweaks the panel itself is
very similar to the model it replaced
from last year with a very similar
performance the most obvious changes are
to Smart TV with a much better suite of
services which now include Hulu Plus
Pandora and Skype in addition there is a
new low-power mode which is meant to
resemble painting when you turn it off
inputs a constant at 4 HDMI though it
now includes MH L for connecting and
charging your phone though I can't see
this is being used by most people as I
want to keep their phones on them there
are some performance tweaks with shadow
detail much better than last year's TV
and blacks just a little bit deeper
color is a little bit better as well
otherwise it's pretty much the same
television which is to say this is a
high quality screen for a decent price
this has been ty Pendlebury for cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
