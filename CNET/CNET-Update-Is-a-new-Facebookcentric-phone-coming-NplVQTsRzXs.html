facebook phone I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your seen that update facebook
may soon announce its working with HTC
to create a phone with a modified
version of Android that has built-in
Facebook features facebook invited press
to an announcement on Thursday April
fourth and it has something to do with
Facebook's new home on Android we're
expecting to see a phone with software
that has more integration with Facebook
apps like messenger or it has more
options to share things to Facebook back
in 2011 HTC unveiled to Facebook phones
that had a dedicated blue button for
quick access to Facebook they were
called the HTC chacha and the HTC salsa
but both phones were a total flop path a
social network more private than
Facebook is working on a subscription
service to launch sometime in the second
quarter path is an app that's marketed
to be the social network for only your
closest friends and family it encourages
you to post more than you normally would
on Facebook such as constant updates
about your location path is following
the footsteps of apps like Evernote and
Spotify to create a premium paid product
alongside the free version but when I
spoke to paths founder Dave Morin he
wouldn't reveal what users would be
paying for paths started taking payments
a while ago with photo filters that cost
a buck in the recent update the app
added cartoon character stickers to be
used in private messages and it costs
two dollars for a pack of those stickers
Morin said the app made more money in
character stickers in the first week
than it did with photo filters in the
past year amazon is buying the book
recommendation network goodreads soon
the network that discusses books will be
able to buy the books they talk about
and it's another way for authors to find
me readers you might even see Goodreads
woven into the Kindle e-reader a change
in Microsoft's Windows 8 screen
resolution requirements gives us a clue
that we could soon see 7 inch mini
tablets running Windows 8 the 7-inch
tablet market was huge during the
holidays last year with the ipad mini
Google Nexus 7 and the am
on kindle fire we're keeping our eye on
ouya the new android based game console
the cube-shaped Booya costs ninety nine
dollars and includes one controller all
the games are downloaded and you can
sample all the games for free before you
buy it's officially launching in June
but cnet got an early look this is a
neat system for discovering independent
games or if you're looking for a cheaper
way to play games on your television
you're not getting PlayStation quality
games here these are simple and low
budget you can also make your own games
if you know how to program that's your
tech news update you can find more
details at cnet com / update and be sure

studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
