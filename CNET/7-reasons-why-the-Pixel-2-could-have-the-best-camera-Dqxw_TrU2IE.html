see much better than the dual camera on
the iPhone eight plus but Google says
it's the best yet again we're proud to
announce that DXL mark has issued pixel
to an unprecedented score of 98 what
does it claim to do better
last year's pixel had Google's hdr+
image processing which takes multiple
shots at the same time and then combines
the best elements of each into one the
shots look incredible especially in low
light and this year Google has perfected
the technology for an even better result
on the pixel to the pixel 2 also uses
what Google calls fuse stabilization
it's basically google jargon that means
it's using both optical and digital
stabilization for smoother video and
potentially sharper low-light than its
predecessor the iPhone relies on optical
only
Google didn't exactly say the pixel had
a better portrait mode than the iPhone
but it did say it can do it with one
camera using machine learning and it can
do it on both the back and front camera
the iPhone 8 plus only has it on the
back camera to get it on both you have
to wait for the 10 and what's great
about the pixel is that both the cheaper
to and the more expensive to excel have
all these features because you'll get
the same great experience on both we
don't set aside better features for the
larger device plus you get more storage
Google is offering free unlimited
storage on Google photos with every
purchase in full resolution so you don't
have to lose quality
well unlimited until 2020 that is then
it will start compressing the files and
the camera will also be able to answer
the muffin or Chihuahua question because
the pixel 2 is debuting Google ends it's
a feature that uses Google assistant and
machine learning to recognize images and
text around you it's kind of like what
Samsung tried to do with bixby vision
and it'll have augmented reality
capabilities with Google's AR core
similar to what the newer iPhones can do
with Apple's AR kit
Apple has the floating heart and Google
has stranger things but these are still
claims and we won't know who the real
camera winner is until we put them to
the test
