and I'm with the Panasonic TCP 50 u 50
this is Panasonic's 50 inch plasma TV
the cheapest 1080p plasma TV and
Panasonic's lineup for 2012 that means
it doesn't have 3d or Smart TV but it
does have one really nice thing
excellent picture quality I'm a downside
this set is only available in this
50-inch size so there isn't a 42 or 55
to speak of but if you're looking for a
50-inch TV and you don't want to spend
too much money this one is one of the
best you can buy right now
design-wise the u 50 is relatively
generic there's a glossy black frame
around the edge that's not too thin not
too thick seen from the side the TV is
also about 3.3 inches thick so again not
too fat not too skinny the whole thing
is pretty nondescript although Panasonic
does throw in this little accent strip
along the bottom feature-wise there's
not much to speak of this 1080p
resolution TV is a little bit more
expensive than Panasonic's 720p models
the company also throws in a photo and
music viewer you can actually put an SD
card right from digital camera into the
side of this TV which is an option that
not very many TVs have so it's pretty
convenient another downside to this
entry-level TV is the sparse input
selects there's only two HDMI there's
one component video that also serves
composite video and that's about it so
if you have a lot of devices we actually
recommend picking up a cheap HDMI switch
or maybe an AV receiver it's a little
bit more of a hassle but if you have a
good universal remote you can make it
work seamlessly the you 50 is also
sparse on picture settings it's just a
couple of modes and not really much you
can do with them on up side the cinema
setting actually has very good preset so
we really didn't have to do much to
improve its picture quality that picture
quality is very good once you set it up
in cinema mode the real upside here is
the deep deep black levels when you turn
out the lights the screen it's really
inky in fact it's as good as any
panasonic plasma TV regardless of price
except for the very most expensive one
we've seen this year
it also out does pretty much anything at
its price range of producing that nice
deep black color was very accurate again
and we also appreciated plasmas off
angle and uniformity characteristics
basically perfect on the downside is the
screen finish on this set under bright
lights it really does wash out quite a
bit so if you can afford to step up to a
little more expensive TV there with a
better screen finish it might be
that's a quick look at Panasonic's TCP
