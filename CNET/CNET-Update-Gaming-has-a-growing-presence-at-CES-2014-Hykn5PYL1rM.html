electronics show in las vegas I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update it seems that gaming is a bigger
topic than usual for this year's CES
right as the tech show kicked off sony
revealed a new way to stream old
playstation games much like how you
would stream a movie on Netflix it's
called PlayStation now we got a chance
to demo how it works here at the show
but it won't be available for all
consumers until the summer at launch
you'll be able to stream ps3 games from
your ps3 or the new ps4 and if you have
one of Sony's new 2014 bravia tvs well
then you can stream a game right from
the TV in the future more platforms will
be supported so you could stream a game
to your sony tablet or xperia phone
there's no word yet if sony will add old
playstation 1 and 2 games to the
streaming library as for cost you can
either rent one game or sign up for a
subscription plan and if you're worried
about your internet connection being a
little laggy the system will analyze
your speed and give you a heads up if
you may encounter problems and this is
also the year of the steam machine it's
a gaming system by valve and it lets you
play PC games on your living room TV
there are 13 prototype consoles made by
third-party game hardware manufacturers
like alienware an Origin with different
sizes and specs and since some pc games
are programmed for being controlled a
little differently with a mouse these
steam machines have controllers designed
with to track pads but the price of
these systems were not announced yet the
steam machine can play 250 games there
are new ways to play android games on
your TV such as the snakebite Viper it's
a 7 inch android tablet with a docking
station remote control and Bluetooth
game controller it will be out at the
end of the month in the u.s. starting at
two hundred dollars there's also a new
prototype of the 3d virtual reality
gaming system by oculus it's called the
crystal cove now from a year ago it has
improved resolution with a 1080p OLED
screen inside and it knows where you're
moving in the game with little LEDs in a
camera and there's less blur to help you
avoid motion
sickness now virtual reality still may
be a bit futuristic but there's some
classic tech that gotta reboot Polaroid
announced that it's making a
retro-looking socialmatic Android camera
to come out in the fall it has a 14
megapixel front camera and a 2-megapixel
back camera built-in Wi-Fi for uploading
your pics to social media and like the
classic Polaroid it has an inkless
printing system to pop out 2 by 3 inch
prints with sticker backings be sure to
follow our live coverage of CES all week
long at cnet com / live from the cnet
stage at the Las Vegas Convention Center
