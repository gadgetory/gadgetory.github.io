and pro light cameras let's take a look
at the best of the best according to our
CNET editors after months of rumors
Apple finally revealed its 10th
anniversary iPhone and it did not
disappoint the iPhone 10 got a radical
redesign that gets rid of the signature
home button for a nearly bezel-less
display that scans your face to unlock
it has a faster processor improved dual
camera and wireless charging a first for
Apple's three new iPhones it's also the
most expensive iPhone ever at $1000 oh
yeah and there's this the new glass back
means you now have two breakable
surfaces so please put a case on it if
you're having a hard time justifying the
price tag there's always the eight plus
it may not look as sleek and shiny as a
ten but it has most of the same great
features plus you get to keep the trusty
home button and touch ID Sampson also
stepped it up in 2017
this year's Note blew us away in a good
way that massive quad HD display that
spills over the edge of the phone makes
anything look good and an S Pen that's
packed with even more productivity tools
it also added a second lens on the back
for a DSLR like portrait effect that
lets you control the intensity of the
blur it's the best overall Android phone
of the year and one of the most
expensive but it was the s8 and si plus
that basically laid down the blueprint
for the note 8 and by now they're more
affordable you'll only get one camera
and no S Pen but if screen real estate
is what you want the plus is almost as
big
LTS V 30 was another great one that got
overshadowed by the previous beasts it
has great performance battery life to
spare and the best headphone jack on a
phone it's dual camera pax more
megapixels than its competitors with a
really useful wide-angle option that can
fit more in each shot oneplus may not
have the brand recognition that Apple
and Samsung do but it continues to build
its way to the top with phones like the
5 T it has a big 6 inch
Green premium processor and dual rear
cameras that are great in low-light it
competes at the same level as the top
phones at a significantly better price
its biggest downside it's not as widely
available but if we're talking about
budget phones there is no match for the
Moto G 5 plus for about a fifth of the
price of the iPhone 10 you get a solid
metal build fingerprint scanner that
doubles as a trackpad and a 12 megapixel
shooter plus it's as close to a pure
Android experience as you're gonna get
in an on Google phone of course you
could go with Google's own pixel to the
original pixel was a welcome addition to
the Google family and this year's pixel
2 and excel were even better a debut
google lens a software feature that lets
you look up more information about the
world around you and it's camera is also
our favorite of any Android phone this
year but the pixel to excel had a few
stumbles users complained about burn
issues in the screen which Google says
it's fixed let us know which one was
your favorite in the comments section
below and be sure to check out all our
