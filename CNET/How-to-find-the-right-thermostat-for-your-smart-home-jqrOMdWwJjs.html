student appliances and this is an HVAC
buying guide so you probably have a
basic manual control or programmable
thermostat in your home right now but
there are several smart home options
that are becoming available that could
just change your heating and cooling
forever so if you have a programmable
thermostat now and you're using it to
set schedules you're already automating
your heating and cooling environment to
some extent but it isn't smart and
adaptable like these models of the five
smart thermostats we've reviewed so far
there are three different key types of
texts that define them the Nest Learning
Thermostat the Honeywell Wi-Fi smart
thermostat and the Honeywell Wi-Fi smart
thermostat with voice control all rely
on learning algorithms this is an
adaptive way of heating and cooling your
home it relies on motion sensors built
into the thermostat and it will sense
whether your home our way and even if
you've already set a schedule which you
can do with these models if it starts to
notice that your home when your schedule
is normally set to away it will actually
automatically update your schedule to
account for those changes so the
Honeywell lyric thermostat takes a
slightly different approach it relies on
geofencing to determine how close or far
away you are from home it actually has
two different fences one that's 500 feet
and one that's seven miles away and you
can set it to whichever distance you
prefer so if you set it to 500 feet when
you cross out of that range it'll set to
a way mode and when you cross back
within that range it should revert to
home mode the third main type of tech is
sensor based so basically instead of
having an adaptive algorithm or geo
fencing it will rely on sensors built
into the thermostat and also a remote
sensor that you can position anywhere in
your house so if you don't walk by your
thermostat often even if your home it
might set itself to away mode
as far as installation goes these
thermostats our DIY models you can find
them alongside regular manual and
programmable thermostats in local retail
stores and like those more basic models
the installation process is essentially
identical you just need to keep in mind
your level of expertise and be sure to
enlist a professional or an experienced
friend if you have any doubts about the
installation most thermostats today will
run on either a four or a five wire
system that is the one key
differentiating feature just keep in
mind that you'll need the sea or common
wire if you're installing the Honeywell
Wi-Fi smart thermostat the Honeywell
Wi-Fi smart thermostat with voice
control or the Eco v3 thermostat the
Honeywell lyric and the Nest Learning
Thermostat can be installed with just
four wires but definitely consult a
professional if you are in doubt once
you've installed your thermostat the
next step is configuration and it's
basically the same for all of these
models they all have mobile apps that
will ask you questions like what type of
system you have is it forced air what
type of fuel source you're using if it's
a one or two stage heating and cooling
system once you've done that your
thermostat is configured and ready to
use in addition to the unique adaptive
features of these smart thermostats they
also boast innovative design and work
with a variety of third-party products
so if you're interested in the smart
home in general these would be very very
good choices to look at just keep in
mind that most models range between 250
to 350 dollars so it might take a while
for you to actually enjoy the cost
savings thanks for watching this HVAC
