going to start shipping products via
drone or so they say there's a catch in
honor of Star Wars Episode seven
lucasarts is letting you step inside of
Star Wars but there's a catch oh the
NASA shows astronomy fans the dark side
of the moon but there is a catch
tomorrow daily
greetings citizen to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best speak
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley scale adjoin me as always is
anonymous oh yeah me and our new our new
robot army wind up robot hair Logan you
might get a shot of this sony robot
various it's very crumb trying to sell
the robot I don't most adorable i just
don't like cancer everybody know what he
looks like cuz it's kind of small
considering what we cover on this show
this is the most low-tech robot I think
you could possibly and I think if we get
some raspberry pi 2 we get Arduino we
just get some get some programming in we
learn how to code then throw away this
robot and feel the gum I think it could
really I think you could really be so
okay well we got some we got some catchy
very cat you have very catchy stories
today so let's have the headlines
so I don't know if you're familiar with
the company Alibaba like may have heard
of you know what but this international
company they have a online marketplace
called taobao it's in China and they're
saying that they are going to start
delivering a specialty via drone so they
released this video which if you're
listening to the show and not watching
it's it's a very well produced video
where somebody orders this ginger tea
off of taobao and then all of a sudden
this drone there's a garage door opening
and this drone lights up and it takes
the t and it goes and delivers the tea
but here's the thing as we're watching
this video I'll explain a little bit
this would be the first time that real
customers not not test flights would be
it would be receiving actual product
okay so this would be a big deal if it
were actually happening but there's the
i agree with evan over at IE spectrum
which is where i like to read a lot of
robot news this kind of smells like a
stunt so if you're watching this video
again very well produced looks great
looks great but also I think maybe is a
little bit unrealistic and the drones
are going to have to deal with all kinds
of things like power lines and and when
they land they're gonna have to deal
with things like people not hitting
people which you know they're not really
going to be able to see a lot of that
stuff after a certain range and there's
some there's some translations on the
website that sort of suggests that these
unmanned aerial vehicles are going to
have a preset flight plan with like
pre-programmed you know waypoints and
GPS and all this stuff to sort of avoid
hazards but I think the important
takeaway for everybody including us on
this particular video is that I think a
lot of people think that drone delivery
or something like it is like going to be
just all the rage this year and it's
really important to remember that even
though we see these things on video they
can be very well produced we were still
kind of a ways off from this type of
technology being really
emmalin's there's a lot of Hoops to jump
through one of them being range you know
being able to figure out how to get
there saying they're going to deliver
this T to customers in Gwangju Beijing
and Shanghai which you know is not an
insignificant distance like depending on
where the original factory or warehouse
is where they're going to be setting up
these drones out or whatever but they
say they're going to deliver it to 450
people like like right like soon or
right now or whatever it is but no
official word yet on if anybody has
actually received something delivered
via drone so I don't know I would regard
this with a little bit of skepticism but
it is really interesting to see that not
only are we you know watching companies
like Amazon say they'd like to even half
jokingly get into the drone delivery
game or starting to now see this like
globally is like people saying oh hey
like this is our plan to deliver things
via drone so while it sounds really cool
and I think a lot of people are really
interested in it it's possible that you
know it's a little ways off so I know
that we get really excited about like
future tech and everything but why you
you're like I don't be a downer yeah
you're building a huge downer no I just
want I just you still get a hip in the
lady I just want fans of the show to
like look at things like this that they
see online with a discerning eye and say
well I think the internet imagine
discern there's no other thing so I
think it's easy to pull the wool over
the Internet sadness that it doesn't
seem feasible that a tea company should
be doing this well no this is like a
bitch already pretty just like a big
market place like an Amazon ish circuit
companies okay like no co and then it
would ship use but it's this very
specific T that is the thing that
they're saying they're delivering said
it is just the T 450 customers would get
this this like T this ginger tea I don't
know yo really interesting choice I like
to you so on our way on board yeah tell
me about Star Wars okay so if you've
ever wanted to step inside of Star Wars
you may have a chance thanks to Madame
Tussauds Wax Museum in London they've
partnered with Disney and lucasarts yes
are you reacting to everything to Disney
and they partnered with Disney and
lucasarts on a multi-million dollar
exhibit okay there's going to be 16
heroes
villains from movies as well as 11
recreations of scenes from the movie
that you can walk inside us so here's
here's some of the ones they talked
about you can hang and hang out with Han
Solo in the cantina bar and she's i
assume he's sitting down yeah you can
sit next to Chewbacca in the pilot seat
of the millennium falcon which I love
that's what I want to do usually um so
really in this video they're really only
showing off Yoda that's the only one
they really show off in the video but we
can assume they we can assume they're
gonna have all the popular characters
you know like ig-88 salacious crumb in
the gong o course you know the pub's
your fema cool you have drooping module
it's not so made up so if you watch the
video they pretty much say everything i
said but they also at the end talk a
little tiny tiny tiny bit about how they
make these things there's a they talk
about Yoda there's 20 artists took it
took 20 artists for months just to make
Yoda they're saying the difficulty of
his size judge him not by a size no no
um they talk about the process including
molding the wax and hands and then also
painting on his little tiny tiny tiny
tiny tiny wrinkles so yeah there you go
that's Sonny Yoda wrinkles yeah this is
coming out in May if you live in London
it's a yeah in May so you got some time
may the force be 43 that's what it is
you with you that's got to be it alright
so that's him so that's pretty cool I
really like the fact that you can
actually go inside of the day looking at
it being like well that wax looks pretty
neat yeah or like even just you know
like have it where it's just the figure
and you're just like on that so that's
that's fine i guess like you take a
little picture of it yeah we're like i
was there but listen why how did i make
wax Chewbacca he's just all hair like
well I would have Majesty that would be
you'd have to make a hairless Chewbacca
and then like the hair is one at a time
date so they're doing at the Yoda they
do the hairs one at a time okay right
but you don't see underneath Chewbacca's
hair they started in 1977 building that
wax figure just now finishing which is
why this exhibit is opening finally but
there you go and mol four years
million-dollar exhibits so if you guys
live in London and in May wilfredo just
fruit won't forget but go reminded me
and Senate edged your phone
photographer if you remember yeah if you
remember at all right no seriously you
guys should go I'm still alive I'll
probably just be we should put some
plane tickets to London we should just
go I don't we won't do that um that
actually brings to our hashtag of the
day TD wax that's our hashtag of the day
I want to know what scene from a movie
TV show or video game would you want to
recreate and like a like in wax like if
so if you could say okay madam sewed
this is the thing that I need recreated
in wax this scene right here that I want
to sit in like what would it be okay you
go first no I asked you first no no I
got to think a little bit do you think
about it what don't think just just I
would say I'm gonna take your shirt as
inspiration and I would say that's not
fair is telling us apart can't say
drives apart cuz you asked me first say
you didn't let me think okay go ahead uh
no i would say i would totally love to
do the the science lab where they like
as they're all talking about you know
pulling all of the DNA out of the
mosquitoes in the am burns the science
lab oh yeah there's no like dinosaurs if
there's like a little time I lost my
temper I don't them or the kitchen scene
or the kitchen scene freeze up like that
that's pretty cool and then I could hide
behind the thing and look really scared
and take a picture I think that's pretty
cool i like that i do space jam oh my
god space be any and all the looney
tunes and then also the one of the
Monstars yeah that'd be that's spaceship
Madame Tussaud call us we'll really get
a whole company yeah we'll put you into
bankers w out you'll have no money for a
wax it's a good thing wax is cheap oh
well if it's terrible they could just
melt it down multi-million dollar cheap
all right they just melt down all the
all of those characters and they're done
ok so this last story is from NASA this
is really cool I just thought this was
awesome because NASA is like all right
well that's what you want we'll give
that to you so what um I'll explain why
so last year late last year nasa
released this video and it was really
cool because it showed all of the moon's
phases over the next year like so this
is what the moon is going to look like
every single night for 2015 well it was
just really cool so after they did that
people are like this is amazing we love
it but like what would the back of the
moon look like like
which is kind of a weird question excuse
me that was all well and good but what
about the back I think it's cuz it was
the year of the but last year I know
what everyone's like what about the
moon's booty you want to shoot i need a
speech the moon booty okay so um NASA is
the coolest is the coolest group of
people ever and they were like yeah okay
we could totally do that and yeah we got
that we got it we got it we got that log
down and that's exactly what they did so
they made this new video that flips the
moon phases around and they show you the
back side of the Moon take that which is
pretty awesome and then they show it to
you in a couple of different ways so
this is as a this is all
computer-generated so it's all this is
in a telescopic lens so the move so the
earth looks huge as you're looking at
the back of the moon and then they do
another version another view of it that
they'll show in a second where they they
actually do a wide angle lens so the
earth looks really really tiny as its
orbiting and you can see like basically
that's kind of what it would look like
if you were actually looking so it would
be like much smaller because it was a
little earth little tiny earth um but I
just thought this is really cool it's
like proof that you know NASA just does
awesome things and like and they don't
even need to it doesn't need to be like
oh I can't we have always set a camera
on that blah blah no they just they're
they know exactly what it looks like
they've mapped the moon so while at this
point they can literally computer
generate the back of it just like
Melissa what the back of Lu's gonna look
like for the rest of 2015 deal with it
guys you're welcome internet like
spoiler alert stop asking us dumb
questions but now it's not a dumb
question I thought that was it seems
like a question like you would hear from
like a kid be like we're got back of him
was that look like yeah now I want to
see what the back of the earth looks
like i'm curious i just i'm just so care
is no but that's pretty cool that they
just like done i know i love how they
were just so open about just like Oh
back of them yeah we could do that no
problem and then they just released this
video so thank you NASA for showing me
what the back of the moon looks like in
different phases and how do we see that
you're awesome uh you go over to NASA's
website they've got or their YouTube
channel they've got a bunch of really
cool stuff over there um thats it for
our headlines we're going to come back
with a round of into it because it's
thursday and we're about to head into
the weekend and then of course we have
your user feedback and our photogra for
the day so don't look away it's tomorrow
daily
welcome back to the show we have
returned kills looking at me
suspiciously which means it's Thursday
and it's time for another into it I want
to go first dude I want that calm is a
site that I've spent most of today on
and I dare you to go to this website and
not find something that you want to buy
this is like one of those sites where
you find something cool then you end up
posting on Facebook and people look I
want that oh dude I want they they have
okay so on the screen there's a camping
donut that has everything you like you
need for camping oh yeah I saw that has
all the utility stuff mm-hmm you can buy
any one particular like if you only like
red starburst you can just buy red star
ball is like cat armor um I also saw you
could buy an exoskeleton a power pot
cooking camper which is it's basically
it boils water like if you're camping
and you can charge your phone with
boiling water above but you can buy a
Tron book like there's so many like just
weird stuff that you wouldn't expect to
find like really anywhere there's like
that Loch Ness monster ladle so when you
put it in there looks like a large
posters going it alone this um there's a
little a helicopter on there I want a
helicopter I'm gonna go buy a survival
bike so it has like a whole bunch of
attachments in case you like in danger
or whatever Logan wire producer Logan
why are you obsessed with the butts yeah
look there's there's pinky Queen which
makes us you can lighten your nipples
there's a Lego strip club right there
it's like it's all kinds of stuff you'll
find something that you want to buy a
tropical stop everything baby found a
tron light cycle it's pretty cool uh
what's even better about the site is you
click on it and it and then it has like
little by links on the bottom you don't
buy it from the site is a site that like
aggregates everything so it'll have a
link to go like where you can buy it on
Amazon right see wherever it is it's
just an aggregate I've seen that similar
but with like women's clothing and
accessories there's
like that that I'm a member up yeah this
is basically SkyMall for nerds come on
shirts weird stuff that yeah may or may
not buy and I'm probably by half totally
filling a niche because SkyMall is now
bankrupt so Kailyn I are gonna buy
SkyMall we're gonna start we're gonna
start SkyMall uh so for me I am into
better call Saul so I should I will say
this so better call Saul is coming out
of this sunday and full disclosure I've
not finished watching breaking bad yet
like kale and producer Logan no I just
started watching it like maybe a couple
months ago it finally got to my netflix
queue the husband and I have been
barreling through episodes we just
started season four it's so so good and
I love the character of Saul and so now
I feel like I'm far enough along in the
series to where I can finally like watch
this show and not be spoiled because
it's a prequel to breaking bad it's like
the this guy's I don't want to go like
for anybody who hasn't seen breaking
that I want to be like oh it's the
disparate but his character Bob Odenkirk
character saw is a lawyer and hits his
sort of prequel like his life before he
ended up meeting I Bryan Cranston's
character Walter way there isn't a human
being alive that watch breaking bad that
wasn't just a little bit worried that
this wouldn't be good I know would soil
the name so many people were very upset
there was like a lot of nerd rage about
this when it got a natural you're
ruining at well there was nerd rage but
there was also like oh I trust Vince
Gilligan but the reviews are coming out
and there's it's good and they're pretty
positive they're like it even like it
even gives you a reason to rewatch
breaking bad because like there's like a
there's like crossover an undertone
resources are this is what we're doing
right now I am stoked as well with the
walking dead and that it's all it's all
right TV it's all gonna be great sunday
all the good stuffs coming back and
excited about that um so yeah that's
what I'm into but but now we have to
talk about what you guys are into which
is a which means it's time for your user
feedback
so yesterday we asked everybody to write
in with TD vs and tell us if they whoa
if they had to do mixed reality sports
like we talked about oculus rift versus
a real-life athlete would you be the
real life athlete or would you be the
virtual athlete and what sport would you
know what did you say uh I think what
did I say I don't even remember you
realize I litter like when we're done
filming the show my brain just like
erases what we just did I camera you
should watch the show then maybe I will
know I should i do when i edit i do when
i edit it and then as soon as i posted
it's like it's gone it just gets right
cuz i'm like a hard-driving coins every
day um so Mohamed wrote in and said I
would like to be a Formula One driver
virtual of course and race against the
rest of the f1 drivers are any racing
really I like that I with all of these
I'm gonna be like well you know it's
much more dangerous for the other person
of course well having is totally gonna
tip those cut those corners like way
hard and he's gonna crash and he's just
gotta laugh about it yeah hahaha and
rather like if I crash this very serious
accident a very expensive car yeah but
that would be very very cool that would
be super cool Rick wrote in and said
ping pong I will be a real player
playing with robot on the other side
imitating kill anonymous's moves what
who will be on virtual reality are you
game what ping pong no he would all be
the real player though playing against a
virtual you all right everybody's body
scan terrible at ping pong I was just
aggravated because that last person was
like well I want to see Unreal Engine
pong and I'm starting to see a theme it
everybody wants to play ping pong in
some way shape or fashion or form hey
listen I'm gay let's go some people
juggle geese let's go some people are
really in a ping pong lets me practice
your backhand let's get practice yeah
that's really nice a caution wrote in
and said I'd want to fight george george
st. Pierre in VR of course and not get
totally schooled in any sport from X
Games in parkour and then he wrote an
extra tweet and said an to add it's not
V it's not vs. but it would totally help
in training high-risk jobs like
firefighting hashtag thinking out of the
box nice job very good yeah we agree
very cool that is a really good way to
train people it's like instead of
actually they
I don't even know how to even put this
without giving away like a part of my
life that I'd rather not tell everyone
on the internet that happened but it's
just like in firefighting when you do
training stuff they have like actual
buildings that they burn and you can run
into them and Fire regalia and like
rescue a dummy but it's still kind of
dangerous even though it's a controlled
burn so like can you did this yes I did
why is that something you don't want to
share because I can't share the context
of it so anyway that's enough oh alright
fair enough good you are you're an
arsonist that's fine again yeah that's
that's definitely not it but um ya know
so it's like instead of doing that you'd
be able to just give if you put them put
them on with the oculus and the virtuix
and then you have them running like into
the building and let go up the stairs
and like put out the fire grabs body
drag it out like that would be amazing
Thanks yeah that'd be fun so the caution
but you know yeah it'd be a good way to
do it without potentially injuring
anyone to be great unless you fall down
in the virtue accident break your arm or
something in which case somebody'll to
it somebody will get injured I'm some
doof yeah somebody named kale somebody
whose name rhymes with kale anonymous
well no I got the VR on lock fair enough
okay guys it's time for our last piece
of user feedback which is our photog
refer of the day yeah are we gonna tell
them what we're doing this weekend no I
