Lamborghini Aventador roadster it's a
pretty cool ride I don't know if you
were I've heard about the Lamborghini
but I can't reach the pedals and they
couldn't find the key so I had to climb
in over the window can't reach can't
reach it either buttons and I don't know
what they do but I'm not actually here
for that we're not here for the
Lamborghini this is a great car $150,000
not too comfortable I don't feel really
at place I don't know how the doors work
um right here for the Lamborghini
surprisingly enough I didn't drive it in
protip I'm gonna try and get out so I
can show you what I'm really here for
let's forgotten when a handle is
this is an excellent data where my
lobster sucks
I'm here to talk to you about the
Lamborghini massage chair by body friend
come up with me here now if you think
this looks like a Lamborghini then
you're right because it's actually
designed to be the perfect accompaniment
to your fancy roadster car I'm gonna I'm
gonna climb in it's like a regular
massage chair except it just cost a cool
thirty thousand dollars and it's just as
easy to get into as a Lamborghini also
quite a nice recline so if you're
feeling like chilling out at the end of
the day you've driven through the
countryside maybe had some apres ski
with friends jump into your Lamborghini
massage chair pull out your remote
control and don't forget to turn it on
with a special button shape just like
the cars oh oh it's happening this is
real people this is real okay I'm gonna
choose from all of the preset modes and
choose from airbag massage smart care
manual massage and auto massage I think
I'm gonna take an airbag massage oh okay
I can also control where my head is
where my legs are and I can control the
incline vibration heat of the chair now
if this looks like something that's
maybe a bit too fancy for your house you
might be right
it's worth a cool thirty thousand
dollars and it's mostly been sold in
places like Macau and Asia they actually
gave some of these away to casino high
rollers after they'd earned enough
points to pay for the chair is it a
chair when it's this big alright you can
control your music through the sides
there we go can you hear that sound it
revs like an actual car alright I'm
gonna play some music turn up the dial
and let's get the vibrations going on oh
the heating's on okay back to my massage
choices
oh let's go for an auto yeah Auto
massage regular massage well let's go
quick massage this is faith okay a quick
full body with full body Oh didn't think
I get one of those in Las Vegas
oh it's actually heated and it's rubbing
my back in really confronting ways this
is pretty amazing I could get used to
this now most of CES is filled with tech
that people are hoping you'll buy I
don't know if I'm okay I don't know if I
have a $30,000 to spare and I don't know
if it's going to be for me but if you
have a Lambo and if you want to
supersize your massage experience then
this is probably the chair for you okay
that's all for me from the CES show fall
I both delighted and really confronted
I'm getting squeezed in new ways thanks
guys see you later on the show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
