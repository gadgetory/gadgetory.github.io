it's seen that show about what's coming
next
tomorrow and way way beyond tomorrow I'm
your host Eric Mac in an unusually rainy
and snowy New Mexico but I'm joined in
the studios in San Francisco by Bonnie
Burton Kelsey Adams Jeff Sparkman and
Steven Beecham if you want to join the
conversation today the chat rooms are
live on YouTube just go to youtube.com
slash CNET you'll find the far-sighted
link right there on the home page right
now we're also on livestream at live
stream comm slash CNET slash far-sighted
or if that's too long just sent a tweet
with the hashtag far-sighted and I'll
keep an eye out for that too
so later on to the show we're going to
hear about what went down at Silicon
Valley Comic Con from a few of our
intrepid correspondents there but first
we have a very special guest on the show
today who I'd like to introduce by way
of a really brief rant and I promise
that's a good thing we we talk an awful
lot here about science fiction and
science fact on this show and as a
science writer and a journalist I
mentioned before that I have kind of
sometimes uneasy relationship with
sci-fi because I worry that it's given
us a society as a society somewhat
unrealistic expectations about what
science and technology can do and how
quickly and at what scale it can do
those things I mean I get really excited
when we talk to scientists who have
found molecular hydrogen on the moons of
Saturn using a spacecraft by the way
that was not designed to do that at all
but then the response you know I often
hear from so many people is well what's
the big deal
call me when we found the aliens and you
can beam me directly there but there is
a really rare group of people out there
who dedicate themselves to bridging that
huge gap and put everything they have
and almost always at a high level of
risk into making those science fiction
fantasies even the crazy stuff from
comic books and superheroes stories
making that into reality and we've got
one of those people with us on
the line today via Skype from sale from
Silicon Valley
his name is Adam Draper he's the founder
and managing director of boost VC which
is an accelerator investing in startups
working on blockchain virtual reality
artificial intelligence drones there's a
really cool one that connects companies
with university researchers and of
course one of your startups is even
working on a hoverboard Adam Draper
welcome to far-sighted and that was an
awesome intro thank you for having me
yeah well did I get it right what is
boost VC in your own words yeah so we
invest in startups so we help start a
Founders get going
we provide its a programmatic approach
to investing it's called an accelerator
where twice a year we back 20 to 25
startups and we put them through the
gauntlet of creating a good
infrastructure for that startup we
actually provide housing and office
space and we invest in the startups that
go through a program um the way that I
like to think about it though is we're
sort of a hub to Silicon Valley for
companies from all over the world to
connect when working in virtual reality
blockchain flying cars what-have-you and
we happen to have built out our brand
really strongly around blockchain and
virtual reality though and so why is
that the focus why pick those two areas
VR and blockchain specifically you know
what do you see in those areas so I mean
I like there's a there's a long internet
or enter short answer like they're
awesome oh yeah that makes sense I mean
that's a good reason to invest well long
answer is four years ago I was an angel
investor I actually my background is I
went to use sale at UCLA as an English
major I founded a company out of UCLA to
help private company private companies
raise capital online which was a new
concept it would be like where would you
go to buy shares of the uber today like
we were trying to solve that problem for
for like Facebook and Twitter
that's everything and then I found that
I really enjoyed the mentorship side of
helping startups not make the same
mistakes I did but how we ended up
choosing I was an angel investor before
I've started this accelerator and I
backed a company called coin biz and so
coin base is if you've heard of Bitcoin
with the blockchain it's the most
financed startup in that space most
trusted startup in the Bitcoin
blockchain space and now then was one
guy in in a basement built building
thing and he and he pitched me this
really big idea of connecting the world
through financial transactions and I
bought in hook line and sinker and then
we when I found in boost VC which was
about two weeks later I ended up
dedicating a big percentage of our
future towards building APIs Bitcoin and
blockchain ecosystem and so then we
realized what we do is we build
communities around emerging technology
we basically when something's early we
back a lot of startups and launch the
network in the ecosystem like if you
know in the most basic of sense and then
what we realize is it didn't matter if
it was blockchain or some other
technology so two two and a half years
ago we looked at the market of
technologies out there and I tried
virtual reality reality and I was like
it's here it's happening this is the
platform this is going to be the future
of computing um let's let's jump in and
so two and a half years ago we we jumped
into that and we've backed now 180
startups total 55 in the VR space 65 in
the blockchains bit Bitcoin space and
you know a blimp a flying car a suit of
armor so of all the VR stuff you've seen
what's what's some of the coolest stuff
that you think we could have soon you
know really successful looking project
oh man you're gonna aim today go buy an
HTC vive or an oculus rift and you can
have the
and experience of different worlds being
able to build it what you're showing on
the screen right now sculptor VR which
is a it's a gravity game which is really
fascinating um now it's driving a made
it so that you could be built out of a
game engine so that other people could
build games and then there's I mean are
okay my big vision for VR VR is the way
that we're going to learn more faster so
that's my long-term 10-year vision like
VR is the way that we learn because how
we learn is through experience and VR
allows you to experience more or faster
than ever before
same way that the Internet allows us to
index a lot of information and became
sort of this web of information this is
indexing experiences and allowing this
to consume more experiences faster um
which is really really exciting on a
huge level for education but in order to
get there we're going to go through a
gaming like stage of development where
people are early adopters gaming and
we're going to go through to building
that you need tools to create the
content right now it's sort of difficult
to create content for virtual reality we
need more of that and then social like
just being there with other people is
really really important but so that's
pretty awesome I mean I wonder if you
can kind of build on that with the you
know the other things that you're
working on and you know how do you see
some of the companies you're working
with now changing how life is going to
be you know 10 20 years from now you
already talked about learning stuff and
VR what other things are coming down the
pike that are just going to be part of
daily life in 10 or 20 years ago so one
of the biggest trends and I don't know
what the listening audience viewing
audience your you guys know about
Bitcoin in the blockchain but it's
fundamentally going to change the way
governments and currencies work and that
is a really exciting trend that I'm
watching as people are decoupling
government from currency and that
concept is very very powerful where
suddenly
you can be in control of your own money
your own value and your trust so we're
on a big level I think that that's going
to be a big change that we can't predict
what's going to be happening after that
that happens which is exciting
um there's a there's a great quote that
I quote every once well from Phil Libin
you found it ever no he was talking
about BOTS but in general I said the
future is either gonna look like Star
Trek or Mad Max and yeah anytime I can
make it look a little more like that
Star Trek I invest and that's sort of
how I feel but like that's in essence
the philosophy that I've consumed along
with you know anything that gets me
closer to a Iron Man suit we would
really like to hear more about that like
what do you feel what do you look for in
an Iron Man suit what does an Iron Man
suit really need oh so uh be oh I'm
frozen on your screen I'm actually
hopefully you can hear me the UH area
yeah so what this video that you're
showing right now would I I know this
guy record brownie AK in your demo day
and he has built his own Iron Man she's
flying and this this absolutely blew my
mind like I can't actually explain how
incredible this but I don't there's a
quick clip of me in the background in
the front row and it's like I just freak
out like this is I mean it's the dream
like the ability to just like you I'm
over in the corner right there
I uh I it's the dream of being a
complete freedom and being able to fly
and this guy he's hovering a foot off
the ground or two three feet off the
ground but he could just go it's just
there's a lot more dangers that happen
oh and so he's uh but he's a fantastic
guy really brilliant
and he's captured the imagination of
like what's possible I feel like ever
since this video came out then Larry
Page released their pages company I
think it's called Kitty Hawk released a
flying car a video the like there are a
lot of these flying vehicles that are
that are emerging right now which is
super which I'm very very excited about
because I think that changes the way
that we think about travel that changes
the way it is going to change everything
you know a funny story they Richard
Browning sent me a press release on
March 31st about debuting that suit I
made him send me the UK patent number
cuz I didn't believe it was real to
prove it wasn't an April Fool's joke o
told me that he told me that like a lot
of people still thought it was fake
because he came out on April Fool's said
yeah yeah it was the day before and I
was dealing with his PR person and I
really ran her through the wringer to
prove that it wasn't it wasn't fake but
yeah there's pretty incredible stuff so
it's real
I can verifiably if you trust me but you
know maybe you should maybe shouldn't
but it's written it was the most it was
incredible and I'm I'm hoping to be in
line to have an Iron Man suit how loud
was it because I know with a lot of the
jet packs there deafeningly loud and I
was just curious how loud is that suit
when it's in operation or did was it
like you know not so noticeable oh it's
a full like audio touch experience like
the wind is like chaos leaf throwing
dirt all over the place uh and you know
the super loud and then this guy's
flying and you're freaking out about it
yeah but but it's the sound is about
three leaf blowers oh maybe a little
louder that's actually not too bad cuz
this the the jet packs are the ones that
sound like you have like a sonic maybe a
sonic boom but definitely a lot louder
where people you know have ringing in
the ears long after yeah we all had ear
plugs into so maybe maybe it was that
loud no you would know you would know
cuz I mean I I remember there's this guy
that had a jet pack and he used to dress
up like Boba Fett and when I worked at
Lucasfilm he we would hire him for
special events like a celebration or
convention or something and we had to
warn the city that we were in that he
was gonna be doing this because it's so
loud it sounds like a jet engine but you
can hear it for blocks and blocks and
blocks away and he's also high up I mean
he goes up pretty far so it's not like
he's just hovering off the ground I mean
he's like he comes out of nowhere and
then lands and it's super loud so I was
just curious
with this type of because it's not the
same type of equipment it's totally
different so I was just curious yeah
he's the first one that has done it this
way which is sort of like he has to be
in super good shape to be able to do it
it's wondering about that like what kind
of I don't know training they they need
to go through so yes do like was it go
kinesthetic esthetics like the Rings it
like the gymnasts use and right hold the
positions
yeah and I got cross right yeah and he's
in he's in super good shape the guy's a
machine he runs like super marathons or
something like he's super awesome so
Phenom if he didn't if he wasn't strong
enough to maintain the right kind of
posture would would he sort of get
wildly knocked off balanced by the
engines and so on so one what is the
only thing that's ever happened and you
said was I mean he fat so he was a
couple feet off the ground and our arm
one of the arms basically came loose or
the jet like threw him to the ground a
little bit but there's a default like
Killswitch that everything dies and it
wasn't that big a deal um he makes
accept his caliph BC he believes that
it's safer than a motorcycle well sure
which you know I don't know
that's the argument you want to make
well it could be like safer than
hoverboard concerning that a lot of
those hoverboards just ignite for no
reason so well you're looking on an
actual hoverboard though right Adam you
got a company that is yeah so we backed
a lot being entrepreneur eighteen year
old and he's fantastic and like this is
what he wants to dedicate his life to
and he's building a his envision is a
flying car but he is as a segue to that
segue bit
it's uh it's been pretty awesome
yeah and becomes called Airport and it
yeah we're super excited about it he's
visually what we look for is tenacity in
our entrepreneurs and that's what really
wins championships so we're we're really
excited about all all of our
entrepreneurs but like all the
technologies were investing in these are
the things that in five years we're
going to be using and it's divided well
maybe for the flying cars and iron suit
maybe it's ten but like the like virtual
reality we're all going to be using
virtual reality it is more efficient to
meet someone in VR than it is to meet
them in person and that's going to be a
huge business use case like we back to
company let's do
you still like if I'm designing a
product and I needed to be manufactured
in China or wherever it needs me
manufactured I I can show them the
object in 3d and I'm you know turning it
over and showing them in expanding it
and you know I can explain every piece
of it so there's less of a communication
error than when you're just sending like
2d emails back and forth of one another
that's awesome
um yeah it so we're using you're good I
was just saying there's real use cases
for this stuff it's really exciting
where do you see the the flying car
thing in ten years because you know
there's people like vertical takeoff and
landing is like one thing that uber is
looking into some of those jetpack guys
think that they'll have some version of
what they're doing that'll just be like
personal transportation where do you see
that going like like the uber
ride-sharing drones are we all gonna
have flying cars is gonna be more of a
ride-sharing situation what do you think
I think it's a really interesting
question because first off you need to
assume that flying car is that it's a
little bit of an assumption because
we're not quite sure but you have to
assume that flying cars is more
efficient than like driving and things
like that and for an individual I think
it probably will be but gas wise I don't
know it's going to be high cost um
what's it good for is it mid-range is it
that like 50 minute trip or is it the 10
minute trip um what's it replacing in
our life so those are like the questions
that you'd want to ask uh it will be
less efficient for moving huge like
cargo it will be more efficient for
moving people and so I think yeah I mean
I think in 10-15 years we're gonna be
the coolest thing ever autonomous cars
flying cars so my my daughter who is 3
years old will never need to drive I'm
very excited I never thought about that
that's a good that's a good at thinking
there yeah it'll be interesting to see
how much of the
flying vehicles or autonomous because I
was just thinking oh now I have a way to
see car crashes above me because people
are notoriously bad drivers even though
the tech is so advanced right now it's
almost like because we can like text and
do things we're not paying attention to
our driving even more than before so I'm
hoping that if it's air travel people
the right either it'll be autonomous so
robots who aren't getting it all of a
sudden want to pretend they're in Fast
and Furious they won't be the ones
driving or maybe you know it'll be
reserved for emergency purposes so
actual police and ambulances and fire
trucks can get where they're supposed to
be getting quicker that would be great
but it'll be interesting to see like who
who's actually going to be using and
what they're going to be used for at the
beginning or if it's just going to turn
into Fifth Element
and we're all like barely running into
each other I'm okay I'm hoping
everything is done with magnets because
we're seeing all these uh you know
quadcopter things and this Kitty Hawk
thing we're just watching and they're
blowing air around that jet thing though
they're blowing air and blowing dust and
garbage now my allergies get good by you
you walk on targetting yeah flying over
your head it's gonna be crazy so we may
need like some sort of like allergen
helmets to wear so we don't obviously
instantly get you know a mouthful of
dust but ya know I'm always curious
about that because also we've been
dreaming about this since sci-fi is
existed so I mean not even just Star
Wars and Star Trek but in the 50s I mean
if you look at illustrations from
Popular Mechanics from the 50s and
earlier these were things people were
hoping for would be already a reality
now so it'll be interesting yeah I mean
Jetsons the guy is a middle class man
who flew uh you know flew a flying plane
to work there's a great joke about that
too is because of the future of Jetsons
no one walks anywhere they're always on
escalators or they're always on you know
sidewalks that are moving that when they
actually have to walk on their own like
it uh it was a Harvey Birdman skit I
think where they just couldn't get
anywhere
they were always out of breath because
they had to walk places in the Harvey
Birdman cartoon words and Jetsons they
have to flow they flew everywhere they
were on escalators or the Jetsons
spaceship is really quiet to listen it
just goes like yeah really it's like a
Prius no it's not like jet engine wow
the Fantastic Four are doing it watching
also all the buildings look like you
know mid-century modern like and
everyone has like a robot helper which
we sort of do now but they aren't quite
this is just like you know Rosie this is
how I want to drop my kid off at school
yeah there's leagues right now why'd I
have to physically walk them into school
and then say goodbye
I just want to dump them off of it
jettison them out of them yeah literally
Jen oh you're being recorded right now
you're gonna show this a little later I
saw Adam your big comic comics guy right
oh yeah I'm a huge comic book bin what
are your faves so uh well my but my
thesis around investing has been build
the Ironman suit so BR you know if we're
flying in space the currency of space is
probably not going to be paper so we
went in the Bitcoin and then you know
I'm looking at actual iron in suits but
the superhero I grew up on was Peter
Parker spider-man and right now my
favorite comic book is by a guy named
Kirkman uh is it Robert Kirkman idea
it's called invincible there isn't a
that's a good one yeah I'm a huge con
azúcar awesome so so our crew here in
San Francisco was was down at Silicon
Valley comic-con this past weekend I
wonder I wonder how much you guys saw
down there that kind of ties into what
Adams working on what we've been talking
about well I went to the NASA panel that
they had and that was the thing that
surprised me the most was people ask
them are you worried about funding right
and they said actually we're getting a
lot where things are looking really good
for us right now and so we're we're just
working hard and getting to Mars and you
know they talked about methane and
liquid water alkylations and drones and
you know it was really great um but you
guys did know I was just gonna say yeah
they're getting funding cuz Trump just
watch Star Wars on Air Force One so the
robot he just watch real good so it
knows what kind of funding he's thinking
about um I love the NASA booth there you
know I think NASA should be at every
comic book convention the reason that
Silicon Valley Comic Cons are different
than San Diego comic-con during New York
comic-con or other Comic Cons that you
might be used to is that they have a
whole level of tech and science as well
as the usual suspects of comic books and
video games and you know the movies and
TV stuff that we're all excited about
when we go to comic book conventions
where it's more of a pop culture
convention nowadays and was is really
interested in the way that comic books
and sci-fi help us plan future science
and yeah July's future societies and you
know the connection there so it almost
felt like a science fair it kind of felt
like a bridge between maker faire which
is something that happens around the
country which is kind of like a science
fair on you know steroids it's actually
I always call it Burning Man for kids
because it's like it's like the coolest
science fair ever all these like you
know Tesla coils and robots everywhere
and of course all the r2d2 astromechs
and it's really great to get kids
excited about science and tech and
engineering and I wish that more comic
book conventions had a NASA section I
know there's a NASA section at Emerald
City Comicon and I think if there's
comic book conventions closer to where
there's a NASA hub I mean we have NASA
Ames which is part of Silicon Valley but
I think also you know I'm sure the
Houston comic book conventions have NASA
there as well so it's just good to see
some real-life stuff as mixed in with
the sci-fi stuff so I I had a blast I
had a pic I had my picture taken in
front of that are inside that vintage
like was it vintage NASA astronaut
astronaut suit I didn't go into the head
on display yeah the one they had on
display I think you just showed a
picture of it of someone
was in there um you could get your
picture taken inside it looked like you
were inside that now yeah there you go
the yeah it's funny because there are a
lot of little kids trying and the steps
didn't quite make it so it's like a lot
of little kids are hanging on for dear
life trying to get their picture taken
and when I took my picture it looked
like I was the most excited astronaut on
earth are not honored but the new
astronaut suits are much more sci-fi
than that but I I just love that they're
getting kids excited about NASA because
I think that's important to always have
a real life element yeah they had a
whole stem village for kids yeah I
didn't go into because I didn't want to
seem creepy I'm sure it was good we got
we took a lot of pictures down at like
the area where they had stuff for kids
and one of my favorite parts was the
tech your parents grew up on just
because because I don't feel old enough
already
oh did they have Walkmans oh yeah they
had like all kinds of DC arc Apple twos
the one that really killed me was like
they had what you remember the
transparent phones that were popular
yeah late 80s early yea thick they had
basically the phone that I had when I
was in high school oh my god no good
it's artifact Ya Ya Allah wasn't like a
Motorola no it was like not like a
landline phone I was like kind of
transparent had neon colors I mean every
time people talk about how new VR is I
keep thinking of that Murder She Wrote
episode with Jessica Fletcher trying out
a VR video game and she's got the gloves
on and a helmet and everything and so I
mean we've been working on I regret
about it a lot of time with but you
couldn't have it in your house before
right well you yeah exactly it wasn't
not it was yeah it wasn't like everyday
use it was something that was very
high-tech that you can only get in
certain areas but yeah no I
I like the Silicon Valley comic-con just
because it's the second year they've
done it so they're still trying to find
themselves and try to figure things out
but it's pretty well organized parking
is nightmare as with any convention um
oh yeah there's did you just show gonna
 oh that's a really good episode
actually if you have Netflix it's on
Netflix right now so you can watch that
episode it's a murder that takes place
in a VR company and shieff has to find
clues within the VR game it's very like
vector I want to do
that yeah it's pretty awesome um needs
to be an escape shimmery make that
prasena you know that whole season has
cell phones and cars too
they actually had mobile cart but
they're huge oh yeah um but I like that
they have like I like that they had like
tech we grew up with that Silicon Valley
comic-con though I really good idea yeah
it was like oh yeah had one of those in
school had one of those it's go oh yeah
god I'm old why do they have the
Castaway the volleyball well that was a
separate thing they also had an auction
yeah these are all oh this I see the
screen-used props and like one of the
coolest things that I saw there I don't
have a picture of it in the gallery but
um I had to get my picture taken with an
actual Superman suit that Chris Reeve
wore granted it was in Superman 3 but he
still wore it still a good mood I still
love Superman 3 or you don't allowed to
talk about well I don't I I don't think
anybody's gonna get in trouble but you
know how like when they have props you
know for auction they don't want you
touching them great you know if they
don't want you screwing I won't you grab
me little hands all over the space I'll
say I was talking to one of the guys who
was in charge and he asked me if I'd
touch the Superman suit because I was
telling him right how big of a deal it
was for me to see it in person I'm like
no I wouldn't think like I wouldn't even
think of touching it because so he took
me in there and I got to touch it I was
one of the high points of that's pretty
exciting
did it this energy transfer into your
body and I haven't been able to fly yet
and I don't have like little Superman
spit curl going either
ha ha ha we are tracking him just in
case yeah just in case we just have a
joke at Lucasfilm with that when you
would go into Lucasfilm archives and you
would touch the Ark of the Covenant
nothing might happen so a lot of us were
like I'm not touching that even I'll
touch the Captain EO suit before I touch
those keep your covenant yeah exactly
but no matter I like that they had two
good makes a prop so it's good so Adam
you must I mean if you're building an
Iron Man suit you must have some
experience with comic-con or cosplay is
that right uh yeah no well I've gone to
the San Francisco comic-con it wasn't
last year it might not be comic-con just
kind B but it had been the my
throwing a big event um but no I went I
went to a big comic book convention I
went to one end that was in New York I
have not been to the major I haven't
been to the Silicon Valley one and I
haven't been to the one and now San
Diego either Cine know is the one that's
like a war zone
yeah so this is so Richard browning it
is being asked to speak at the in the
San Diego one the the Iron Man guy oh
yeah so so that you can fly you know to
his bang and show people flight it's
okay so is your own your own quest to
build a suit for yourself is that along
the same lines of what he's building or
do you have like a different design in
mind so it's more partaking in the you
know innate but what my whole career is
enabling people to do these things and
one of the things that I just want to be
a part of is the Iron Man suit creation
gotcha
and so yeah I mean there are a lot of
things in the Iron Man movie that he
hasn't built yet so yeah and I'm also
fascinated with like underwater you know
submarine type of things there are a lot
of things we haven't discovered
underwater so that'd be a cool suit if
you were able to go like super deep um
rather than up but yeah it's I mean
common proves our inspiration for all
sci-fi I mean all technology like and
and and science fiction Star Trek has
created countless things that have been
built now for sure totally for sure and
Jeff for you I think sci-fi at least
with the comic-con was was inspiration
to cope with some other issues and you
wrote about that for I've seen it want
to dive into that at all uh yeah sure um
so like I have been reading comic books
since I can read and watching kind of
like sci-fi stuff since I could watch
things which you know um but I don't get
to go to a lot of conventions because I
mean like nobody really likes crowds
but like when you get to the point where
you see a lot of people and then you
just start like like physically reacting
to it um it makes it a little less fun
to go um so a lot of times I just kind
of like you know watch everybody else go
so what I've been doing is trying to
kind of kind of hack my way I guess into
being able to go to conventions be able
to do things that I want to do um so you
just you know you can you can read the
article and and learn all these things I
would just like to point out as I
mentioned in there I am NOT a doctor nor
do I play one on TV but no it's just
like a lot of like simple things like
you know you can start it like small
conventions um cuz I've noticed like in
the last couple years it seems like even
like you know like my old home town had
a convention and my daughter went in the
cosplay contest
oh she got third place she was very
happy but it's it's a it's a nice place
to just kind of like ease yourself into
it because it's just kind of scaled
really um now to be fair when I when I
go into even small conventions if I go
into like you know the dealer area where
you can buy all the stuff that you don't
need but you really want um it's I still
like kinda like have like a physical
reaction but I need to kind of like you
know you push through it and you know it
gets slightly easier the more you do it
but you're still kind of fighting that
initial react one of your tips in there
was if you need to move around easily or
leave quickly follow someone tall oh yes
because they'll usually people will you
know get out of their way yeah I I sort
of did that at Comic Cons I would go to
I would follow people with very large
cosplay yes exam weather is chuckles
yeah well the problem is you run the
risk though if it's good if it's not
late they'll stop every five seconds to
take photos and then you're surrounded
and you're you're caught with a horrible
look on your face photo bombing someone
so you're gonna be like 20,000 photos
looking panicked which could end up
being like a court case evidence for
something so I you know if you could
follow someone tall that's not doing
excessively good cosplay
something bulky maybe like a crappy
Chewbacca yeah or maybe you know someone
that's just you know Abraham Lincoln I
don't see a lot of those gonna hat your
hat that really gives you like yeah um
yeah you want to be very careful not to
follow around people that are good at
cosplay because then you will be stuck
yeah forever I always found that
following goth kids was good uh-huh
because they don't like crowds they
don't like the Sun um they're antisocial
so Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter would
actually be perfect yes but no that's a
great article you wrote Jeff I'm glad
that you read it because I think a lot
of us to the older we get the less
anxious we are to I mean the less eager
we are to be in the middle of like you
know a stormtrooper battalion yeah just
want to get to the nacho stand or
something and yeah yeah and just like
even just something as simple as just
grabbing a piece of wall yeah that gives
you at least one direction you know
you're not going to be in somebody's way
yeah now familiarity helps me a lot to
like the first time I went I was
terrified until I sat in my first panel
and then I was like well I'm sitting in
a chair listening to a speech I've done
that before yeah I know what that's like
no I'm that's good and then the next
year I was scared again but not as much
because I knew I'd done in the previous
yeah someone like a meteor sittings
another good way to kind of deal with
crowds and dealing with overpopulated
cons and you just kind of want to go
somewhere to relax and not be in the
overcrowded concessions area follow
anyone with armor because a lot of them
have to change out of it and there's
special designated areas for storm
troopers or for people dressed in like
you know King Arthur armor or the
Klingons they all kind of know where to
go getting out where it's a little bit
cooler the lines aren't as bad at San
Diego comic-con that's upstairs through
the exhibit hall and then you go
upstairs not it's the opposite of the
entrance yeah and they have their own
it's actually really nice over there and
that's where a lot of the celebrities
are because none of the fans have
figured it out yet I probably just ruin
it for them but thanks Lonnie but any
convention you go to there's always one
space where it feels like oh this is
where the parents go like this is where
we came for the old fogies go to like
relax and not get you know strollers
running over them
yeah I was even able to find I mean not
empty spaces but like
empty enough spaces even at San Diego
last yeah which I can't believe I
actually went to cuz yes indeed guys a
madhouse I mean it's it's fun to say you
went once but it's crazy did we just
lose Adam we did we had a bad connection
his connection dropped so I just want to
say thanks to Adam for being on the show
really awesome having you yeah Geoff
inspiring I'm gonna check out your site
to see what you're investing in because
it sounds really fun oh yeah here's this
Twitter in case anyone wants to find him
at Adam Draper it looks like a visionary
here's Buchan hombre you think it's
superhero already Glenn yo visionary
yeah so go check out his stuff they're
working on some cool stuff there's other
stuff too that I know we haven't even
scraped the surface of what they're
working on so I feel like maybe we
should have him on as a regular guest
every once in a while to find out what
he's a tail catch up we don't want to
distract him from from investing I know
I wish I had money to invest but now see
Silicon Valley was fun to answer your
question Erik I had fun I was only there
on Sunday I was part of it and bullying
panels as coaches ask you about that
yes called me a superhero in real life
um chase masterson he was a Star Trek
actress and she's done a bunch of stuff
she's really a huge advocate advocate
and ending bullying and dealing with
bullying and um with both teenagers and
adults and kids and I was part of it
because I wrote a book called girls
against girls which is a preteen and
teen ager self-help book about how to
deal with Mean Girls but also have not
to become one in the process because
it's very easy and girls have a totally
different way of how they bully each
other out a nice ad there i girl them
away and quickly that was quick girls
have a way of bullying each other
different than let's say boys a few was
a great show called 13 reasons why on
Netflix I highly recommend watching
based on a book young adult book and
it's about bullying in high school but
um this panel was interesting I was just
honored to be on there I was there with
rod
Roddenberry um Gene Roddenberry's son
and it you know there's a really
eclectic group of people on this panel
but one of them cannot remember a name I
think it's dr. Scarlett something's in
my Twitter on my phone but she
was I believe from Russia Russia or
Latvia somewhere were there would have
been radiation and she moved here as a
child um as a refugee and didn't know
English didn't know anyone her family
moved here and she was bullied because
when people found out that she was
literally radioactive they bullied her
um and she turned to superhero comics
specifically the x-men as solace and to
find you know relatable characters and
of course storm you know and obviously
how many characters and superhero comics
have a radioactive like that's how it
becomes so she you know found some sort
of you know disappointed Jeff didn't
just actually pop out with another no
she found some common ground there
actually if you want to hand me my phone
I can call up her name phones are dr.
Janina Scarlett yeah that's it
um she sounds like a superhero uh but
she was really inspiring and she came
out with a book I think it's called
superheroes in real life superhero
therapy yep that's it and she goes to
schools and teaches kids that they can
find positive messages through superhero
comics and superheroes and how to deal
with um day to day problems through
superhero therapy and she's an actual
psychologist she has two PhDs I mean she
was so inspiring to sit next to I'm like
why I have a book I wrote for teen girls
and then she goes into this I was
worried I'm radioactive I was a refugee
and she's like super nice and she's got
like two degrees and she's doctor and
she heard about superheroes and she's
helping kids in school so it was
definitely an inspiring panel there was
also some cosplayers that um reach out
to kids for representation so there's
african-american cosplayer from Atlanta
who dresses up as Batman then he says
that a lot of you know kids um people of
color come up to him and go thank you
for representing Batman as you like you
know say she's like I'm not black Batman
I'm Batman and it's a very interesting
way to deal with that because a lot of
geek on geek bullying happens especially
in the cosplay industry or a cosplay
community because if you don't look
exactly like the comic-book character
you're portraying in the movies or TV
you get a lot of Hell I mean and there's
a lot of curvy girls that like to dress
up as Lavely and I don't want to get
yelled at because I'm not like a size
whatever even Carrie Fisher didn't like
being that size like she's like it was a
it was hard to stay that size for her so
umm it's just interests that panel was
interesting because it talked a lot
about geek on geek um
bullying but also talked about you know
how we can all be positive influences
how we can all help kids growing up in
this kind of scenario where they're
constantly being bullied how they can
look towards these fictional characters
that have overcome massive you know bad
huge hugely bad childhood trauma
um and bullying and were able to not
become villains out of it so it's it was
an interesting panel but it was good
that they had that and we had a pretty
decent crowd even though we were against
we're competing against Adam Savage
which is always hard and then just as a
segue to Adam Savage he dressed up as
Chewbacca um and if you know Adam Savage
from Mythbusters whenever he does a
convention he works on a costume that's
a huge elaborate ordeal of a costume he
works on all year and then he enter he
goes into these conventions incognito so
no one knows it's him so the Chewbacca
costume that he built and he has many by
the way uh this one had an animatronic
c-3po that he was carrying on his back
but look how good that is that's like a
movie ready and keep in mind I don't
like he actually killed chubak yeah keep
in mind too that Adam worked at ILM I
mean he worked in industrial like magic
where this was you know we had to do
stuff like this well I worked at
Lucasfilm when he was there and he knows
movie props inside and out if you go to
a site tested comm you'll see this video
I wrote an article about it on CNET so
you can see the video there too but look
at that it's awesome
but the reason I'm wearing the backpack
is because it allows me to distribute
the load of Threepio this is about 35
pounds and the Threepio comes courtesy
not courtesy I mean I paid him for it
Threepio Master Gordon Tarpley he put
this together for me in a record amount
of time he supplied me with the Threepio
parts that were vacuum metallized in
gold and pre weathered I built it all
into this framework now when you're
attaching resin parts like this
difficult so I did a couple of
structural things I added a web strap
that goes out through the thigh across
the bottom calf back up through the
other thigh so that even if someone that
starts to deteriorate from the wear and
tear of the floor it will still hold
together and he won't catch on fire I
mean that's some such as Oliver so he's
wearing a very flammable costume and he
has a lot of wiring back there sweaty he
must be like in that full 35 pound metal
backpack yeah so there he is going
through I think I walked past him and I
didn't realize it um but it's so good I
mean it's better than probably Peter
Mayhew is costume in the first film
now does this are the c-3po move around
yeah I did I'm thinking heads ms around
the light eyes light up you can sort of
see a little bit um he does a bunch of
different dialogue um from the movies
it's pretty impressive that's pretty and
of course he was gathering Kratz
paquetes Adams done all different
costumes I'm he's dressed up as a
realistic bear he's dressed up as the
was it Toro from the must oh yeah yeah
um he's I mean he really goes all out
and at comic-con San Diego's probably
the ones where he really tries to get as
much bang for his buck but the problem
with San Diego comic-con 2 is you're
starting to compete with a lot of
cosplayers if this is there like
livelihood now yeah take a picture with
a low budget
Chewbacca at CES yeah I wasn't excited I
personally I personally prefer low
budget
Chewbacca's I find them a much more
interesting and hilarious when they're
made out of carpet uh charm I like it
when I mean I love professional looking
cosplayers of course right I also like
when people are halfway like it's more
like a Halloween costume like they love
this they've put their resources into it
but isn't their actual career and so
like there was a girl at SV
see see Jedi robes where she was wearing
actually a brown cardigan with cable
stitching on it and it looked really
good you know it fit the aesthetic but
it was still also homey yeah I mean I
think we're getting to a point now at
comic-book conventions where you're
seeing people that are making
professional-grade cosplay costumes and
a lot of them this is their livelihood a
lot of them are paid to be at different
places or they're on reality TV shows
where they're competing I mean you know
and a lot of these shows are great too
because this is like a calling card for
these people to work in actual films um
and TV so it's but I have to agree with
you Kelsey like I really like seeing
people that just love the characters but
don't necessarily have the time or the
patience or the money to put into the
costumes but you still can say you know
I'm doing something I'm showing off what
I love and I love cross cross-play where
women are playing male characters and
male men are playing female characters a
lot of Lady Captain America's this year
yeah I just did a video I just did an
article and seen that I think it was
this week of Mass Effect beat down
boogie put together their remix reel of
all the different Mass Effect's from all
the different conventions that they've
gone to and Mass Effect is great because
I mean as a video game it's even so many
different types of characters but
there's a lot of gender swapping going
on and I mean well what you get for
either gender yeah yeah this chair this
chair so it makes sense but I just I
loved seeing all the different commander
Sheppard's both male and female
obviously you can do that in the game so
it was it was interesting but these are
all very professional I mean these are
the people that like spend years on
their costumes and their outfits as
opposed to kind of like the half other
yeah I don't know I would I can't
cosplay like I I'm a crafter so I do a
lot of craft books and things but for me
I'd rather cosplay as a building I think
we were talking about this right before
they were we went live of what we would
cost play at especially to convention
like Silicon Valley Comic Con it's like
I I know that Simone Gertz who does the
crappy robots she cosplays as Windows
like a computer that shows windows I
think I saw a picture and so it was like
her head that was just a computer box
and then she had all black on but then
her face was done like the the window I
think it was a windows logo I think so
um I thought that was hilarious because
that makes sense at Silicon Valley Comic
Con because you want to have something
as like tech so I maybe next year I'll
do cosplay as a flip phone or some like
old-school tech that no one will
understand why I'm dressed like that I
feel like that would be I don't know
maybe a Walkman I've had a long-running
joke for a while that I'm a very hirsute
hairy man and so I've had a joke for a
world if I continuously shaved all of my
head and body hair I could knit it into
a sweater I'm thinking maybe I should up
that until I can if I shave and collect
enough maybe I could knit my own
Chewbacca suit there you go you could I
mean it's interesting a Steve sansweet
who's director of fan relations at
Lucasfilm and he has this thing called
Rancho obi-wan which is this giant
collection that he houses at his place
that's a it's a giant used to be a
chicken ranch and he refurbished the
barn so you can have all his entire Star
Wars convention that are at Star Wars
collectibles there and it's a non-profit
so you can go and visit and you know pay
certain amount to to visit it but I
asked him what his biggest regret was as
a collector that he did not buy and he
said that was either a garage sale or a
flea market and it was a portrait of
Chewbacca done by a barber that
basically anytime he cut hair he would
collect the human hair and make these
elaborate Chewbacca portraits and he's
like he just couldn't do it because his
human hair and he just felt weird about
it
but he's always regretted that he didn't
buy that because it's actually really
well done it wasn't like cheeseball it
actually looked good but it was all done
with like human hair and beard hair it's
just like that's gotta be amazing oh you
know even though we know it's on
Christmas list sir maybe I'll do a craft
tutorial for starters for me the fourth
will do shave your beard and make a
Chewbacca portrait at the same time if
you have your next book idea about eggs
I think that's about all the time for
we're running a little over we could go
on forever probably thanks again to Adam
Draper from booth BC for joining us that
was really fascinating I think we could
have gone on for quite a while talking
about everything that they're working on
over there thanks again for having him
join us and thanks also to the crew
there in San Francisco Bonnie Burton
Kelsey Adams and Jeff Sparkman our
intrepid Silicon Valley comic-con
reporters and of course behind the
control Stephen Beecham nobody has ever
pulled up the jetsons video faster Thank
You YouTube thanks everyone for watching
check out everything that we talking
right but of course on cnet.com and at
boost DC that's the website for Adams
company there Adams accelerator so uh
thank you again this has been
far-sighted we will see you next month
