to the Apple bite for everything good
and bad inside the world of Apple let's
get to the show and the new MacBooks
can't come soon enough not only for us
but for Apple as well
the latest Gartner report estimates PC
shipments fell 5.7 percent overall this
quarter making it the eighth consecutive
quarter of decline and the longest
duration of the client in the PC
industry now Apple's Mac shipments have
dropped thirteen point four percent
compared to the same quarter last year
ouch
so if you weren't sure about talk of
this post PC era yeah it's been here for
a while now Apple even rescheduled its
upcoming earnings call from October the
27th to two days earlier on the 25th
leading many to believe that an
announcement for the new refreshed
MacBook Pro MacBook and iMac lineup will
happen on October the 27th instead it's
not official but you can mark that date
on your calendar for now and really
what's the best way to shift attention
away from it another quarterly decline
in iPhone sales guess what brand new
Macs two days later now I'm still
curious about how good the oled touch
bar will actually be with this rumored
new MacBook Pro but reality is that it
probably still won't be enough to turn
around Apple's PC shipment fortunes
significantly but maybe brighter days
are ahead for the iPhone according to
USB analysts they expect the iPhone 7 to
help spur an 8% growth for Apple in 2017
and if you want to be even more
optimistic they say the new 10th
anniversary iPhone or what we like to
call the iPhone X will bring even a
bigger boost in fiscal 2018 with a 16
percent year-over-year throat now these
numbers have not been confirmed with no
shirt on us yet next question and in
Apple pants I could be coming to an
iPhone X near you Apple has been granted
a patent for embedding light sensors
directly into device displays and this
is important because it will help create
a full-screen iPhone without its current
big black forehead and chin bezels this
design change could save millimeters on
the final design specification and could
open up the doors for a true fullscreen
iPhone X display and another recent
panel one issue Apple described
a super-resolution multi-sensor camera
with cube prisms it details a three
sensor camera array that's capable of
achieving a maximum image quality in a
minimal amount of space there are
space-saving benefits to the patent but
it's folded camera design can also offer
more room for extended zoom capabilities
again it's a patent so we'll wait and
see how it may or may not be integrated
there's also been a constant
back-and-forth battle in the courts
between Apple and Samsung that started
back in 2011 and it's a fight over three
iPhone design elements patented by Apple
that Samsung had earlier been found to
copy in 11 of its phones now the case
has finally reached the Supreme Court
this week lower courts ruled Samsung
should pay 100% of the profits earned
from those phones while samsung thinks
they should pay less now Sammy may get
its wish as two of the justices agree
that design is part of the reason
someone would buy a phone but not the
entire reason the Supreme Court's ruling
is expected to take two to three months
and they will not decide the final
amount owed but we'll pass it back to
the federal courts to rule on a revised
sum how fun
also Apple recently won an appeal for
120 million dollars in its case against
Samsung again but this time for the
slide to unlock feature which they no
longer even use in iOS 10 and you know
Sammy is trying to hold on to anything
they can after the train wreck that was
the galaxy note 7 I called it the best
phone of 2016 and I stood by that until
you know it started exploding not once
but twice
even with its replacement units now the
note 7 is officially dead samsung has
completely stopped production it's dead
dunzo they're even asking people to send
back their note 7 in a fireproof return
box that will only be shipped by car now
this can only be a good thing for Apple
but you can't really talk about Samsung
without Apple they were arch rivals it's
that competition that really led to
Samsung rushing out the note 7 but this
could be really the end of that rivalry
and before we go I always have to show
love to you the Apple biters how many of
you have an Apple watch or just got one
well you know I returned the series to
watch because I'm not a swimmer and I
personally don't use the GPS feature on
trails so it just wasn't as useful for
me compared to my original Apple watch
you know what I'm gonna wait for the
next one now there are plenty of you who
have a first-gen 1 or
your first Apple watch and I've got
something for you check out the Go Power
watch from our friends at connects it's
the first portable battery for the Apple
watch that you can take with you on the
go and it has the capacity to charge
your Apple watch six times you can even
use it to charge your phone and an Apple
watch at the same time it has an
inductive charging spot specifically for
the Apple watch it's pretty sweet and
it's the first of its kind so all you
have to do is watch last week's show
tell me what I called two iPads joined
together from Apple's rumored magnets
patent I even touched the box for you so
you know what's real plus you can go to
their website for 10% off everything
using the code Apple byte 10 and it's
good until Saturday October 22nd all
right that's gonna do it for this week's
show you can email us at the Apple buy
to see Netcom or tweet me at brian song
and i will announce the winner of next
week thanks so much for watching we'll
catch y'all next time for the bite of
the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
