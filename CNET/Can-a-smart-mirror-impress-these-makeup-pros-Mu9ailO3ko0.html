lighting you may as well not have done
it I don't think women need to know
anything about lighting to do their
makeup I think they need to know about
their makeup fluorescent light is kind
of the worst case scenario for lighting
and that's what's that's what I have in
my office
my only concern too is like doing your
makeup for like fluorescent lighting for
an office is then you if you do it for
that lighting which is never flattering
for anyone I would find myself in the
bathroom just like looking at my face
thinking I just left the house like I
know I look better than this and one
time somebody else came in it was really
very spacious
oh no I do this all the time like
there's no way we look this bad it's
this is a joke and then you walk out
into the real world to go get your
coffee in the morning get Starbucks it's
just not gonna translate well I wish it
had a magnifier I think magnification is
key I think it needs some magnification
just for that detail work that women do
with their eyeliner and mascara and just
check-in eyeshadow bloon $400 even if I
just had a lot of money laying around is
a pretty steep price for admission with
regrets to make it marriage like it
would be something it would just sit on
someone's vanity that has extra income
that likes something kind of fun and
techy
I think it you have to be pretty far
into the extreme of whatever it is
you've done look whatever lighting
you've done your makeup for for it to
look sort of weird in other lights oh I
don't think any sort of lighting app is
gonna turn any woman into a makeup
genius it's not it's not going to help
you with your application at all
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
