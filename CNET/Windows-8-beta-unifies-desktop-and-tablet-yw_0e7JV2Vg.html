checking out Microsoft's most ambitious
operating system yet the windows 8 beta
also known as the consumer preview is in
fact rockin a traditional windows core
with the Metro tiled interface means
that Microsoft has created the first
unified OS for both PCs and tablets and
it's got the sink to back it up Windows
8 is big gutsy and there's a whole heck
of a lot to show you it may even freak
you out just a little bit that's okay
you may not like it but trust me you're
gonna want to see this there are two big
changes to Windows the first and most
obvious and the one that's most likely
to hurt your brain just a little bit is
the touch interface Windows 8 is all
kinds of touchy-feely after logging in
the first thing you'll see is this new
start screen we saw a rough version of
this back in September but now the tiles
are interactive and they update in real
time more on that in a sec here's how
you navigate around swipe in from the
right edge and the windows 8 charms will
appear these include the instantly
recognizable search share start to
return to the start screen devices and
settings once you've launched at least
one app you can swipe in from the left
edge to return to the last open app
pinch to zoom out and get a global view
of your app groups you can also create
new custom groups and move apps around a
quick swipe in and then back out on the
left edge shows you thumbnails of
recently used apps as well as your Start
screen at the bottom so yes the start
button is hidden but no it's not really
that hard to get to it takes about the
same effort to get to the start screen
from either edge the left and right
edges are for settings so the top and
bottom are for the apps themselves an
Internet Explorer for example this means
that your location bars at the bottom
and your tabs are up top on the start
screen you can get a list view of all
your apps in mail you can set up
accounts including non-microsoft ones
like Gmail create folders sync and more
it's a little confusing to note that app
settings will often appear under the
setting
charm even when most settings are
accessible from the top or bottom edges
so clearly there are some workflow snags
that microsoft hasn't quite worked out
yet so what's that second big change
Windows 8 is such a schmoozer it's
arguably the most social desktop OS out
there from the login screen where you
can see your calendar and email
notifications and set other apps to
appear to the real-time updates to your
tiles on your Start screen windows 8 is
anything but a static input only
experience search is global and includes
data from all your apps that have
activated the Search API hooks of course
just being windows you can easily tweak
those settings part of being social is
sinking and Windows 8 is sink happy
connect a Microsoft account such as
hotmail or live and you'll be able to
sync settings nearly instantaneously
from one windows 8 to another throw in
the app sinking from the Windows Store
you've got one heck of a mobilized
system SkyDrive will help you keep your
file sync to okay fine you can poke it
with a stick how does it work with a
mouse and keyboard simply connect your
traditional interface peripherals and
bam scrollbar the screen automatically
knows when your mouse is pushing one of
the edges and will scroll you through
your groups hotkeys get a lot of love in
Windows 8 all of the combos for windows
7 work in windows 8 even in the Metro
interface if you miss windows 7 or just
want the precision of a spreadsheet you
can jump to the familiar windows seven
style desktop with the desktop tile
notice that apps here can be designed to
appear more like traditional windows so
ie10 and Metro is touch tacular while
ie10 in desktop mode looks like IE 9
even though both ie10 skins are powered
by the same engine and have the same
features short version Photoshop and
other high precision programs have
nothing to worry about those are just
two of the biggest changes in Windows 8
but there are tons more security gets a
lot of attention and you can choose one
of three logins password pin or set a
picture login perfect for tablets
there's also stuff you're likely to
never encounter that
acting you like trusted boot for double
checking system integrity and smart
screen to protect you from phishing and
malware there are features like refresh
that will reinstall windows 8 without
deleting your data multiple monitors
support for showing start on one screen
and the desktop on the other and more
Windows 8 is a heck of a Hail Mary pass
if it lands like vista microsoft will be
in a world of trouble it doesn't look
like that's going to happen though
hardware makers are on board redmond
says developers are investing heavily in
it and it's earning its buzz because
there's nothing quite like it out there
windows is ready for you to touch it
question is while waiting for the
unified desktop mobile experience have
people already moved too much into
mobile to care for seen it i'm seth
