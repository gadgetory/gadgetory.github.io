you'd expect to see at CES you probably
don't expect to see craftsman here but
here they are they've got a bluetooth
enhanced smart lawnmower along with a
Bluetooth smart tool chest now why would
you want bluetooth and a lot more in a
tool chest well the answer with the
lawnmower is to keep track of the
maintenance records do you want to keep
an eye on those hours spent riding it
and know when it's time to change the
oil or change the blades out all of that
is tracked in the app and you can check
it on your iOS or Android device you can
also order replacement parts online with
just a tap or checkout useful how-to
videos if you need to make a repair
yourself on the tool chest side it's
really just about security you want to
keep an eye on those tools you want to
know that everything is locked up and
you want to know if anybody's trying to
get in so if anybody tries to jiggle the
handle and force their way into your
tools you'll get a notification on your
phone if you're in Bluetooth range
telling you hey it's someone trying to
break in you can also let yourself in
using your phone locking and unlocking
the tool chest right from the app along
with seeing a history of when it was
accessed all this is available at Sears
right now so you can go and pick up that
riding lawnmower for about twenty six
hundred dollars or pick up that tool
chest for a starting price of five fifty
or more depending if you want something
a little bigger</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
