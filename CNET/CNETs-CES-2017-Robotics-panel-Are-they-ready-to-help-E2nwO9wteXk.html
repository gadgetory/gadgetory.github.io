progression of computing from desktop to
laptop to mobile now what you're
starting to see is robotics enter into
the fray and really if you think about
it that's spurred by one of the key
consumer trends which is the ability to
talk to your devices and what's ironic
about that is it's actually it's a
throwback to an original consumer trend
which was just talking to each other
right so I think I think it's kind of
come full circle in that sense but what
I think robotics really does is it it
takes that wall that's between you and
your environment that cell phone and
gets rid of right and so the
interactions that you can start to have
become very meaningful in a way that
isn't about you having to go pull out a
device start to search it's just having
a conversation so that's I think if you
are hearing one of the themes across the
board here you're going to hear that
theme of speaking to your technology and
getting value back from it is that is
that solving a problem it revised
ultimately the evolution of systems like
Alexa like Google assistant is that
making ultimately the the adoption of
robotics move more quickly and almost
like a parallel path at islands us real
quickly and let them and do I think
what's great about echo and Google home
is it's it's making that trend be a lot
more pervasive and it's moving along
quite a bit more quickly I think that
the value of some of the form factors
that you see from some of the likes of
these companies is it takes what is in
an inanimate object which is very
passive and it turns it into a two-way
proactive interaction so pepper can see
you pepper can reach out to you call you
over and deliver some sort of content
which has a lot of really interesting
use cases and dr. kloor you've mentioned
before that you feel we're about to
enter a rapid growth phase of robotics
and I'd love to hear a little bit about
your reasoning for that well from the
examples that you've seen but I think
where the reason is is because we it's
not just about mobility but it is about
the artificial intelligence of course
this is not general AI but specific AI
and I think you're seeing also a driving
factor through media and so in s
we as scientists grew up seeing movies
like Star Wars and seen various
representations of robots and now a host
of exponential technologies have been
coming together to advanced robotics so
it's not just the robot themselves it's
the AO it's deep machine learning it's
the array of sensors that are out there
the ability for those sensors to see and
hear for instance the these studies with
pepper I'm really impressed with pepper
and one of the my favorite innovations
by the way because the the whole point
of it is it does give presents the whole
thing about having arms and a face and
seeing you is what we as a society want
to see we want to have presence and then
and for us from the avatar sense we
think that's extremely important and i
look at avatars as a basically a sister
to robots so that we're looking at
avatars as robots powered by human
intelligence and I distinguish a rope a
robot by itself and need not have any
intelligence I mean you could go back a
couple thousand years in heaven etana
tom that's mechanically driven so I
always say a robot with AI or a robot
with human intelligence think about a
conversation that you've had with Alexa
you probably haven't right you you tell
Alexa dare do something and it's either
music yes lights if you have those
enabled some kind of home automation or
you ask a question of which most of the
time today it says you know I don't know
the answer I didn't understand the
question that I heard it's getting
better you can ask questions I asked
them is cut ken follett alive after I
finish one of his books and she said yes
and I was like wow that's really amazing
so it's coming along but also great for
ken follett yes yeah that's good for him
yeah and I also ice where does he live
and it says London and I've got to one
word answers which was totally
unexpected so so things are coming along
and I'm impressed by that but at the
same time you know there's no
conversation happening and I don't even
think there's a conversation happening
in the next five years so you ask about
short-term you know we focused on not
having relay speak and it's no problem
to play speech and pretend like we can
off the problem is that people walk up
to it all the time i drive it through
the convention center and they say you
know hey bring me of gin and tonic look
like it's not going to bring you know I
understood it I can't bring you a gin
and tonic and you know this is not going
to do that and so you end up setting an
expectation way up here and then
disappointing people and we decided that
you know in the Star Wars metaphor we'd
go r2d2 instead of c-3po just beeps and
whistles and it's cute and and maybe you
don't understand it and that's okay the
other one I think is interesting just so
for using science fiction metaphors is
Star Trek which doesn't really have any
robots it's surprising in that
particular show but the ship as a whole
talks to you so that's much more like
Alexa than embodying robot wasn't data
although eventually eventually you have
the same if you actually have to aig of
data and then you have the holographic
doctor though is an a on a diseased evil
twin as well yes let's not forget about
the next 45 min we're going to a Star
Trek West world i agree but that's my
whole point is is an AI training wasn't
at all about conversation it was about
action so in fact if i want to train it
to do a physical thing the data from
that not from the conversation and which
is why in fact i push strongly for four
avatars because i want to see robotics
move forward and the limitations that
you just mentioned i don't have it all
right so I if I put a human in in your
robot or in n pepper they can have
conversations with you all day long and
the great thing about what you're doing
is that machine learning needs a lot a
lot of data and so if you can actually
get a lot of people in the in the vive
and other systems like that are making
it so that you could inhabit it and
avatar pretty well from home and pretty
affordably if you can do that and then
you collect data for five years then I
think you can really start to talk about
conversations and interesting stuff I've
talked about stories before where
there's a lot of Robotics happening on
the ISS in order to free up those menial
tasks and and free up astronauts time to
do more experimenting and more things
that require a human
less things that don't necessarily need
a person to be doing yeah I think it's
really interesting if you you think
about the space station you know people
have at first this in this notion that
oh my god what a fantastic wonderful
place to be on it probably is but then
you get past then you say what's it
really like to live and work on the
space station and the reality it's not
all glamour it's not all fun it's not
you know get up in the morning do
science all day long in reality it's
much more like camping you spend all of
your time taking care of where you live
and the astronauts spent a tremendous
amount of time doing chores they're
monitoring their environment they're
looking for where things are you may not
realize that the space station today is
the size of like a six bedroom house and
it's a place where you switch out the
entire family every six months but you
leave all the stuff behind which means
that you know when you get a new crew on
board and you're told hey you need to go
do this activity go use this piece of
equipment that's in this drawer on the
open door like it's not here so where is
it well somebody misplaced it they
didn't log where it went and now get to
spend time searching for that so if you
think about the space station in reality
is a lot like our environments here on
earth it's a place where we're trying to
you know remove all those unnecessary
things that just waste too much of our
time by trying to do things either
autonomously with robots or with systems
to help us offload these menial
repetitive really frankly boring chores
and so one of the things that I'm very
excited about is I look to the future is
you know how can we build the systems
can that can do these things it doesn't
mean that you have to have your complete
general purpose you know humanoid form
robot if we could do that fantastic but
the reality is even if we don't build
that there's still lots of things that
you can do in fact it's kind of
interesting the way we're kind of set up
here we have sort of like the humanoid
robotics end ends of the spectrum and
then Steve and I have certainly worked
on robots so I shouldn't say not just
Steve as Steve used to actually work
with robot does was quite humanoid in
appearance but the point is that there
are lots of different forms of robots
and affecting Steve Alou to this to that
can do things very productively and I
think that more important than sort of
just the basic form of the robot is
really you know how resilient is it
reliable is it I think any consumer out
there or frankly any astronaut is not
going to want to use a system if it
breaks down all the time or if they
can't predict how it's going to function
it needs to to operate well it needs to
interact with you in a way that's
efficient and frankly it needs to be
something that you can just rely on</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
