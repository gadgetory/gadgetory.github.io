and that's gonna be a great thing if
you're looking for an iPad that's
affordable and works with Apple pencil
the new ipad called ipad starts at 329
and looks a lot like the nine point
seven inch iPad pro that debuted in 2016
this model comes in 32 or 128 gigabytes
storage and it starts at 329 or goes up
to 429 the cameras 8 megapixel and
shoots in 1080p
it also supports LTE the ipad works with
a bunch of new creative tools that Apple
announced here at the lane tech prep
school in Chicago and the feel and look
of it is a lot like the iPad pro that I
remember and the pencil sensitivity has
promised to be pretty much the same as
what you expected before it has an a-10
processor which matches what last year's
iPhone models before the iPhone 10 and
iPhone 8 had and it felt pretty
comfortable to draw on
the new iPad costs $2.99 if you're in
the education market saving a little bit
of money
and they're also going to be new apps
that support it pages and the rest of
the iWork suite are going to be
supported for Apple pencil and Apple
supporting a new creative initiative to
encourage kids to use the pencil in all
of its apps and classroom tools here I'm
just trying to draw and keep up with
trying to see what my hand looks like if
it had a skeleton overlaid with
the pencil is exactly the same as before
but there will be a new pen select
accessories Logitech is making a $49
crayon and a $99 ruggedized keyboard
stay tuned for more
