today we're going to be talking about
the Bissell Powerglide Deluxe pet vacuum
this vacuum retails for one hundred and
seventy nine ninety nine meaning it's a
pretty budget-friendly vacuum by
comparison especially when you look at
models like the six hundred and forty
nine dyson DC 41 animal complete but
don't let the exterior which is rather
humble or that price tag scare you off
of this vacuum because it excelled in
almost all of our tests and outperformed
vacuums that cost twice as much but
aside from performance which is
excellent one of the things that I love
about this vacuum is the versatility it
offers you there are a lot of hidden
features that you might not know about
such as the fact that this is a
convertible vacuum meaning that this
canister portion lifts off so that you
can take it away and use it as you would
a traditional canister vacuum this is
great for vacuuming stairs draperies or
even detailing your car because you
don't have to take the entire vacuums
body outside another thing that I really
like that offers you that versatility is
this adjustable height handle meaning
whether you're very tall or very short
this vacuum can be customized so that
it's comfortable for you to use in your
home and finally I like the fact that it
pivots this is kind of a sneaky feature
that the Bissell has slid in under the
radar and that you look at this and you
think it's kind of a one-trick pony and
it's only going to go back and forth for
you in your living room but it will
actually pivot making it an
exceptionally maneuverable vacuum not
unlike the ORAC touch bagless so if
you're looking for a vacuum that's both
friendly on your wallet but also will be
really good to you and your carpets you
can't go wrong with this Bissell for
