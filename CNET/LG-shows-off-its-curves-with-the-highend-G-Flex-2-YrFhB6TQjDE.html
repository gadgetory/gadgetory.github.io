today we're going to check out LG's
latest high-end device the G flex 2 just
like its predecessor the handset sports
a unique curved design and display that
is durable enough to flex straight when
you press against it but this time
around the art doesn't look as prominent
and the phone is smaller and lighter
this makes for an altogether more
comfortable and maneuverable handset
than before in addition to the slightly
rework look the G flex 2 is 5.5 inch
screen has a sharper 1080p resolution
images videos and text are bright and
rich in detail and the curve display is
immersive and as well to bring the sides
of it closer together and draw you in
more on the back LG included a battery
door that is scratch resistant and can
quote unquote heal itself with the
special coating this coating can protect
against everyday scratches and scuffs
like when it rubs against your keys or
whatever but it doesn't claim to be
indestructible and as you can see here
I've managed to leave a scar when I
rubbed a jagged rock against it oops
powering this device is a non removable
3 ampere hour battery that's smaller
than the first iterations 3.5 ampere
hour battery but it's still a decent
amount of juice it lasted about 10 hours
during our continuous video playback
tests and it takes about 45 minutes to
get half its battery life back up with
its stock charger inside you'll find
Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 810
quad-core processor other than the
Korean variant of the Samsung Galaxy
Note 4 it's one of the first few
smartphones to have this its 64-bit
octa-core CPU has a clock speed of 2
gigahertz and games and graphics look
very smooth and fluid with this
processor for your camera needs the G
flex 2 has a 13 megapixel camera that
can shoot 4k video and has a dual flash
optical image stabilization and a laser
guided focus on the front there's a 2.1
megapixel shooter that can sense when
it's being lowered from a selfie stick
or pulled into your view so it can
automatically call up your most recent
taken photo or selfie and switch back
out again when you pull it away lastly
the device runs Google's latest Android
lollipop OS with LG's user interface
overlaid on top you'll get some of the
company's signature software we saw
before like not code as well as the new
glance view gesture that lets you pull
down on the lock screen
to check the time and any miss
notifications the handset is already
available in Korea and it will launch in
other countries as well in the u.s. AT&amp;amp;T
Sprint and US cellular have already
announced that they will carry the phone
and we're expecting it to roll out
sometime in the spring again I'm Lynn
and you've been checking out LG's latest
