the infinity display has an incredible
end-to-end screen that spills over the
phone sides forming a completely smooth
continuous surface the entire front of
the phone is pure pristine glass which
flows seamlessly into the aluminum shell
the result is a beautifully curved
perfectly symmetrical object to create
the infinity display
we took a five-point inch piece of glass
6.2 inches for the galaxy s 8 plus and
we rounded the corners and curved the
edges even with more screen the phone
feels small and comfortable in your hand
now you see the conventional wisdom was
that having a big screen meant having a
you know big device but with curved
edges we realized that we could increase
the size of display without sacrificing
that comfortable grip now some of you
might be wondering what happened to the
home button well it's still there but to
give you more screen we move the home
button beneath the Infinity display and
with a combination of hardware and
software
and with a combination of hardware and
software we make sure response to
pressure just like a physical button
would we saw an opportunity to make
users lives safer and easier through
biometric authentication now instead of
typing a password you are the password
it's the perfect combination of security
and convenience one of the most exciting
examples of this is the iris scanner
which Maps your iris and creates a
unique digital signature and eye print
instead of a fingerprint it's the most
secure form of biometric security we've
ever created
so we've perfected a form of biometrics
that lets you do exactly that
it's called face recognition so let's
say you wanted to unlock your phone
right now the first thing you do is you
take your phone and then you see the
lock screen with face recognition there
are no other steps you just hold your
essay in front of your face and it will
pull up your home screen instantly</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
