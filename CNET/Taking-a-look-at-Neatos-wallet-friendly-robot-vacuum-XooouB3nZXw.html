appliances here with a review of the
neato XV essential robot vacuum this 379
dollar vacuum may look very similar to a
neato that we reviewed last year the
neato signature Pro and it is but this
one is actually $70 cheaper so it's
basically the same machine but the
accessories are different so you have a
different filter and a different brush
this one is good overall but the other
one is actually better a tackling pet
hair so if you have a pet it's really
the best option this is a great machine
it did perform very well but for 20 more
dollars you can have an even better
machine with much better accessories the
basic filter offered on this one is kind
of a usability nightmare it's hard to
take off and it spills stuff everywhere
so nito's lineup of products is a little
bit confusing a lot of their robots have
the same brains and guts but different
accessories that come with it and that
will really inform which one you buy
this one is one of the most basic models
available it's three hundred and seventy
nine dollars and has a basic filter and
a basic brush it did perform really well
but the basic components make it a lot
harder to use it's harder to take the
filter out because it's flimsy and it's
cheaper I hate to say it because this
model did perform well but I can't
recommend it over the signature for 399
or the signature pro for 449 the
signature comes with the pet and allergy
filter a lot easier to use and the
signature pro comes with two peten
allergy filters and two brushes but on
the whole nito versus Roomba debate I
actually really like both the nito's are
kind of more of a budget option and the
Roombas are a bit pricier the 880 I
recently reviewed was six hundred ninety
nine dollars but it did offer top
performance great usability great
features but I would still recommend the
signature or the signature Pro nito's
for their price thanks for watching this
has been a review of the neato XV
essential on Megan Fullerton foreseen
