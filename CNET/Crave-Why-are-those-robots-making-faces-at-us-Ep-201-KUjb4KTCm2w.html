here's just happening this week on
CNET's crave blog researchers at Cornell
University and robotics fans on the
internet have trained a PR to robot to
autonomously make coffee based on
objects the robot recognizes in a
database of images the robot was able to
figure out the corresponding action
needed to perform with each object it
observed even though it had never seen
in a special machine before in its life
the robot barista was able to identify a
lever on an espresso machine based on an
image of a urinal handle it had in its
database previously and figured out the
correct movement coordinates to grasp
and activate that handle on the espresso
machine if you were interested in
helping the robot learn more tasks you
can sign up to be part of the robo
briefs to project a Cornell's website
and read more about the Robo brain
project on the crave blog post
professional chorus singer Aaron Johnson
who also happens to be an affiliate
faculty member at the bio Imaging
Science and Technology Group at the
Beckman Institute in Illinois jumped
into a new super fast MRI machine
capable of capturing video at 100 frames
per second and sang the song if I only
had a brain my thoughts were busy hat
 if I only had a parade
I Johnson and many scientists are
interested in how the muscles in our
face work together in concert to produce
the sounds humans make Johnson also
expressed an interest in learning how
our vocal cords change over time as we
age and how those changes affect the
quality of her voice the Avengers age of
Ultron is coming out next week in an
honor the film's release fanboy and evil
genius maker Patrick grieve has created
a working iron man power glove that can
do some serious damage in this video he
devastates some balloons and burnt some
wooden pieces with a high-powered laser
and it looks awesome and scary this
isn't Patrick's first walk in the park
with the laser stuff however a few years
ago crave reported on the Iron Man laser
gauntlet that he produced and showed off
on his youtube channel called laser
gadgets where you can check out more of
his laser creation Hanson robotics
recently showed up their newest humanoid
robot hahn at the Global Sources
electronics fair in Hong Kong Han is
capable of making multiple facial
expressions that are created using 40
small motors underneath the skin on his
face which is made of a material called
rubber which is short for flesh rubber
which was patented by the robotics maker
Han is equipped with facial recognition
software so he will always look you in
the eyes while speaking and react
accordingly to facial expressions you
might make during your awkward
conversation while there's a finance and
robotics plans on commercializing its
robotic systems using another humanoid
robot named Eva which might be employed
for educational purposes aged care or
even medical training applications
alright guys that's your show thank you
very much for watching as always you can
find all these news stories to cnet's
crave blog at crave athena com make sure
