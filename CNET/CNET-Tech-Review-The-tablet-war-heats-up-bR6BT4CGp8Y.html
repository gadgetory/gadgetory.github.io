tries to take a bite out of Apple the
galaxy tab versus the ipad in a tablet
price fight LastPass prevents poor
passwords and cell phone carrier ratings
for where you live it's all coming up
right now
hey everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's get started with the good just
before the Thanksgiving break acer held
an event in new york to show off a
couple of their would-be ipad killers
dan ackerman was on hand to give us a
peek at what's to come i'm dan ackerman
and we're down in soho today we're acer
had a big press event to talk about
really the hot topic of the air that's
tablets and touch screens they had a
handful of products and some new
services to show off key among them
iconia it's a 14-inch laptop and if it
looks like something's a little bit
different that's because it has two
screens and they're both touchscreen
this is more of a full laptop experience
and to get that on-screen keyboard what
you do is you don't hit a button or
anything you take both hands ten fingers
two pumps put him down right here and it
knows to pop up the full keyboard right
there which then you can type on
depending on your proficiency with
on-screen keyboards it will also take
one hand input you put all five fingers
down and it brings up this media jog
wheel that lets you John through all
sorts of different media options and of
course they actually have their own
custom web browser built in right here
that's meant to work with both screens
I've got it up right here but with one
touch I can expand it to both screens or
I can just view it just on the top the
Iconia is a full-featured laptop it's
going to intel core i5 processor and it
runs windows 7 and it should be
available depending on where you live in
the world
in december or early in 2011 so we're
here with ashes just announced 10 inch
android tablet unlike a lot of other
android tablets that we've seen this one
is actually going to use nvidia's tegra
platform and that should give you a
pretty good experience in terms of you
know media viewing and videos and music
and stuff like that it's designed to
work with clear Phi that is answers new
multimedia sharing platform and it
should be out sometime in 2011 it does
not yet have a name a price or any info
on which cell carriers are going to sell
it in the u.s. acer also talked about a
couple of new services one is clarify
that's their media sharing platform for
having a central hub in your home and
sharing music in movies and video among
different devices the other is alive
that is a sers new content store and
that works again on acer products and a
little bit like itunes and that it has
movies and music but it also has ebooks
and other kinds of publications and apps
leaving games and what it does is it
keeps track of your preferences and lets
you set up almost channels if you like
particular artists or type of music
remove it you can set up a channel and
it will give you suggestions based on
things that would fit in that channel
like superhero movies or Lady gaga so
just in time for the holiday shopping
season to kick off Asia has given us a
whole bunch of stuff to think about for
next year in soho i'm dan ackerman
looks like acer is really taking a run
at apple a fancy laptop a tablet
wireless media sharing and the acer
store better watch out Steve Jobs but
before those acers come to market
Apple's already got its hands full
trying to fend off attacks from Samsung
and the galaxy tab and of course there's
really only one way to crown the king of
tablets prizefight what's up prized by
fans I'm Brian Tommy and this is the
first ever prizefight tablet work that
you've been asking for it's a prize 5
point out between the samsung galaxy tab
and apple's ipad 3g our judges for this
fight our senior editor Donald Saved by
the Bell senior associate editor Jessica
dish amount dole court and Bryant ring a
ling a ding dong now we'll take all
three judges blind scores and average
them out to the nearest tenth each round
the final price wide score be an average
of all rounds using the same decimal
system let's get ready to rumble round 1
is design Samsung's Galaxy Tab has a
solid design with its 7-inch screen and
curved corners that's less than half the
size of the ipad it's lighter and more
comfortable to hold the tabs 1024 x 600
resolution on a smaller screen brings a
slightly crisper image button left us
wanting more and buy more we mean screen
size the iPad brings apple's highest
level of design and its 9.7 inch screen
is big but its design isn't bulky the
metal finish and curved edges are
gorgeous and it's 1024 x 768 display
just pops it might be heavier than you
like but it feels like it's worth every
penny Apple's iPad gets a perfect five
and Samsung's Galaxy Tab gets a 4 next
rounds controls and user interface the
galaxy tab is pure Android and if you've
used it before you'll feel right at home
one issue is that it's the exact same
experience you would get on a phone
there's nothing that makes it unique for
a tablet you'll still get the same
customization but widgets don't align
with icons hitting the menu button to
access app features on the android OS
bug donald the swype input method is
here but at the end of the day
newcomers to tablets might feel
intimidated by its learning curve now it
doesn't matter if you've used an iphone
or ipod the iPads user interface is so
simple then several judges mentioned how
our nieces and nephews one and a half
years in older can all use the iPad we
keep saying it but it's still amazing
how easy it is to use the keyboard is
more spacious and comfortable for typing
and the iPad was snapping or navigating
overall the iPad strikes hard with its
second perfect round and the Galaxy Tab
gets at 3.3 it's after averaging two
rounds Apple leads by more than a point
but there's plenty of fight to go round
three is features and performance the
tab has everything that iPad users have
been craving for with front and rear
facing cameras with a flash a microSD
card slot wireless hotspot capability
and flash 10.1 support it also comes
packed with Google's goodies like voice
search and commands google navigation
and access to key services in the
notifications pull down apps from the
marketplace are still built for phones
and just don't take full advantage of
the screen real estate they're just
bigger the tab is also a step behind
performance wise with a few laggy
moments and its battery life is shorter
by three hours now the iPad can't match
up with the hardware features but it's
still the snappiest tablet on the market
with significantly better battery life
the new control strip is a nice addition
but changing the orientation button to a
mute button is idiotic it also has
plenty of apps built specifically to use
the larger form factor and it makes for
a better user experience but it's not
enough as the tab finally takes its
first round with the floor and the iPad
gets a 3.3 next round is web browsing to
multimedia the tabs web browser is a
solid offering but it's frustrating how
it goes directly to most of the mobile
versions of websites by default even
with a 7-inch screen the experience can
be a little cramped now flash playback
can be hit or miss and it has laggy
moments when you're pinching and zooming
into websites Samsung's media hub is a
nice way to get media content but it
still has a long ways to go the 3
megapixel rear camera is mediocre but
one advantage is that it's easier to
hold and use as an e-book reader now the
iPads web browser is
full screen multi-touch version of
Safari that actually makes web browsing
more fun and takes advantage of its
space even though it doesn't have flash
the multimedia experience is one of a
kind with its deep library of content
from iTunes it has a polished media
player multimedia absent add more access
to content and a large screen that
enhances the experience the iPad gets a
4.7 and the tab gets a 4 so after
averaging four rounds apples lead has
been trimmed down to seven tenths of a
point the final round that decides it
all is value the samsung galaxy tab can
be purchased with a two-year contract on
t-mobile or sprint for 399 or without a
contract on all four carriers for around
5 99 data plans vary but at that price
you're almost paying the same price of
an ipad 3g for half the screen size
apple's ipad 3g starts at six hundred
and twenty nine dollars with no contract
an apple broke new ground with
affordable data plans the Wi-Fi only
model gives you even lower pricing but
if you're looking for the best bang for
your buck it's the ipad tablet prices
are still a little high overall but in
the final round the ipad gets of 4 and
Samsung's Galaxy Tab gets a 3 so let's
average out all five rounds and
enterprise fight where Apple came out
swinging with back-to-back perfect
rounds the Galaxy Tab closed the gap but
it was just too much to overcome and the
apple ipad 3g takes this first-time
tablet face-off 4.4 to 3.7 and is your
prize fight winner both of these tablets
are great pics and will fit different
needs but this young market will
constantly be flooded with new
contenders and the war for prizefight
supremacy rages on i'm brian Tong thanks
for watching we'll catch you guys next
time on another prize fight
was there ever any question what was
going to win that prize fight yeah not
really but luckily for samsung they've
got other new products for you to choose
from and not just the TVs and
smartphones you're used to seeing check
out this new laptop courtesy of Scott's
time hi I'm Scott Stein senior associate
editor at cnet com and this is the
Samsung qx4 10 now this holiday shopping
season everybody wants to know the same
thing how do I get a great affordable
laptop that's got everything I need and
is pretty compact it's simple questions
right well you may not be thinking of
samsung laptops but this year we've been
really surprised at the quality and the
affordability of samsung laptops that
we've seen and the qx4 10 is a slimmer
nicer looking design that really looks
like kind of a crossbreed of a vaio and
a macbook pro at a price that's really
pretty reasonable 849 and inside you've
got a core i5 processor 4 gigs of ram
640 gigabyte hard drive and Nvidia
Optimus enabled automatic switching
graphics now the graphics aren't
spectacular its geforce 310m which are
entry level but they enable you to play
most mainstream games pretty well don't
expect anything screaming if you're a
real hardcore gamer we will deploy
everything from unreal tournament 3 2
Activision's blur a pretty reasonable
frame rates and we enjoyed it and in
addition this laptop is intel wireless
display which we've seen a number of
other laptops you need to purchase a
separate $99 neck gear box called
push2tv once you have that enables
streaming of video and audio content
wirelessly to your television and it
works really nicely with the exception
of doesn't play blu-ray or DVD content
you probably already have that hooked up
to your TV anyway considering all of
that in this package for under a
thousand dollars it's a great deal
especially since it's a really nicely
designed laptop it has a aluminum metal
frame here brush metal on the back edge
to edge glossy display the keyboard
feels really nice it's sort of like a
macbook keyboard is a little bit like a
vaio keyboard or if used a sis's raised
keyboards and there's a multi-touch
click pad that's pretty nicely sized
better than other competitors we've seen
not as large as a macbook pros but hey
we're not complaining and the port
selection is pretty nice you've got your
us
p ports you've got your HDMI there's
nothing unexpected on here there's no
Express card and there's no bluetooth on
this but other than that for 849 you're
getting graphics you're getting a good
processor you're getting good specs
you're getting Intel wireless display
and you're getting a design that to most
people is going to look high-end but hey
it's a 49 you saved a little bit of
money this holiday season give the
Samsung qx4 10 a look I think you'll be
pleasantly surprised I'm Scott Stein and
this is the Samsung qx4 10 so a pretty
snazzy laptop from Samsung and a pretty
snazzy shirt for Scott to although maybe
not the best for shooting on that set I
think I lost track of him a couple times
turning our attention back to Apple last
week in the tech review buying guide we
suggested that the ipad and the macbook
air both make great gifts but is now
really the right time to buy Apple
products well let's check in with Brian
again with his buying guide from the
apple byte okay it's the holidays and
you probably want some real good advice
about when is a good time to buy that
specific Apple gadget we get tons of
emails about it so we want to give you
the apples buyer guide or what we like
to call here the Apple biters guide in
it all right we have three apples green
means it's good to go yellow means it's
in the middle of its product life cycle
so it's okay but it might be worth
holding out a little longer and red
means wait for an update soon now things
are fluid and unpredictable but this is
using the best info we have so first up
the iphone for now it really depends on
your carrier if you're on AT&amp;amp;T it's a
solid time to buy and that's where they
have a green apple new models will be
probably coming around june or july
since it's a yearly update so your smack
in the middle now if you're on verizon
we're throwing out the red apple don't
switch over to a different carrier just
be patient because all of the major
websites point2 sometime in january for
the iphone florida potentially come to
verizon key word is potentially now if
you're looking for an iPad it's worthy
of a yellow Apple there will be no new
models announced any time soon but we
expect to possibly hear news in January
but the next-gen will probably come out
in late march to april which is still
about five months away so if you just
want one with a camera then don't pull
the trigger and wait for it now the
entire lineup of ipods was refreshed in
September and that's been their typical
yearly release cycle so green apples
galore for all ipod models imax are
updated about every seven months and
it's been three months since the last
release so it's where they have a yellow
apple and there's nothing wrong with you
getting one if you need one now the mac
pro's they get updated a lot less
frequently because they're so powerful
the last update was in july and they'll
go even a year or more before the next
update so all signs point to a green
apple now on the laptop front this line
is updated every six months or so the
macbook pros and the white macbook we're
updated in the spring we won't see
anything before Christmas but we'll
probably see something early next year
so we're giving it a yellow apple but I
would lean towards waiting if you can
all right we'll get two more your
questions next week hopefully that
biters guide helped out but that's going
to do it for this week's show send your
emails to the apple byte at cnet com i'm
brian Tong thanks for watching we'll see
you next week for another bite of the
Apple
I know the macbook air wasn't on Brian's
list but since it just came out in
October I think it's safe to give that
one the green light as well and i'm
giving you the green light to stretch
your legs for a bit because it's time
for a break but don't go too far because
we will be right back with more tech
review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good according to
our friends over at smart planet the
most common password people use are the
digits 123456 so if that's your password
change it now or better yet check out a
program called LastPass which can help
you manage better passwords and remember
them for you I don't know about you but
i hate remembering passwords there's
personal email work email bank accounts
Twitter and Facebook and woe to anybody
who uses the same one for both of those
malware magnets so far the best option I
found is the free browser add-on
LastPass hi i'm seth rosenblatt for cnet
and today i'll show you the basics of
how to use the secure encrypted password
manager LastPass which is encrypted with
aes 256 the installation process is
simple but important more than just
installing like any other add on it
helps you create a LastPass account and
it will import your existing passwords
unless you choose not to once you
install the LastPass icon will appear in
the upper right hand corner of the
browser importing the passwords is key
because once they're in your LastPass
account it can remove them from your
browser's making it difficult to get to
them without your LastPass login info
once installed last pass will
auto-detect username and password form
fields if it has the credentials for the
page or visiting it will ask to fill in
the info for you you can also set last
pass to automatically filling
credentials or even automatically log in
when you visit a site that you're
creating credentials for it will ask if
you'd like it to create a password for
you in the LastPass vault where your
passwords are stored you can change the
default level of security for generated
passwords it will also auto detect when
you've changed the password for a site
that's already been saved and ask you if
you'd like to change the saved version
LastPass comes with some excellent power
features you can use the encrypted
online vault to access your secure sites
on the fly and
past premium supplies you with a mobile
version of the password manager it also
works in conjunction with you Becky for
extra tinfoil-hat paranoid protection or
you can create for free your own
encrypted USB key for multi-factor
protection called LastPass sesame if
you're concerned about keyloggers
LastPass com supplies a virtual keyboard
it's not fail proof but LastPass is an
excellent and secure way to cut down the
risk of having your passwords
compromised the first look at last pass
for cnet download.com i'm seth
rosenblatt and just in case you were
wondering the number for password on the
list is password some people just never
learn all right let's switch gears and
see what we can find over in the bed
since this is the holiday season many of
you may be thinking about buying a new
cell phone for a loved one don't at
least not until you check out our top
five awful cell phones that no one wants
to find in their stocking this year
it's a great time to be alive and
communicating excellent cell phones of
all kinds abound these however are not
among them I'm Brian Cooley with the top
five phones you should pass up for
something anything else number five is
the motorola flipout with a tepid cnet
rating of 6.7 okay motorola lesson one
when making a touchscreen smartphone
make the screen large enough to touch
this chunky little guy has the android
operating system crammed into it but not
enough interface area to take advantage
of it in spite of a nice slide out
keyboard here's a hint the screen is
square the web is not oh by the way the
speakerphone is also crapped as was its
3g radio next number for the sony
ericsson vivaz what us stupid name cnet
rating 6.3 now touchscreen products
these days pretty much all use what's
called a capacitive touchscreen except
the vivaz which uses resistive
technology kind of like those plastic
flat buttons on a gas pump that ain't
cool coupled with the hoary old symbian
OS and slow internal guts and you'll
have plenty of time to contemplate what
else you could have bought number 3 the
samsung SGH a 107 C narrating six-point
oh we give it about a 2 point 0 for its
name this is the most basic phone on our
list of losers today and frankly to
basic it doesn't have an external
display so you have to flip it open to
do anything other than being a great
prop for a movie set in the 1990s it's
just a mess oh and it's missing the
single biggest innovation and phones
since the flip Bluetooth number two the
ZTE agent with a cnet rating of 5.3 yes
ZTE has who makes this dud no I hadn't
heard of them before either I think this
quote from our review says it all design
features and call quality all leave much
to be desired we're done with this one
before we get to our number one phone to
avoid a smartphone in general is
not something we're avoiding latest
numbers from Nielsen research indicated
the number of smartphones in use in the
US will equal the number of ordinary
cell phones by around q3 of 2011 the
revolution is on ok our number one phone
to not walk but run from is the dell
aero with a miserable cnet rating of 5.0
that's out of 10 remember running the
ancient android 1.5 OS doesn't start
things well but then del that paragon of
user interface design skins at their own
way which makes it frustrating and
unintuitive ads sluggish internals and
mmm nice phone if you want to see the
secret sixth loser phone that vibe for
number one on today's list or to catch
up on all the cnet top fives head to top
five cnet com I'm Brian Cooley thanks
for watching
now once you decide not to buy a
terrible phone you should probably make
sure the phone can get decent reception
where it's going to be used luckily for
you see net has partnered with
RootMetrics to bring you a new service
that can help you find the best carriers
for your area kent german has the scoop
in this week's bottom line hi I'm seen
at senior editor kent german you've come
to rely on seen it for in-depth analysis
or reviews of the latest cell phones and
accessories but as you know carrier
coverage also plays a part in creating
your best wireless experience seen it
does not rate wireless carrier coverage
because it varies too much from
neighborhood to neighborhood but we know
that it's important to research care
performance for your home commute and
workplace that's why we partnered with
RootMetrics to create a unique tool that
can help you make a carrier decision
unlike some services that track carrier
dead zones rootmetrics uses a smartphone
app that anonymously gathers information
on voice signal strength and data speeds
now i'm going to show you the tool to
explain its features and how to use it
to access the tool just click on the
cell phone coverage map link here at
cell phones cnet com you also can find
the link on any seen at cell phone
review you'll start by seeing a list of
all the covered markets which includes
most of the country's largest cities if
you don't see your town listed at the
moment route will be expanding coverage
in the future and at the end of this
video I'll tell you how you can help now
i'm going to show you what information
is available for each city let's choose
San Francisco as an example the
interface uses a mashup of google map so
it should be familiar to most users you
can zoom out and in with the bar on the
left and you can scroll around as you
wish down at the bottom of the map
you'll see tabs for the three metrics
that route tracks the first tab the
roots corps represents the carriers
overall network performance using a
color code it measures an aggregate
voice and data score for the area the
map is covering green and yellow are
best orange is in the middle and red and
black or worse as you click between
carriers and as you change the map view
by scrolling or zooming the data is
recalculated root breaks up each city
into hexagonal sections or hexes that
span a couple of city blocks to see data
for specific hex just click on it and
you'll get this pop-up window you can
choose to see the score for one carrier
or you can compare all for the carrier
with the highest school
or will always be at the top of the list
if you click on the voice tab you can
see the voice score for the map area
currently viewing just like on your
phone you'll see the voice strength and
bars for even more detailed information
you can click on the advanced link to
see the signal strength in decibels now
it's a negative number so the closer it
is to zero the better the signal now
it's important to understand that this
tool measures the signal penetration in
a certain area capacity however is
another story even with a strong signal
a cellar network can be overloaded if
too many people using it at one time the
result can be made dropped calls poor
audio quality or an inability to connect
the same is true for data as well here
you'll see the average time it takes to
download a song and upload a photo for
each carrier and if you click on the
advanced link you'll see the average
upload and download data speeds and kilo
bits we hope that you'll find this tool
useful and that you'll use it to think
about wireless coverage in your area and
if you'd like to take this information
on the go and help root gather data
about a new or existing area download
the free iPhone app that's available in
the iTunes App Store an Android app is
coming and support for other smartphones
will follow in the near future for more
information go to root metrics calm I'm
Ken chairman and thanks for joining me
the bottom line this week your mileage
may vary a lot actually we're really
excited about this new project and you
can help us make it better by
downloading the app and letting us share
your results and no we won't read all
your text messages I promise all right
folks that's it for me today but come
back next week for an all-new episode of
the cnet tech review until then there
are tons of great videos available every
day at cnet TV com I'll see you next
time and thank you for watching
