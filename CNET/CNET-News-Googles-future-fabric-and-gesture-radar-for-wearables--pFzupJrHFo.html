mean a SmartWatch or a fitness tracker
what if it was something that was with
you all the time like your clothes
that's what Google has in plan for
project jacquard this is fabric textile
with conductive yarns weaved through it
to make special panels that you can
touch to control pretty much anything
now this isn't a conceptual stage so far
but google has teamed up with Levi's
while there aren't any touch jeans on
the horizon yet many different
applications that Google have said this
could be used in include things like
couches pillows so you can basically
control any device you have from the
comfort of your couch or your bed now
the other thing that google showed off
with project Ricard is the ability to
make a phone call just by swiping on
your jacket the other thing that google
showed off was project soli now this is
a really small radar sensor about the
size of a fingernail that can be
embedded into wearables what it does is
detects the motion of your hands and
your fingers in real space and then
converts that into justice that control
your device one of the things that
Google showed off using this project
soli technology was using a small pinch
gesture using your fingers to control
the hour and minutes on a watch face now
solely again like projects your card
doesn't really have a centrally state
but the technology will be made
available to developers later on this
year with an API and a full developers
kit as well there's a quick look at the
new project soli and project jacquard
from the eight app team here at Google
