we're taking a first look at nike's
lunar hyperdunk plus smart shoe that
tracks how well you play on the
basketball court I'll get this out of
the way quickly the hyperdunk plus
didn't do much to improve my week game
but thanks nike+ basketball technology I
can at least track how awful I was from
game to game there are several
components of the shoe first off for the
pressure sensors accelerometer the shoes
themselves these help measure how
quickly you move and how high you jump
as well as give you a Nike Fuel score
which is the company's own measurement
of activity underneath the insoles are
slots where you can put in these
Bluetooth sensors which act as a bridge
between your shoes and your iOS device
and Nike Plus basketball app I got a
chance to get a few games able to shoe
and the results were mixed bag the
presentation of the app was fantastic
giving me stats and an attractive
presentation and even showing you real
time how much pressure you're applying
to the shoes I can also appreciate the
technology that women do these things
which feel light and comfortable to wear
despite the extra sensors I found myself
wanting more from issues quickness the
vertical leap or grade but what about
steps or total distance traveled nike
says this is just the beginning of Nike
Plus basketball and I look forward to
seeing what other metrics they add down
the line I've talked about nike field
previously in my review of the FuelBand
as I said then if you buy you the
concept it can be a great motivational
tool the hyperdunks are actually more
accurate because the sensors are your
shoes rather than your wrist it's harder
to fake activity when you've got to keep
moving your feet a Bluetooth connection
between the shoes and the app broke a
lot and while the data saved in the shoe
constantly needing to sync up the
information was a hassle to court it's
tough telling the other guys you need
another minute for your shoe talk to
your phone great and a two hundred fifty
dollars these are expensive even for
shoe and basketball enthusiasts well
somebody like the design I wasn't the
biggest fan if you got a lot of money to
burn or really intense about basketball
and give these a shot but given the
price of limitations of what it can do I
can't recommend these shoes for the
average Joe or even folks again on the
core on a regular basis so nike has to
be commended for pushing the boundaries
when it comes to integrating technology
with sports gear I'm looking forward to
seeing what comes out next for cnet.com
