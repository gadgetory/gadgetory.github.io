talk-show in the known universe
I'm Jeff kanata I'm Ashley's gotta last
hits on headlines Bandai Namco it's
coming up with a really cool VR
experience that if you live in Tokyo you
will want to check out they're opening
up VR Zone project I can on April 15th
which is a virtual reality experience
Center designed for people to try out VR
without spending an arm and a leg on it
the center will be located in Tokyo like
I mentioned and of course and will
feature six different simulations
including fear of heights where you
rescue a cat that's stranded on a plank
650 feet above the ground while you are
also balancing on a plank in real life
to help immerse you in the demo and also
scare you if you're afraid of heights
there's also a horror game a driving
game a skiing sim a train conductor sim
and a mech battling game out of all
those six which one do you want to try
the most well I think the one I need to
try the most is the fear of heights one
because I do have an issue with Heights
and I think I'm kind of excited that
virtual reality might be able to make me
face my fears more I just start crying
and hold on to the board on the ground
so that's not for me but I really want
that mech battle man you're two inches
above the ground not in here
hey Google research is trying to teach
robotic arms to be able to pick things
up autonomously grasping is a pretty
tough concept for robots to calculate on
the fly since we tend to process a lot
of the action through visual information
that's a lot of data for a simple robot
to process though so Google research
went a different route
they gave 14 robotic arms each a bin of
various items and left them to learn how
to pick up each item through a deep
convolutional neural network it's a
pretty specific experiment but the team
hopes to find ways to translate the
results into better real-world tests
teaching robots how to do things on
their own I think this is honestly the
future in a lot of ways not just for
robotic arms but all kinds of things
we're seeing neural networks being
established and then this is the same
thing with the with the go the the was
named
alphago was playing go you don't you
don't program all the behavior you just
give it the the rule set and let it
learn itself pretty cool
really really awesome stuff what do you
want to talk about on Thursday show oh
man
both good and then both really good I'm
kind of leaning toward this neural
network idea but talking about VR as
always my thing so what would you like
maybe because of the oculus starting to
ship we'll talk about this VR experience
cuz we could talk about some other VR
real-life VR experiences that are sort
of popping up now all over the world I'm
I want to know why my oculus hasn't
shipped yet Ashley that will be what
we're talking about is how I got my
email yet that it's shipped because I
pre-ordered so why have they not sent me
my email is deeply upsetting if you'd
like to tell Jeff why he has not gotten
his oculus rift if you're shipping the
location please tweet at us using
hashtag hey TD and you can also use that
hashtag to get in on the conversation of
all the topics we talked about during
the week yeah anything that you want to
in be involved in with regard to these
topics we're gonna bring them up again
on Thursday we'd love to involve your
comments so use that hashtag I literally
read every hashtag hey TD tweet just FYI
just so you guys know I do we love it
and we really love having that two-way
conversation with you so you know hit us
up on the social medias yes and speaking
of hitting us up it's time for our phone
tog refer of the day
today's phone tahg refer is Josh he took
this photo with his galaxy s6 yeah Josh
wrote to us and this is actually last
week and he said we are having a
blizzard here in Colorado hashtag
blizzard 2016 I went to the grocery
store and stopped to check the mail
luckily work is closed today for safety
I took this photo on my Galaxy s6 and
for good reason your work was closed
because that looks literally like the
set of the mist it's terrifying it is
really I mean you can't see anyone yeah
I didn't walk into that because that's
where the monsters are that is exact and

show we also love a little story about
why you took that picture can I ask you
a question please see you realize you've
done this entire show with an inside-out
shirt I just wanted to ask is a choice

that note it's okay because I did it
with two two t-shirts on it's fine
I'm not note we're done we're done here
we'll be back tomorrow with a very
special guest actually we are going to
