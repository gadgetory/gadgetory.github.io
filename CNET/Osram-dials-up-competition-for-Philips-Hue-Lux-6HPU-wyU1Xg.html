I'm here with the Oz room light a Phi L
edy starter kit now this is a new set of
smart bulbs that use ZigBee to
communicate with a base station so you
can control them remotely from your
phone schedule them to turn on at
certain times and automate them in all
sorts of cool ways now like the Wemo
LEDs we saw last year the Ostrom light
of Phi LEDs use a plug-in hub to relay
the ZigBee signal to your router you can
stick that in any socket just like the
Wemo link you can also use the Wemo link
itself to control these bulbs they'll
work in Wemo there Wemo compatible so
you can control them in the app sync
them up with the Wemo motion detector
all sorts of cool things like that
another cool feature here is that these
are colored tunable bulbs and that means
you can change the color temperature
from a yellowy 2700 K up to something
hotter and whiter and blue or even here
in Oz rims app it's pretty easy to
control the bulbs you can just tap in
the center to turn them on and off or
battle the color temperature brightness
up along these kind of radial dials you
can also schedule the lights pretty
easily you set up when you want to turn
on and when you want it to turn off
now the bulbs themselves are pretty
impressive I was excited to test them
out because oz brooms dumb LEDs did very
well in our test and these are no
different they put out about 850 lumens
from a power draw of 9.5 watts I like
both of those numbers although the color
rendering score here is not quite as
good as Wemo there's also about a half
second delay from the time you'll turn
the switch on to the time the light
comes on
so that might annoy some all in all
though I think these are a good value
the price per bulb is a little over $30
that's similar to we most similar to
philips hue Lux and the price for the
starter kit is 60 bucks
gateway one bulb the Wemo kit and the
philips hue Lux kit are $100 starter
kits that come with two bulbs so if you
bought that starter kit for 60 and added
a bowl but be about 90 better value plus
you're getting that color tunability
feature that neither Philips and/or Wemo
offers so that's a pretty good deal if
you like that you're gonna like these
bulbs quite a bit thanks for watching
check out the rest of my reviews at
