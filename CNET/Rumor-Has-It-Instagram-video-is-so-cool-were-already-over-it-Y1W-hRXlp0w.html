has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors and you can
vote on what you think about the rumors
too in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet now apples event in e3
last week put some long-standing rumors
to rest but don't worry I was able to
scrounge up a few things that have been
making their rounds online first up
photos of the long-rumored HTC one mini
have surfaced leaving everyone to wonder
why is there a mini everything the
device is said to be a shrunken down
version of HTC's flagship device it'll
feature a 4.3 inch LCD screen and a
thinner and shorter frame and of course
the same unibody aluminum design other
speculation points to a 720p rather than
1080p screen and a watered-down
dual-core processor it's really funny
how trends changed just a few years ago
everybody wanted the smallest most
pocketable phones then we saw rise in
screens that are 5 inches and bigger
leading to the annoying term phablet and
now we're back to shrinking down these
huge machines so that they fit back in
our pockets adding to the mini train
there's an event in london on jun 20th
where Samsung will possibly announce the
Samsung Galaxy s4 mini a previous leak
pegged the handset to have a 4.3 inch
screen a dual core 1.6 gigahertz
processor and an 8 megapixel camera mini
mini everything I wish physical
keyboards were the next new old new old
trend next up last week Facebook sent
invites to a special press event on jun
20th but did not reveal what will be
announced the invite came shortly after
facebook hashtags were released and just
days after the discovery of code that
hints at a Facebook RSS reader which
could replace google reader but
TechCrunch is reporting that the company
has something a little more exciting up
its sleeves according to an anonymous
source Facebook's Instagram will include
video support similar to Twitter's vine
okay so first hash tags now Instagram
videos
it already released verified accounts
last month they say that copycatting is
the highest form of flattery but is this
just getting too obvious what do you
guys think it's Facebook turning into
Twitter will it unveil Instagram videos
don't forget to vote and leave a comment
and we'll check in with the cnet council
the cnet council is composed of five
editors who cast their votes anonymously
their opinions are not an endorsement by
Cena or CBS interactive obviously
because these are rumors folks and the
cnet councils verdict is a unanimous yes
each one of the editors I asked thinks
that Facebook will announce Instagram
videos at the June twentieth event I
mean come on can't you just see the
suits over at Facebook watching vine and
seeing it trend and being like what is
this vine thing that everybody is into
we must do something just like it right
now the suits or the hoodies as the case
may be yeah I can totally see that
that's our show everybody please share
your rumors at rumor has it at cnet com
or call us up 1 800 750 cnet and tweet
us and tune in next week for more tech
