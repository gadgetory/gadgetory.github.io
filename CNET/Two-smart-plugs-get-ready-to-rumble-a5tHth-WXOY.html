three important elements it's got to be
flexible it's got to be affordable and
it's got to be unobtrusive so I took two
of the leading products the Belkin Wemo
insight switch and the I devices switch
and pitted them head-to-head this is a
smart home show
the first question is how well their
features stack up both devices let you
schedule them track energy usage control
them from an app and issue voice
commands Belkin works with Alexa and I
devices works with Siri between all
these features these plugs might seem
like an even match the Belkin Wemo has
one more trick up its sleeve
if compatibility by tapping into the
collective integration that IFFT as a
platform offers belkin's feature list
expands like crazy and it makes all the
difference so when it comes to
flexibility the clear winner is the
Belkin Wemo insight switch to plug with
the better price point is pretty easy to
settle the Belkin Wemo insight switch at
45 bucks is five dollars cheaper than
the I devices switch so the winner is
the Belkin Wemo insight switch when it
comes to aesthetics the iDevices switch
look sleeker than the Belkin Wemo
insight switch which is a little bit
more unassuming but being inconspicuous
isn't just about looks it's also about
functionality and both of these switches
have the bad habit of getting in the way
Belkin switch blocks the outlet above it
while the iDevices switch blocks any
outlets that are beside it different
users will prefer the look of different
smart plugs but when it comes to the
functionality both of these plugs are a
little bit disappointingly conspicuous
so when it comes to which plug sticks
out more it's really a draw if you
really prefer apple homekit as a
platform then the iDevices switch is a
real contender but if you're looking for
the better overall product then the
Belkin Wemo insight switch is your clear
winner</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
