ultra tucson state drive from SanDisk
now the special thing about this one
here is that there's nothing really
special about it that's right not very
impressive that is now this one here
come with only three year warranty for
example and that's nothing compared to
this extreme pro right here also from
Sanders ten year warranty and in terms
of performance is also quite slow
compared to the extreme pro right here
so the question is why am I talking
about it well because it's still a great
Drive especially if you're still using a
regular hard drive like this one right
here or this one right here this drive
would still make your computer a much
faster machine now sandesh make it very
easy for you to replace your hard drive
with this ultra 2 because it includes
the free drive clothing software with
the drive it also comes with a Sandi's
dashboard software for you to monitor
and manage the drive here pretty cool
but the most important thing though is
the price the drive here is very
affordable for example this to a 40 gig
right here costs just hundred and ten
dollars in the US or 87 pounds in the UK
the Xtreme Pro here cost up to 55% more
depending on the capacity now the entre
2 here also comes with three at the
capacity 120 gig for than 80 gig and 960
gig and most of them cost less than 50
cent per gigabyte but that is a new low
in pricing for SSDs ok so this one here
is a standard 2.5 inch internal drive
over here it has the standard SATA port
the DRI supports the ladies SATA 3
grosso work with SATA 2 and SATA
basically it worked everywhere a regular
hard drive of the same standard is used
in my testing it performed actually
quite well with sustained speed of some
210 megabyte per second for writing and
some 310 megabyte per second for reading
that is actually quite fast it also
helped application to load must faster
if I'm on the drive here check out my
full
review as cnet.com basically for
homemade cost this one has a great rifle
though who's still in regular hard drive
but if you've been using another SSD for
a few years or maybe it's a better idea
to upgrade to the extreme pro here in
step me though and keep them both
together with few others of my favorite
let me show off it's not new though
because I'm dumb going this has been the
first look at the ultra 2 so stay dry
from Sandy's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
