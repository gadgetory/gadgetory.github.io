new phones for Android marshmallow I'm
Bridget Carey this is your sunette
update google is expected to announce
two new nexus smartphones next week on
September 29th Nexus phones are Google's
prime vessel for Android and these Nexus
phones will come loaded with the latest
Android 6.9 is Android marshmallow
multiple reports and photo leaks posted
online are suggesting that there will be
two models one made by LG called the
Nexus 5x with a 5.2 inch screen and a
larger model made by Huawei called the
Nexus 6p and that has a 5.7 inch screen
this would be the first time Google is
launching two new Nexus phones at once
this new Android marshmallow supports a
new type of charging port it's called
USB type-c and it's the same on both
sides so it connects no matter which way
you plug it in and it's also expected
that these phones are going to have that
charging port in marshmallow google now
suggestions will get more personal based
on your upcoming appointments your
location and it answers your questions
based on apps you have open for example
if you're listening to a song and you
ask google where is she from it'll know
she means the artist you're currently
listening to in marshmallow you can get
picky on the permissions of access that
you give each app such as allowing an
app access to the camera but not the
microphone it's something iphone owners
could already do but for Android it was
all or nothing in accepting permissions
these new Nexus phones won't be the only
ones getting an upgrade Google usually
also pushes out a software update to
older Nexus models right away so if
you're looking for a deal and you want
to be one of the first with the new
android marshmallow last year's Nexus 6
models are selling for big discounts on
ebay and amazon and unlock 32 gig Nexus
6 was found listed for 300 and 350
dollars on these sites it costs five
hundred dollars if you buy it straight
from google and also on the topic of
sales amazon is discounting the price of
its prime subscription service but just
for one day only on Friday September
25th one year of prime cost sixty seven
dollars instead of ninety nine dollars
but it's only for new prime customers
amazon is doing this to promote the five
Emmy wins for the show transparent which
streams on amazon prime instant video
and finally it's time for a new round
SmartWatch the pebble time round is a
thin circular screen SmartWatch the
first round one from pebble it runs on
the same pebble software and has an
e-paper display but it has a shorter
battery life than the other models it
last two days instead of seven it costs
two hundred and fifty dollars pebble is
taking pre-orders now and it arrives in
November that's it for this tech news
