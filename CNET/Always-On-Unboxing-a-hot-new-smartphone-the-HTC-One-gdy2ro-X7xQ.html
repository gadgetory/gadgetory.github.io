sure other people are too because it's
been delayed and then delayed again yes
and it was delivered through the matrix
because it's the one we had to get yeah
totally
we had to actually get this from our
Sina editors in New York because it's so
hard to get our hands on it so it might
not be and I tell you this because I
know how you are about unboxings it may
not be the most original packaging ever
but whatever the phone is in there this
arrived moments ago I don't get it but
it's good that you left it open so you
can cut yourself yep oh oh look see I
love the so cuz they've wrapped it all
up for us oh I see so it's been used but
I feel it it's so cold and night it is
it's like the embrace of an Android had
metal backs yeah this is really cool
looking yeah so the Beats Audio in the
minute Beats Audio previously like an HP
only thing it's light it's light it's so
gorgeous
let's return nine yeah turn it on oh man
I actually I'm having a hard time
getting over how nice this phone feels
in your hand like it is a pimp
brilliant you're gonna cool eight on
this one it's really marketing then Oh
Oh lots to say it is sort of though this
is a moon shot for HTC because they've
been losing so much ground to Samsung
yeah in the android market okay let's
see what else is in the box so
international charger because we have
the unlock position looks like the
headphones are like Beats Audio red
power brick power brick okay fine
branded and of course a USB cable yep
micro USB charging you know how I love
that standards yay and then are kind of
pretty these I would presume should
sound a little better than usual since
they're you hope so if the Beats Audio
branding but you never know we'll try
that later for now it's all about what's
on the inside of this phone
the HTC One has a 4.7 inch full HD that
is 1080p LCD display at 468 pixels per
inch Thank You Apple for getting us
interested in that spec it has a 1.7
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon processor
and it runs Android jelly bean
the base model comes with 32 gigs of
internal storage or you can upgrade to a
64 gig version there's two gigs of ram
to power that quad-core processor it has
a micro USB 2.0 port and a
high-definition video link for USB or
HDMI although the HDMI requires a
special cable the front-facing camera is
a pretty impressive 2.1 megapixels the
rear facing camera is just four
megapixels but they're doubling down on
the sensor we know that megapixels
aren't always the most important and
that camera is capable of 1080p full HD
video recording t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T and
Sprint's are all supported but at launch
at least Verizon isn't the 32 gig model
will cost $199 with a new contract and
the 64 gig model will be $2.99 ok so
everything about this phone is the
hotness the middle back is totally nice
like the performance seems super snappy
but and I can't believe I'm gonna say
this because the screen is 4.7 inches
but I'm just looking at it thinking I
wish it were a little bigger that's
amazing I can't believe we've gotten to
the point where a four
point seven inch screen is tiny for
years but fans I mean I know I don't
think anybody else is gonna feel that
way it's super light it's super
beautiful the processors amazing I like
how it stands out from a crowd to that
back and just the design really says
it's a unique phone yeah it looks like
something special I'm a little worried
about scratching on the back but we'll
of course you know torture test it and
see assuming that it ever comes out so
that we and you can buy it yes that's
the biggest concern with this phone well
that does help in order to get at help
when it does I think they have a
contender that'll look out galaxy s4
yeah I'm just saying impressive phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
