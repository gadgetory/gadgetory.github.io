welcome to the 404 show on this Tuesday
July thirty-first 2012 I'm Jeff Bakalar
and I'm Justin you and I Mario nu√±ez
and this is a show or we dump the tape
delay that's correct we say no to tape
delay not like the Olympics I'm actually
okay with tape I am too and we'll get to
that in just a second but first things
first we're back on the air we're back
on livestream we're back on cnet TV or
streaming video we're live this is the
greatest day of my life yeah I don't
know about you we got a lot of
complaints about the lack of video over
the past few days but yeah nothing we
could do about that I think I don't know
what it was people weren't and we were
pretty vocal about this we that we
didn't have a video stream it wasn't
working well these people clearly went
going to our 404 sub red I don't know
what you were detailing the entire thing
I was pretty proud learning things from
that thread I'm sure you were yeah
because that's what happens when you
leave a 330 every day yeah no I'm
kidding and yeah we definitely want to
let everyone know what was going on with
our problems long story short the system
we use to switch pro switch cameras and
called the TriCaster and that just
crapped the bed it was just it was all
over the place the system is down this
system is down we got a new one in here
it seems to be working well ariella
myself were here late last night right
where we not yeah we were we got to get
to know T we got to learn a lot about
each other like a lot got close I know
everything about our a little too much
you can never you cannot know enough
about it gets hot in the studio after
hours true they shut off the air
conditioner oh yes they do just two of
us topless yeah wrong with like handles
with some family need to didn't have to
the lights are working like Top Gun it
was yeah podcasting it was a weird like
gratuitous sex scene from the 80s from
like an 80s be here
meanwhile areas like all blurry and
blown out yeah it looked good I thought
yeah anyway long story short we're back
up and uh I'm feeling it I think
everything's working right and will uh
will that time tell that guys are
podcasting geniuses I don't know if
that's what you want to call it but it
wasn't fun Sidley's either way we should
be good to go from here on out so there
are any problems if you have anything
that you've spotted that she thinks a
little awry don't hesitate healthy now
show that we had no uh definitely let us
know the 440 netcom and check out the
subreddit because that was i was using
that subreddit to document everything
dude we're almost had 500 subscribers
for that yeah i want to i want to make
it a thousand that's what I'm shooting
for once we had a thousand I mean come
on I kind of want more Instagram
subscribers to because we've been
posting a lot of back behind the scenes
photos oh you know or a studio revamp
all the problems we've been having I've
been posting a lot of pictures on there
check us out on Instagram at the 404 do
you want to thank the TriCaster folks
before we continue you're not at all no
I'm kidding no they were helpful real
helpful um they did a girl they did a
great job in helping us know they were
for hey for the first third of this
issue they were they were on top of crap
I just you know I was dealing dealing
with them and then did you stop don't
wanna get into it I don't want to get
anyone in trouble just that's Justin
pleading the fifth it's right there um
have you been watching the olympics at
all yes I have i'm watching swimming a
lot it is not good it is not fun why you
had a swimming olympic yachting first of
all swit the swimming yeah i mean it is
not very exciting we talking not i'm
saying it it's not exciting I don't find
it exciting because there are there
aren't as many records being broken nose
on the care about Brad you they're the
best swimmers in the world yeah it's
great but they it's just not very
exciting to me maybe that last 17
seconds as they're making their way to
the final push you know that's sort of
exciting right i also have a problem
with the way they shoot the the
the competition I don't think the camera
should be where it is right it's
deceiving I think the camera should be
right on top looking top on a top-down
source you're saying you can't see these
swimmers as they go into the lanes it's
hard to follow the sport right and it's
on and you know I feel about the entire
game of hablo everyone that talks crap
about hockey the biggest problems that
you can't see the action that's not why
are you so dense and you can't
understand what I'm trying to say I
can't we really get what you're saying
but as a swimmer I can follow it find it
no you can't because you don't know if
the guy in lane 1 is equal to the guy in
Lane 8 well it's impossible to see
anyway because swimming is a sport that
is literally off by a tenth of a second
I'm just between swimmers no you're not
able to see who finishes before they
tell you anyway no but but if they had
that top-down view which they
occasionally cut too right I know it is
much easier to tell who's an elite
that's what I'm saying you can't tell
who's in the lead right maybe if they
had graphics above each swimmer as it
was going with numbers above it they
should just do that maybe yeah I mean to
have it for everything else do something
like that I think there's a lot of
things that are really exciting about
the sport of swimming especially easier
because in 2008 right I don't know if
ember this big controversy over the
swimsuit that the athletes were it was
created by speedo right now it's called
the lzr suit this is full body thing and
that was the reason why michael phelps
won all eight of those medals you think
that's why he want is exactly why he won
so you're saying it makes you one tenth
of a second quick and makes you a lot
faster apparently it says 90 speedo
claims that ninety-eight percent of the
medals won at the Olympics in 2008 was
directly because those so why does
everyone wear because now they're banned
really yeah which is why people aren't
showing as many records this year
because you're not allowed to wear
full-body suits in so that it was cool
and Beijing and now it's not yeah see
that's a huge issue in swimming right so
now you'll see people with like in the
2011 they were had they had an entire
body suit now the regulation says you
have to wear suits with no fastening
devices and alt like they had zippers in
the old ones and then they have to only
stretch from like your knees to your
shoulders for women's swim suits and
they have the jammers for the men which
are basically just yeah guys can't wear
full body right but basically would ya
which i think is true you know that that
creates a hugely I mean they were
basically human torpedoes right now
they're right and it's because it's
because the Olympic American Olympic
swimming team was sponsored by speed oh
right but does that you mean like the
other guys in Beijing couldn't just put
on speed of stuff no but they've have to
pay for it which is a huge lot of money
right yeah and some countries can't
afford that no they can't afford these
bathing suits this whole land the
Olympics is here it just a flat explain
it just bought its I'm sorry and I've
said this is the beginning the summer
ones are boring they're boring um you
know it's exciting to watch the beach
volleyball beach volley act very active
sport two on two beach volleyball is
awesome even the team volleyball all I
like that the basketball I mean we're
great right we should just win there's
no problem it seems like there's always
a lot of controversy to like I see the
thing about South Korea and the girl who
wouldn't get off the stand because the
clock broke in fencing no sound big
fencing controversy I'm some sorts big
deal the fencing world is on his head on
his face right I do agree that there are
a lot of sports that maybe shouldn't be
an Olympic sport like synchronized
diving like I'm sorry but if you can
retire after one year as like a 19 year
old from the sport or just so specific
these sport right or Olympic yachting
yeah I mean what did you don't say that
the winter the Summer Olympics is not
you could say it about the Winter
Olympic right Bob why people so yeah but
summer is not strictly white sports
cycling super white okay near your right
pinky closet sport that's continually
like all but I feel like the fastest
runners aren't white yeah gymnastics
also not wide enough yeah so come on
point the China is wiping the floor with
the the men's gymnastics true which is
not that much I mean I I respect and I
appreciate the strength agility stem the
overall talent of these athletes I do I
really do it's just not fun to watch for
me how are you watching the Olympics on
a television yeah but are you watching
it live or are you watching it no
because when I'm home it's 3am
in in London yeah so I'm watching it on
it on a tape delay ok so you don't mind
the tape delay because that's what we're
the show title came from people are
complaining that the tape delay is
spoiling a lot of the events yes for
people that like to watch a lot I don't
understand why this keeps coming up
every two years people freak out there
is go always going to be a time zone
that gets screwed over this depending on
where the games are geographically
located the time zone that's like five
hours behind is going to eat it because
they're all going to find out but why is
this but people seem to be there like
what do we do well the tape delay issue
isn't it's not a geographic argument but
but no they're saying that because it
happens earlier so well how far head is
England says six seven hours and that so
something that happens at 9pm there is
two in the afternoon here yeah they're
like well we're not going to show that
live we're gonna show the tape delay so
we can get that prime time or exactly
should I understand them doing that but
people are upset with them I mean yes I
do think they should be airing it live
maybe not on NBC but maybe you know
Barry it on like CNBC if you're really
that die-hard you can go watch it but
what's but what's the problem this has
always been an issue right good ever
since the the prevalence of of internet
that's not him i sees fault is the
internet were like blaming NBC like it's
there for maybe they can have a better
strategy which they uh how they wish to
sort of handle this what are you gonna
do that's that's just the the more the
Beast how can people don't complain this
much when the East Coast spoils the
Oscar winners for the west coast couple
hours or no that is not as long as big
of an issue 3 hours and they think they
do a lot yeah they still do a lot but
people don't complain about that three
hour because there's no delay no there
is a delay no they show at the same time
don't they know like if it's on at nine
am-9 p.m. here they don't show it at
nine p.m. local time that's just why you
living on the west coast yeah that's I
think that's the bigger size you gotta
move well that is you literally need to
pick up and move east I'm sorry that all
this is that's that's our own promise or
maybe just you know if you want to watch
it uh the live coverage or if you want
to wait to the primetime wrap up that
mash up later on at night then maybe
just don't spoil it for yourself and
maybe refrain from looking at olympic
coverage they the entire day yeah maybe
have these work during the
like everyone else is doing maybe you
impose something US big boys like the
call willpower okay that I understand
the argument though because a lot of
people are complaining that NBC just a
headlines on the NBC home page where
they're directing people to go for the
livestream ruin it just by the headlines
alone right that's a bigger issue and
and you're right some of the fault must
lay in the hands of NBC they did
something last night that was so effing
stupid with that they ran a promo
talking about that Franklin girl who won
the gold medal and some swimming event
they've literally ran like we're gonna
see what it's like for her to meet her
family once she won the gold medal and
then the next thing they add they're
like well who's gonna win the gold medal
it was right after they ran this
30-second bumper about good day America
whatever whatever they're good morning I
don't know what they have whatever it
was the next morning right they were
gonna show the interview with her
parents and the girl there like she won
the gold here's her first reaction with
their family and the next things like
well we're here the finals for women
swimming not sure who's gonna pull away
with it that was a bonehead move I mean
that's just common sense right I'm also
hearing this maybe I'm not supposed to
repeat this but there's like other
advertising issues like what like maybe
she's like inside baseball but there's
like certain sponsors aren't getting the
airtime their source beginning okay
that's another problem but in terms of
just the tape delay stuff come on that
is a bonehead move right there yeah it
also bruin it twenty seconds before
you're gonna air it yeah you know what
ever happened to it's new to you if
you've never seen it well we just ruined
it for everybody that's stupid I think
it's just like I know it's a no-win
situation either way people like to
complain if they showed it during
primetime then people would be upset
because they're they wouldn't you know
they would spoil it but because there's
a delay but if they showed it live then
people will just complain because
they're I work and they can't watch it
so I mean you're kind of f'd either way
I think the bigger NBC the big takeaway
is I just just wait till this winter
it's just going to be better dis ignore
all coverage unless you've seen the
event already I don't mind it's the same
thing as watching dark knight rises for
example like I avoided anything that
said that on reddit
you know like right don't other people
about Batman I told you that I was on
the subway train heard someone spoiling
spider-man for me I had to like plug my
ears llll ever have any old fashioned
ear plug it would ever happen to that
arm but yeah I mean look you're it's
gonna get spoiled for you it's it's the
way it works yeah I was watching a like
some news wrap-up yesterday and some guy
literally had to look at the camera be
like okay guys like turn away from the
TV now if you haven't seen the coverage
yeah this Olympic event yet the local
broadcast see that yeah yeah NBC for the
one did that the sports guy be like okay
spoilers onion are happening now like a
child yeah it's kind of ridiculous all
right we're done with that let us know
what you think about the Olympics I
again though man it's cycling fan that's
that's why you're not excited that was
cool to finish in the rain did you that
was terrified you actually tweeted
something interesting and you said if
snowboarding can be a winner Olympic
sport why isn't skateboarding a summer
for sure yeah what's what what the hell
yeah what do you think it would be more
interesting if we had skateboarding I
would I would watch it yeah that'd be
the one thing I would go out and pursue
and watch it didn't snow boarding
evolved from skateboarding uh I think
that's a fair thing to say maybe I you
know it's it's it's like it's just the
seasonal equivalent yeah winter is the
snowboarding as summers the
skateboarding that's just how it works
you know when we when you just have
shaun white on he'd be like oh i
skateboard in the summer and I snowboard
in the winter and that's how it works
and I we even asked when Tony Hawk was
here I was like dude woody I was like
what are you doing to get the Summer
Olympics to take on skateboarding he
didn't seem like it was something he was
really going after but if there's a half
pipe which is just tricks that's all the
half pipe is in the winter olympics if
there's a halfpipe in winter there
should be a vert competition for
skateboarding in summer thank you know
do you know how many more sponsors and
what kind of an audience would tune in
for that if you win the gold medal in in
in skateboarding on the vert that's
awesome yeah you know get a big young
demographic for sure I bet its ESPN
totally lobbying against it because
they've got the X X Games and they're
like no no no you can't do that
I don't know snowboarding was able to
make the the jump in skateboarding is a
lot older than snowboarding yeah what
about rollerblading and razor not need
to be the next in line scootering
scooter scooter in Justin the man
scootering competition I don't get it
yeah yeah but are you with me with the
skateboard I mean I'm sorry being
sincere about yeah great i I really cuz
you I would really freaking watch that
because skateboarding to me the vert
yeah probably harder which doing a lot
of you I would love to see a street
skating let's not push our luck I would
love that too you can't really race with
skateboarding like you can with
snowboarding yeah you can just be very
violent I feel like um but yeah I mean
come on are you guys with me chat rooms
seems to be on board I would watch
skateboarding everyone would watch it
what are we doing what are we holding
out on let's do it 2016 where's 2016 me
rio de janeiro right what are the sports
you want to see in the summer olympics
Oh years from now I don't know I think
that's about it I would like baseball to
come back yeah baseball is not as
international as we think though um but
yeah I mean a lot of American sports are
not international American football
we're really only once I care about it
yeah you know I don't know the only one
we play here that's two is basketball
and hockey is really international yeah
anyway let's mosey along and talk about
the FBI good and this this new
initiative would affect two-thirds of
this room right now the FBI is thinking
about making a database or they want to
make a database of human tattoos and
which tattoos belong to which people
yeah how do you feel about that you have
the most tattoos out of anybody in this
room I'm literally covered in tattoos
you they're all just skin colored
doesn't take many to fill this body with
tattoos no I literally have two tattoos
and you're like three quarters of my
body you're three inches taller than me
yet I have more real estate to work
because I probably got a bigger belly
it's very difficult to tattoo on me too
ever been to the mall and see the
Chinese guys right on rice
right of name on a single grid right
that guy has tattoos that's my art
exhibition traction they put you in this
vise straitjacket it's literally like
tattooing bun I would argue that my pain
threshold is probably higher than yours
um for you I know that hurt his bed shut
up dude like down a pig that is not
right you're right i just squeal in the
chair yes you man it is not okay and
even if that's the case you know how to
park up the parts of my body yet are
getting tattooed I'm sorry I know you're
like Jack Skellington walking around
here but you do not have skinnier knees
than I do and that's where my tattoos
going down and that hurts yeah okay how
dare you say you're the bone vibrating
yeah I can't man know all the flavors in
the way two people have to stretch the
skin finger it's a seven-man operation
do you really think I'm like insanely
obese is that what you know but if you
can make fun of me for being skinny I
could do the officer no because I'm not
fat you're skinny but I'm not saying
it's bad joke we joke a show full acute
you up man the table between it but
seriously though All Things Considered
sousaphone your larger than life what do
you a wudu ua anh nhu a block 45 that is
ridiculous yeah I bet re always down 61
to you way more than that you gotta
weigh more than I haven't weighed myself
lately but I'm like 150 yeah and you're
a foot taller than him I am skinny here
news flash oh but I'm just where are you
I'm 190 00 check your diet man oh my
golly you're the man who intravenously
serves bacon grease into your scrotum a
today thank you oh how dare you how dare
you you know when that needle is on your
your kneecap and
fun yeah all right I know I my knee is
so insanely large and fat and discuss my
knee has diabetes you're blown up with a
hectic I can hear you getting fat hello
ice cream yeah but a good time I'm gonna
beat you up man how do we get into this
cuz we're talking about the FBI trying
to put together a database of tattoos
okay okay obesity aside did you know
that a lot of tattoo apprentices
actually tattoo pigs because pig skin is
most similar to human skin did you know
that yeah true so I guess that's why I
got such a good tattoo then huh yeah I'm
serious that's why they got all those
pigs leaves nestle go on um okay where
were you oh yeah okay so the FBI is
consulting local police and it basically
this is an extension of the Homeland
Security's Security Department they're
trying to beef up their databases of
known criminals right now they have iris
protection and facial recognition
services and now they're testing this
new software that will track people
based on their tattoos and so they're
going to amass all these different kinds
of like overhead camera shots you know
the cameras they have in public places
like airports and whatnot if you have
visible tattoos they're going to start
recording those adding it to this
database so they can basically keep
track of criminals and also decipher
gang symbols because that's something
that is a big identifier rails and in
gangs sure those tattoos yeah
interestingly enough this follows a
report on in July eleventh and this was
a story back in the Wall Street Journal
that was apparently reporting on
government official denying immigrants
green cards based on their spouses
having gang-related tattoos even though
they don't have arrest records they
weren't allowed into the country because
they had these gang-related tactic which
I guess i'm not totally against right no
i mean i mean if you like should we let
anyone into the country this isn't this
isn't a gang thing but like if you had
like a swastika tattooed on your right
head yeah i'm gonna be going to deny
your uh no but see i think i think that
tattoos are open for interpretation
tation like a swastika if it was not
open for it is not open for
interpretation but a lot of people don't
know that if I do it the opposite way
well that's for Buddhism right I'm just
saying you can interpret that's a
different logo right right but like to
the Virgin I yield regret right and you
if you're really comfortable in trying
to make that different you know I mean
yeah that's that's pretty ballsy don't
judge a book by it's cover unless that
cover has a swastika not every skin has
bad yeah you know some of them are
fun-loving they're just big teddy bears
yeah with no hair or what if you're a
reformed skinhead and you still have
those tattoos all right the people that
only hate acidic do they they welcome
every other kind of they just don't like
one sex right yeah so I guess the I
don't know maybe the answer here is
don't get any visible tattoos don't
tattoo that face look you tattoo your
face you have more than just the FBI to
worry about yeah you're making a staple
on you're making a statement I mean it's
fine I've seen well no I haven't seen
any face tattoos that I think are okay
hmm but you are making a stable a lot of
people are starting to do like the
sideburn area have you seen that like
down the side of their face yeah it's
not as bad is something on your forehead
but mm-hmm still pushing it you know
like going back to the story I think
that unless you have a tattoo that
clearly says I hate blank non-asians
more if you have something as apparent
as a swastika right then maybe we
shouldn't judge based solely on that ink
on your skin alone there should be other
factors that are taking the
consideration in its consideration like
prior criminal records well look if
you've turned it around I just think it
reinforces that negative images of
tattoos if i do not see if i was a
neo-nazi and i turned my life around
right i was like you know what I was
drinking the kool-aid for too long
Hitler had no idea what he was talking
about I love everyone I'm tolerant of
all colors religions all that I'm
covering up I'm gonna tattoo over my
swastika okay I know someone who did
that because they formerly had racist
tattoos they used to have a swastika on
their leg cuz grown up that they didn't
know any but I'm serious it's like a
friend of yours from the front yeah for
now
ends with you not from I didn't know him
during this part part portion of his
life okay but growing up he got involved
with the wrong crew people and he
thought that was the way to do things
and when he grew up he realized how much
of a moron he was sure when he was young
and he covered it up because he was like
oh this is a symbol of hate he did like
a black bar thing whatever it is he
turned into a Christmas tree idea what
do you do what did you do no it's I was
tic-tac-toe you can make I have no idea
he just closed the lineup it was a box
box on accident i'm a big box guy hey
love bug love that what you have tattoos
have you ever run into a situation where
you felt like you were uh you were
misinterpreted or or maybe someone
assume things about you that weren't
right based on your tattoos I mean you
have it's just my leg it's your leg it's
a it's a it's a pretty massive tattoo on
my leg that's never been misinterpreted
but you never had to hide your tattoo
because you're worried that people would
assume the wrong things about you know
even my grandma doesn't mind it and
she's 90 yeah you know so I had to do
that once uh why oh I know I why why why
just wait what I've never told you this
or before so i can meet somebody that
yes uh so uh a little while ago I met a
girl friend's mom and uh your girlfriend
my girlfriend yeah and I made my I met
such a girl mom you met my girlfriend
your mom's co sign this book yeah I met
my girlfriend's mom and at the time we
were at work and you guys were here for
this I remember sure sure um I was
wearing a short sleeve shirt and we were
meeting really close to the office and I
was worried that my tattoos on my arms
would show if I reach for something you
know like if I reach for something
across a table or handed a dish I didn't
want to have to do like the mr. burn
like the monty burns like short t-rex
the Tyrannosaurus yeah you know like I
wanted to extend was afraid all right
and so because I didn't have time to go
home to change after we're gonna put on
a long sleeve shirt I had to go had to
put on a sweater the problem is two
things one it was really hot because
this was like a month ago in New York so
it was like 85 degrees outside yeah
number two the only thing I had
office to cover up was a sweater and not
only it's not just any sweater a wool
sweater yeah does ribbed wool sweater
and I didn't want to put it on when I
got to the restaurant because anyone my
hair to get messed up so I put you know
I donned it at the office sure also I
had to remove eight pounds of cat hair
before showing up you guys are all the
lint rollers in the world could help you
out never so by the time i made the walk
over there with this wool sweater and a
shirt and an undershirt underneath it I
was sweating like an emer effort which
made what's a bad look the show up
really sweaty yeah I mean you're sending
some interesting signals right you do
that got like hygiene issues yeah like
oh god I can't stop sweating and then on
top of that we ate soup noodles for some
reason because that's what you want to
eat on a shirt I've degree day and then
and I was sweating profusely the entire
time I was there it was so I felt like
Ben Stiller right in the in along came
polly yeah but but the reason a hot and
then also the heat made it really itchy
because I was uncomfortable and I was
nervous on top of that so it's like you
know just like trying to like do this
like pull my collar what would have
happened if she saw your tattoos what
like would the world of imploded we can
understand like this is someone who is
like a very traditional Korean so I mean
they still a lot of people still harbor
these stereotypes against tattoos that
anyone who has one must be affiliated
with a gang really yeah is that are you
surprised by that not everyone lives in
New York California you're right i get a
but sooner or later it's gonna come out
yeah maybe just gonna hide it i don't
know i mean like if you want you know if
you're if you're with this person for a
very long time relator is going to come
out sooner or later would but I mean
what am I ever gonna go swimming with
this person's parents you know it's I'm
not seeing any ways to avoid show where
it is so you're gonna go your whole life
for nacho I have a friend who is from
Hawaii and she has two sleeves full of
tattoos not to mention a couple ones and
relaxes well her family lives you want
pics after that yeah I like the legs and
uh yes she's her parents still don't
know because it's the same issue you
know her parents are very traditional
donors and that idea yeah abdicating
tattoos because you like the way that
they look and read shaker design I but
yeah so every time she goes back to
Hawaii whether it's to visit or just for
the summer time whatever she has to
cover up wear long sleeves which must
look ridiculous in Hawaii you know it's
like they never go swimming together I
mean these are things that a lot of
people have to think about I think at
the end of the day if your parents love
you and you love your parents it's not
always about it's not as simple as like
understands loving me I understand but
you know if you are gonna do something
like this it's it's just I don't know I
think we make way too big of a deal of
it I think I and I understand its
cultural and I can't necessarily
identify with that because I'm not
emotional you can you can still
understand that not everyone knows that
tattoos are as prevalent as we know no I
know I I just I just I think it's a
little silly in in going out of your way
to hide it from people you know I think
the biggest issue is that parents
understand the difference between like
well done tattoos and just like a dragon
with like blood all over it right right
knows our show you very different types
of tattoos right honor those aren't
tattoos those are like refrigerator
magnet you know what I mean re oh do you
have any anything yummy tattoos I have
no debt really you come off as a guy who
would really be scary with tattoos ya
see what is that like that's what I'm
talking about though what is that well
that's Joe first I want to be scary but
Jersey don't don't get it oh yeah no you
should I will know I planning I plant oh
you do yeah I plan to I just I just met
with an artist all right on where what
do you wear on my arm and it's gonna be
a Pegasus Oh would like for our more
high up up so I could cover it okay
right on yeah my girlfriend's parents
are real traditional tea and everyone
knows something super turd traditional
my in-laws are relatively conservative
they don't they don't really didn't care
right yeah I don't know and I got the
whole Jewish thing with like the whole
myth of not being buried and stuff like
that all right is is that a myth can you
clear everyone that I've talked to so
apparently people a lot of people
believe that if you get a tattoo you
cannot be buried in an Orthodox Jewish
right and I didn't know I think that's
the thing i think it's you can't be
varied in an orthodox one it was a it
was a storyline of an episode of curb
your enthusiasm
okay and everyone I talked to was like
no it's a room that's a myth and you
know it's just people not wanting to get
tattoos because I guess it reminds them
but it isn't it a chicken in the egg
thing because if you an Orthodox Jew
then you probably wouldn't get a tattoo
in the first place I don't know how that
works so then what if you weren't why
would you wanna be buried one anyway is
your dead I'm right if it's on my arm
all right cut my arm off probably my
office like well we're burying ninety
percent of death here the other ten
percent we threw in the Hudson River
that's a little I'm okay with that
though you can also buy if you go to
like Sephora or other like Beauty Supply
counters you can buy specially made
makeup that's you know you could put on
your tattoos to hide it like me because
one sponsored by Kat Von D right there
is for me though it's just white out
yeah it's just industrial-strength white
out because we know this we know this
from people who've seen me try and put
makeup on for shows there does not yet
exist a shade of makeup that lines up
with the pigment of my pigmentation of
my skin no scientists just haven't
gotten there yet yeah cosmetic
scientists they just haven't yet reached
absolute white flour you just got a
bunch of flour makes me look ten really
thank ya the color makes me look dark
you know if you want to really see
something super funny yeah I maybe we'll
put this in the reddit go and look at
some of the still images of the photo
taken from CES when Jim lands owned was
on our show and our buddy jon said he
who did the makeup out there oh he's
like Jeff I'm gonna make you tan today
and I was like Jon don't do that he's
like I'm already doing it yeah so he and
he makes me look tan it's the one we
were doing like the Ron Burgundy polo
right i'm talking about i'm doing the
lands owned and i look like a different
race it's how dark i am hahaha you got
it up on your screen looking for if i
can get that here it is the funniest
picture where's this one you don't get
too bad come on I mean my face what and
look at my neck
into my neck my forehead right it's like
a yin and yang three different shades in
your face or here cuz your beard is red
yeah your face is super like a little
darker in this one yeah and your neck is
why does I mean even going from my ear
to my cheek there is a pretty big
difference Oh bakula oh it sucks being
this pale all right let's do one more
story before we get out of here for the
day okay I'll leave that to you because
you're the man okay let's talk about a
social sickness and we actually we
didn't get to the story about Twitter
sort of being banned from the Olympics
did you watch the opening ceremonies by
the way why did they not ban cell phone
use at the opening ceremony why what was
going on it was just really irritated to
see everyone holding up what you know
the same idea as holding phone up in a
movie theater it looked super
distracting of all those screens do you
mean the people videotaping the opening
ceremony in attendance you could tell
that that was going on yeah how could
you tell because they were making no
effort to hide it like all of the people
in the stands no people on the actual
but no people or walking in yell they
were holding cell phones do it just
looked ridiculous oh cuz well it was
sort of like a party yeah it's like a
free-for-all I guess so I thought they
would have been better about checking
your phone because you could literally
see people tapping on Instagram right
well there was like um like Kobe Bryant
was doing in and LeBron was doing it
okay though what are you gonna walk in
the opening ceremonies of the Olympics
don't know you think it should be much
more like a conservative affair I just
don't think that anyone cares to watch
to see photos of someone that was on the
floor right you only we're gonna watch
the actual coverage of it hey fair
enough regard really disagree uh social
sickness apparently Twitter can tell you
when you're going to get sick and up to
eight days before it happens this is
really interesting yeah so this is a
study made by Adam SATA luck and his
team of researchers over at the
University of Rochester okay and his
team basically analyzed tweets from
about 4.4 million people that's a huge
sample size in New York City alone
that's over six hundred thousand users
okay in one month two years ago in 2010
right and then they used all those
tweets to basically construct an
algorithm of who's getting sick and they
made this heat map of when people are
sick the frequency and what type of
illness it was whether it was a cold vs
a flu okay and that they used a an
algorithm that would recognize
individual words so words like sick or
ill or like you know sneezing cough
whatever symptoms you're experiencing
right they also train the AI algorithm
to not recognize or weed out words that
where people said sick but didn't mean
ill get me pretty tough I mean that's
our like I usually song is like super
sick yeah yeah like that's not even to
the flu they differentiate artificial
intelligence algorithm always that's all
always given anyone yeah that's it man
yeah it's over so sick and anyway so
these researchers are saying that the
key to the system is friendships and so
those associative relationships if your
friends are sick you're also saying the
same thing then those are highlighted
more in the map and they can use that
tiny sample size to compare to the
entire one gotcha really cool now that's
cool so can you use this for your own
good I mean it kind of doesn't do
anything to prevent it just sort of lets
you know it's like that sort of our
early warning system right right it
shows that a lot of people in your area
or getting sick maybe you won't look as
many subway pools yeah I mean that seems
like the next logical sort of precaution
it's crazy how accurate this algorithm
is true this makes uh ninety percent
accurate and about eight days in advance
that can detect flew in your area is
that like the incubation period for a
goal yeah days or something like that
yeah it's very much it takes all right
cool I uh I really want to learn more
about this but you never get sick so
it's not related you know I do i do know
I I think I I think I go maybe too much
out of my way to not get sick yeah I
don't know there's something about
having a cold like I would rather have
the flu like just have like a fever and
be in bed all day then get a common cold
to me that is the most irritating thing
it also sounds like crap on the shot you
know you're like hey right i mean like
that's
awful it's weird though because that I
would think that you would get more sick
because it's always like the palest kids
you associate with my absolute
malnourished no like that's always like
the sickly kid right like really pale
like a sickly is different Bommel pale
you know man you're really lacing in
today first I'm a pig getting tattoo
tattoos now I'm like a sickly emaciated
pale free of fat and sickly I'm fat hey
Lisa yeah and you're gonna come out on
the ice with me buddy yeah I and that'll
