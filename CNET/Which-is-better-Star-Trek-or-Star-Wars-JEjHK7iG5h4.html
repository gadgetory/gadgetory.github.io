phases like it like a week blaster there
are two stars in this room which try not
myself request away but they're also two
stars in the geek Canon Trek and Wars
but which is better
I prefer Star Wars which prefers Star
Trek why is that rich why well it's
obvious it's Star Trek is a utopian
vision of the potential of humanity what
we could we all have to look forward to
if we can all just learn to get along
except with the Klingons I don't like
them that sounds Pleasant as an idea mmm
it sounds like boring television it's
great television Oh honestly it's great
television I mean let's face it there's
a whole universe full of terrors and
scary things and exciting things and new
planets to explore and alien women to
try and make love to and just all this
exciting stuff that's happening all
across the galaxy yeah and what's the
first thing you do when you encounter
these things you have a meeting have a
meet and who doesn't want to have a
meeting I'll tell you who doesn't want
to have a meeting yeah han Solo
right there's a very Ansel has a meeting
in a new hope and in that meeting
there's an argument and someone gets
shot to death well it depends if you're
the person who made the agenda or not
because frankly that kind of thing going
off off the minutes is just a is just
not acceptable I think I know that I
know that sort of popularities and
everything but in this sort of Star Trek
versus Star Wars thing and I think I
would say like just in case anyone's
really frothing at the mouth we do both
love both but we just have our
preferences but what I would disagree
with it what I would say is it if you
look at the popularity of both
franchises I think it's fairly clear
that Star Wars is more enduringly
popular despite being okay be more
enduringly popular Wednesday will start
1977 where did Star Trek start 1966 and
when did Star Trek actually become
popular not when it originally aired
only when it was sort of repeated on the
TV ad nauseum so children sat on with
nothing else to watch because Star Wars
had finished at the cinema like well I
guess is a bit like Star Wars I suppose
they are in space so it'll have to do
and that's what Star Trek is
it's the half to do let's look at the
quality of their quality of robots okay
fine bring it on look at the roads
install yes
c-3po a kind of fussy golden butler and
yeah tiny walking trashcan that he
doesn't even talk properly right and
then you've got data all-powerful all
powerful robot you can just do anything
I don't really understand that see why
the rest of them are there should just
be data just flying around sorting out
the problems I don't really understand
why even needs a spaceship or that kind
of thing but anyway an all-powerful
robot who can do things on his own
that's so that's data yeah again it's
like the utopian society it's like yeah
it's cool but like it's not much fun to
watch you've got see-through utopia
school kids it's not much of an
adventure as it's not like the conflict
doing good and evil that resides within
every one of us but like so c-3po and
r2d2 are perhaps the greatest on-screen
robots ever yes they are I've just ran
through the data banks and yes they are
so c-3po is right because he provides
like comic relief without being annoying
and he always looks like he's about to
fall over which is brilliant r2d2 is
extremely lovable he was like when I was
a kid who's my favorite you know he's
like he's he's plucky and cool and he
does that without saying any words but
with just sort of whistles and Boop's
and things he's extremely practical easy
you admire r2d2 immensely plus yes have
his head outside in of the spaceship
he's got the best view all right
lightsabers phases phases yeah phases
like it like a weak blaster a phaser is
it dial it up that's when they say
phases on stun you dial it up and dial
it down oh good again again like useful
practical things boring to watch like oh
good I hope they put them on stun here
we go all the phases Hunt's done cuz
everyone gets stunned alright let's
let's talk baddies then we've got the
Borg the Klingons
the Romulans the Cardassians is
brilliant values fantastic the ball
grown incredibly you've got me there I
wish Star Wars had a really iconic bad
guy who I could sort of pull out my
sleeve at this moment I don't think
there is one I'm just I'm just thinking
is there any book just the book no
and distances futile so I bother even
thinking about it Star Trek has good
good bad guys ok let me ask you where
would you rather have lunch Star Trek or
Star Wars in the canteen yes Star Trek
which is nice but it's effectively like
eating lunch in the office is always
gonna be wouldn't you turn on the right
you go ups the replicator and you say
I'll have roast dinner please all the
trimmings oh it's a wonder they're all
so thin what about the queue behind you
up to the replicator where everyone's
like Oh a race dinner it's gonna take a
while to print out no it's fine I'm not
hungry
you go ahead rich as he printed all the
potatoes are unbelievable there are
potatoes again absolutely printed them
all I'll tell soup then just print me
some soup I'll have whatever Slade
Thanks
but then again if you go to have lunch
in Star Wars you're probably gonna be in
the cantina again you're gonna have your
arms cut off which you don't need she's
not ideal no maybe you're in Jabba the
Hutt's palace he drops you through a
hole in the floor yeah because you said
he looked like a big slug yeah which
doesn't look like it makes like I mean
alright so at the end of this argument
yeah have I convinced you have I made
you think any higher of Star Wars yeah I
think so I don't think I could think any
lower or Star Wars so I think you've
done you've done a pretty good job I
quite like the way I didn't have to say
very much and you just eventually start
arguing your way around and so I'll
actually start okay so my conclusion is
yeah
Star Wars is more exciting Star Trek is
probably on the whole sort of like a
better geek culture thing because it's
more complete and it's easier to imagine
yourself in because it's a little bit
mundane just like real life that's where
that's my final position that's true
that's do I think that makes sense we
agreed away I think we really can't okay
so we've come to terms but what do you
think let us know in the comments and
stay tuned to see net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
