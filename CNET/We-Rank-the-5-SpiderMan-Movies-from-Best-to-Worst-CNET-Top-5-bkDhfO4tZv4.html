you might have heard that there's a new
spider-man movie coming out here a few
ads out there for it on every TV bus and
billboard let's count down the top five
spider-man movies before spider-man
homecoming arrives and number five
spider-man three the first spider-man
movie that ground everything to a halt
this movie will always be remembered for
emo Peter Parker and a spectacularly
terrible dance routine let's just watch
that for a second
yep
that happened then there's Topher Grace
as venom the less said about him the
better at number four amazing spider-man
2 the second spider-man movie that
ground everything to a halt in this film
we got a redesigned Spidey suit that was
brighter than an amazing spider-man
otherwise we've got a complete mess of a
story with the Academy Award winning
Jamie Foxx playing electro Electro's
motivations for hating Spidey make no
sense and the end of the movie attempts
to bring about a sinister six spin-off
and number three the amazing spider-man
yep it featured a darker spider-man
story than we've seen in the Sam Raimi
series but it was fine and way better
than the other two we've just mentioned
Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone were
great together as Peter Parker and Gwen
Stacy we also got the lizard for the
first time on film and number two is
spider-man the 2002 Sam Raimi film had a
spider-man who looked great swinging
throughout the city the film had Willem
Dafoe as the incredibly menacing Norman
Osborn
- that goofy Green Goblin mask in
general this film showed the world that
the adventures of spider-man belong on
the big screen before we get to number
one let's get to an honorable mention
let's talk about the amazing spider-man
1977 this was a made-for-tv movie that
starred Nicholas Hammond it's corny
low-budget
and very 70s but it's downright
brilliant compared to number five it
features the origin story of the Spider
Man and he even builds his own web
shooters and at number one is spider-man
- this is one of those rare sequels that
is better than the original with the
origin story of spider-man already out
of the way spider-man 2 was free to up
the ante with Doctor Octopus Alfred
Molina played Otto Octavius in a way
they gave the character depth then
there's that train scene which showed
what spider-man would be willing to do
to save others spider-man 2 is just a
great spider-man story
there's a really good shot that
spider-man homecoming will make its way
on a best list eventually but that's for
another time
