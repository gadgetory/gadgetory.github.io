kicks off on june the 13th here in San
Francisco California seen its senior ad
shower tip ken is here to give us the
inside scoop on what's going to happen
at WWDC now virtual assistants and
artificial intelligence is really big
from a bunch of other companies like
Google and Microsoft this year what do
we know about Siri yeah so for apples
developer conference it's always about
software they occasionally we'll talk
about new computers things like that but
this year it's going to be really heavy
on the software Syria is something we're
really hoping we'll get an update so we
saw with Google like you mention some of
these other companies have really done a
lot to make their voice assistants their
digital assistants smarter series still
is not quite there so we're hoping to
see them make more improvements make her
smarter she might be coming to the Mac
as well which is pretty interesting now
on the topic of software oviously Apple
has had a kind of a quiet you with Apple
music can we expect any more
developments on that particular front
yeah I mean I think that we're really
expecting some big updates to Apple
music probably more redesign as opposed
to new functions but also it's
interesting that they're having this at
a different venue usually they have the
developer conference at moscone center
which is this big conference hall
instead they're having this at Bill
Graham which is where there's typically
concerts so that kind of makes me wonder
if they're going to have you know some
sort of musical component to it I think
the last event they had their they had
one republic perform so they're it you
know it could be something like that yes
that's really interesting to say they're
doing in a musical venue as well like
they did with a couple of the other
launches previously and what about
obviously hardware is very unlikely to
happen so Mac os10 you expecting
anything on the software front for that
yeah yeah I mean there should definitely
be an update for both the iphone and the
Mac there's talk that they could rename
OS 10 to just Mac OS to kind of go more
in line with their other products it's a
pretty big year for iOS as well so we
just had iOS 9 so it's going to be I OS
10 or whatever they call it so you know
really interested to see what they're
going to do with both of those software
items and finally Apple pay there's been
a lot of conjecture about say p2p
payments and Apple pay
Apple pay working from mobile to desktop
do we have any more room is on that I
think that those are kind of the big
features that people are really talking
about right now Apple's really been
pushing Apple pay but it's not really
clear how much people are actually using
it so any sort of features that they
could add you know like the peer-to-peer
payments would really make it more
attractive to people shower thank you so
much and of course if you want to keep
up to date with everything new in the
world of Apple at WWDC we have a live
show kicking off on cnet on june the
13th and of course all of our coverage
