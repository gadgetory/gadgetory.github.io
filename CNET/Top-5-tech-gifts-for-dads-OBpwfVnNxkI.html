time to talk about dear old dad
and the day we celebrated but what do
you get your pop for Father's Day Tech
of course here a top 5 tech gift for Dad
at number five the curry connected LED
smartphone I know what you're thinking a
smart fault yeah every dad wants you to
turn off any excess lights that are on
for no reason unless he works for the
electric company first up this LED bulb
costs about $15 and uses only 11 watts
on top of that it connects to the wink
hub and the philips hue bridge so dad
can control the lights from the
smartphone think of the power you've
given dad at number 4 is the automatic
smart driving assistant now this little
device connects to pretty much any car
made after 1996 think of this as a
Fitbit for a car dad can get all kinds
of information on how and where he's
driving or how you are if you borrow his
car and can find ways to save fuel it
also tells dad what's wrong with his car
when the check engine light turns on
number three is the Pico bruise I'm
addict now what is it it's a thing that
helps you make beer at home yeah it's
pretty pricey at nearly 2000 dollars but
it's a great way for someone to get into
the homebrew habit the Pico brews I'm
addict is a connected brewing device
which logs data on the process and it
can also link up with Pico brews website
for new beer recipes hooray beer
appraised at at number two a
controversial pick a SmartWatch I pulled
some of the scene at dads in the New
York office including myself and the
majority of us said we'd like one as a
gift for the most part we wouldn't buy
ourselves as one but a free SmartWatch
now that's a different thing
if you think dad would like a SmartWatch
first find out what kind of phone he's
got an Android wear watch like the Moto
360 will work only with Android devices
Apple watch only works with Apple
devices and the pebble steel well that
works with everything and the number one
thing to get dad is a TV yes a
television this year we're picking the
LG 55 EC 9300 seen it editor David Katz
Mayer said this OLED TV has the best
picture ever with perfect black levels
and exceedingly bright whites Oh le D
the ad is a okay I am so very sorry
if you're interested in more information
or want different ideas on what to get
that check out dad's Netcom reward top
