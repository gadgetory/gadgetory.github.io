app store a few years ago for being
reckless with user privacy by keeping
track of and identifying iPhone users
even after the app had been deleted from
the phone this is according to a New
York Times report which gives a highly
detailed account of how CEO Travis
kalanick has a history of doing whatever
it takes to win even if that means
knowingly violating Apple's privacy
rules back in 2015
Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly invited
colonic to a meeting at Apple's
headquarters where Cook said to him
calmly so I've heard you've been
breaking some of our rules yeah that's
not something you want to have to cook
call you in to say to you according to
The Times cook then demanded that uber
apps stop its privacy violating behavior
or it would be removed from the App
Store and kalyn it complied Hoover says
the app was idean people to prevent
fraud by stopping folks from creating
fake new accounts to earn more money and
cheat the system but it wasn't just that
the app could ID users even when the app
was deleted you see according to the
report Callen dick told his engineers to
hide this code from Apple by putting a
geofence around apples headquarters so
anyone from Apple that was testing the
app wouldn't be able to catch the code
that little stunt didn't stop apple from
eventually spotting it Callen dicks
risk-taking has put the future of the
ride-hailing app in peril multiple times
and the company is now facing its
longest lasting string of problems since
it began in 2009
uber has reportedly used a secret tool
called grey ball to trick some
law-enforcement agencies from finding
drivers in areas where the app wasn't
allowed to operate there's also been the
recent allegations from former employees
that the company is hostile to women
employees and kalanick was caught on
camera shouting with an uber driver in
February coming off as insensitive to
the people working for him now out of
this Rose a campaign for people to
delete uber and use an alternative app
like lyft Callen ik has since apologized
for some of his actions and said he's
looking to hire a chief operating
officer to help better manage the
company to read up on more of burrs
