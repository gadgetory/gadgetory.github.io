Facebook I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update facebook launched a new
jobs board the social jobs partnership
app pulls in job listings from branch
out direct employers association work
for labs job bite and monster calm right
now 1.7 million jobs are listed on
facebook and you can apply it without
ever leaving the site we are in an age
where more employers are using social
media to recruit facebook says that half
of us employers are using the network
during the hiring process it's only a
matter of time before Facebook finds a
way to monetize these job listings and
what about LinkedIn Facebook certainly
is shaking things up but LinkedIn is
still more established and trusted as a
tool for recruiters be sure to keep an
eye out for some system updates Google
TV has an update that has better voice
search a redesigned on-screen guide and
new ways to share video between a mobile
device and the big screen the features
are first rolling out to LG televisions
and then to other Google TV products in
the coming months Google TV always had
many features but it's been criticized
over its usability there are also
updates out for Windows 8 and the
microsoft surface tablet aside from
security patches the surface tablet is
getting a firmware update to speed up
performance t-mobile is rolling out the
Android 4.1 jelly bean update to the
samsung galaxy s3 it's available to
download through the samsung kies app
sprint users already got the update in
october verizon and AT&amp;amp;T should be
pushing out the update before the end of
the year and those of you using
blackberry messenger there's an update
that adds voice call support users can
place free voice calls to other
blackberry messenger users when using a
Wi-Fi connection and you can also text
and call at the same time Pinterest is
now allowing companies to transfer
existing profiles into business accounts
no big shocker here given the websites
massive growth and the fact that
companies post stuff you want to buy and
people post things they want to have
business accounts will get verification
badges buttons and tools to drive
customers to follow a company's board in
the future there may be a way to have
analytic tools you better double-check
that Groupon deal in your email if it's
really a group
von deal with the growth of these daily
deal emails clogging our inboxes cyber

to spread malware and get your
information a study shows that these
fake coupon attacks are on the rise
