report and now for the gadget of the
week the gadget of the week is the LG NV
and although the spelling of the name
with a small e a big B and no y makes me
want to physically retch I have to admit
that this phone itself is pretty sweet
it's a sleek little job e with a
standard number pad on the outside and
there's a 2 megapixel camera that works
and feels much like a standard camera
and the phone supports the high speed
Abdo service plus when you flip open the
case there's a wide screen and a full
QWERTY keyboard underneath that's right
a full QWERTY keyboard with all the
letters of the alphabet so you can use
them even if LG won't and now for the
news this week it's looking as though
Olive mp3.com may finally bite the dust
all of mp3 is the Russian music download
site that sells all kinds of
commercially available songs at
ludicrously low prices the RIAA has
declared it basically the world's worst
music piracy site and the United States
has made shutting down all of mp3 a
condition for whether Russia can enter
the World Trade Organization and Russia
has said that it will indeed shut down
the site and man I am bummed I mean I
was totally gonna go buy this Wolfmother
album today now am I gonna do with this
dime buy anything with that it's been
reported that several gamers have
destroyed or damaged their television
sets while playing the Nintendo Wii
apparently people have been accidentally
hurling their wiimotes at the TV
due to the wrist strap breaking or
simple carelessness Wow so much for that
vaunted gamer hand-eye coordination huh
you get them up out of their tears and
they're all whoa whoa Plus now they're
gonna have to get their TVs we placed
speaking of game consoles in the
aftermath of the pre Thanksgiving
release of the PlayStation 3 at least
one analyst says that Sony shipped only
a hundred
seventy-five thousand units to North
America now those shortages plus all the
presale hype and extremely high eBay
prices contributed to a pretty insane
buying day frenzy in fact one man
actually remained in a ps3 line after
being shot so that he could turn in his
voucher to collect a ps3 that he planned
to sell on eBay people come on this is a
video game console this is not worth
starting parking lot gun battles over I
mean have you even tried crack now
that's what you start a gun battle over
crack not video games this week Google
sightseeing calm has released its list
of the top ten naked people on Google
Earth now we're going to give you a
small sampling of the list but I should
warn you this may not be WorkSafe huh is
that a man or a woman anyway yeah that's
hot then to think all this time I've
been getting close-up pictures of naked
people for free off the regular Google
when I could have been enjoying these
fuzzy blobs of indeterminate gender
viewed from outer space am I just too
old for this I'm not a wooden this has
been a buzzword thanks for watching
