the blackberry classic now this
smartphone is available for $449 unlock
and as the name implies it's gonna be
really familiar for your blackberry fan
it starts as expected with the keyboard
the layout is going to be really
familiar to anyone to use the BlackBerry
in the last three or four years or so
there are four rows of evenly spaced
keys and typing feels fantastic every
key is shaped with little ridges and
depression so if your touch typing
you'll always be aware of when your
fingers shift between keys really helps
is accuracy and the keys out for a nice
satisfying click with every press which
leaves you typing confidently the
classic looks good to a stainless steel
frame borders the full length of the
phone and the back has a nice grippy
texture three buttons sit on the right
side there are the volume controls and a
mute button in the middle push and hold
it to call it the BlackBerry assistant
it works just like Siri or Google now
ask a question or give it a task and
it'll do it the SIM card and SD card
slot sit on the left side the phone
accepts nano SIM cards and SD card to up
to 128 gigs call quality is great I
tested the phone on 18 T's LTE network
here in San Francisco and could hear
everyone I spoke to very clearly and
heard no complaints the phone speakers
are on the bottom with the microUSB
charging port they're loud and calls
sound nice and clear but the audio
quality isn't really suitable for things
like music so stick the headphones
you'll find the headphone jack up top
with the lock button the battery is non
removable but rated for over 20 hours of
use so you probably won't be hunting for
a charger too often the phone is a 3.5
inch screen with a 720 X 720 pixel
resolution that low resolution is kind
of a bummer for images and video but
text is going to be the primary concern
here and it looks great everything is
crisp and easy to read and edit the
square aspect ratio is going to be a
bigger problem though especially if
you're running Android apps see the
classic runs blackberry 10 point 3.1 and
supports the Amazon App Store as well as
blackberry world that's BlackBerry's App
Store blackberry says that the idea is
to get your secure enterprise level apps
from them and turn to enter for things
like games but a lot of Android apps
just look really weird in the square
format if you swipe down from the top of
the screen while you're running an
Android app you can actually choose from
different screen ratio presets which
could help things out attack but here's
the thing is a great keyboard really
enough smartphones live and die by the
apps we can install on them and the
small hodgepodge available on the Amazon
Appstore isn't really gonna cut it and
then they're all the great security and
productivity features that BlackBerry
offers it was really only shine in a
managed IT environment which rules out a
lot of smart phone numbers so that
leaves existing blackberry fans now if
you've got an older blackberry phone or
you just have fond memories of the curve
or bold you want to own the blackberry
classic is going to be a great upgrade
but for those of us who weren't tied to
physical keyboards or don't work in
managed corporate environments then this
phone isn't really for us
I'm Nate Roth thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
