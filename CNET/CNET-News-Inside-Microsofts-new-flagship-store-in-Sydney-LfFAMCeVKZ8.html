first ever Sydney flagship store in
Australia it's the first outside North
America and the atmosphere has been
pretty insane loads of crowds queues
wrapping down the street and of course
as we've come to expect from Microsoft
stores plenty of people in bright shirts
waving clapping and dancing but just
exactly how does Microsoft plan to get
people in the store and buying and what
do they have on offer let's take a look
the store opening ties in with the local
launch of the surface book and Microsoft
band both of which are exclusive in
Australia to this store customers can
also pick up the new surface pro 4 as
well as accessories like laptop cases
from Kate Spade and even Beats
headphones Microsoft is also catering to
gamers with dedicated Xbox owns and
there are plenty of video screens to
watch the action one of the things I
love about the store is their 178
screens with 38 different video feeds
means in different areas of incredible
immersive experience in one corner you
can be playing Minecraft and another
corner you can be playing with our
surface hub devices and really thinking
about the way we're going to collaborate
in the future there's even a dedicated
answer desk where you can come in and
troubleshoot problems with your new
product or any device running Windows so
with the answers desk we really provide
services to customers from any sort of
ecosystem come in we'll get your PC
tuned and clean and it'll make sure that
it walks out working giving away
products and concert tickets to early
customers we caught a few of them in the
line bigstar opening today what are you
excited to see the surface book the pro
four and the new loom is fantastic how
about you I'm definitely very excited to
see the band 2 and the Lumia 930 XL you
just went up on stage what just happened
I just got a surface pro 4 shaking and
so what are you excited to see in the
store today I want to see the band and
the Microsoft band opening six weeks out
from Christmas in one of Australia's
busiest shopping districts Microsoft
certainly has the timing right
but once the Christmas sales have died
down how will the store fare even
Cortana can't predict that one for more
