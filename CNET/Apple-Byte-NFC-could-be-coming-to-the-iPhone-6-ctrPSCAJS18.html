and welcome to the Apple bite for
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple this week WWDC gets closer
apple's next display tech and Apple
shuts down the weed firm now let's get
to it an apple has released the official
schedule for their developer conference
in their WWDC app with Apple's keynote
taking place on Monday June the second
at 10 a.m. Pacific time there's a lot of
speculation for what we'll see out of
WWDC but I don't expect it to be too
Hardware heavy we know there will be a
huge focus on OS 10 10.10 that should
get a look and feel that aligns even
more with iOS 7 with design elements and
performance upgrades except they should
keep away from the Hello Kitty colors
now iOS 8 will have all the changes
we've talked about like health book maps
car play and more but Apple has kept its
iPhone and other major Hardware events
separate from WWDC the past few years in
I expect it to be the same now I do
think that we'll see speed bumps for the
MacBook Pro line and the dark horse
hardware that we might see is the new
Apple TV it would make perfect sense
since rumors have hinted at it gaining
more apps and games and WWDC is the
perfect place to announce that they're
opening it up for devs my gut says we'll
see no iPhones no eyewash is just no
major Hardware until later this year and
don't start crying now Chris that's
right I'm talking to you all the Chris's
since it's a common name but we will see
the foundation that will drop hints for
the hardware will be seen later this
year I'll write a new report from Morgan
Stanley predicts the next iPhone will
finally bring an NFC chip to Apple's
flagship phone Apple has already pursued
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for short
communications like airdrop and ibeacons
that we showed you in action at an NBA
game but a recent Apple patent
application showed off an NFC based I
wallet that allows people to make
purchases wirelessly through their
phones using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth but also
uses NFC to create a secure link now
Apple recently began rolling out an
upgrade to its retail store mobile
payment systems with this new VeriFone
point-of-sale device and check it out
you've seen retail associates with
them and it now has an NFC contact point
right above the LCD screen so at the
very least they'll have the
infrastructure in place to support it if
the next iPhone brings an NFC chip
inside we also talked about the
possibility of seeing a new Apple TV at
WWDC and according to ours Technica
Apple is moving forward to building
their own content delivery network and
is making deals with some of the largest
ISPs in the u.s. to deliver Apple
content to consumers Netflix did a
similar thing by paying Verizon and
Comcast and companies like Google
Facebook Pandora and eBay are doing the
same now by building their own CDN Apple
can deliver iOS updates more reliably
but also iTunes in the App Store content
as well and that's a big thing to me you
build your own content delivery network
that behaves similarly like Netflix and
it's definitely a stepping stone towards
their Apple TV product which we might
finally see at WWDC and now you see how
the stuff all ties together now we
reported about a patent application
discovered by Apple Insider in February
that features the Cupertino kids
invention for integrating solar panels
into touch sensing components like
buttons or surfaces well the US Patent
and Trademark Office recently granted
Apple a modified version of it which now
widens its scope to include transparent
multi-touch screens and flexible
displays you say I watch now light
collected from around the touch screen
would be bounced onto the rear-facing
solar panels now we don't expect to see
an iPhone 6s solar and it's not clear
where we'll see this tech integrated if
anywhere at all but this is just another
look into how they're thinking all right
let's check out the quick bytes in in a
fun story all these rumors of an eye
watch aren't the first time Apple
actually made an attempt at a connected
wristwatch an image from legendary
industrial designer heart loot s leaners
book called keep it simple the early
design years of Apple shows off a
wristband with 12 keys numbers 0 through
9 and a star and pound key paired with a
headset with a single earpiece designed
with an integrated microphone it's
something that I would use and totally
wear today the headset that is all right
in for those of you who scour the App
Store's top 10
the number one free app that shot up the
charts by smoking the competition was
weed firm and has been removed by Apple
now the game centered around the
marijuana business with the player being
responsible for all aspects of growing
and selling the green stuff now this
hits home because a lot of you
especially on YouTube comment that I
look high when I do the show sometimes
but it's only because I stayed up all
night putting the show together for you
I'm not high
did you see that butterfly
now the developer Manitoba games says it
was removed to address a few maintenance
issues or what we call suffering from
the munchies but later said the removal
was entirely Apple's decision now
there's been no word whether people in
Colorado and Washington have even
noticed the game has been taken down so
good Apple bad apple you know what I'm
gonna let you guys decide let me know
why and if I like what you say then you
could win one of these four MacBook Pro
Retina smart shell cases from my friends
at spec and it's just a coincidence that
the 13-inch ones are green so send me
your emails to the Apple byte at cnn.com
or tweet me at Brian Tong and I'll
announce the winners next week
that's gonna do for this week's show
thanks so much for watching and we will
catch you all next time for another bite
