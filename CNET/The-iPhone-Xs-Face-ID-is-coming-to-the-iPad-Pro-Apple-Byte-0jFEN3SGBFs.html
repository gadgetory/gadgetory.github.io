welcome to the Apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
we know that Apple is big on augmented
reality with AR KITT Tim Cook has made
no secret about it I mean look at a our
games like follow me dragon oh look at
how cute he is he's like so aren't you
the church now Tim Cook recently sat
down with the independent where he
talked about augmented reality in
Apple's future plant when asked about
smart glasses specifically he said today
I can tell you the technology itself
doesn't exist to do that in a quality
way the display technology required as
well as putting enough stuff around your
face there's huge challenges with that
the field of view the quality of the
display itself it's not there yet
so you're telling us you've been working
on it which has been reported for a
while
cook then went on with the company line
that Apple will only ship a product
that's the best and that the company
doesn't care about being first to new
technology because we've never noticed
that at all
all right Apple has seated the second
beta of iOS 11.1 for developers and the
public beta that you can sign up for and
you know what that brings new unicode 10
emoji
and that's a hedgehog and not a
porcupine in case you ever have to use
those in a text message just to be clear
now only other users of 11.1 beta 2 will
be able to see the new emojis if you use
them and there's no word yet when we'll
see an official public release
all right the beta 2 also brings back
the 3d touch app switcher gesture on
devices equipped with 3d touch I just
saw some of you through the screen say
yes now Craig federighi said it had to
be temporarily removed for technical
reasons but would be bringing it back in
a future iOS 11 update also watch OS 4.1
beta to get some new changes and
features that you know what i'm
just-just about the new radio app now
streams over a cellular connection it
didn't in the previous 4.1 beta release
and the ESPN station now plays in the
radio app as well new Wi-Fi changes are
the biggest there's a new Wi-Fi toggle
that allows you to turn it off or on
great for LTE users that really want to
force it to LTE and the Wi-Fi SSID is
also displayed in the control center so
you know which network you're connected
to now this makes me warm and fuzzy and
happy inside and you know what that
deserves a radical like those are legit
improvements plus you can also pick up
the new Nike Plus GPS and LTE series
three models in stores now which brings
you the Nike branded watch faces and a
watch strap also iOS 11 point 0.38
that's available that fixes an issue
where audio and haptic feedback would
not work on some iPhone 7 and 7 plus
devices and an input issue with non
genuine display replacements for the
iPhone 6s now I was just talking about
how many of my messages weren't buzzing
or making sounds this past week on my
iPhone 7 after eleven point 0.2 so maybe
that fixes this for me it's the third
minor update to iOS 11 we've seen and
I'm still waiting you know for a battery
life improvement wouldn't that be nice
alright Apple pay cardless withdrawals
are now available and over 5,000 Wells
Fargo ATMs across the US you'll still
have to use your ATM PIN to authenticate
it but this makes even going out without
cash a whole lot more convenient if you
don't want to take your phone with you
Wells Fargo says its remaining 8,000
ATMs will be upgraded by sometime in
2009
team and it also supports Android pay
and Samsung pay and according to a
report from Kei securities Ming Chi quo
the new 2018 iPad pro models will come
equipped with a true depth camera and
support face ID to give a consistent
user experience with the iPhone 10 you
know just like they did 3d touch between
the iPhone and the iPad oh wait
they didn't now according to quote it
will only be brought to iPad pro models
which are Apple's flagship tablet device
and still you know what one of my
favorite devices of the year another
recent report by Kuo also says Apple's
true depth camera tech has turned the
industry's attention away from under
display fingerprint recognition
he says Android smartphone vendor
requests for 3d sensing tech has tripled
since Apple revealed their true depth
camera and face ID system whoa believes
3d sensor equipped Android devices will
exceed under display fingerprint
recognition by two or three times over
the next few years also a couple reports
say Apple was all in for face ID from
the start and that touch ID through the
screen was not part of the plan and
guess what this might matter for you it
does for a lot of people Apple is
quietly released iTunes twelve point six
point three which brings back the App
Store and the ability to download apps
and ringtones from within the iTunes
software now a lot of you were ticked
off when Apple remove this in the most
recent iTunes twelve point seven they
made this version available because
according to them certain business
partners still need to use iTunes to
install apps you won't be prompted to
download a new version of iTunes with
this version and if you'd like to grab
it you can go to the link I created
right down here for you check it out
it's also compatible with iOS 11 iPhone
10 eight and eight plus but it's not
clear how long Apple will offer it and
before we go we've got another killer
giveaway from my friends at 2k sports
guess what with the NBA season starting
in just under a week we're hooking up
Apple by nation with one of six copies
of MB a 2k 18 this is for real three for
the Xbox one and three for the ps4 all
you got to do is tell
what did we put on top of an Apple home
pot on last week's show let me know the
version you want and I'll pick randomly
six winners and announce them next week
all right that's gonna do it for this
week's show you can email us at the
Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me at
brian tom thanks what's your watch it
will catch all next time for another
bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
