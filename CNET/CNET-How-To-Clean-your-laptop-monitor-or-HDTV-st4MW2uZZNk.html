forever over time your once shiny new
computer slowly turns into a filth
machine crumbs get lodged into the
keyboard and smudges and stains begin to
appear on the screen luckily all of
these annoying cosmetic flaws can be
quickly and easily fixed with basic
household items I'm dan Graziano I'm
going to show you one of the ways you
can clean your laptop to get the job
done I recommend picking up some soft
lint-free cloths or microfiber cloths
you'll also need mild dish detergent
such as dawn a can of compressed air and
some rubbing alcohol never use things
like paper tower or Windex as this will
surely damage your computer you should
also never apply anything directly to
your screen make sure to spray it into a
cloth first before you begin power down
your laptop and unplug the connector if
your model allows it you should also
remove the battery however as you can
see with my macbook air this is not the
case we're going to start by cleaning
the lid and the bottom of the device mix
a couple of drops of dawn or another
dish soap and a couple of cups of warm
water together
dip your lint-free cloth in the soapy
mixture bring out the rabb and wipe down
the surfaces rinse out the cloth with
clean water and wipe it down again to
avoid water streaks wipe it down a third
time with a dry cloth
this method can also be used to clean
your laptops display and the screen on
your monitor or even an HDTV next we are
going to take the can of compressed air
and begin to spray away the crumbs from
your keyboard if your laptop has vents
try and spray the dust from there as
well
more advanced users can open up their
device and use the compressed air to
spray away any dust on internal
components but for now we're sticking to
the basics if your keyboard is
especially dirty dab your lint-free
cloth in the rubbing alcohol and gently
rub your keys I find this to be a better
solution than soap and water because the
rubbing alcohol evaporates almost
immediately which greatly reduces the
risk of liquid getting inside of your
laptop for more how-to like this one be
sure to check out how to see Netcom you
could also reach out to me on Twitter
with any questions or
