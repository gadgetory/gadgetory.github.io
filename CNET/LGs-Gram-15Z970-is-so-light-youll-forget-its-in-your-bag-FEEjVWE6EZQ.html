doesn't make you sacrifice screen size
or some runtime for less weight it's
seriously light at under two and a half
pounds and about the size of a typical
14-inch model but you can get it within
Intel Core i7 and a 15.6 inch full HD
touchscreen for $1,500 or without touch
and a core i5 for around a thousand
unfortunately to get a big display in a
smaller body the webcam is on the hinge
which basically means positioning it is
always going to be a problem also the
lightweight does make it feel less than
durable but if you can get past the feel
the magnesium body should hold up to a
daily commute the keyboard is decent if
a little shallow and spongy plus the
backspace and enter keys are just a
touch too small the touchpad is
altogether fine too but you might want
to tweak its settings to avoid some
cursor jumpiness or random resizing oh
and buy some good headphones because
these speakers are just plain bad inside
isn't anything too extraordinary it's
meant for productivity not high
performance but it has no issues keeping
up with typical day-to-day tasks and
with the larger screen you have room to
stretch out and work with two windows
side-by-side and with a little less than
10 hours in our video streaming battery
test you should be able to eke out a
full eight-hour workday with some time
to spare</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
