is Steven Beach and producer of the
Apple byte extra crunchy podcast with
your host mr. Brian Tom what's up
everybody welcome to the show hey it's
episode 118 Apple byte extra crunchy
we're here in the studio live together
like in the same place
maybe that's what I would do it again
this is the show that's kind of our
complementary piece to the actual Apple
byte podcast the video show that's
weekly we have news stories that keep on
happening because in the Apple world
everything drops constantly to be a part
of the show we had tons of calls from
you all and we continue to do that the
number to call us is at 1 800 662
1 861 6 268 leave your name where you're
from and then just get into your
comments I think this week because we
scold people and said okay no more
2-minute calls you guys tightened it it
up for us which we appreciate so I think
we're gonna have a lot more we're
actually gonna be able to get through
more calls today yeah that's great yeah
we get a lot more calls because they're
shorter so so that benefits everyone
here but I appreciated everything
alright let's jump in the show we know
the big story this week the big headline
story this week the home pod is finally
out it was released to multiple outlets
and youtubers for review see net has
their own but because we're subtle but
it's like bait what I call the Big Red
Machine they gave us a home pod unit to
our smart home crew they're based out of
Kentucky and so they actually have our
review obviously you can check out scene
that's owned or others I will be
personally getting mine tomorrow and
then we'll be all that's gonna be
goofing around with it you know a lot of
times we need I like to spend extensive
time with it so you'll get my review I
kind of have like a little more laid
back casual style about it and I want to
really deliver what it does great and we
know everyone is raving about the sound
which is kind of what we expected the
sound is the focus for Apple but beyond
that you know everything we kind of know
about a 3:49 price tag series not that
smart and I will dive into exactly how
smart it is or isn't but I can tell you
right now I think the biggest thing that
people are frustrated about and again
this doesn't surprise
but this is kind of par for the course
when you talk about how Apple does
things shirt supports all of Apple's
services and Apple music recently there
was an announcement how Apple music
subscribers actual pain subscribers
headed something around 30 million
subscribers in the US they don't say
actually they say their pain but I
wonder how much of that is at least the
initial trial but that's a huge number
and really when you look at this device
it is made for someone who is strictly
in the Apple ecosystem and I'm talking
about someone who uses Apple music
someone who uses iCloud matching and
someone who has the iTunes sorry the
iTunes Match service and then purchased
songs that they own from iTunes it's for
you there is no headphone audio 3.5
millimeter headphone jack on it there's
also this is the biggest Bugaboo for me
we're all conditioned to connect to any
type of Bluetooth speaker we want to
this home pot has Bluetooth 5.0 but it
does not support any phones to stream
music over Bluetooth it only supports
iPhones running iOS 11 very serious so
that what that means is you have an an
on iPhone you can't connect to the home
pod if you have an iPhone that doesn't
have iOS 11 you can't use it with the
home pod and also no one has really dug
deep into what happens if you have Apple
music but you're on an Android phone my
assumption is you'll put in your
credentials but you really have to talk
directly to the home pod you won't be
able to stream or control your Apple
music collection from your Android phone
hmm so I mean that's my assumption based
on how Apple is doing this no one's
really dug into that also you know just
things subtle things how the Siri on the
home pod I believe it or not is more
limited than Syria on your phone so
you're not even getting the same Siri
meaning you can't do the same things I
it's kind of crazy but Apple is
targeting a specific market for this and
until we actually you know until I get
my hands on it we'll really see but
overall everyone says the sound is on
point but if you want to pay $350 for
speaker and it better sound the best in
its class for that
price but beyond that it's really for
the die-hard Apple loyalists and you
know there will be software updates the
other thing to mention we have talked
about this airplay too is not ready yet
so there you will not be able to buy to
home pods right now and use them in
stereo sound which is one of the
features they promised that when they
announced it and also it there is no
multi room support so you can't put two
home pods in two different rooms and
locations and play the same music from
it right now it's just the home pod so
it is coming out Friday to mention also
about pre-orders for the longest time
app you could get these were readily
available but right now at least in the
UK they're delayed out until February
the 13th which is three four days I
think Australia has a one-week wait time
that's really more on inventory but just
this morning or really maybe last night
availability in the u.s. changed from
February 9th which is launch day to
February 13th so there are more people
that are jumping on it but it is the
first Apple product that I can remember
that took two weeks for it to even
fulfill its pre-order and then get the
date pushed back I mean that's never
happened so I'm expect to hear what it
sounds like man I mean yeah I mean
excelling pointed better sounds will
you'll get one here in the SF office
tomorrow sweet so and the funny thing is
we it's not like we can play songs that
you know on it because of music
licensing rates that's right
we'll play generic songs that you don't
know but but you know I it's an
interesting thing I I think it's just
one of those products that really people
in general there are people that are
excited about I think the loyal Apple
fans the loyal diehard ones but it is
the most eco system locked product you
could ever think of quite honestly that
Apple has that Apple's easy you can even
use air pods on Android phones that's
cool you can't use a home pod as a music
speaker
over Bluetooth that's a big deal to me
that's been like most of the reviews
I've been reading is like it's great but
it's trapped in an app Apple super
trapped so you kind of it's the trap pod
it's the trap pod so anyways check that
out um you know we'd love to hear people
by the time our next show comes up for
the Apple byte extra crunchy Colin if
you bought a home pod let us know what
your thoughts are you know give us your
kind of quick 1 minute 1 minute and a
half mini review what you like and what
you don't like we'd just love to hear
from you to kind of contribute to just
the overall feeling of what people are
thinking about the home pod so there you
go all right also a lot of iPhone use
dropped this week as well Apple released
their second betas for Mac OS I Sierra
they released their second beta for iOS
11 which is really important and the
second beta for TV OS but what we found
that was the most interesting thing as
part of this is that the iOS beta it's
the second beta is the first time it
introduced this actual new battery
health feature from Apple and so what
does this battery health feature do
basically it does a variety of things it
tells you the pretty much the condition
or the capacity of your battery has that
changed over time because we know with
the 6 6s and the 7 those are the those
are the phones through iOS 11 that were
affected where they were throttled down
if the battery wasn't great and then we
have this whole thing now where people
getting their batteries replaced I don't
know if we really have to get into how
ugly it is but it's we've talked about
it like for the past for show so I'm not
gonna get into it as much but this new
battery health feature will tell you how
your battery is doing it'll also offer
you the option to turn off the
throttling feature but this is in the
beta 2 so if you're part of the
developer program you can check it out
right now I don't honestly off the top
of my head I don't know if they released
it for the public beta just yet but this
is out there and it's worth checking out
I think it's really cool that at least
they've done and answered every question
we have the other nugget that I found
out that came out really interesting
from this is Apple then officially
announced on their support page about
the iPhone 8 the iPhone 8 plus and the
iPhone 10
are gonna be less impacted by this
performance management tool and why they
say they say the actual physical
hardware and software design of those
three phones specifically should see
less issues in regards to this whole
okay if your battery performance is low
then we're gonna throttle your phone
down and I think a lot of that has to do
with there's a lot of coprocessors and
just really more raw power in the actual
new iphone 8 and the iphone m10 with the
new processors inside of it and that's
really what's kind of aiding those
phones I know everyone's worried like
well I have to worry about this
long-term we'll wait and find out but at
least right now they are saying that the
8 the 8 plus and the 10 won't be nearly
as affected by these battery performance
really performance management issues I
almost felt like ice performance issues
yeah yeah this is really this is really
like the iPhone 6 is that it affects six
6s &amp;amp; 7 I mean 7 is having other issues
beyond that - really yeah even you just
actual functionality issues as well the
other thing that I did want to mention
is a quick story I kind of missed and
skipped over because there's a lot to
talk about
is that recode recently reported as well
that Apple right now they're not doing
anything about it but they are mulling
over the idea or whether or not to offer
rebates to customers who previously
purchased full price iPhone battery
replacements because if you had a phone
that was out of warranty before Apple
basically made this reveal of what they
were doing people still went in and
wanted to get their batteries or play
some paid $79 instead of the change $29
price that they're now offering yeah so
Apple has directly said yes we are
exploring this and we will update you
accordingly so we'll find out there's a
lot of users you you've got to win some
good faith back I know there's hundreds
of millions of Apple fans out there but
do the right thing
they have they're sitting on I think the
number now is 280 billion dollars of
cash and they can kick down 40 bucks you
the right thing and just just get it all
great just this article coming out that
they're mulling it over tells me that
they're gonna do it they're just trying
to figure out how to do it and they
wouldn't even address it if they weren't
pretty much going to do yeah exactly
right they would just ignore it so maybe
like oh what problem what issue I don't
have no I have nothing no idea what
you're talking about I mean another kind
of new issue popping up that uh we are
keeping an eye on and this has been
growing in the Apple forums is a been
reported by the Financial Times that
says a growing number of iPhone 10 users
are unable to accept calls and Apple is
actually looking into this investigating
it what's happening is the screen which
doesn't have right touch ID button or
physical button to prompt it sometimes
people are getting calls where the
screen stays off and then they don't
even get to see on screen visually the
accept or decline button and so I'm one
that hasn't happened to me yet but it's
a it's something worth mentioning just
because this is a growing thing in the
support forums I think it's around like
a 15 or 20 page talk now but even people
that are having this issue they've tried
to restore their phones redo the
software and they're still getting the
same issue so just when I thrown out any
bad apples right now just something
that's a serious bad Apple though if if
true if true you get a thousand dollar
phone you can't answer the phone call
yeah that that could be a problem that
could be a problem we also want to let
you know that today's show is unsullied
by any sponsorship or influence but that
will change the next three or four weeks
so basically just to let you know no one
is paying us to sit here right now other
than seeing it yes thank you Cena
thanking us to sit here we're just
messing around all right on to the other
stories here just kind of some follow up
with Apple products across the board
after their earnings report we know
about the Apple watch Apple still yet to
reveal official sales numbers they don't
like to do that so what we do is we lean
on projections and ideas from other data
analytics that really follow the market
and the movement of actual units so
according
to research firm Canales they estimate
that shipments for the Apple watch
topped an all-time high of 18 million
units last year in 2017
now that's an over 50 percent increase
compared to the roughly 12 million units
that were shipped in 2016
they say that of this breakdown 48% of
them were Apple watch Series 3 while 52
percent of them were series 2 or older
models of the series 3 purchases around
13% of those customers off opted in for
the LTE model which I did and which is
really the best version to do if there's
the lifestyles yeah yeah really I mean
this the series 3 watch with LTE and
watch OS 4 transformed it completely
I've said it over and over and over it's
a legitimate product and I'm look
there's no surprise great hardware great
software put them together even if it
takes you three years to do it and then
finally the market is responding again
Apple won't reveal their numbers they
bundle this in with like the Apple TV
with accessories like the air pods and
their beat sales and even their home
pods they'll be bundled together so like
it's been three years it's not like
Apple is doing gangbusters like if they
hit if they hit a benchmark of like 50
million Apple watch watches sold we
would have probably heard about it even
20 million but we still have it because
they brat they brag about it so much
when they hit those benchmarks so good
news coming out from the Apple watch the
another really cool story staying in the
same place comes to us from this new
study from company called cardiogram and
what they've basically found is that
according to the study this is really
their first a large-scale study that
demonstrates you know how an ordinary
heart rate sensor something that we
could find in the Apple watch in others
even like the Fitbit but it can actually
really detect early signs of diabetes
and they did this by can you know they
have this whole study that they put out
they have people opt into it but this is
kind of crazy that we've talked about
although it may not be the sexiest thing
Apple using the Apple watch
to get into health and fitness but
really the medical field and so they've
from their studies they it suggests that
the Apple watch heart rate sensor itself
can detect early signs of diabetes the
pancreas is connected to the heart
through the nervous system and according
to their report the heart rate
variability changes when a person begins
experiencing diabetes like cysts
symptoms that's awesome really cool we
also know that Apple has their own
official apple heart study that's a
partnership with Stanford and so you can
actually opt into that right now
I I kept on getting notifications like
opt in opt in so I'm like forget it I
don't want to see this anymore
I'm just gonna opt in but they're trying
to basically detect abnormal heart
conditions arrhythmia and to see how
they can connect that in really warn
people ahead of time that I think there
was a story about a gentleman who his
heart rate kind of peaked and he didn't
know what was going on and he went to
the hospital and they basically I don't
know if it was a stroke or not but they
they caught his medical condition before
it actually hit him that's huge man so
the strike exactly the stuff is already
happening yeah I know not the sexy sexy
but uh no that's sexy actually you know
you want to know if your heart it hasn't
you do if your heart is like beating it
regularly or too fast you want to know
that well I'm just telling you just
don't eat McDonald's every day I think I
mean I love a Big Mac and a fish filet
and I'll kill a 20-piece Chicken
McNugget in one sitting I don't know how
you and I got the two cheeseburger deal
I was in a hurry I had to eat but it was
good wasn't it wonderful well you know
it sucks because I could still do it but
there was a time where whenever I go to
McDonald's I literally would kill two
Big Macs to the Big Macs Big Macs and a
fries with sour sauce I put the sweet
and sour sauce in there I don't think I
could do that that's invasive man that's
but I had to stop because I'm like this
is probably not good for me yeah how do
you feel like an hour after you eat
McDonald's you feel weird you definitely
feel different like something's wrong
it's called good it's called satisfied
something in the bottom of my stomach
all right um just some news stories also
we're kind of throwing this under the
bundle of maybe March announcements
coming out historically Apple has
put out new product releases in March
last year it was like the iPhone I think
it was at iPhone 7 read addition we also
saw new iPad pro the nine point seven
inch and then um I think we saw it we
saw a new Mac we saw a new MacBook as
well and if I recall right I believe
they bumped up the capacity of the
iPhone se as well those were kind of
some of their announcements in that
March time period you guys can fact
check me if you want to but I believe
those were kind of like some of the core
products that came out what we know
right now people been asking what's
going on with Apple's air power they're
maxi-pad oh yeah we got a call about
that too so they're I'm gonna say they
said 2018 we still have yet to see a new
air pods with the actual charging case
hmm right there they showed off that
there will be an actual air pods that
comes out with a rechargeable case that
you can drop on this air power pad the
Apple watch and iPhone will support it
so I don't know if they got their ish
together they delayed the home pod so
maybe that might have delayed the air
power but I'm gonna let's put March on
the calendar let's just call it right
now let's say March right March
March it is could be totally wrong also
iPhone se two tons of rumors about that
maybe we'll see something like that in
March I think the thing about the iPhone
se - there's still such a we get we get
questions about it all the time I know
it's like it's a pop what's going on
with the iPhone se and that money for an
inch form factor that people still love
people still want that we I'm gonna
assume that we see it sometime this year
but I think the big thing is that this
se - because of just how how its
advanced if you look at the current
iPhone se it feels like I mean it's
basically like the iPhone 5 design so
there's no way in time much was a good
which is good there's just no way in my
mind that it would ever look the same
like the iPhone se - would at least be a
modernized looking thing I'm gonna throw
it out there
by the time and this has come out touch
IDs you know force touch might be in
that screen but I think they just need
to release a refreshed iPhone se - it's
been a popular phone it surprised Apple
how well it's sold it surprised them how
well it did yeah definitely so there's
no reason not to do this even though I
think the last time they showed their
product line it was like again it was
like a row of like six or seven
different phones I do miss that screen
size I mean but we go back with you go
back I would I mean I know it feels
small I knew like I'd take some getting
used to it be like this looks really
small but yeah you know after a while I
think I would just be fine with it again
cuz I had it for a couple years before
didn't have any problems with it
it was legit five years ago all right
I'm just messing around over the years
see I think people sometimes have a
complex when you make jokes about the
tech piece that they have and they take
it personally it's like it's not
personal no but everyone always gotta be
personal when it comes to saying a bad
thing about a product that they spent
money for I don't know why I'm still
trying to wrap my brain around that
because they're they're worried that
they made the wrong decision me but
that's fine but then why take it as a
personal attack I know like if I say
something bad about the home pod they're
like you're so negative I'm like I'm
actually just telling you the truth did
I ever say I hate it did I ever say it's
crappy no I just said it's not up to par
with what's out there
industry wise and yeah it'll probably
sound the best and according to all
reports it does sound the best yeah it
doesn't match up in terms of its brains
but in terms of its sound it's it's
superior but I still think my thx sound
that's what I'm saying about my thx
system at my home probable brighter yes
humble brag I also think my Dolby Atmos
sounds works around system probably
sounds better
probably humble brag with a 12 inch
subwoofer Wow yeah I think I got like a
yeah I think mine's like honestly I
don't even get to use it to its full
capacity I'm in an apartment people
complain when I dump that too hard I'm
in a townhouse I don't care I'll just
bump it I hear my neighbors sometimes
their bump in their movie yeah yeah
alright I have a lot of bumpin next door
oh right
whoa iPad news let's go oh yeah do you
believe this do you think true or false
the iPad was the top-selling tablet last
year what do you think I believe that
are you looking at the headline or not
no I'm not actually but there's another
question do you believe that the iPad
sold more units than Samsung and Amazon
combined or sold less that's a tough one
I think maybe they sold more you are
correct Stephen item because those other
there's other ones like you see those
Samsung tablets and the other tablets
they just look like toys they look like
things are gonna be in the garbage and
you know and then in the near future I
don't know they just don't look great
you know I'm not I'm not feeling it so
check this out research firm IDC
released their results based on data
that is again an estimate now here's the
thing we know actual ipad units sold
physically sold by Apple which totaled
forty three point eight million units in
2017 and forty eight forty three point
eight million now again
IDC is estimating Samsung and Amazon the
key thing about this is these are units
that Samsung and Amazon shipped shipping
means going to retail doesn't
necessarily mean 100% sell through
Samsung shipped twenty four point nine
million tablets last year and amazon
shipped sixteen point seven million
tablets last year if you combine those
totals that's forty one point six
million which is two point two million
lower than iPad sales so while the
industry continues to shrink Apple's
iPads pretty much stayed flat which is a
good thing because the overall market
decline six point five percent and again
you know one of my favorite toys iPad
pro I had Pro and the iPads they last
forever to like my aren't using like
your iPad like my three is still rockin
dude like got no issues that's what I'm
talking about
it's legit another story that just came
out this week a rig in regards to the
new iPad pro that will again most likely
see sometime this year we know that
everyone has kind of already talked
about how it's most likely gonna have
some level of face ID and minimum bezels
Apple three and Apple engineers
applied for a new patent that was just
surfaced that could indicate how the
Apple pencil will evolve we don't know
if this is gonna come this year it could
be down the road it could be never but
this new patent showcases and features
an Apple pencil or a stylus basically
that can be used outside the confines of
an actual iPad so it can be used on a
laptop screen or on a desktop screen
which okay fine whatever wheel I know
the microwave touchscreen MacBooks I'm
just saying the patent indicates it
could be used though oh wait are they
changing their tune over there at Apple
with an apple with a stylus though with
a stylus I don't not not I mean a pencil
not a stylus Oh a pencil now here's the
other thing that makes this cool
according to the patent application
there's going to be motion and
orientation sensors in this stylus even
something along the lines of a camera
who knows not like a camera to take
pictures per se but we kind of jokingly
like to call them for sensors which
would allow also this Apple pencil to be
used completely on a different surface
like a table or on paper so it could be
gamified they're gonna try to gamify
this thing yeah I just could be like a
like a almost like a gaming remote like
a controller you know or we like a Wii
Remote or sumter or or this could just
be the first steps to be like yeah there
is gonna be an actual iPhone note no
this is gonna revolutionize pictionary
I'm excited it's the best pencil you've
ever used the world's smartest pencil
the world anyways that is a pan and we
don't it doesn't mean it's actually
happening but there's always kind of
some cool fun Nuggets just to see like
what Apple is doing with tech when you
talk about that stuff all right um
that's kind of the meat potatoes of the
stories let's we got the calls
positional love again remember the
number is
I still got music playing that's fine
I'm like I'm feeling a guy's been from
Indiana love the show I got a question
for you
seems like ever since iOS 11 my phone is
not done well with geofencing and
Bluetooth connection with my smart home
for example I have key those smart locks
I'm supposed to be able to tap the lock
in is supposed to unlock or lock the
door
geofencing for arming security cameras
for turning my lights on and off with if
this than that
just various things with my smart home
it just seems like that there isn't good
recognition of the location services to
make those things happen just wondered
if you guys have noticing any of that as
a problem with iOS 11 it seemed like
with iOS 10 it was perfect it worked
great so wonder what you thought thanks
a lot appreciate it
I mean I think what I experienced I
haven't experienced what you have but
the biggest thing is when iOS 11 came
the table all of a sudden my Bluetooth
stopped working the same way with my
home theater where you know I just pump
Bluetooth audio into it and also even
connecting to not my car but my
girlfriend's car like for whatever
reason it stopped and so I had to repair
that connection in the car fine but it
didn't it still doesn't work the same
way it does before it's it's not as
consistent I had to actually update the
software on my receiver home receiver
audio receiver in order for it to see
the Bluetooth again which I thought that
was weird I'm like what it's just blue
too so I once iOS 11 hit some of those
devices that I work with and that I
connect with they had problems and some
of them aren't acting the same so I got
imagine other people are having similar
issues as well because it's not just
isolated to me in uber oh I wouldn't
know because I'm still on ten hey oh
okay smart guy
let's smarts guy my wife updated and
then she started reporting all these
problems I was just like I'm not gonna
I'm not gonna do this don't do it oh
okay here we go let's go next call hey
guys here's one from Orlando Florida
just wanted to give a call guys and so
you guys are doing I just wanted to say
Brian businesses for Brian I love how I
love how you when the air pods came out
you said oh my god they're so hard to
get and now the whole pod comes out and
you're like complaining that you can get
it right now so just make up your mind
you know you complain for having it now
and completely I'm not having it I'll
just mission around I'm very excited for
the home part actually I have Lex at
home but every time I get visitors I
always play with her all the time and
kind of always me sometimes that you can
respond to anybody commands but Siri on
the home part like I carry my phone to
see the only responses to my command so
when I say hey Siri she will respond I
would everybody says
hey Siri she only responds that to me
and I like that feature a lot so
hopefully the home pod or will still
have that though she will only respond
to my voice not to anybody else voice
but uh just about thank you so much guys
I love the show keep up the good work
I get a sense that he's very possessive
of his technology yeah he wants a very
obediently he only talks to me she only
talks to me no one else just me just me
don't talk to them only me now we know
that Siri cannot support multiple users
so the thing about the home pod is that
she is actually made to respond to
multiple people so I don't know if that
same voice coding like you said right we
know it if I say the magic words to my
phone
technically based on how I trained it it
shouldn't set off someone else's phone
but with the home pod it's actually
supposed to be able to respond the
multiple people just not be able to
identify multiple people from each other
but uh you know if you don't have any
friends then Siri will only talk to you
anyways it's true true true that but uh
also I wasn't complaining about the
availability of the products I'm just
making a point yeah home pods not sold
out after two weeks now they finally are
four days out but that tells you
something about the demand for a product
the home pod was not sold out after it
was also delayed for a long time brand
that air pods were delayed also but they
were sold out for literally almost a
year they were sold I'm not a year not a
year let me take that back they came out
in late December and up to like July
August they were still had a for four to
six weeks shipping time on Apple's
website and that's right because the
iPhone 10 came out and their air pots
are not available when the iPhone 10
came out that is correct yeah see that's
what he's talking about
you would complain about that too bro
yes okay next call here we go
God once more like hey guys this is Paul
I was calling about the Apple home pod
and I was wondering why they didn't put
it on some type of space that's almost
like a wireless charger and you can
actually take it outdoors with you if
you want to go barbecue outside in the
backyard or something just wondering why
they didn't think of that
love your product I love your show and
watching it right now
thanks for everything guys you guys have
a great one bye-bye
I'll tell you why they didn't do that
home pod to
it's like come on home pot - no that's a
great idea I didn't know you couldn't
unplug it and take it places yeah it's
it's it's you know they got rid of the
headphone jack but they still got the
power jack
cuz I thought in that Diplo video he was
like carrying it around and moving it
around oh that was that was the Google
that's a Google one
oh but also but also Google the Google
Max's tethered down just like rotating
and stuff some of the some of the mobile
ones that let's see you don't uh the
boat the boat Bose has a speaker that
actually sounds really good that's kind
of like a mini looks like a mini lantern
that's completely uh not Wireless but
you can take it around you wherever you
want to go someone in the chatroom is
saying the home pod is sold out now
what's a way yes correct for teh wait in
the US it is a four day way we yeah we
mentioned that earlier in the show but
they are correct there's a four day wait
in the US but until yesterday it was
still readily available and it was on
pre-order for two you had two weeks to
preorder it cool and then we'd also
don't know how many units they actually
produced of that yeah I mean whether
they did ten million five million I
doubt they did millions I think I think
I I could see them do like 5 million
exam they could make whatever they want
they're sitting on 280 plus billion
dollars of cash they could literally do
anything they want that's an ocean of
cash okay here we go
my name is keno and I want to know has
Apple lost it
what's wrong with their products now how
come they're so expensive why are they
so buggy
that's my question thanks I don't know I
I don't we're not gonna date look if you
listen to our show every week you kind
of I think we've made it pretty clear
it's not the same company and all those
questions that you had have been
answered multiple times we just liked
how your call sounded yeah it sounded
great it's like did why are they so
buggy I think it was this inner
monologue just coming out and like this
nice rhythm yeah you put a nice like
space in between each question like why
and it was at keno or keno because you
know you know my name is no no you know
that's a Vegas I believe Beno was the
name of Ernie knows at keno or key knew
not Keanu I think it was keno was the
name of Ernie Ray's Junior's character
and teenagers been to Ninja Turtles too
you know I'll keep you Rufio no Rufio is
dante basco sometimes people think that
I'm Rufio but I'm not I'm gonna lick
this up while we listen the next call
I'm gonna confirm Ernie Ray's unit was
key knew in teenage girls do secret of
the news we got a teenage me a ninja
turtle reference and a hook reference
next call this one's real short hi my
name is max I'm from Texas I was just
wondering if we'd be able to use dual
home pods as a stereo speaker set for
Apple TV viewing so that's the idea
right they wanted to be stereo but we
just don't know about Apple T it'll come
it'll come down to airplay to quite
honestly something tells me that you can
but I honestly I don't know this for a
hundred percent sure I can't even
remember I can't remember if that was
part of it
there there is no actual you know we
don't have to worry about physical
connections because all the air all the
audio is being streamed through their
airplay to protocol and airplay so I'm
gonna say yeah but we'll find out it
would mean if it's look they're so
dedicated to that ecosystem that it
would be silly for them not to now
whether it's available it's not going to
be available now per se but uh I'm gonna
say yeah because they've been they kept
it so locked in I don't know if
someone's even looking at the that's the
spec sheet right now or knows off the
top of their head but I can't remember
that one specifically for sure or not
okay
all right we will find out if I'll fine
I'll try and find out too okay keep next
up here we go hey Apple bike nation this
is pre Samuel so I'm just calling in
regards to the air power and Airport
just wanted to check when the any rules
or any anticipated date when the air
power is gonna come because Apple just
mentioned it's gonna come sometime in
2018 and then in regards to the airport
they mentioned something like optional
wireless charging case and then there's
also talked about an airport
second-generation
two are both these things referring to
the same thing so I just wanted to know
your thoughts and things like that and
have a discussion about it thank you bye
okay Beach I was reading up I am DB to
confirm what I thought was correct so
was he asking about her plan their pod -
yeah the charging case the wireless
charging case like when is it high in
the air pod 2.0 yeah okay so we did talk
about that early in the show that March
is our guess but we honestly really
don't know can i really just quickly on
a tangent since it's towards the end the
show during I call section please this
is how good my frickin brain is Ernie
Ray's jr. was Kino
not kinu keno just like our caller and
if you didn't know Ernie Ray jr. was
also inside the Donatello suit but he
wanted more face time so when she needs
me Ninja Turtles - yes - have a roll oh
he's like the kids that like trying to
join there go and there's a point where
um who gets kidnapped one of them gets
kidnapped than here so like run to them
to get their ten he's like Raph dude
it's me Kito like he's trying to get
there I can't this is this is way too
much information that no one cares about
except maybe me yeah and he was like
stalking the turtles while they're like
he fighting crime and then he would like
jump in and help them they're like what
are you doing yeah dude he also has a
martial arts like studio called I think
yeah I'm gonna stop now he's probably
cause like I'm something of a bromance
bromance crush on him this is really has
tons of turtle memorabilia at his uh at
his karate school this is awkward
uh yes I just wanted to confirm here the
home pod can be connected to Apple TV
using airplay nice just wanna let y'all
know it won't do stereo yet but it can
connect your Apple TV but eventually
we'll get the stereo yeah so all you
rich college kids you get a home pod for
your speaker system congratulations
thanks seriously seriously brah the best
congratulations I've heard in a while
okay here we go next last call this is
the last one in addition song it's dated
from Maryland again I just want to leave
another another thought that I had or I
wanted to get your thoughts on this I've
read some articles that Apple was maybe
thinking I mean rumors that they might
be thinking about purchasing a Netflix
or something like a Tesla to just you
know get Apple into a better space in
that area I personally would love if
they bought a Netflix just because I
feel like they could do a lot with the
content that they already have and they
just haven't done a lot with Apple TV I
was always expecting Apple TV to be
servus you know an all-in-one service
the papal coffer where I could use for
may be streaming instead of cable I mean
also original content so let me know
what your thoughts are on that
thanks guys love the show right yeah you
know we haven't touched upon this for a
while but we've pretty much made it
clear historically through this show I
think it was back in 2015
2014 to 2015 when Apple was working
rumblings were that they were working on
a TV streaming service to get out there
to the masses but what Apple did is
because there can you know they're brash
and they're cocky they wanted to set the
terms while doing this the studios were
like no what are the ones that control
the content will tell you how much you
know we'll charge for this content
apples like no give us the best deal
where Apple while this is happening all
the TV networks and studios and media
conglomerates decided to hey these are
these are our terms to other companies
so what did you see sling TV PS view
AT&amp;amp;T DirecTV now all these other
services now we have Hulu TV YouTube TV
all these other companies were able to
lock down deals for their own TV
streaming service and Apple couldn't do
it and it's it would it's a pure revenue
stream source Apple wanted to be hey we
dictate the terms they guess what it
worked back when the music industry was
collapsing and trying to figure out ways
to make money you know arguably Apple
helped usher in the generation of music
being digital for better or for worse
for the records for better for worse for
the record but Apple has no TV streaming
service they have no revenue from that
there's always been talks about Apple
then looking to buy Netflix I would love
for them to buy Netflix keep it the same
integrate it into their system and then
just throw in additional content that
Apple offers but they Apple can afford
it but they aren't doing it I think if
there's anything we'd see it would be
that but we wouldn't see Apple do
anything with Tesla yes Tesla actually
just announced like I think last night
that they lost like 600 million dollars
last year or something so that wouldn't
be a good buy for Apple even if I turn
it around even if
I wanted to you have to remember just
it's not always even about the dollars
with these deals it's about philosophies
Elon Musk is our generations Steve Jobs
oh yeah he wants everything open and why
woody lawn my let Apple by his company
at least today unless he's extremely
extremely desperate and needs the cash
for his vision to succeed he has his
hands in so many amazing projects he
doesn't need Apple again right now maybe
we look back at this two three four or
five years from now rewinding you hear
me saying this that's why I have to
preface it right now but Elon Musk is
his own dude he's not gonna be a guy
where Apple purchases him and then
boughs down to what Apple asks him to do
now that he's he said publicly that the
person that takes over the company after
he's gone they have to have the same
philosophy everything needs to be open
source people need to be able to have
access to all is it and that's why he
gives away all those information for
free like the what is it the the thing
that goes underground I figure what it's
called it's not led yet what is it
called I know not the hyper tuned the
hyper the Hyperloop Hyperloop he put
that all out he put all his plans out
there in public like free for everyone
to use and go build it you know an Apple
does not do stuff like that ever
another funny thing that you say about
Elon Musk oh he says oh um you know
you've got to have the same mind the
same passion yet there's only one Elon
Musk so he's odd no one's filling that
spot anytime soon dude so inflamed for
the throwers right now for 500 bucks
apiece yeah sold out
I mean look Steve Jobs successor to
Apple was Tim Cook
Elon Musk he's not gonna hire a Tim Cook
for him nowhere he's not he's not he's
not well that's all she wrote man we are
done okay everybody thanks so much for
hanging again you know we keep it under
an hour for you guys so I'm sorry if
your commute is longer than an hour
I'm not gonna we're not gonna go longer
than an hour we try not to no we try to
keep it tight for y'all thanks so much
