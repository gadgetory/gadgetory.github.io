1998 yes with the Bondi blue I managed
in fact this really relaunched all of
our products the way we make products
how innovative they are how incredible
the designs are it also Pitta mised
something out with us so well to create
a breakthrough innovative product and
then through the years relentlessly keep
updating it with the latest technology
to push it as far as the technology
allows we've had seven generations of
iMac each one better than the last so
that's why it's so great today for you
to be the first to see the next
generation of iMac and here it is
it is absolutely beautiful
it is stunning from every side edge to
edge glass that amazingly thin edge we'd
like to see one in person I hope so as
we have one right here so this is the
brand-new iMac it is absolutely
incredible the most beautiful neck we
have ever made just want to get a look
at how thin it is I turn it just a
little bit look at that edge just
remarkable how thin that design is
there's an entire computer in here it's
hard to believe this even just a display
in here all right let me tell you a lot
more about it that edge is five
millimeters thin that is 80% thinner
than the previous generation and it
extends the entire length all the way
down to this area at the bottom we
lovingly call this the chin now that
this enclosure is made of two parts that
chin and that entire big aluminum back
and they're put together previously with
some advanced laser welding but this is
so thin we want to do something even
more incredible the engineering team use
a technology you may not have heard of
it called friction stir welding this is
unbelievable the actual molecules of the
aluminum emerged together between the
two components to make one piece that
are super-strong and nearly seamless the
lengths they will go to to create these
products is astounding but how did we
make it that fan well to explain it let
me bring back up the previous generation
isn't it amazing how something new makes
the previous thing instantly look old
it's incredible well let's look inside
and take it apart a bit the first thing
the team did was engineer an entirely
new display that's five millimeters
thinner that's a huge difference and if
you ever look closely at the previous
generation there's a very thin air gap
between the display in the front glass a
two millimeter air gap or we've removed
that as well by laminating the display
directly to the glass this was a huge
challenge
we've never laminated its way this large
to glass but the benefits are huge the
entire display system is 45% thinner
that makes a big difference then we
remove the optical drive and completely
re-engineer all the internal components
to make something this amazingly thin
let's talk a little bit more about this
display the display comes in two sizes
21 and a half inch in 27 inch the
27-inch is 2560 by 1440 the 21 and a
half inch 1920 by 1080
they're both IPS panels for a beautiful
viewing angle and at full brightness
over 300 nits so beautifully bright and
we said that's fully laminated besides
making it thin the full lamination
delivers another benefit when you look
at it the text and graphics will look
like they're sitting right on top of the
glass because they're right that close
and it improves the optical quality and
then we also apply an anti-reflective
coating to the display but we wanted to
make it even purer even thinner even
higher quality image image quality and
we use it new technology for us called
plasma deposition you can go home and
tell people today I heard about plasma
deposition it allows us to apply the
anti-reflective coating down to an in
and meter thickness and the combination
of all this hard work is really simple
customers are gonna appreciate that it
is 75% less reflection than the previous
generation that's a really big deal
and to top it off these displays are
beautiful they're each individually
calibrated on the manufacturing line
with a spectral radiometer it is very
very cool some of the other features is
a FaceTime HD quick camera for 720p dual
microphones and stereo a stereo sound
system that sounds even better than the
previous generation which is so hard to
achieve because this has 40% less volume
than the previous generation it also
sheds up to 8 pounds over the previous
generation pretty remarkable and again
like the MacBook Pro so much work has
gone on on the inside I'm very happy to
show you what that looks like there is a
serious computer inside this thin design
here are some of the elements of it
Intel quad core i5 or i7 Ivy Bridge
processors Nvidia discreet Kepler
graphics Wi-Fi bluetooth you can have
either up to seven and sixty eight
gigabytes of flash or up to three
terabyte hard drive and up to 32
gigabytes of memory that's twice as much
as before so much work has gone into
fitting all of that inside a computer
this then turns of i/o a headphone port
SD card reader 4 USB 3 ports 2
thunderbolt and Gigabit Ethernet I want
to talk about storage just a little bit
more as I said customers can choose a
hard drive if they want and many
customers do because they want the
maximum capacity others choose flash
because that gives you maximum
performance in many cases up to 3 to 4
times faster at key tasks well with the
iMac as well as the Mac Mini we just
discussed we have a new third option for
you to choose it's called the Apple
fusion Drive what's the fusion drive
first
it's 128 gigabytes of flash storage and
added to that your choice either one or
three terabyte hard drive and in
software they're fused together into one
logical volume we do this so you can get
much faster reads and writes the hard
drive can but best of all it's built
into OS 10 mountain lion so it's
automatic there's nothing to set up
nothing
to manage nothing to do it just works so
how does it work well when you order
your iMac if you choose the fusion drive
you get it in this one drive made up of
both flash in the hard drive of course
the operating system entirely fits on
that flash so we keep it there for
maximum system performance in fact all
the software that comes pre-installed on
your iMac automatically fits in flash
and then as you load up applications and
documents or migrate in the from a
previous computer will fill up all the
space and use the storage you have and
then automatically as you're using your
computer oh it's tens fusion drive is
figuring out what you use the most and
what will benefit from being on flash so
for example if you don't use iMovie very
often but you use a lot of high-powered
numbers spreadsheets it might move those
on the flash or perhaps you use aperture
not iPhoto well to move on a pitcher
into flash and run it from there as well
all transparently from from you you just
use it it works and so how does it
perform while using that aperture
example when common tasks and apertures
to import photos if you use a hard drive
you get a certain speed and flash is
over three and a half times faster at
this task so how does the fusion drive
compare here's how it compares get near
the performance of flash with access to
all of that storage without having to do
anything else
so that's the fusion drawings the iMac
comes with a wireless keyboard and
wireless Magic Mouse of course many
customers also choose a wireless Magic
Trackpad as well and for those who still
are stuck in the past yes you can get an
optical drive we offer a great super
drive that plugs into USB there's a 21
and a half inch Mac that starts at a 2.7
gigahertz quad core i5 eight gigs of
memory the geforce GT 640 M that's a
kepler part in a terabyte hard drive for
just $12.99
of course you can you can make other
configurations if you'd like and these
start shipping next month in November
the 27 inch on that begins to the 2.9
gigahertz quad core i5 8 gigs of memory
geforce gtx 660 m a terabyte hard drive
for $17.99
and these start shipping and start
shipping about a month later in december
and again like all of our computers
incredibly environmentally friendly
energy star 5.2 EP gold and on and on
we've also engineered this new iMac to
even more energy-efficient uses up to
50% less power when sitting idle so
those are the new iMacs 21 a half inch
27 inch but perhaps the boldest new iMac
designs we've ever created and they
carry on this great tradition we call
iMac and that completes our
announcements for Mac</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
