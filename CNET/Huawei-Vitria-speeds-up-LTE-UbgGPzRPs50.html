taking a first look at the huawei
vitriol for MetroPCS there might be two
reasons you're interested in this phone
the first is that at $130 off contract
it is very affordable and the second
reason is because it does have 4G LTE
and metro pcs
is now using at least in some areas the
t-mobile network so 4G LTE is a lot
faster than you've ever seen in on a
metro phone before the specs themselves
aren't terribly exciting but it does all
hang together to give you an Android
experience there is Android 4.1 jelly
bean on this device has a four inch
screen colorful enough rich enough
definitely it's not going to distract
you is a little bit hard to read
outdoors and direct sunlight so find
yourself a little bit of shade the phone
itself has curved corners and a very
plain soft touch finish on the back that
makes it comfortable and easy to hold
the screen on the front does attract a
lot of smudges so you're gonna want to
keep a little wiping cloth handy at
almost 5 ounces the phone is rather
heavy but you will soon grow used to it
if you hold on to it long enough there's
a 5 megapixel camera on the back with
LED flash there's also autofocus which
is nice photos were pretty good and so
was the 720p HD video the audio pickup
in video capture mode wasn't that great
I could hear myself a lot better than I
could hear anybody else I was filming so
you'll want to get in close to your
subject on the front you'll find a very
basic of VGA camera there's a 1.2
gigahertz dual-core processor in here
sometimes performance was a little bit
laggy and I would see starts and
stutters for video playback and games I
did reboot the phone and that made
everything very smooth be prepared to
buy expandable memory for this there's
only four gigabytes of an internal
storage and you will only have access to
about two of those so you can get up to
32 gigabytes of expandable memory and I
recommend you get at least something
this phone isn't perfect it's not the
most beautiful you can get and there
were a couple of bugs but I think it was
a solid effort from Huawei and
definitely a phone that you can consider
if you're looking for something
affordable with LTE
