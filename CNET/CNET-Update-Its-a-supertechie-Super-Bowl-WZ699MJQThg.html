football I'm Bridget Carey this is your
C net update when you have the biggest
football game of the year being played
in the heart of Silicon Valley you know
it needs to handle an onslaught of
techies on Sunday at Levi's Stadium in
Santa Clara California
there will be 72,000 football fans that
want to tweet Facebook Instagram
snapchat periscope and peach their
hashtags Super Bowl 50 selfies and this
stadium will be ready opened in 2014
Levi's stadium is the most high-tech
football venue and for the big game it
is wired with 70 miles of Wi-Fi cabling
with one eret access point to every 100
seats within the bowl the stadium has
ten times more bandwidth than the NFL
mandates at other stadiums last year's
Super Bowl in Arizona saw six point four
terabytes of data transferred and this
year could easily surpass that and the
tickets not just to help get fans online
it's to help get them drunk there's an
app where fans can order drinks to be
delivered to their seats now if you're
one of the hundred and ten million
expected to watch the game on TV well
you can watch it for free the game is
broadcasted on CBS which is seen as
parent company and if you have it over
the air digital antenna you can pick it
up but it's also streaming live on the
CBS sports web site and the CBS sports
app and it's free to stream either if
you don't subscribe to cable of course
there are always some people who watch
the big game for the commercials
companies are spending as much as five
million dollars for a 30-second ad and
for the first time Amazon will have a
Super Bowl spot it's for the Amazon echo
smart speaker you'll see alec baldwin
and former Dolphins quarterback Dan
Marino interacting with Alexa which is
the personal assistant for the speaker
now if you're hosting a Super Bowl party
at your home I suggest you read up on
our guide on how to get your TV ready
and adjust the settings so the display
and the sound controls are primed for
maximum football enjoyment here's one
good tip you want to adjust the color
with green on the screen to make sure
it's not too dull yellow or vibrant
because green will be the most common
color you'll see in the game the movie
or cinema preset modes tend to be the
best for
than any other pitcher mode but if you
can't watch the game you don't have to
feel like you're missing out computers
have been working on simulating the
outcome the Madden NFL video game says
the Carolina Panthers will take home the
title against the Denver Broncos with
the score 24 to 20 they take the lead 17
to 0 at halftime and the Broncos come
back with 20 points with the Panthers
quarterback Cam Newton dives into the
end zone with only one minute left for
the game when he touchdown
the makers of the game Electronic Arts
have correctly guessed the winners nine
times out of the last 12 years and even
got last year's score exactly right
that's it for this tech news update and
there's more at sea Netcom from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
