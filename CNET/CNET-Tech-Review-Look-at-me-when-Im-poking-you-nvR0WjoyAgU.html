takes a poke at Facebook with Google+
and Facebook fights back with video
calling plus hot new headphones and
speakers for your auditory needs and
take control of your home computer using
your iPad it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the scene at tech review where we
collect our hottest videos of the week
and tell you what's good and what's bad
in the world of tech plus offer some
unique tech wisdom in the form of the
bottom line let's start with the good
since the end of last week the internet
has been abuzz with talk of Google's new
social networking platform called simply
enough Google+ now unless you're among
the lucky few who have been able to
score an invite you might have no idea
what everyone's talking about well
here's rafe needleman to help get you up
to speed Rafe Needleman here with the
first look of Google+ Google's Facebook
killer well not really but Google+ is
the search giant's latest major social
networking play and it's the first
product that may eventually just give
other social networks including Facebook
and Twitter a run for the money google
has clearly learned a lot from the
problems that affected earlier
experiments like orchid google buzz and
Google Wave the key social concept of
Google+ is the circle you can create
circles for the different parts of your
life your work your family your friends
your hobbies and it's easy to drag
people into circles and then to create
updates that just go to particular
circles or to all of them at once and
then to keep you from getting
overwhelmed by all your contact social
updates you can watch just what's
happening in particular circles by using
streams so if you're in the mood to see
what's going on with your family you
just check out your family stream the
ease with which you can shift in and out
of circles send updates to one or some
or all of them is Google pluses big
differentiator from both Facebook and
Twitter now Facebook in particular also
lets you send updates to particular
groups but in plus the whole setup is
around carefully directing updates to
particular groups it doesn't feel like
an afterthought like it does in facebook
google+ also has a very strong video
conferencing feature called hangout you
can create a video room and then invite
your friends from some or all of your
circles plus displays everyone's webcam
image at the bottom of the window and
autumn
matically shows a bigger video of
whomever is talking it's a seamless and
very powerful video experience we tried
it here and we were up and running and
having a natural conversation in moments
Plus also makes it really easy to share
photos it connects to picasa web albums
for instant sharing or you can easily
drag pictures from your computer into
your stream to share with your circles
and if your mobile there's a good mobile
web version of plus it has some features
that you don't get in the big web
version like location-based check-in and
the ability to see stream updates from
the friends that are closest to you but
it can't access the video hangout
features android users also get a nap
and iphone users will get the app later
all is not perfect in plus land though
adding people to your circles can be
time-consuming and a little confusing
especially if you're used to the more
monolithic social systems of Facebook or
Twitter it's not clear for example if
you add someone to a circle if you're
also added to one of theirs also
integration with other Google services
is so far incomplete for example if you
have a lot of contacts in say google
voice you might see all of those people
in google+ but not the categories or the
circles that you filed them under and if
you send a direct message to a user from
plus through the email feature and they
email you back it shows up in your gmail
viewer not in + + is big on privacy and
data ownership though which is a big
plus the whole idea of segregating your
updates into circles makes it much
easier in theory to control who sees
what of the things you post google is
also pushing pluses take out feature
that lets you export all the information
on plus to your own computer for use
however you want facebook finally has
this too but i was a very long time
coming if you want to get into + hit up
your friends there's big demand for
people to try the service and people who
are in it have been sending out a lot of
invitations google is only letting those
invitations go out in small batches for
the time being but they should start
flowing again soon it is unlikely the
Google+ will unseat Facebook as the
number one social network but it is a
worthy additional social service if
you're not already overwhelmed by having
to manage your connections in facebook
and twitter or linkedin and elsewhere
it's really worth a try when you can get
in
right needle with prasina now before you
all start writing in no I do not have
any invites to send you but the stay
tuned to seen at TV and we'll be sure to
share any sign of workarounds we come
across Plus tell you all the google plus
tips and tricks we can come up with of
course Facebook couldn't just lie down
and let Google get all the attention so
they scheduled a big surprise
announcement for Wednesday here's Rafe
again with a look at the new video
calling features you will soon find
inside Facebook home your hair and try
to look nice facebook is doubling down
on its person-to-person communication
tools it starts with the way you see
other online Facebook users everyone
using a computer with a large or a wide
screen will notice that Facebook has
taken the list of who's online and moved
it to a side part reinforcing the fact
that Facebook is a place to connect with
friends in real time not only does a
sidebar make Facebook feel more alive
but there's a bit more you can do with
your friends who are online with you in
particular video chat facebook has
partnered with skype and you can start a
person-to-person video call from within
a facebook webpage you do need to
install a small executable on your PC or
Mac but the key point is that you don't
need a client app this all works within
the browser it's fast and easy to get a
video call going even if in early
testing we did have some audio sync
problems but if you want to do video
chatting with friends or relatives who
aren't on skype or more technical
service like Google Facebook video is
just a great solution it is the easiest
online video system to use and it also
has the most users there are over 750
million people on Facebook there are a
few issues though first there's no
integration with skype even though the
technology comes from a Skype deal skype
users cannot connect to people on
facebook and or the other way this will
be added later and could make Facebook
and Skype together the most important
real-time communications network on the
planet but it's not here yet second
video conversations are person-to-person
only those of you waiting to see how
Facebook will trump Google's new
multi-person video hangout feature in
google plus keep waiting facebook video
is like Google Talk the person-to-person
video feature not it's cool new hangout
if you want to do video with a bunch of
people all at once stick to Google and
third there's no mobile access for the
video feature it's another feature
that's on the road map but at the moment
mobile buddies can't play along facebook
also just added a group chat feature so
you can huddle with a bunch of your
friends at the same time in a real-time
conversation other instant message
platforms have had group chat for a
while but again when you build a feature
into facebook all of a sudden everyone
is on it at once the group chat feature
is easy to use you just click the tool
icon and a person-to-person chat to add
additional people and Facebook will then
open up a new multi-party chat window it
can get a little hard to manage multiple
chat conversations and Facebook at once
though and with the multi-party chat
that might become an issue for heavy
users these new chat features are here
now and they're here for everybody
facebook isn't rolling them out in dribs
and drabs like that other service all
facebook users with cameras that is can
now do video calling and everyone can
participate in the group chats for cnet
I'm right new one so what's it going to
be skype via Facebook or hangouts in
Google+ either way it's about to get a
lot tougher to avoid talking to those
annoying people from high school that
you never knew in the first place and
now it's going to be face to face better
keep the makeup handy up next we've got
a couple of products for all of you
music and home theater fans out there
first up Justin you has a set of
headphones that aren't his editor's
choice distinction then Matthew miskovic
offers some big speakers with big sound
but a small price tag
if you're a DJ shopping for a stylish
new headset that performs just as well
as it protects III deserves your
attention I'm Justin new headphone
editor for cnet.com here with the first
look at the editors choice winning III
tma-1 DJ headphones so it's getting
harder and harder for headphones to
stand out with a unique look but the
tma-1 succeed where others fail by going
backward and pairing the physical design
down to a simple one piece look that not
only looks pretty cool but also serves a
protective function so you'll notice
that aside from these short spring coils
on the side there is no physical joints
to weaken their durability the
silhouette is much more subtle with a
blacked-out stealthy colorway and a wide
nylon headband with notched adjustable
ear cups are only critique with the
physical build is a lack of padding on
the underside of the headband which we
can imagine becoming an issue for DJ's
playing music all night the earcups also
follow a modular design and III gives
you an extra set of ear cushions that
are really easy to change out thanks to
the for nubs that just snap firmly
behind each cushion plate since the dual
40-millimeter drivers are protected
regardless you won't have to worry about
throwing the headphones into a bag while
you travel DJ headphones also need
specific details and III answers that
demand with a detachable rubber cable it
also has an extra coiled section for
more freedom of movement you'll notice
however that you can actually rotate the
ear cups for one-sided listening but the
materials themselves are so flexible
that you can bend them around
comfortably without worrying them
breaking the tma ones are closed back
headphones and their noise isolation
makes them a solid choice for DJs and
commuters alike some djs prefer bass
heavy headphones but we actually like
the tma ones for their natural wide
depth of sound and oral realism in
relation to the recorded tracks they do
have a considerable low-end punch but it
doesn't overpower the other instruments
and they can also handle very loud
volumes so we don't doubt their
performance for djs in nightlife
environment you can read all the details
and check out more pictures in our full
review on cnet com but that's going to
do it for me I'm Justin you these are
the editors choice winning III tma
on DJ headphones and that sounds good
too hey I'm Matthew miskovic at cnet com
and this is the pioneer SP PK 21 BS this
is a 5.1 speaker system and it's
available direct from pioneer for four
hundred dollars the two things you need
to know about these speakers is that
they sound incredible and as you can see
they're huge there are four satellite
speakers for the front and surrounds and
they come in at a little over a foot
tall the center channel is one of the
largest we've seen that nearly 20 inches
wide and it's not going to fit under
your TV so you need either a separate
cabinet or a shelf to put it on you also
see that it has a curved bottom so it
doesn't quite sit level but it doesn't
really affect its sound quality the
hundred watt subwoofer is actually
average sized for the system and it has
just a simple cube shape all the
speakers have a faux wood finish which
isn't quite nice as the high gloss
finishes available on some competitors
around back you'll find sturdy metal
speaker connectors that can accept
banana plug spades or bare wire now if
you're willing to put up with the size
of these speakers the payoff is that you
get the best sound quality we've heard
from a budget system like this the
Pioneer has no problem getting loud
without distortion and it delivers the
kind of powerful sound that you just
can't get on smaller systems even more
impressive is that it sounds great with
two channel music to which most buzzer
systems can't handle when we put it
head-to-head with the editors choice
award winning energy take plastic system
the Pioneer definitely had the edge at
higher volumes although to be fair it is
a much larger system so altogether if
you care more about sound quality than
style and you're on a budget the spp k21
BS is the hands-down best pic and an
outstanding value overall but if you're
looking at these speakers and you're
realizing they're just too big for your
room check out the smaller but still
excellent energy take classic system I'm
Matthew miskovic and this is the pioneer
spp k21
yes so whether you're on the road or in
your living room there is no excuse for
listening to muddy sound there's also no
excuse for listening to muddy sound
that's all so auto-tuned Britney Spears
but far be it for me to judge okay the
time has come for a quick break but
don't go too far we still have a lot
more tech review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good antuan goodwin
thanks so much of the contour plus HD
camera that he made it an editor's
choice and now you'll see why it's also
one of our favorite tools of the trade
the old contour HD 1080p that we usually
use to record the car tech podcast that
it's unfortunate demise beneath the
wheels of a moving vehicle we were rough
on these things but ouch so we needed a
new sports camera fortunately contour
the new top-of-the-line pro supermodel
that just might fit the bill I'm antuan
goodwin with cnet com let's take a first
look at the editors choice winning
contour plus HD sports camera the
contour plus doesn't look much different
from the rest of contours lineup it's
got the same sort of bullet camera form
factor but if you look closely you'll
see the differences for starters the
twin laser pointers have been removed
from the front to make room for an ultra
wide-angle lens with 170 degree viewing
angle the lens assembly now rotates 270
degrees rather than the old 180 allowing
the unit to be mounted upside down if
necessary as always using the contour
plus as easy as powering it up and
sliding the record slider forward to
start recording and back when you're
done video is recorded either at 1080p
HD at 30 frames per second or in 720p HD
at up to 60 frames per second however
the plus has a few new tricks up its
sleeve including a still photo mode that
captures 5 megapixel pictures and 22 60
second intervals which is great for time
left photography the unit also features
a new microphone input and an hdmi video
output that can be used to send live
video to an external source beneath the
raised record slider is a GPS receiver
that keeps track of the latitude
longitude elevation and speed of the
unit while recording a feature that
comes into play a little bit later
there's also an internal Bluetooth
antenna under that hump that allow the
unit to connect to an iPhone now why
would you want to connect a camera to an
iPhone well the contour plus
lacks a viewfinder but when you use the
contour at on your iPhone the handset
can show what the camera sees so you can
line up your shot perfectly before you
hit the record button the app will also
let you adjust the settings of the
camera to switch between its various
recording modes and adjust exposure and
microphone gain on the fly once you're
done recording contour also provides its
storyteller software which can be used
to download the videos from the contour
plus and to trim longer videos to
highlight just the most awesome parts if
you've recorded GPS data the storyteller
software can also show you on a live
google map where you were when you did
your recording with speed and elevation
data when you're happy with your video
you can upload it to contour stories
video sharing site with that map data
intact or export the video for uploading
to for example YouTube now your contour
won't compact this elegantly we're being
a bit theatrical here but it will ship
with these accessories including an hdmi
cable a microphone adapter cable a mini
USB cable a rubber lens cap and three
adhesive mounts unlike the previous
contour models that we've tested the
plus does not ship with a head strap or
goggle mount for most of our testing
though we use our trusty pen of ice
suction cup mount which is actually sold
separately it's five-hundred-dollar MSRP
may be a bit of a turn-off for some but
if you want the absolute best as far as
ease of use fantastic video quality and
compact size we're picking the contour
plus as our editors choice out of the
current crop of sports cameras I've been
antuan goodwin check out the full review
of the contour plus over on cnet com
and there you have it a little peek
behind the scenes of how some of our car
tech videos get made and I wonder if
that means our car tech producer Mitch
can write off his iphone now too all
right now as promised it is time to
complete Brian coolies iCloud top five
double header as we move along to the
bad last week Brian brought us the top
five things Apple's iCloud service gets
right well now it's time to burst some
bubbles and count down the ways I cloud
comes up short
Apple's iCloud it's what jesus uses well
as with all things apple maybe it's not
quite as good as the hype I'm Brian
Cooley with the top five things icloud
needs before it can part waters number
five it works with Windows but not for
you iCloud doesn't work with windows XP
just Vista and 7 the problem is
according to most surveys XP is still
the most popular Windows version out
there whoops number 4 photostream this
feature promises to be complicated a
thousand of your latest pictures are
synced on all your devices but that can
be made broader if you manually add them
to albums except with advice that took
the image originally which always has it
and meanwhile 30 days with the photos
are stored on the iCloud servers but all
your photos are kept on the desktop you
sync to really number three no sharing
I'm an only child of this one bothers me
I cloud is largely a sinking thing not a
sharing service like a Dropbox that
means this isn't a big hard drive in the
sky and you sort of got to keep your
hands off it most users will be okay
with this but a lot of sophisticated
users won't be good and support both
number two installed applications you
still need them hi welcome to the 90s
I'm Brian I'll be your server tonight
itunes and i work are still not cloud
apps only their data made that move and
apparently mobileme is losing its web
interface as well that means you can't
just plop yourself down in front of any
browser and get your stuff Google may
not be losing a ton of sleep but the
number one thing we think I cloud needs
or are we at least we're hoping it was
going to get is streaming it's not their
iCloud syncs your music on all your
devices but the files all still live on
your devices you're never streaming your
stuff from the cloud purely the way
Pandora Rhapsody Amazon Google mog and
just about everybody else is doing now I
get it apples in the business of selling
new devices that hold stuff but this
one's starting to feel a little stale
thanks to cnet's josh lowensohn for his
help doing this list together and make
sure you check out his piece on making
the
from mobileme to iCloud we've got a link
to that at top 5 cnet com where you'll
find more episodes like this I'm Brian
Cooley thanks for watching seriously
there's still no streaming so if you
take the time to wait for a movie to
download to one device you have to wait
just as long for it to transfer over to
another one so much for on-demand
viewing although I might just have an
alternative in this week's bottom line
our how-to video this week features a
couple of tips to help you take control
of a remote computer with your iPad
let's see if Sharon Vaknin can help us
with that streaming problem even though
your iPad lets you tons of great stuff
when you're out and about there are
plenty of reasons why you might want to
access your home computer instead I'm
Sharon Vaknin for cnet com with an easy
way to control any computer with your
iPad
first of all if your mom is always
asking you for tech support it might
just be easier to take control for
computer instead to do this I'm going to
use a free program called teamviewer any
computer you want to control needs to
have his program installed and it's
compatible with mac and pc go to
teamviewer.com and download the program
on your computer when you open it you'll
see an ID and password we'll come back
to that in a second now go to your iPad
and get the free app from the app store
launch it and enter the ID and password
from your computer hit connect and watch
the magic happen you'll see a helpful
screen with gesture tips for instance
use one finger as your mouse pointer
drive with two fingers to scroll pinch
to zoom and double tap and drag to move
windows so now you can show your mom or
friend how to change a setting or maybe
even send yourself a file from your
computer but what if you want to
actually stream media from your computer
to your iPad remotely instead of taking
up space on your iPad by storing movies
on it you can stream from your desktop
computer with air video go to end method
calm then downloads and grab the air
video server for Mac or PC open it and
you'll see a window where you can add
folders you want to share with your iPad
it's pretty neat because you can even
share itunes playlists right here now go
to the remote tab and check enable
access from internet also make sure
automatically map port is checked make
note of the pin and will be using it in
a sec next head over to settings and
check require password make sure you set
a strong one unless you want to give
hacker as a free pass to your computer
finally make sure the server is turned
on now head over to your iPad and
download the air video app which is
actually compatible with all iOS devices
hit the plus button and select enter
server pen enter that pin you noted from
the remote tab and you'll be given
instant access to videos on your
computer just remember that your remote
computers will need to stay on and
connected to the internet for this to
work and that if your iPad isn't
connected to Wi-Fi while doing this
you're definitely hogging your data
usage as for streaming music check out
my video on how to string
music from the cloud on iOS devices and
if you have any questions come ask me on
my facebook page and visit how to
cnet.com for more videos like this for
cnet I'm Sharon Vaknin and i'll see you
on the interwebs the bottom line this
week no mom your computer isn't taunted
I'd suggest that you tell someone that
you're going to steal control of their
computer with your iPad first and of
course one downside of this tech support
technique is that it's not going to help
with one of our biggest problems the
relative space why their computer won't
connect to the internet in the first
place all right folks that's our show
come back next week for an all-new cnet
tech review until then there are tons of
videos available every day at seen on TV
com see you next time and thank you for
