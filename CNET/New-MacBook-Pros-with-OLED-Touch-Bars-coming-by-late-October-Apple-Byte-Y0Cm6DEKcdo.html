welcome to the Apple why for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and we start the show with the new
macbooks and according to MacRumors
Apple is likely aiming for a late
October launch for the redesigned
macbook pro with rumoured OLED touch bar
and touch ID sensor now the report says
Apple is moving quickly with development
work on Mac OS 10.2 point one with its
main focus on preparing the operating
system to support the new hardware
features of the new macbook pro apple
will seed one more beta version of Mac
OS 10 12 14 public beta testing next
week finalizing it to them be loaded
onto the new hardware apples also said
to be shifting to the Polaris and the
graphics chip on the higher end 15 inch
models plus new MacBook Airs with USB
seaports and new imacs with an AMD
graphics chip that are expected before
the end of the year now there are still
no rumors surrounding the Mac Pro and
mac mini that are still desperately in
need of new updates and in products of
the future that you know i really want
to see bloomberg reports Apple is
pushing forward with development of
their own echo like smart home device
based on this eerie voice assistant the
project started more than two years ago
and is now in the prototype testing
phase think of it as Apple's own Amazon
echo and the device is designed to
control appliances locks lights and
kearns via voice activation now to
differentiate from the competition apple
smartphone device will have more
advanced microphones and speaker
technology even including prototypes
that are using facial recognition
sensors it would also be able to process
siri commands so you can read emails
text messages tweets and stream content
from Apple music the project hasn't been
finalized and could still be scrapped
but they need something like this like I
love my echo and one made for the Apple
ecosystem you know it could be really
special for Apple users now the big a is
also looking to expand the reach of
health kit for the Apple watch to be a
diagnosis tool giving advice for users
doctors and others according to
Bloomberg the team is working on new
apps for the Apple watch such as a sleep
tracker app and one that measures a
user's fitness level by measuring the
time it takes for the heart rate to fall
from its peak level to resting level the
goal for apple's medical technology team
is to turn the Apple watch into a tool
that improve the diagnosis of your
health and can then be easily
transferred over to physicians on site
easily really the next step is to prove
that the data being collected is
reliable and can be used to be really
helpful for doctors and a JD Power
customer satisfaction survey has ranked
Apple music as the highest in overall
customer satisfaction among the seven
main music streaming brands based on
about 4,500 people who have paid for a
music service in the last six months
scores were based on performance and
reliability ease of use cost of service
content communication and customer
service Apple scored the highest with a
score of 8 34 out of 1000 Rhapsody had
an 8 26 Pandora and 825 and Spotify at
824 so really there's barely a
difference between services two through
four but title wasn't even included on
this the survey also found that
exclusive content improves customer
advocacy of a service so again where was
title also in music drake's album views
recently became the first to surpass of
1 billion streams on Apple music and
they celebrated by giving him this nice
plaque Congrats drizzy drake you know we
also celebrated a song from that album
last year you used to make the greatest
iPhone innovation number
also a Business Insider report claims
Apple is using an office in Israel to
develop hardware for the rumored iphone
8 according to an employee at the site
now this could really be any part of the
phone but we've heard all the rumors
about the edge-to-edge glass display
with a fingerprint sensor embedded into
it calling it the iphone 8 though is
kind of suspect considering Apple would
have to change their naming conventions
by skipping the 7s name but if they make
a jump they should just go directly to
iPhone X you know for the 10th
anniversary if you ask me so come on
stay with me iphone X sounds cool huh
we've also talked about this for several
weeks but in a report for motherboard
Apple Genesis are saying that Apple
knows about the iphone 6 is touch
disease but won't admit it publicly it's
the engineering flaw that has made too
many to count i phone sixes touch
displays completely inactive and
unresponsive to touch now that many of
these phones are out of warranty it
costs three hundred and twenty nine
dollars to make the repair on site
there's a class action lawsuit with more
than 6,500 people who have contacted law
firm about it so keep on ignoring the
Apple because until you acknowledge that
issue that's a bad apple very bad and if
you want to see the genius patent Apple
is working on feast your eyes on this
it's one of apple's latest innovations a
paper bag see apple store bags currently
tend to be a little flimsy and according
to this patent application the paper bag
may include a bag container formed of
white solid bleach sulfate paper with at
least sixty percent post-consumer
content Thank You Apple this bag will
most definitely improve the quality of
my life it is real innovation all right
that's going to do it for this week's
show you can email us at the apple byte
at cnet com or tweet me up brian Tong a
so much for watching timile catch you
all next time for another bite of the
Apple ever since that SJ left us poor I
for watching doing what I hope for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
