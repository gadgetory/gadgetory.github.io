and it's time to get loaded and gadget
is reporting that a new Apple TV could
cost ninety nine dollars and run the
iphone four point oh operating system it
also may not have very much internal
storage meaning it would be cloud-based
much like the Roku where you stream your
movies and TV shows from the internet
rather than from the device engadget
says they have this from a source close
to Apple but we may not have to wait
long for confirmation Steve Jobs takes
the stage at the Apple Developer
Conference in less than two weeks and
Motorola is betting big on Google's
Android operating system and verizon's
network the wall street journal reports
that motorola has an agreement with
verizon that motorola android phones
will be heavily promoted motorola has
two new Android phones coming out in
July on verizon one of which could be
the droid shadow which is the second
generation droid and Android users can
now listen to Sirius XM satellite radio
on the go the app just launched today in
the android marketplace you do have to
have a subscription to Sirius XM but if
you don't you can listen in for free for
seven days and Sony is showing off an o
LED screen that you can roll up like a
scroll we don't exactly know how it
works or if and when we'll see it or
even how we'll use it but it sure does
look neat those are all your headlines
for now we will be off next monday due
to the holiday but we'll be back on
tuesday so have a great memorial day
weekend thank you for watching I'm
Natali del Conte we've seen at TV
