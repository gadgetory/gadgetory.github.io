manufacturers have their own Android
wear smartwatches so standing out from
the crowd isn't easy by equipping its
SmartWatch 3 with built-in GPS Sony is
hoping its first Android wear device
will catch at least a few eyes now
having built-in GPS allows the watch to
track your route on a run without
needing to be tethered to your phone
actually the first Android wear
SmartWatch to have GPS built in or the
others require you to carry your phone
with you while jogging which can be a
little cumbersome you can store music on
the watch too to play with a pair of
Bluetooth connected headphones so you
can actually head out to exercise using
only the watch it's clearly then aimed
at the fitness fanatics among you which
may go some way to explain it it's plain
rather design which does look far less
stylish than round watchers particularly
the LG G watch R it doesn't explain
however why it doesn't feature a
heartrate monitor as you'll find on most
of its rivals now that seems like an odd
omission for something geared towards
fitness I just running Android wear the
interface is identical to other
smartwatches around you'll see cards
popping up giving notifications about
the weather steps you've taken and will
display incoming calls and text from
your phone as well the 1.6 inch display
is sharp but it has very poor colors and
bad viewing angles too which does make
it much less pleasant to look at rather
more vivid G watch are all the Samsung
gear live the watch itself is waterproof
you can swap out the strap and best of
all it has the USB port built into it so
you don't need to carry a separate
charging cradle to charge it that's
particularly handy as the battery isn't
really up to much in general use you
should expect to get about a day of use
but you'll certainly want to charge it
every night
in general the SmartWatch 3 doesn't
really impress due to its poor screen
its uninspiring square design and its
lack of the heart rate monitor still it
is the only Android wear device with
built-in GPS making it worth checking
out if for some reason you desperately
want to track your running distance but
cannot bear to carry your phone with you
