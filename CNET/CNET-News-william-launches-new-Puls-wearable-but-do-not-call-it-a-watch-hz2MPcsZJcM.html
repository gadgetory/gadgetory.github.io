it and I am here with will.i.am to
showcase off his pulse you don't you
don't call it smart watching a connected
device well what do you like to call it
well it's not a watch one it's a device
on your wrist called the pulse um it's
not a watch because watches don't have
SIM cards so so and it's not a
SmartWatch it's a whole new thing that's
it it's a new paradigm a new category
called a pulse over here your
notifications are here your navigation
is here ok so you just got imagine you
have three things here and notifications
here that's that simple and up here is
going up and down are your in apps so to
travel from here you get your note your
little in that menu go to notifications
cliff achill some cool features like
vibe the vibe is a app that way that's
baked into the OS the vibe can plug into
if you choose to your call so you could
I can record my speech what I'm speaking
so here's like you were talking about
earlier it here's kind of the tone it
analyzes your voice your mood kind of
kidney help you yeah neck with that and
then my mom could follow my vibe and
check up on me like are you stressed
what's wrong right or mom is everything
okay I see that your stress or a mile
you're happy what's going on so you
share your vibe with folks and more
importantly say for example you're
working and someone calls you with a bad
vibe why do you want to answer a bad
vibe call so you're just gonna like it
deny it right away is only what you
would do you don't like the bad vibes I
mean that with I'm in a good vibe but
I'm working trying to focus if
somebody's calling me on a red alert no
I don't want a bread Jim so will let's
talk about like the watch design because
it is unique from a standpoint of you
know a lot of people are trying to
figure out do I need us do I need any
type of device on my wrist the chord
device is the black one and the black
one was based off of a cuff like a
fashion cuff like a Chanel cuff or a
Gucci cuff a Fendi cuff and they're
they're not there's not skinny punk rock
has been wearing multiple cuffs but
spikes on it since the 80s
for some reason the direction that tech
companies of cooking is watches so we've
taken the route of punk rock hip-hop
fashion and it's why it's not a watch
it's more a cuff than a watch a bracelet
than a watch a fashion bracelet and you
know I just want to bring a different
perspective in the world of wearables
and how this connects to jackets so
we've created a jacket and components
for the jacket for other fashion houses
to design around our components so that
when the sleeve touches the watch you
have four days to really wait so you're
saying your sleeve will be able to
charge or the hour the watch yeah yeah
with it with this fashion line that
you're that you're going to use to kind
of connect this all right yes so we have
jackets give you three days talking so
also yeah we got to show you guys this
the backpack that you're rocking that I
mean this is this is gnarly their
speaker's pumped in there this is you
you mention though it's going to be able
to talk to the pulse as well right
weather smart devices
you know just bluetooth sound and power
so like Apple has their eco system
you've got your like full on body eco
system going on here with the pulse
horrible eco see yeah exactly what of
all these steps along the way kind of
helped you get to this point how's that
helped you the place where I learn the
most is beats being one of the founding
guys there and Jimmy iving just guiding
me and encouraging me has done wonders
to give me the strength and the the
discipline to start my own company to
the point where I funded the company to
get to this point and went out after we
built it all to went out myself to raise
money so you know I'm really proud of
the team that we have there's like 45
plus folks that are top-notch engineers
and we wouldn't be here without without
those guys and you know just finally I
know this is you know a passion project
of yours you know just just from the
history of you if you had to say one
thing when you see this
on your wrist how does it make you feel
that people from the projects can be a
part of a consumer electronics
conversation and they can bring the
market not just hardware but software
and operating systems as well to me even
saying that sentences is surreal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
