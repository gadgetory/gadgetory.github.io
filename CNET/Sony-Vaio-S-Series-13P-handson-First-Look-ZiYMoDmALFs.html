front of me here is the sony vaio s
series 13 p now that's a mouthful for a
line that has been around for a couple
of years now the vaio s is Sony's
mid-range to slightly premium laptop
line it's a step above the e series they
have a 13 and 15 inch model an important
thing to know is that these aren't
ultrabooks this 13-inch laptop is a
regular laptop which means that it's got
a full voltage processor and some more
features that you're not going to find
on an ultrabook you know you're going to
have an optical drive you're going to
have better graphics you're gonna have a
larger hard drive that type of stuff and
the vaio s previously was kind of a
mixed bag the ones I had looked at
tended to have middling battery life
that required you to buy an extra slice
battery for a hundred fifty dollars more
and some features that were okay but
didn't really stand out that much from
the pack the new vos comes in three
different flavors starting as low as 799
but the one I reviewed is the premium
edition that starts at eleven nineteen
the configuration I looked at is 1199
now that matches up with a 13-inch
MacBook Pro what you get here I think is
a lot more impressive than one apple
offers in the macbook pro in fact it's
the feature set I wanted in the first
place this is 3.7 pounds a lot lighter
than the 4 plus pounds you get on fuller
size laptops this has a slot-loading
optical drive it has a new core i5
processor 640 gigabyte hard drive six
gigs of ram nvidia geforce 640 graphics
which are really nice although they're
not super spectacular they get the job
done and you also get a higher
resolution 1600 x 900 display so you get
higher resolution graphics and you also
can get a slightly larger desktop for
your 13 inch screen it's kind of like
the sweet spot and even better the
battery life on this is much improved
I've got about five hours five and a
half hours plus running our tests which
is good enough to get you going for a
day it's not super spectacular but it's
definitely far far better and you know
what more would you ask for there's a
larger trackpad it's a little finicky
but it's much better than what it
existed before backlit keyboard and
there you go now I might have some
quibbles about the strange speed /
stamina toggle switch up your message to
Sony that's a really confusing button
and not really need it anymore because
within video graphics there's a fix
switching already and you can tweak your
performance settings internally so what
does this really do it's kind of a
physical toggle that you don't really
need and clutters up the space a tiny
bit the sony vaio s is a really good
laptop this time around and the 13 p
might be a little bit too premium for
some that's got things like TPM if you
don't know what that is you don't need
it it's got a fingerprint reader and
some optional SSD storage capabilities
but that's really for a lot of small
business use I think you might want to
go with the enhanced version instead
check out Sony site for their somewhat
confusing layout of pricing options I'm

2012 sony vaio s 13 inch</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
