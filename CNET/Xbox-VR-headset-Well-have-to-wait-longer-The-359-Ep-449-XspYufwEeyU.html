morning all live from the scene at
studios in New York City it's a 3:59
podcast my name is BVG episode 449 your
host today are Roger Cheng and Alfred a
warning happy Monday everyone what up
we've got a busy busy day for you we'd
be talking about our Smith's scoop on
the what could have been with the X bar
X Box VR headset this is a scoop from
Ian sure about sir what happened and the
fact that they were actually in active
development even though they've been
pretty cagey about that I wasn't that
we'll talk about will offer preview of
the ephah trade show this is going on in
Berlin our own bedbugs Reubens actually
there we'll share some details but we
want to see from the show and then
lastly we'll touch upon the the tragedy
of this weekend the shooting at the Med
19 tournament down in Jacksonville so
without further ado if you have any
questions leave them in the comments
section Brian will pick out the best and
we'll get them in 3 minutes and 59
seconds see you all back in the chat and
3 minutes and 59 seconds from 3 -
welcome to the 359 I'm dr. Chen I'm out
for dang don't hold your breath for the
Xbox VR headset well Microsoft hasn't
said much about it but rumors of a VR
had said had been floating around for
years you know they basically Nix the
plans but Aronian sure had the scoop on
actually the fact that they were in
active development for a headset to the
point where they were actually asking
partners to create specific content for
them and really been looking at the the
kind of device build and the screen
quality I mean I think it's a good thing
I got next I mean I've seen like games
for the PlayStation 4 VR I don't really
think we're there yet as far as like
good games in VR and I know a lot of
people that play a lot of your games
tell me I'm completely wrong and I
probably am but my I just like I don't
know if the market is really there for
them right now
yeah it was interesting that they
decided to pull back on that you know
given the fact that VR there was a lot
of hype around VR over the last few
years
Playstations been investing in it oculus
has been investing it you know
HTC obviously and so you know the fact
that VR the hype has doubt died down a
bit you kind of look back at all right
all right it's a smart call but just
sort of given that initial appetite for
VR it's surprising that Microsoft didn't
rule anything out yeah I'm curious if
they're like holding back so they can
like put out something you know more
high-end that like once a demand is
there or if they are you know more so
relying on like hololens for Microsoft
if they want to do more like AR gaming
with right with their consoles because I
I know that they were kind of like all
in with like Kinect for a while yeah so
I mean I feel like that might fit in
really well if they are I had a Kinect
and I found it worthless and I'm still
pretty angry about it you would probably
be saying the same thing about Xbox VR
if had it come out that is a really good
point one of the one of the details that
Ian poured on was the fact that they
were they are waiting for better screen
quality things like a wireless adapter
which right now is is an accessory
that's available with HTC vive for
several hundred dollars on top of the
you know the small fortune you're
spending on a VR headset so we'll have
to wait around and see if if VR of Xbox
embraces VR down the line
next up the ephah trade show kicks off
this week in our own Ben Fox Rubin is in
Berlin for the conference and this show
is largely known for big appliances TVs
but we've got some cool stuff there the
the robot pants that LG teased you know
this is a Khloe robot that we saw out in
a at CES we're imagining LG to talk
vision LG will talk more about robotics
and AI and really Google Amazon and
their assistants should have a big role
there whether or not they'll actually be
there in person I think you'll see a
lexan Google Assistant pretty much
everywhere yeah I mean when we were at
CES what we saw them in like a bathroom
and in a mirror
and in like a fridge fridges like the
least while example fridges like it's
almost standard yeah an assistant fridge
I'm just you know honestly we should
have a whole conference just for robot
clothes though that the pants that was
cool idea in robot pants robot hat maybe
it's I just hope that they don't you
know fall flat on their face like the
one that we had seen at CES right the
old Chloe robot which we actually had on
for our show SES our 3:59 show and just
sort of fail to respond to any of our
commands it's come sad I'm looking
forward to all the news coming from
Aoife though just to see all the great
technology that I know I can't afford
there you go lastly tragedy struck a
madden 19 tournament yesterday in
Jacksonville's gunmen opened fire to the
event three people have died eleven were
injured you know you're tad more into
the gaming community we're some the
reactions that you saw so this is
spurred like a major conversation around
security and you know tournaments like
these a lot of people come to these and
you know now you know there's been a lot
more concerns about you know we don't
really do bag checks or security or
anything like that so the organizer
behind Evo which is the largest fighting
game tournament basically said in a
tweet yesterday that you know we're
going to be you know requiring metal
detectors for all of our events starting
in 2019 or so and like that's like
there's this whole conversation around
like what we should do to ensure
security for people to come to our
tournaments now right that's because a
lot of these tournaments like this one
in particular was in sort of a low
budget yeah there right yeah it's not
like a big stadium that yeah vision some
of those bigger eSports events all right
so our deepest sympathies go out to
everyone involved for more of these
stories check us out and see net I'm
Roger Chang I'm Alfred Aang thanks for
listening
all right welcome back everybody thanks
for joining us for the recording of the
audio podcast that will publish a little
bit later will tell you where to
download it until then go ahead and
submit questions and comments will even
take your feelings over the tragedy and
how this affects your community for all
of us here and tech world and gaming
it's always rough to hear stuff like
this but in the meantime let's try to
keep things a little more upbeat I want
to hear more about robot hats Alfred um
yeah it could be like copy from Super
Mario Odyssey where you just throw it on
stuff and then you don't know you maybe
it fixes your hair I want you to commute
you wear the hat on your commute and
when you take it off your hair is
already made up
so is Aoife essentially just becoming
the Jetsons yeah pretty much although
you could have make that argument for
all all these text ratios right CES
shows off the the latest and greatest
and things that we're seeing it we will
see over the next few years know if it's
kind of like that although it's like I
said it's traditionally been slated or
been heavily towards appliances washers
dryers you're starting to see a kind of
a fuller breadth of products and
technology out there I think we're gonna
see more stuff on foldable screens as
well a little displays that'll be
interesting we're we're supposedly gonna
see foldable phones next year so it'd be
kind of nice to see some of the
everybody work this is foldable like
like the clamshell way or is this
foldable like paper where's like roll
yeah yeah I would I would imagine like
clamshell okay that's a ripoff and I'm
not interested in that really the
Nintendo already came out though 50s no
but that's not one continuous screen I
mean there's a hint yeah sure one I'm
not I yeah I'm not that interested in it
no if it was a if it was a giant screen
that sold out and it was continuous
screen there's no hinge in the middle
that's the point I think I'd have to see
it to like like when it's folded like
how thick is it still you know I don't
know yeah that's to me really good
question that's why I like the rollable
one and you can just just how would that
be better if you rolled it cuz it's like
it's it'd be like a ten yeah scroll yeah
fix grow yeah how is that better it's
definitely better
I'm sure look up at on the whole
time I want a hole like a baton but like
you'd definitely be easier to put in
your
in your pocket and he just wants it so I
can do like Monty Python stuff just I
mean a scroll phone scroll phone ooh no
it's controllable phones that's no no
one's gonna buy that phone I'll buy it
let's go ahead and jump into the chat
take some questions from Ryan Williams I
just bought an S 9 plus and have the VR
heads or and the VR headset is supposed
to be a good accessory for it does
anyone own it and know if it's actually
worth it and wants thoughts specifically
from Roger or Alfred so they should just
leave me out Wow Brian get out yeah man
I have tried it I mean it's it's not as
it's not that different from the the
older version of the gear VR headset
which I'm assuming you're talking about
that that accessory it's fine I mean I
feel like there's still a lack of
content
most of the content that you you'll find
is you know like two or three minutes
long it's fairly disposable I found it
to be an interesting gimmick the truth
perfectly frank like I have a gear VR I
have I have the what's the Google one
the pixel dream catcher or something
yeah that a dream a dream yeah thank you
daydream I have three VR headsets and
they all collect us now so I usually
kind of dust them off and show them
around when when folks come to visit
like hey check out this VR experience
they think it's really cool and then and
then we move on my favorite is still
that Samsung gear VR commercial that was
airing like all the time last year when
it was like would they show a family
member or something like it's like a
senior like member with like a
grandmother or something like that and
then she like she like lets out a single
tear because it's so beautiful what
she's saying but they never show like
what she's actually watching or anything
like that
Oh same ones like the Olympic one we're
like the woman knows that the rehab that
we had that was a different one but you
actually was kind of like you know you
be cool I don't know if there's ever
been anything as beautiful in VR to
drive people to tears no but I'm very
nice for all the traffic a Harry Potter
one those kind of
cool I was like in the wasn't her about
as fantastic beasts I was in the
briefcase yeah I think it's because
they're all missing the point of like
why we go online and it like consume
content and so of cuz like it's more
like a social thing like if I see you
like a good video I send it to a friend
after you know it's not like and I feel
like with VR that's you can't really do
that because like how many of your
friends like own VR headsets so it's
kinda like this is really cool and it's
only for me and I can't talk to anybody
back so look
I sort of a glimpse into I think how
entertainment might evolve over the next
few years it's it's kind of cool to have
I wouldn't spend that much money on it
if if there's some sort of bundle offer
where it comes for free that's great I
don't think I'd spend money on a VR
headset I feel like you're gonna use it
for a little bit just to check out some
of the content and then you're gonna get
tired of it it's kind of a pain to like
put your phone in there slap it in get
you know actually strapping your head
and actually use it cuz it's like a
three-minute experience and it takes
about a minute two minutes to put
together so yeah and I have Google
cardboard that I stole from Scott
Stein's office nice I take it you don't
use that either nope yeah
next question from Jacob Lombardo what
do you think about the rumored Xbox all
past subscription where you pay twenty
two bucks a month for an xbox one s and
Xbox Live Gold and the game pass it's
technically a good deal but only if you
stick with it yeah I'm not aware of this
but I've been an Xbox Live subscriber
for why I think III think I still am too
even though I haven't played a game I
mean I think like all companies are
really going in this direction of like
hey we'll charge you more per month to
up like our servers but we'll give you
these games that I'm inclined to say
that you would not have bought these
games like on their own if they were at
that price right to begin with so like
Xbox I remember this one time I was like
yo we'll give you like you got
assassin's creed 4 free this month only
I never wanted to play Assassin's Creed
but so like they always just say like
it's like an additional bonus kind of
thing but it's just like oh yeah
this is a bonus something I never want
I'm always alone
wary of those kinds of monthly
subscription plans because there are you
go I go through long stretches where I
don't spend any money in video games and
so the committee of that yeah I think to
your point like if you stick with it and
you're playing games every month and
you're playing the new games that you
get it's worth it otherwise you know you
can't do the math when you're in your
head about whether or not yeah I mean I
know what you're already spending on
games and what you would continue to
spend on gaming if it's there it's there
I don't think I'd sign up for that
though I barely use the live past
anymore I got it for the Netflix and all
that but then it took away the group
watch and now you don't need it anymore
to use streaming apps so I don't know
why I still have it
oh because they have a bunch of saved
games that are up in the cloud I don't
want to lose those that's yeah that's
the thing too like you're tearing bad
your console is like pretty much useless
unless you're like in on like one of
these plans you know like like I had a
like an Xbox 360 for a while but I don't
I don't want to pay for the online stuff
right so he's basically like it's just
here like I don't know I do anything 60
there's still enough like single-player
games and yeah you didn't have to be on
live yeah it was early on but at the
same time though anything now you buy
the device and then you subscribe to a
service there's no there's no single
pain you know even you do anymore find
that really annoying what the video game
industry having to buy like some sort of
online package or whatever to keep the
game updating with with new over-the-air
content or whatever just I don't know I
miss the days where I lost the console I
got it I bought the game and I'm good to
go
like it's not like a complete game
unless you have this whatever Jacob does
point out that the subscription includes
the hardware so essentially it's it's
doing what are you talking about with
and taking out a step ahead of buying
the console then subscribing it's just
like I mean it's an Xbox one s not X
right that's what he said again I'm not
familiar with this program so any would
make X the lower that's the lower end
yeah yeah but I also think that's pretty
interesting I guess they're going for
like what the car dealership model now
where you pacing yeah like you pay this
one do you they'll be testing the water
with you know the more attainable
or accessible console that they expect
to sell more of so do you do you own the
console eventually or like are you like
basically renting it so is it like the
modem at Time Warner yeah yeah I feel
like that's what it is right like once
you're done with playing you you
the back that would be awful I would I
would not want to do that because you're
gonna you don't not paying more for it
by like the end of right like it's more
like a lease program though once you
paid it off you paid it oh yeah I'm
reading the article now at the end of
the 24 month turn players own the
console oh god yeah I would sign up for
that if you had to send it back
people do that have cars all the time
cars yeah that's true
I mean you could just take it back to
GameSpot and get three dollar coupon or
whatever no it is I mean I do enjoy that
I think that's something I definitely
would have done like as a kid or
something like that it did no no like
lease like a console because like I
remember back then it would just be like
you know this thing is you know $300 or
something like that and I can't like
really get it now unless like it's like
Christmas time or something like that so
if like oh we can just do the five
dollars a month for 24 months if you do
the math on that so that 35 is for the
Xbox one X though Oh s so yeah but my
point is like I think I would be into
that just like you know at a time when
like I as a kid like you you're not able
to just get the console flat out like I
think I do I do appreciate them like
considering like accessibility like
price wise for other yeah yeah yeah you
see in with obviously you see with cars
you see with smart phones yeah it makes
sense that they would try this model I
just I don't know yeah but that's also
along with the like the game pass stuff
yeah the service you'd get anyways
probably it does pay itself out I just
wonder like what kind of penalties are
there if you opt out early yeah that's
the thing because like I remember having
this like debate with myself about the
Nintendo switch when it came out was
like should I buy it or not and if they
had a program like this where like you
paid 20 bucks a month until like for
like a year or two until like I could
have like
done that and figure out whether or not
I actually want this console instead of
like shelling out like all that money
and pretending that I like it do you
guys remember that I just I'm having
flashbacks to the 90s when my neighbors
and I they had a Sega Genesis I had an
NES known had an SNES so we'd go down to
the local rental store and you'd rent
the console you have to beg your parents
to pay whatever the hell it was to rent
it for the weekend a weekend deal was a
console to games to controllers so we'd
get the SNES we get turtles in time we'd
wallop it like 4 or 5 times over and
never turn the console and then do it
again next weekend no I mean if we
didn't have a console we just didn't
play I didn't remember renting games
though and basically we had to because
some blockbuster know from like
mom-and-pop rental stores I'm a
blockbuster and I remember her bass I
mean I still remember renting like
Nintendo games and back then we didn't
know what was a good game or what wasn't
right it was all based off the box art
we didn't have Jeff Bakalar to tell us
exactly so most the games is terrible
I mean renting a game was one thing I
just remembered my whole world changed
like you can rent the whole console I
actually did not know that yeah I've
never been to a place where you can like
rent the whole week you can do that
blockbuster right those were more
monsters right I mean I don't I never
had a blockbuster where I was growing up
I only had the momma pops right so and
only a couple of them did consoles a lot
of them didn't do consoles because I
didn't think they really had the space
to stash and when they did yeah yeah
imagine that that's kind of a pricey
business model
yeah yeah anyway it's moving on ramos at
a time here's one from priority one are
there games in VR and facilities where
you can actually walk around in the game
without bumping in the walls think of
like a four way treadmill we have seen
this yeah we have I mean there I mean
I've seen them open up here in New York
in Long Island where I live or in Queens
that there are these treadmills I mean a
lot of them I don't see the treadmill so
much I do see like five setups with like
a wide space that you can walk around in
mm-hmm hear from Scott where he did this
treadmill Scott called the Omni Omni
well bless God who is our VR guinea pig
and just will do anything in VR well
almost almost anything er careful but
yeah we we
the omnidirectional thing I saw it at
CES I didn't get a chance to try it but
I don't see it anywhere like
commercially so I don't I don't know how
successful those are I do see like VR
arcades opening up or there they do have
a dedicated kind like four foot by four
foot spot for you to walk around and
you've got a vibe system it tracks you
or foot by four foot that's it's not
that big that's like a closet I mean
it's not you can't even on the vibe you
can't really move around yeah I wonder
how long until we see something like an
arena open up with almost like a
paintball arena but for VR like
widespread I know that they exist in
little pockets and stuff and we've seen
him test it out well we tried that at
CES remember that uh zombie zombie game
I mean a core player would be a new
breath into the concept of the the
arcade right cuz the Arkham
what we tried though the facility was
fairly large how big was that room I
just like the size of the studio it's
probably bigger it felt like it was big
like know like the entire play like up
to where like Brian is right I felt like
it was even bigger Holly bigger yeah it
was just this massive empty spot it was
four of us backpacks we can see each
other in the VR world as we're killing
zombies but there are also parts were
like they divided us into teams of two
yeah
and created virtual walls or we can only
see the yeah two of us yeah so those
those experiences have definitely popped
up a lot it's another one price you know
that one was like a $50 experience I
think yeah there's like a half hour long
game but it was pretty pricey yeah I I'm
just careful about like the whole like
oh this might be a resurgence of like
the arcade kind of thought yeah I feel
like the folks like you they probably
learned lessons from arcades and why
they like all failed once everyone got
home consoles right and I think they
understand that like people are proud
like V ours like not accessible now in
the same way that like games weren't
back then but like most likely they'll
be able to go be like home consoles
within a few years too and like all
these like the origin why you're seeing
some of these arcade experiences offer
come unique things whether it's like
obstacle physical obstacles in large
large rooms like the one we tried and
really experiences that you couldn't
duplicate at home even if you yeah VR
headset
yeah I mean we'll see I'm like why
skeptical that you know about the
longevity of these experiences but like
I see them pop up in like movie theaters
like in the lobbies so where where
there's already sort of an existing
business I think it makes sense to kind
of complement it with a VR option only
baby steps away from ready player one am
i right there we go we are out of time
we got to wrap it up for the day but
thanks everybody for joining us
fantastic questions still rolling in and
we never have enough time to do it so
we'll see you guys tomorrow thanks again
