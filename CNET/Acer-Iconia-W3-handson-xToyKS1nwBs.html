look at the acer iconia w3 it's a bit of
unique system in thats a full windows 8
tablet but it's only got an 8 inch
screen most of the windows 8 tablets and
hybrids that we've seen have 11 inch
screen as 13 inch screens are a little
bit bigger this is closer in theory to
something like an iPad Mini or an
Android tablet but of course it's
running full Windows 8 which works well
on a small touchscreen as long as you
stick to sort of this tile based display
right here if you go back to the
traditional Windows desktop it's going
to be pretty hard to manipulate of
course this is running an intel atom
chip which keeps it sort of low powered
means a battery lasts a long time but
it's not great for every task that
you're going to want to do with your
tablet or your laptop it's good for web
surfing they're made for watching some
video social media email things like
that anything more complicated you're
going to want to move up for more full
power at laptop or tablet or hybrid now
even though I ended up liking the w3
more than I thought it would it did have
a couple of near fatal flaws that really
turn me off one the screen frankly is
not great if you look at it from even a
little bit of an angle you lose the
image very quickly it has kind of a
gauzy not super sharp quality to it and
then there's this keyboard dock that's a
seventy dollar and on the tablet itself
is the 379 24 29 depending on how big
the hard drive is keyboard dock it's
bigger that's kind of weird right but
it's based on a 13 inch keyboard it's
actually pretty comfortable for typing
on the big problem is it doesn't have a
touchpad or even a track pointer anyway
to control the cursor on screen so
you're basically typing and either using
an external mouse or using your finger
to try to navigate which if you ever
tried that on a very tiny screen is very
very difficult so I've give the w3 a lot
of credit for being a very inexpensive
full Windows 8 touchscreen device that
actually has a usable keyboard accessory
you can get but that lack of a touchpad
and the poor screen quality kind of make
it not a very good productivity device
maybe you want to spend a little bit
more and trade up to something a little
bit better i'm dan ackerman and then
