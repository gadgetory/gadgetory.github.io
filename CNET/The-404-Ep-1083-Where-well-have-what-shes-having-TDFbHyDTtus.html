close i'm back in the ugly see changing
shares yeah keep i'm a chair shifter
yeah it's fine um thanks for coming back
Thank You Elmo sayin yeah you were
telling I was telling me before he's
like not gonna lie guys I almost didn't
make it out of that feeling feel good to
be back in San Francisco can't blame you
so you had a good time I had a really
good time proper burritos quite a good
buried I was gonna take a picture but I
just hate it before I
you thought about taking pictures you
just didn't stop myself that happens
with good food um I want to talk about
what we do a little movie talk in the
beginning obviously mentioning on Nora
Ephron's I say efrain some people say
Efron um but the reason I I brought this
up is because there is a there is a
interesting piece of fake news that got
me so excited and I went to super
official news.com have you heard of this
website no I thought return on or after
well we will this sort of leads into it
um and it got me so excited it was
basically a false blog post about how
the big lebowski was going to have a
sequel yeah this is kind of like an
alternative reality right equal to the
and what's crazy is that the right up it
doesn't seem very official but it seems
marginally believable and it basically
talks and about how all the players from
the original big lebowski have signed up
and are going to be making big lebowski
to the dude goes to Washington and it
was supposed to be about how john
goodman and jeff bridges were trying to
protect the bowling alley and the dudes
son who he conceived with Julianne
Moore's character was now the youngest
member of Congress in the in the world
was 18 years old and just went on and it
really made me sort of yearn for
something like this because uh you know
there's a lot of crap out there now yeah
and we look at what someone like Nora
Ephron and we look at what she's done in
the amount of like I mean you look at
her resume it's shocking the amount of
movies that she uh took took part in
yeah um obviously when harry met sally
comes to mind Sleepless in Seattle she
wrote and directed she didn't direct
Harry my turn i think that was Rob
Reiner but she wrote it she wrote you've
got mail directed it shiro Julia and
Julia wrote and directed it why do these
people have to die man um yeah it's
really tragic uh she had her handed a
lot of really funny feminist romantic
comedies I feel like she almost kind of
cornered that that market for romantic
comedies I remember
you had when harry met sally growing up
on VHS tape and watch that so much I
feel like that along with sleepless in
seattle and you've got mail really just
uh I don't know it kind of shaped a
generation of romantics absolutely I
mean let's be honest she might not have
dealt with the most important issues of
our time no she was a great storyteller
and no one when you really think back
about talked about like a solid résumé
and uh and sort of uh you know talking
was she no one came close to what she
was able to do right arm it's just it's
just upsetting you know you're watching
your battleship movies in your GI Joe
movies and you know I feel like that art
of just a great comedy that everyone can
relate to because I so it does such a
good job at emulating real-life
relationships yeah there's not I feel
like there is really romantic homilies
aren't like that anymore they make you
feel good right they have a rarely
benefits doesn't do the same thing of
course not Renee its they're just very
beautiful people right right Miller
Kunis in Justin Timberlake I mean yes um
you know Billy Crystal is not the
ugliest guy in the world but he's a much
more average Joe than then Justin sure
yeah and they have legitimate flaws
exactly like Billy Crystal will divorce
real-life issues that plague these
people and and and you know just dealing
with people's relationships all of it
now is superficial it's all nah it's all
about sex too none of these movies that
Nora wrote were directly about sex I
mean that's part of the story but it
wasn't it wasn't filthy in the way that
movies are now bright we've sort of lost
this and you know her her career and
don't forget she was also an amazing
novelist too yeah she had a number of
best-selling up items she never won an
Oscar she was nominated three times she
did win a few other awards so yeah I
mean it's not someone that you would
automatically assume that we were fans
of bright but when you look back at her
resume in her career it's like man
someone like that you know maybe wasn't
appreciated at the very time but looking
back it's on blue right and i think uh
you know us talking about this comes at
a good time because did you read how
adam carolla was saying there are no
funny female comedians i think last week
he said that on his own
I don't understand that a lot of male
comedians say that but Nora Ephron is uh
you know how to say anything else just
to talk about like a fantastic
screenwriter yeah blows my mind how good
she was at that yeah it's crazy I don't
know that I didn't yeah he did and I'm
never like Amy Schumer Saracen well he
was saying that it's a numbers game and
if you had to choose a member on your
comedic team it'd probably be a male I
don't know you want to touch that I'm
just saying that Nora FS funniest a
policy statement yeah yeah yeah anyway
we will we'll move right along with that
Justin tell me about we talked about
cars that drives them drive themselves
yeah and it's something that I feel like
Google will eventually have a big part
in mmm but what is this that Ford is
working on so the Google cars have been
coming for a while now but a lot of
people don't like the idea of
self-driving cars because then it kind
of I don't take the fun out of driving
right people don't like doing on your
brakes and you know it accident right
all that some people enjoy like myself I
enjoy like driving down the freeway when
there's no traffic right and the only
time you really want a self-driving cars
when they're when you are encountering
that kind of thing and uh so I think a
better take on the self-driving car is
Ford's new traffic assist technology and
that's going to be coming out um pretty
soon it's like their next step toward
autonomous driving cars and so uh what
this basically does it uh it reduces
like your commute times on a stretch of
road by like thirty seven and a half
percent by sort of analyzing uh the
space you have in your lane this
distance between the car in front of you
the ones behind you like it maintains a
safe distance between those cars okay so
this is kind of like what Google is
doing but only engages when it notices
that you're stuck in traffic so the rest
of the time it automatically shuts off
the only problem that I have with the
story is that i was reading this wired
article where it talks about it and it
says i'll quote this force as a feature
could potentially improve the flow of
traffic only where there are no
pedestrians no cyclists no animals and
where lanes are clearly marked so it's
just uh nowhere no that's plenty that's
highway
traffic I guess but what highway have
you been on that with I don't know four
lanes are always clearly marked I just
don't know if we'll see anytime soon on
an automated car that's navigating
through something like Manhattan right
way too many variables humans can't even
do it you need to be scanning within
like a mile radius always it's gotta be
crazy it's a lot of information for a
car to process right talking like
they're people now um but yeah I uh yeah
I mean this is just inevitable atiba tie
don't understand where it'll be okay
like how will they roll this out how
will they make it so some cars are going
to be automated some aren't yeah because
some people are still gonna want to hold
on to that 1983 Dodge Dynasty right you
know what I mean like it's gonna be a
problem how are they gonna keep people
from not just falling asleep behind the
wheel when they don't have to drive in
traffic yeah you know if like you're
really tired at the end the day and you
have to suffer through an hour you know
we used to think cars were gonna fly
right because watch the building the
future yeah they'll think they're gonna
bill even the hope alive really pulling
for that flying car thing well they're
not going to fly but what there are
going to do is they're gonna drive
themselves like the writing is on the
wall for that they're already parking
themselves there any parking themselves
poorly have you seen one do it not in
person on YouTube videos and it did
pretty well yeah I mean uh I feel like
they still have a lot to perfect with
that but what's crazy to me is like all
right so we thought cars were gonna fly
so that would be the case they would
have to revamp the entire department
transportation right the the whole
highway and roadway infrastructure that
the country relies on would need to be
basically you know destroyed and then
yet created from the ground up not to
mention consumables oh it would be a
disaster and that's probably why I would
never happen but for automated cars
they're gonna have to do a sort of
similar thing because certain roads will
be like must be manual you know I mean
and and that's what we're gonna see
that'll be like all right you can engage
autopilot right is that gonna be like a
wireless thing is he has even our car
understands it right you know where's
that gonna happen you know always
wondered we have crumbling bridges and
tunnels all across the country yeah
we're gonna you know completely reface
these gigantic potholes just not I don't
know
why haven't they made wheels that can
rotate all the way around on its own
axis so that people can parallel park
just by driving to the right right i
mean i know exactly we're saying you're
basically saying having so if you look
at wheels right they only go one more
wheels right turn Brett why can't they
turn all you wanted to go 90 degrees yet
and then and then just try go right into
a pie a lot freak inspector gadget's car
you just want this thing to turn its
kind of easy right with gyroscopes and
such popular too and writing about what
when we about what an axle looks like
right ok ok ok maybe let me put this in
words you can understand I know what an
accident about what your bicycle shop
like yeah all know basically so so
that's a thing the the hurdle is getting
the car to sort of disengage from its
axle which or adding another axle or
yeah like or maybe you know having those
lifts up and then these little training
yeah that's what pushes it in right now
but that was very happy that would be
great but how much dope that was my idea
thing stole not your anything you're the
first person ever i do but i think the
first time you heard it yeah yeah the
question is like why should you have to
be traveling straight to go left or
right it if if objectively speaking if
you look at what parallel parking is
right there seems to be a lot of effort
for something right that should be
easier yeah you have to cut it at the
exact right yeah you know you should
just be able to you know push that
button wheels go up training wheels come
down then i think just goes right into
the spot exactly i mean billions of tiny
feet we're not asking for a lot you guys
want to have your automated cars all
going might as well do the 90 degree
parallel parking that's what I'm feature
coming to a car near you I think we're
the first two people ever in human
history to come up with that idea I
think we're the first I think we should
get paid for this somehow tell me about
this robot that wins rock-paper-scissors
yeah a hundred percent of the time yeah
how is that possible because I thought
that was just a thirty-three percent
chance sort of thing yeah well this
thing is like me an expert at rock paper
you're not that good at rock paper
scissors what are you serious I've
beaten you many a
that's cuz I let you win like a father
does to his son no no yeah let's see you
come on see not right now what get it
yeah let's do this how do you were
listening to this well they uh I don't
know are you all narrating on the way
you gotta say what did it what it is on
three no no you go like this it goes
Rock Paper Scissors shoot yeah okay okay
all right Rock Paper Scissors shoot why
is truth right Rock Paper Scissors shoot
Rock Paper Scissors shoot all right the
point is listening uh just 12 in a row
so for the record I'm undefeated against
you this is the most engaging radio
we've ever done yes god damn right it is
you've never beaten me now how does that
feel we're gonna have a tournament after
this it feel to be such a loser no dare
you I'm just saying lamee rock paper
scissors lizard spock no yeah well
that's ridiculous um this is coming out
of i believe japan yet the university of
tokyo's oku laboratory they're really
working on important stuff you i know
they've created this human machine
cooperation system it's more of like a
proof of concept thing that a machine
can recognize uh that what you're gonna
throw before even the other person can
write so it basically looks for
movements in your hands not the
psychology is not the psychology yeah
it's it isn't like create the
permutations in its head right that it
just looks at what your hand and your
fingers are about to form and if your
two fingers are jetting out it'll know
that you're doing scissors so that you
were to somehow um you know make your
throw and and have it like a color like
a different color of light right this
couldn't do it because it wouldn't win
because it can't in these is your hand
it might how could it do that I think
it's because it doesn't calculate it
until the like one millisecond before
your finger is fully formed into
whatever you choose to be a weapon so
this robots dirty cheers it has a
hundred percent success rate right
because it's she does this is looking at
what you're gonna break its cheating
that is cheating you're right i mean
i've never seen a human do that
yeah maybe the the rock paper scissor
champions of the world maybe their
secrets out but I don't know it gotta
think this is probably like third or
fourth down the list of things they were
this machine to do Fred yeah why what
else was it going to do well the other
than from what I can tell a prostate
exam no idea the idea that uh they want
to make it easier for like man and
robots to sort of work together right
and maybe like a factory production line
for you and everyone knows the first
rule to robot human synergy look at this
is Rock Paper Co yet this does look
really funny oh my god always running a
video it's a very fast games very
present this robot is kicking the crap
out of this you know right human head
even mimics the movements if you slow
your hand down it'll I don't have a good
speed of your throat it's pretty good
that's pretty good i like that doesn't
look like paper mr. robot hand what
would happen if you through the Shocker
though i don't think you would break it
it wouldn't know what to do does not
commute and it would just start smoking
and sparking wall yeah anyway everybody
brain injury fingers yeah that it so i
guess three i guess three fingers is
paper and it's only a stupid robot get a
life robot seriously um alright so let's
go break before we get into the audience
engagement port right there's a lot to
do i want to tease what we have coming

nice right maybe we plan the contest
better next time hey come on it I just
kidding yeah tube comment we did almost
fun of me ten thousand oh my god yeah
alright so that's a deal I didn't know
you could we use the word Zach on
Twitter so often we there a lot of
really heinous covet Oh about me they
wanted you to like do something exciting
yeah I don't know not gonna bury me with
that anyway let's say you want to do
some calls from the public yeah sound
like something you could get into right
who did all right I'm to show the love a
jig 6404 cnet i wanna i showed you threw
up I want to get that in a second if it
falls um let's play the first one hey
guys how you doing this is white plains
from Brett I'm calling in and I want
first off I want to say that you know
I'm a longtime listener and for the most
part i agree with ninety-nine point nine
percent of stuff you guys say it's
pretty good like every day like that
never really ever skip a beat okay Mike
all right now is in regards to what you
guys are talking about four orbits calm
now I'm just saying that I don't care
whatever the reason is that you have a
mac or pc whether it's for financial
reasons what it was a gift or you know
arm oh whatever little performance yeah
the thing with orbitz.com is that
everybody should have the same
opportunity the same deals if you go to
orbitz.com you're going there for the
same reason I want the best deal okay so
all right my thing is that you could
kill that all right um so if you don't
know we're talking about yesterday
headlines came out that orbits the
travel agent site was sniffing out what
OS you or what kind of computer you had
and then delivering different priced
deals to you so if you were using a Mac
you were actually getting you were
getting pushed more expensive deals than
you would if you're using a pc right
that said the prices weren't different
they were just feeding you ones at
different times so if you you all the
prices were there right you could reset
the filter and get the same price as
anyone else you do fault it was all like
the deep right sort of search returned
stuff yeah that's fine and I understand
what what our buddies uh you know trying
to say on the phone but think about it
it's all economics it's all relative
when you come to New York
just because you live in New York you're
gonna spend more money because it's a
more expensive city yeah it's just the
way it is but the caller also brings up
a good point is that not everyone that
owns a mac bought one for themselves in
finance that's fine so it on a long
enough timeline it works out that the
people with more money or spending more
money on orbitz I other go into by also
don't think he knows that you can it's
all the same deals out there they're
just presented differently right it's
like you know you go to different places
and their present differently it's all
psychology if you're going to orbitz.com
you have the mindset of a very strict
budget man you want to get the best deal
that's why you're on orbitz and not the
individual airline right so I'm hoping
that most people go and shop around
anyway not to take the price what orbits
is trying to bank on is the I don't know
think about someone who buys a Mac that
probably doesn't need one money maybe
not might not be a big issue to them
okay some people think you know they're
spending more money on a trip they're
gonna have a better time right so I
think that's what they're trying to play
into so you know if you're silly enough
to sort of overlook that stuff you kind
of deserve to get ripped off maybe all
right I don't know that's just but
thanks for the call that definitely is a
it's a cool conversation next call it
what's going on guys it's what Palm
Beach from desean post into Monday's
podcast just now and you guys are
talking about the jingles and ads and
stuff like that that they usually play
the regional nationally and it was just
thinking about how down here in West
Palm we don't really have any Long John
Silver's or red robin but they play the
commercials all the time it was that he

sonic commercials even having me down
here either and then about two or three
years later they started papa yes right

notice this to you will start getting
local regionalized ads right for
products that aren't there but maybe you
will come in the future the same thing
happen to me in my hometown in Orange
County there was no Sonic's but they
were commercials advertising the drinks

groundwork yeah let plan the season

nice flower if so you have such a
subconscious craving for Sonic yeah you
have to go Red Robin listen jack all
