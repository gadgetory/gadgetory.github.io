and this is a tablet battle that will
hold us over just before things start
really heating up it's a prize five foot
out between the samsung galaxy note 10.1
and apple's third generation ipad our
judges for this fight are senior editor
Donald Liberty Bell senior editor and
Eric the tank man Franklin and myself
all night long that will take all three
judges blind scores and average them out
to the nearest tenth each round the
final prize five score to be an average
of all rounds using the same system is
five rounds to the finish first one is
design the Galaxy Note 10.1 is one of
Samsung's most solid feeling tablets to
date but the problem is that it still
feels like it's plastic is dual silver
and white bezel design is a different
take that you might love or hate but
overall this is a good looking tablet
now the third gen iPad took a step back
with a slightly thicker body and a
heavier weight from the previous model
is still arguably the best-looking
tablet on the planet but unfortunately
Apple has regressed instead of improving
when it comes to this models design the
iPad still takes us around with the four
and the galaxy note gets a three point
three next rounds controls a user
interface what sets the Galaxy Note 10.1
apart from other tablets is the option
to use the S Pen Stylus to navigate its
TouchWiz interface on top of Ice Cream
Sandwich now the mini apps tray allows
you to swap your apps and kill apps with
this task manager plus you'll always get
that extra level of customization that
Android gives you but after using
jellybean extensively it just doesn't
compare and we'll have to wait for the
upgrade sometime in 2012 Apple's iOS is
still the most intuitive operating
system that gramma and the kids can use
its strength lies in its speed and
simplicity but it's multi-touch
navigation gestures and double tapping
the home button for quick access to
settings have added a little more
complexity now I can be honest and say
maybe I'm jaded because it's just not as
exciting to use but it's still the best
pick-up-and-play tablet OS the iPad gets
a 4.7 and the galaxy note gets a 3.7
so after averaging two rounds Apple
takes a big lead round three is features
the Galaxy Note brings a quad-core 1.4
gigahertz processor with 2 gigs of RAM
but when there's instances of choppiness
and lag the specs just don't matter now
4G version is coming later this year but
the biggest differentiating feature is
no surprise its S Pen Stylus the ability
to use a split screen with specific apps
like s note lets you take notes while
using another app like the video player
at the same time it's Photoshop Touch
app takes advantage of detecting the
pressure applied to the screen for
thinner or broader strokes
there's even an interface to turn your
handwriting into text instead of using
the touch keyboard it also brings an IR
blaster and Smart Remote app that allows
you to control your TV and a micro SD
card memory expansion is a great plus 2
now the iPads hardware brings a dual
core a 5x processor improved graphics
power and a 4G LTE option but it's 2048
by 1536 resolution Retina display blows
away the notes Meagher 1280 by 800
resolution
now there's AC mi out support with an
adapter but no storage expansion airplay
compatibility makes viewing your content
a breeze if you're an Apple freak with
an Apple TV but its ecosystem is its
greatest asset with its robust iTunes
and App Store that's still superior to
Android tablet offerings both tablets
shine here and we're handing out pours
to both sides next round is web browsing
to multimedia the Notes Chrome browser
is arguably the best tablet browser out
there even if it doesn't support flash
it also has a twist with web browsing
since it's one of the multi screen
supported apps even if it gives you a
lot smaller screen now you'll find a 5
megapixel rear camera that's solid but
not on the level of the iPads and the
Google Play Store is building a
significant library of content but
Samsung's
own media apps won't value multimedia
looks good but when you're competing
with a screen like the iPads is just not
going to look as good no matter what you
do now beyond the screen the iPad still
brings you the best apps available on a
tablet and airplay adds another level to
the multimedia experience if you
take advantage of it the iPads five
megapixel rear camera brings more
natural looking pictures even if I'm
against using an iPad for that and it's
1080p video capture is excellent now the
iPad takes another round with a perfect
five and the Galaxy Note 10.1 gets a
four
so after averaging four rounds the iPad
still leads the final round that decides
it all is performance the Gauss e note
is a solid performer but it still has
its moments of lag that you'll even see
in the split-screen mode now hopefully
jellybean fixes that but bottom line
it's not as smooth battery life is
excellent in our test at nine point six
hours of juice making it one of the
longest lasting Android tablets
available now the iPad has always been
the benchmark for battery life and the
iPad clocked in at an impressive 12
point eight hours in our video playback
test with 4G turn off its interfaces
snappier and consistently smooth and
it's overall one of the best performing
tablets we've ever had
Apple takes the final round with a 4.7
and Samsung gets a 4 so let's average
out all 5 rounds with a 3rd gen iPad
took an early lead and maintained its
dominance over the Galaxy Note 10.1 and
the iPad takes this battle 4 point 5 to
3 point 8 and is your prize fight winner
i'm brian song thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time for another
price
