you're ready to cut cable out of your
life entirely or maybe you're somewhere
in between whatever the case TiVo's
latest DVR aims to please all of the
above the box can record up to four
shows at once from traditional
over-the-air broadcast or you can get a
cable card from your provider to get all
the cable service you want over-the-top
content is available too from Amazon
Prime Netflix YouTube Hulu Plus and
others and if you have a 4k TV
it supports Ultra High Definition
streams from Netflix and YouTube with
Amazon Prime in the works TiVo's
onesearch lets you find programs across
all available services and it's one pass
feature combines both recordings and
streaming options in one folder so you
can always see what's available a new
skip mode lets you jump over commercial
breaks for recorded primetime shows with
one button press while a quick mode
speeds up playback with pitch corrected
audio so speech sounds normal
performance has been improved as well
including app launching which takes just
a few seconds when you first open one
but near instantly after that making
switching between TV and streaming
services fast the bolt also supports
TiVo's mini extenders if you want to
turn the bolt into a whole home solution
and the TiVo mobile app can be used to
mirror content to an Apple TV or Amazon
fire TV lastly it's built in 802 11 AC
Wireless can string to a smartphone or
tablet on your home network and
eventually out of home as well so far in
our testing everything works as promised
so the downside for most people will be
cost the bolt is priced at $300 with 500
gigs of storage or $400 with a thousand
gigs of storage that includes a year of
service but when that ends its $15 a
month or 150 dollars a year or $600 for
the life of the product you own the box
though which means you aren't tied to a
cable provider you can read more about
the DVR and cnet.com but if you're
looking for an all-in-one solution this
certainly seems like a good place to
start
I'm Josh Goldman Luci net thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
