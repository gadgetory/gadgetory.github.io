intense hacks that you maybe
participated in tell me about an
operation tunisia operation school it
started off as a anonymous operation
obviously the people of Tunisia were
like doing their thing you know on the
streets protesting and we're doing
awesome but the government started doing
some weird things with the incident of
communications
they started intercepting communications
by redirecting traffic for example if
you were inside Tunisia try to access
Yahoo or Facebook and try to access it
by HTTP what they're like low-level
routing would do is forward you either
to one of their fishing servers
basically or a middleman server or
finally they will just redirect you to
yahoo.com but without the https of
stripping that encryption mechanism what
that what that did was it compromised
you know probably thousands to millions
of Tunisians who were trying to access
the internet and communicate online
anyway even like you know stories of
rumors I mean I don't know who's
confirmed but there were two lesions
there were bloggers and all that getting
raided randomly like this randomly
getting rated and I would assume it's
because of this they were hijacking
traffic monitoring journalists and
bloggers and figuring out who's like
who's inciting riots or was assigning
the revolution and you guys obviously
didn't like that well anonymous it's
something like that but you know we had
like a subgroup quote internet fed so it
was like a little group before lowsec
and it was much broader it's like thirty
people in there a lot of random people
that shouldn't even be in there in the
first place but like you know one of my
mates from LulzSec actually created like
a grease monkey script or something to
redirect the redirects and so once the
you know it would it would redirect you
off to the insecure server or to like a
man-in-the-middle server it will
redirect you actually back to the
original real HTTP backs Yahoo server or
Facebook server that's what really
caught my interest I'm like wow you know
this government it's like I understand
they don't want this revolution you know
I understand that but now you're messing
with
Vasili users in that night now you plane
likes now your who super dictator like
now you're not even cool my books it's
time for war basically so then we moved
on to hacking the Prime Minister's
website apparently that was a big crush
to the government apparently because I
say apparently because their response
was so extreme as soon as we deface the
Prime Minister's website with a message
like this is anonymous we are legion we
don't you know forget they don't forgive
expect us
they basically firewalled the entire to
legion internet so if you were in the
United States or anywhere else outside
of Tunisia you would not be able to
access any sites within Tunisia but when
we spoke to Tunisia's in Tunisia they
said no it's fine and I said I could go
to the Prime Minister's website right
now is cool I seen this picture and at
this point there was a Tunisian activist
who you know was really into anonymous
and he said what can I do I'm inside
Tunisia so we had the bright idea of
well what would happen if and this goes
back to that first point I made earlier
how do you bypass a firewall so you make
it call you so we had this guy connects
through a like a TeamViewer a remote
desktop in connected to his machine from
his machine wery hacks the Prime
Minister's website cuz it the original
four ability was still open and so
imagine this right the guy is sitting
eyes computer watching a bunch of
hackers in this case it's a boy and some
other guy and he sees his mouse moving
around the screen typing into his web
browser exploiting a vulnerability
hacking the site grabbing like the
defacement message which was a like a
letter to tunisia and he got to witness
all of that in real time that was really
cool I can't imagine how it felt for him
but we react the Tunisian Prime
Minister's website internally from
inside Tunisia and at that point that's
when the Tunisian government began
completely shutting down internet very
similar to what each Egypt it during the
Egyptian revolution and the rest is
history
yeah well and then after that I mean the
final nail in the coffin
operation Tunisia after
you know we were all firewalled out of
Tunisia what else can we really do
besides you know just tweeting the story
and getting it out
so everybody's doing that they're doing
that whole publicity thing and pushing
the issue so I'm over here like okay
well I'm a security researcher you know
I've ordered machines and networks for
many years my time with anonymous is not
conclusive to my skills that I've been
doing this for mass amount of time so
one thing I did was I did a network-wide
security audit of Tunisia's
infrastructure and what I realized what
I found was that Tunisia's entire
government communications their entire
network for emails to back buries the
cellphone companies that were using the
embassy internet systems they all relied
on two DNS servers for the entire
infrastructure of the tunisian
government so i had to bring them down
and by bringing those two tunisian dns
servers down hitting it with like 50
gigabits per second or something i
literally like destroy the entire
infrastructure giving the tunisian
opportunity to probably do more because
at that point the government had no way
of communicating each other unless they
had you know analog phone systems which
I'm pretty sure they did but it really
causing a lot of problems I'm sure now
you said in the past then you know Sachs
with anonymous with a low second with
others that you were sloppy and
ultimately that's what resulted in the
FBI finding you can you tell me how were
you sloppy in what ways were they able
to track you down
ultimately well the biggest mistake I
made was even mess with anonymous in the
first place I mean Anonymous is cool the
idea is wonderful but the problem with
Anonymous is that it its major failure
is exactly what you see on Twitter they
centralize themselves compare anonymous
back on 4chan and now compare anonymous
now what's the difference all right
anyone of everyone a 4chan was just
anonymous there was no nicknames no
pseudonyms no Twitter's no IRC no sort
of public profile at all so if one guy
did a hack you don't know that guy is
from the hole in the wall this is
anonymous now when you know it was moved
to a certain IRC Network
it was move on to
I mean he gave it a lot of prominence
and it's not even communicate with
journalists directly now you could get
stories all you could you know do your
little PR propaganda whatever it is they
you know they were doing but you know in
left and left a lot of chances open for
mistakes in my case my biggest mistake
besides messing with anonymous not
messing with joining the idea was using
the nickname Sabu Sabu was a nickname
that I used a pseudonym that I used
since the 90s so I've also went to war
with other people in other groups from
the 90s on using that name so over the
years people collect the little tidbits
of information like oh he goes by Xavier
so I mean I had no problem with that
right because I as a security researcher
that was my name are you aware by
exhales which is my middle name
I went by Xavier and I really security
was research advisories exploits you can
find all my workings go online and type
in Xavier DeLeon or whatever or even go
to my old blog because I have set up
blog spot.com all right all my old
research is there not all of it but you
gotta see my exploits my local root
exploits they developed so usually the
nickname Samba was a major flaw in my
strategist and his strategy I didn't
attend assemble I've seen first
connected with anonymous using a
completely different name if you ask me
what the name is forgotten no it was
something random I probably would have
avoided all this drama had I used a
continue used the name but it was a
situation where like you know I was
using a shell server here in New York
and you know I had of several different
screens running one screen was running
our SSI or bit checks you know I see
client projects on F net and then I ran
another screen connected to and I'm not
the same that i was send him Nowell
basic no no so basically I had SAP over
here and I had read the name over here
so one of those nights so I'm like may
have been thinking I can lost my
connection to this server
reconnected I used my name Sabu because
that was my actual username on the
server then have you ever used bitch X
it'll it'll point back to the username
so you try to log onto IRC hop on IRC
using where you logged into the root
user you're gonna see that when you log
into the server is gonna try to use the
nickname roots right so in this case is
my name my username on the server which
was running solaris by those awesome old
solaris system since my nickname my
username was actually Sabu when it
connected to the anonymous IRC Network
it came up with Sabu and I kind of said
well that means to wait now it is what
it is I'm already logged so might as
well stick with it might as well stick
with it and once the FBI came to you
once they came to your door they put you
in a very difficult situation
and they they basically put me in a
situation where I had to choose between
my family and an idea now the idea is
beautiful I love the idea but I'm not
gonna choose you know two kids I'm not
gonna choose then the movement over to
kids I mean I'm sorry about that I'm
sorry that that boggles anybody's minds
but I'm pretty sure anyone with children
would agree that you would choose your
children over you know something as you
know as strange is that I mean there
were a group of strangers and I have a
lot of friends which I still have
friends there they're probably wait for
me to come back online and talk to them
about you know it's nothing personal
and how did the FBI monitoring work
because it at that point effectively
they started watching what you were
doing and asked you to be more let's
continue what you were doing but with
them watching how exactly did that
monitoring work well so yeah so those
back to that previous question and did
the whole the whole point was well keep
doing what it is that you doing mmm to
them that's the most important thing to
suddenly change my modus operandi and
start you know texting people like hey
can I have your number I want to call
you which I never did before
you know what have been strange so they
just simply said well keep doing with
what it is that you're doing and what's
gonna sit back and watch so really a
tail just watching and monitoring with
and it was like a Windows laptop and
then just had
the key logger and a screenshot taker
and you know it was all automated I'm
pretty sure was like a like I don't know
was a kernel rootkit that they has it
set up I can't really say for sure
because I didn't do a security audit of
the machine technically that's federal
property right so I don't want to sit
there to try to debug the software and
break-in and go to prison for this one
you know federal property did they
provide you of any other resources
servers or accounts or anything like
that to help what point you know they
provided servers for you know for use by
anybody and those servers that are not
being used by anybody you know it's kind
of funny how people talk about it well
he provided servers to you know the
hackers well he didn't use the service
it's like I provide it's not like I
wanted to provide it you know that
obviously it's part of my cooperation
agreement they provided a server hey you
guys want you to serve it by all means
what was it pushing it you know saying
but uh you know that's pretty much what
that entail just sitting there logging
and just keep doing what I'm doing and
that provided me an opportunity keep the
one I'm doing don't like hack the planet
and they really kind of encourage you to
do that and they said that you stopped
about 300 hacks of domestic targets
ultimately they were fine with you
hacking international targets is that
right well the thing is I wasn't acting
anymore I had to stop hacking mm-hmm
so all I could do is just be me and try
to push issues and work on operations
and keep them what it is that I was
doing before I even got arrested nothing
changed between me before my arrests and
me after my arrest anything changed was
that you know I had a situation where
ever the computer was logged which is
kinda ironic because most people they
got arrested anyway if you look at the
discoveries in the evidence they all had
IRC logging enabled you know it baffles
my mind
especially those guys from the UK it
finds computer full of IRC logs you know
you could you know you want to judge me
for having my computer log but you still
provide the same sort of evidence rather
you know it's a lot of like the
Apocrypha in regards to that but that's
pretty much really what happened just
