we're gonna take a look at the new Apple
TV the new model looks exactly the same
as the old one but inside it's got a
faster processor 1080p support and
there's a redesigned user interface the
look of the box is still the best I've
seen it's small it blends in with your
home theater and the power supply is
built into the box so there's no
annoying AC adapter or power brick
there's just a tiny white light on the
front that lets you know it's on and
that's it around the back there's an
HDMI port and optical audio output an
Ethernet port and a micro USB port
although the USB port is only used for
service and support there's also
built-in Wi-Fi for connecting to your
wireless home network so the outside of
the box isn't new but the user interface
is it's a new icon driven design and
when you scroll down it really makes
your TV look like a giant iPad if you're
looking at iTunes for movies or TV shows
there's also a new menu bar across the
top letting you quickly access useful
categories like purchase content and
search itunes on the Apple TV is even
better than before with both your movies
and TV show purchases saved in the cloud
for rewatching the selection of both
movies and TV shows is excellent and HD
content looks fantastic although when we
tested it against the older 720p Apple
TV you really couldn't tell a big
difference between the two the big
downside is that for HD content you're
looking at paying three dollars per
episode to buy TV shows and movies cost
around five dollars to rent in between
10 to 20 dollars to purchase so it
really adds up fast if you watch a lot
of content outside of iTunes there
aren't nearly as many content options
Netflix is still there as well as MLB TV
and YouTube but there's no Amazon
Instant Hulu Plus Pandora HBO GO all of
which are available on the competing
Roku LT for half the price the Apple TV
also isn't as capable of playing back
all kinds of different digital media
formats so if you have a lot of MKV and
DivX files you're gonna want to look at
something else like the Boxee Box or the
WD TV live well it doesn't have as many
content sources the Apple TV does have
another killer feature if you have other
Apple products airplay and let you take
almost any photo music or video you have
on your iOS device and stream it right
to your
TV so if you're listening to Pandora on
your phone you can play it on your Apple
TV even though it doesn't have a native
Pandora app and outside of airplay the
Apple TV also works with other Apple
cloud-based services like iTunes Match
and Photo Stream so altogether if you're
invested in the Apple ecosystem and you
already own an iPhone or iPad the Apple
TV is pretty much a must-have gadget at
this point although if you're not into
Apple products you'll get a better value
from competitors especially the Roku LT
and if you've already got an old Apple
TV that looks like this don't worry
about upgrading as they offer almost the
same exact experience I'm Matthew
moscovia from CNET and this is the Apple
TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
