layer now this one is the stereo
lithography 3d printer and that means it
has this print platform on top here that
goes down to the resin tank here and
pull up a three object now that is a
very long process these chests be set
right here for example took some 20
hours to finish but it's worth the wait
because the printer can actually make
very very high quality object as you can
see here now the resin is very sticky as
you can see and that means the object
here need to be cleaned with alcohol
before you can use them the good news is
that the printer comes with this
finished kit right here for that and me
I have no problem alcohol at all okay
maybe a little bit now apart from chess
pieces the printer can bring other
things to like larger chess pieces I
like my queen extra large please or this
small little butterfly right here
basically any object of size five point
seven by five point seven by six point
nine inches the larger the longer it
takes to print now as you have seen the
print platform is removable or you
haven't seen however is the fact that
the resin tank here is also removable
and the resin cartridge right here is
very easy to replace and that means you
can suite material without having to
clean anything at all remember the only
one pre platform one cartridge and one
resin tank are included with the printer
now the printer is very easy to use the
hard parts to make it level now it has
four adjustable feet so it's kind of
tricky to make it stayed level and
stable at the same time but even if you
are clumsy you not take you more than
half an hour to get the printer here up
and run it it took me no more than five
minutes now the front touch screen here
really helped now the printer here can
work via USB or network both Y&amp;amp;Y five
are supported it won't really wear my
testing no hiccups at all not even one
single filtering within two way
that I used it but before you get too
excited it has one huge drawback the
price now the printer itself costs some
thirty five hundred dollars and any
extra cartridge like this one right here
will cost you are not under $50 to three
hundred dollars depending on the color
of the type of material so obviously
it's much cheaper to buy stuff
ready-made at the store but if you have
something very unique to MIT which is
why you should get a 3d printer to begin
with this form to here will make it
worth your hard earned money and by the
way if you're wondering what I had to
say about chess-playing well not much
really there's only one thing which is
the only thing I say at the very end of
each match i play and that is checkmate
and that's because I'm double or this
has been the first look at the form to
3d printer from foam lamps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
