to for the first time the second member
of the iPad pro family an entirely new
iPad pro based around a nine point seven
inch Retina display and it weighs less
than 1 pound we call it a true tone
display a true tone display measures the
color temperature of ambient light and
adjusts this display to match it has two
new 4 channel ambient light sensors that
measure both brightness in color
temperature digital devices emit light
and that light has the same color
temperature no matter where it is so the
color cast isn't right it doesn't match
paperwhite well except now if it is a
true tone display it does no matter
where you use it it automatically senses
the color temperature of the light and
becomes warmer or cooler and matches
paperwhite and is really natural to use
it has our fastest chip ever an a9 x
this is a third-generation 64-bit chip
over three billion transistors it's made
with a 3d FinFET architecture if you
don't know what that is it is
unbelievably state-of-the-art and in the
new iPad pro we've put our most advanced
camera yet it's a 12 megapixel iSight
camera with its focus pixels true tone

processor built into the a9 x and you
can shoot 4k video with it so right on
