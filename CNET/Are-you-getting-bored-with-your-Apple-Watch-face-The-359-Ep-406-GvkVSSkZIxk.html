Alfred Aang are you an apple watch fan
do you like watch faces Scott sign has a
nice commentary on why Apple needs to
create a watch face store and I have two
minute an Apple watch
and while the watch faces here are nice
they're fairly limited and it's kind of
it boggles the mind that it's been a
couple years now an Apple still hasn't
let third-party developers come in and
create their own watch faces so I've
never had an Apple watch so when I read
Scott's commentary I just thought wait
that's really weird they don't do that
that just seems like something launched
and yeah it's available on Android a lot
of the the sort of the the fashion
brands have created their own
smartwatches using Android typically
focus on the customization of watch
faces making watch faces sort of front
and center it's really the only way to
customize this timepiece yeah Apple
keeps it fairly limited that's really
annoying I don't I really don't know why
they would do something like that is it
so that they can keep it like within
their own like ecosystem or something or
my guess is they wanted to create a
consistent experience and the watch face
because it's got access to complications
or options for what kind of
notifications you get Apple wand to kind
of keep everything locked down which I
mean that's kind of their bread and
butter right like everything's locked
down but that they have quality control
and quality assurance on that stuff
right but yeah they basically don't want
their watch face store to have a whole
bunch of ugly watch faces hmm so there's
early word that the latest beta version
of watch OS 4 might support the
reporting watch faces and then there's
WDC which is less than two weeks from
now we might get to see more from watch
OS 5 that's weird that they wouldn't
want you to have ugly watch faces I mean
like I paid for this watch if I want to
be ugly like limit there to be ugly I
want the right to have an ugly watch
face so we want to talk about Mark
Zuckerberg who is later on and really
just about half an hour is heading or
he'll be meeting with the EU to discuss
once again Cambridge analytically the
whole data breach scandal and really
answering more questions from the EU
Parliament this whole saga has been very
interesting considering that he turned
down the UK Parliament and then he
originally wanted to turn down the EU
Parliament and then through some
conversation
later he basically said yes I'm going
and then this meeting was also supposed
to be behind closed doors right and then
they like it talked about it again and
it was like okay we're gonna livestream
this now it really shows that they're
like these pressures are mounting for
phase absolu birth absolutely and I
think the EU in particular I think
they're gonna be a little bit more savvy
then then our US counterparts I mean
they've all this issue I think a lot
more closely I think the questions are
gonna be more pointed and I think suck
is not gonna be able to get off as
easily as he did in the US I have a
feeling that the hearing in the EU
Parliament we've much more focused on
GDP are considering that that does come
from the EU there'll be more focused on
that and privacy issues I don't think
it'll be as politically charged as the
one in Congress was where they're asking
about like you know censorship of
political views or anything like that no
I think the the folks in the EU will be
definitely more laser focused on privacy
as the main issue Oh
lastly Alfred u euro a story about Intel
Microsoft disclosing yet another flaw
run through what what is this new thing
with Florida so do you remember specter
and meltdown from I dearie cuz those
names are awesome yeah so that was a
security flaw that had to do with Intel
chips going all the way back to like the
last two decades and not just Intel
chips any basically any chip like this
affected like Apple like iOS devices and
basically anything so like it affected
Intel AMD and arm chips and the idea was
that there was a security flaw that let
an attacker like access parts of your
CPU that shouldn't be accessed because
for security reasons so they discovered
in a new variant back in February but
they announced it yesterday when they
had the patches available for okay and
the idea and this was discovered by
Microsoft and Google their project zero
team and it was basically uses the same
concepts but it's a different variant
that accesses a different part of your
CPUs memory so the patches for it are
available now but they do expect another
slowdown of about two to eight percent
with that yay awesome all right well
that's all the time we have for more of
these stories chicken sounds seen it I'm
Roger Cheng I'm alfred Aang thanks for
listening
all right thanks everybody for joining
us for the recording of the audio
podcast that's a conclusion that's a
wrap if you will if we're going to talk
about something we've shown the industry
that's right so stick around we're gonna
take your questions and comments in the
chat you can go ahead and send those in
now in the meantime let's go ahead and
start with one from Matthew - or who we
can always count on for great con yeah -
I'm not in the iOS ecosystem so I don't
have an Apple watch but it doesn't seem
like there's any innovations going on
and other smartwatches either is my
perception true yeah I would say so I
think it's kind of lagged a bit I mean
Google came out with Android wear now
they've shortened it to wear OS I feel
like that's the biggest innovations they
change the name yeah that you know they
have introduced things like watch latest
looking on the Android side but the the
innovations have definitely been
stagnated a bit I think they the last
year I think Google spent time trying to
invest or trying to partner with
different companies it wasn't just you
know LG or actually see here the phone
makers making these watches is more
about Michael Kors and Movado these
kinds of fashion brands that were
focusing on building watches and they're
not necessarily into innovation right
they just want to they want to make a
good time piece that runs on a fairly
stable software so it seemed like it was
about kind of getting some of the kinks
out and polishing where OS as opposed to
making any big innovative leaps yeah I
don't know if like there's a lot of
space for like massive innovation and in
smartwatches in particular I think in
the same way that like with iPods there
really wasn't like okay it plays music
like how many different ways can we more
music can we innovate it you know I
think they really just want like a
really successful product that works I'd
I thought the ability to call people on
the latest Apple watch is really cool
though but like you know from what I
understand it doesn't function all that
well you have the one that can make
calls all right yeah cellular access you
were able to make calls before if it was
linked to your phone but this one gives
you the ability to do it without the
phone and I actually don't really
separate from my phone
so I haven't used that that frequently I
would say I mean the biggest innovation
that I think everyone is looking for for
smartwatches are watches that actually
lasts a lot longer than they should or
that they did you know as well as
watches are a lot less bulky right
there's the idea that you could have a
watch with the standalone cellular
connection still means that it's fairly
bulky it doesn't last very long and tell
the industry figures out how to get past
these problems I think that smartwatches
are still gonna be kind of that niche
area did you ever have to carry around
like a battery pack like for your you
know how you have a battery pack for
your phone yes no I just don't like
attach it to your arm and then it'll go
about two days so it's not it's not
terribly I don't need to take it off and
charge it at night every single day
although I tend to just for say so about
the battery life of like a razor phone
which razor fat is accurate the Motorola
oh yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah so I mean
it's it's not great but you know I know
some of the fitbit phones or fitbit
watches run a little bit longer like
those the kind of basic Fitbit wearables
they go like a whole week right so until
we get to that point I feel like people
are gonna be still a little reluctant I
remember I was really excited about the
calling feature though because I
remember when they announced I'm just
gonna drop my phone and only used like
the watch as a phone and then it turned
out that it wasn't that great yeah and
also just yeah doesn't last that long
you don't get all your apps right yeah
listen that industry was dead on arrival
in my opinion what the watch watch is
it's just kind of a lame gimmick and if
you can make use of it good for you if
you're too lazy to take your phone out
of your pocket but otherwise I don't see
them contributing much so there was a
really interesting story from quartz
that came out today about the reporter
had been noticing all these different
like people using their smart watches
and like the service industry so like
his waiter yes my watch yeah TSA at the
airport I've been noticing about myself
too like if I go to like a Salvation
Army like all the employees there have
like Apple watch security guards had
Apple watches and the their explanation
was like when you're working a job like
this you you're not making your phone
exactly
so like it's a better way to keep that
with like employees at Chipotle or like
those types of restaurants were there
basically they're on there
their feet they're working constantly
they they almost always have some sort
of SmartWatch yeah it's there that's the
only way to stay in touch with people
yeah that's interesting
all right I'll give you that one let's
take some more questions from the chat
from scott maya with major developers
leaving Apple watch behind Twitter
Instagram Amazon etc do you think a
watchface store would actually bring
back big players or would it be too
little too late
that's not a question I mean I don't
know if it'll actually bring back
developers and it may not be developers
they could they could create tools that
basically hobbyist can be like I think
the idea is just getting more people in
general investing and creating new Apple
watch faces just sort of makes the
experience a little bit better for users
and it's sort of this flywheel effect
right more people create better watch
faces it becomes a more attractive
product and that attracts more
developers or third-party developers to
create those watch faces so I don't I
think it's it's it's kind of cyclical
that way yeah can you get the Goldeneye
watch face yet on on your watch because
I remember that was like a big reason
why like half of my friends wanted
SmartWatch that was available for brand
right yeah yep yeah no it's not there I
mean I got I got Toy Story characters
and I got Mickey oh boy
yeah what you're saying is you use your
watch to entertain your kid oh my god
absolutely the one there's one good big
item one of the key features I don't
have it now the Galaxy S or gear s3 with
the rotating bezel that was probably
like the the killer app for me cuz my
kid would just spin the bezel around as
I was changing his diaper yeah it was
amazing I was still a standout feature
for me all right more question time from
Michael Brown the Apple watch is nice
I've owned one and its popularity says
only two things in my eyes majority of
consumers will buy anything Apple market
hard and the SmartWatch market is really
really bad and I think that's kind of
along the lines of my thinking where
this is just kind of stale and it
started stale and it's only gonna keep
getting stale err I mean I would say too
sooner said that's pretty accurate like
people will just buy Apple products no
matter what
I guess I'm guilty of that I mean I see
more and more Apple watches out there I
don't see as many you know Android wear
devices move Auto watches LG watches is
it because the Apple watch is a lot more
recognizable though like maybe they are
wearing them but like you can't really
no no I you could tell a SmartWatch by
just so the fact that the screen is
usually dark and I typically Goodkin
eyeballing that stuff and I see a lot of
Apple watch to your point a lot of folks
in the services yeah to use them and and
I see them among friends a family but I
just I don't see a lot of Apple watch
users probably an Android wear users
more questions let's take runoff from
Griff Master 61 do you think Apple will
give developers access to make
third-party watch faces at WWDC this
year I think that's what Scott Stein's
hope before
and finally I'm definitely hoping for a
little bit more flexibility in
customizing how the Apple watch will
look cuz it's that's the thing I think
Android I think Google got that and
they're in their uh their push to kind
of make watch faces more of a priority
like this is the only way to customize
this watch this thing look the same it
looks like every other person's watch
the watch face is the only way to kind
of stand out so is there like a watch
face that you have in mind that you want
I don't know I just I think I want
options okay but the golden I'm a guy
I've got four or five different Apple
watch faces set that I kind of scroll
back and forth on but like I'd like more
options hmm yeah I think Goldeneye would
be my call definitely that's a good
watch face I'm sure your battery life
though like the health bar goes down
actually that would be pretty amazing
yes can you even name another cool
looking watch like mint Angier that's
right or like didn't the Power Rangers
have they always know that well they had
the communicators that's what it was but
there was one season where the Morpher
was on their wrist and not on their belt
or something to remember that it might
have been Wild Force I'm not sure all
right I'm sure I'm just gonna take my
cell phone also lost in space they also
had had to had it on their watches a
loss of space time
might have also had lots of space the
power interesting yes of course right
that we were talking about the Netflix
show losses space you have a child
you're going to need to learn this not
for another decade he's not gonna need
to know about power ranges for a long
time Dec you know yeah people stopped
watching Power Rangers when they're like
eight oh really
yeah I stuck it yeah I don't know I
study you guys are so you guys are still
talking about it so clearly it's longer
than eight years yes
dude I'm 32 I still watch it alright a
couple more questions just amount of
time to cover a couple more from APEC
watch Series three can work as a
standalone not very well yeah but it can
yeah well there ever be a time when we
think the watch will completely replace
the phone no no I agree it's I mean it's
the screen is too small it's great as a
complementary device I don't know what
you think I'm hopeful I would really
like for it to I like I would really
like the technology to be there for me
to finally drop my phone because I think
that there's like a whole generation of
people that are out there that do
recognize like phone addiction I guess
in the sense of you know I don't want to
be attached to my phone all the time so
let me put something on my wrist so yeah
I would be addicted to my watch not my
phone yeah the idea is more so like
you're spending less time like you're
not boggled down as much like it would
be much harder for me to respond to an
email like on my watch then the phone
and I hope that there's eventually a
cultural shift where like we're not
expected to be like on all the time and
like so but and I hope that the watch
like brings us there because when you're
on your phone now like you're always
expected to be doing stuff like that but
like like both of you have just said I
think people really like the ability or
like read and you know watch videos on
their phones too much for them to like
just switch their watches all the time
like the screen being less it may be
broadcast some sort of holographic
display and yeah my real future tech
stuff there what yeah I mean I was
thinking about this yesterday and the
day before too because like I was
thinking about like when I get home I
don't look at my phone or like a
computer or anything like for the eight
hours that I'm home like oh really yeah
I like I was thinking I was like I like
I cook and then I like clean the house
and I
play with my cats and then go sleep that
sounds like a really fascinating low
rate lawyer yeah yeah so I was like I
don't really do anything like I dunno I
check my phone but largely because of
work otherwise you're right I probably
would be watching the expanse or
something
geeky phone let's back it up real quick
let's take a look at this from different
semantics taking apart the concept that
phone doesn't really mean phone anymore
let's look at this as a phone could your
watch paired with a pair of wireless
earbuds replace your telephoning I mean
that's what Apple wants you to do if
they're watching like their air pods I
mean essentially they take email and
social out of the equation screw the
screen it couldn't work now largely
because of what we talked about battery
life is still an issue like if I were
just leave my phone home and go out and
just use my watch I think it could kind
of I mean it could work except for the
fact that yeah I would be constantly
concerned about battery life I don't
like you just and you don't really make
phone calls anymore I do make phone
calls I'm an old person yeah well people
make phone calls yeah and I was just
thinking that like I don't I wouldn't
want to have to have like a headphones
on every time I make a phone call I part
of the conveniences like you just put it
at your ear but I'm also like I'm aware
that this looks kind of dumb I do this
all the time hey hello that being said
though back on the the serviceworker
stuff with smart phones I did remember
one time when I was shopping at a
goodwill somebody was talking on their
like phone there on the phone on me you
could hear the conversation yeah it
could she had ear pods I remember that
was one of the key points to Scott's
review I think initial reviews like if
you're in the Apple ecosystem all the
way we're talking about ear pods Apple
watch iPhone like it's a pretty
fantastic experience yeah actually it
all fits really well it's super
integrated the only problems get the buy
into all that stuff yeah so and I don't
have air pods so I don't I do do one of
these things but it kinda reminds me of
like Knight Rider and I'm talking to kit
so I feel pretty cool about that also I
think the fact that like I know we were
just talking about like screen size and
like watching videos and stuff but I
also think people have gotten really
attached to the fact that they have a
camera everywhere they go now yeah and
like yeah until you can take photos with
your watch - I don't think and then well
the original Samsung gear actually did
have a camera built into it and it was
super creepy they took it out because it
came off as creepy like I remember Scott
was reviewing it and he like came into
my office and he snapped a photo with
his watch and I felt kind of violated
was like I guess why what are you doing
even if he had done that with a phone I
probably would have felt okay with it
but the fact that he did with his watch
and his wristband he's like something
pretty creepy and then they took it out
so I don't know if cameras are ever
gonna come back to watches because
there's some sort of creep factor yeah
it's kind of like the Google glass yeah
yeah exactly remember when it was weird
when people would just shove their phone
in your face you know what the hell are
you doing they're taking a picture ball
what I mean was I think that's still
weird I mean I'm not introducing the
behavior I'm saying when that was a new
thing like people like don't just come
up to you and take your photo without
like asking or anything really I know
that story alright almost out of time
let's take one more for Michael Brown
what is the key feature on the Apple
watch or a SmartWatch that you
personally believe makes them a thing to
buy I can't
myself really name anything that I'd
want on my wrist I don't like wearing
things on my wrist in general so I've
avoided this entire culture subculture
I guess the only benefit would be the
quick access to weather I'd rather have
an echo on my wrist I guess I would say
for me I got it for notifications but I
found moat the most useful thing is the
reminder to stand up once an hour it
tells you that yeah if you know if you
if you if it'll know if you've been
sitting there for nearly an hour I'll
remind you to get up and walk
that's kind of nice do you do that I do
I'm like I get up and walk around like I
realized I've been sitting I didn't even
have like two hours strained like I need
to get up and walk and how often do you
use it to tell time have you ever caught
yourself like wanting to know Tom and
you pull out your phone yes especially
the early days it's kind of gone away
but because that's like muscle memory
it's been years in the making so I have
gotten better at turning my wrist and
looking at the time now but I really
don't I was like I pulled out my phone
what am i doing good god okay so this
part is like when you go to reach for
your phone your watch gets stuck on your
pocket watch Brian the time telling
feature is clearly not one of the killer
features on the watch no okay no all
right almost out of time let's switch
gears real quick Matthew dacher asks has
Intel or AMD made any comments about
when Spectre end meltdown will be fixed
in the hardware Alfred
yeah they said that they're they've
released the patches to the vendor so
they didn't release two patches
themselves so if you have like a Dell
computer or something like that they
released it to Dell and then it's up to
them to send it out the interesting
thing with this patch is that it's
default it's off by default like oh
you'll have to the vendors and you have
to choose to turn it on because of like
performance impact it's like it's really
weird that they're gonna make you choose
like okay would you rather have a slower
computer or one that's like potentially
insecure oh my gosh yeah well people
were gonna choose to really be the slow
computers coming people are probably
gonna choose for it to just be insecure
yeah that's kind of sad yeah I mean
that's how like that's the thing about
security though we're like if it's
something that inconveniences you like
right people are like more likely
they'll say they're concerned about it
but you're right though oh yeah behind
closed doors you look out I'll take the
risk
yeah they're like there's so many like
bad passwords out there but the idea is
like okay I'm not gonna remember this
thing with like a million different my
passwords one two three four it's very
convenient so you know but yeah people
most of the times people will like
always choose convenience over security
which
is like a dilemma so does this flaw will
this affect future generations of chips
or they've kind of that kind of phasing
okay yeah so at least there's that
newer computers won't have this issue
but it seems like a terrible choice so
like slow computer or vulnerability to a
hack like yeah people are ability to
hack so not great all right any last
questions up lastly from Josh Boyd
let's give him the option how likely is
the pixel watch coming out this year oh
I don't know I'm you know I was much
higher on that last year and I don't
know like they've been so quiet on the
Smart Watch front recently that I'm a
little hesitant to make a call on I mean
I think there's a chance I don't know
how likely it would be but like you can
say that about anything like it is a
chance for anything but like that would
say so it's a low likelihood for me they
were pretty quiet about like the pixel
buds sure like I had no clue about and
there's like here we go we have this
thing so I mean there's like I said it
is just because they're quiet doesn't
mean that they're not like working on
something but it's true yeah totally
closed things out we're gonna take a few
things into consideration for the
wishlist at WWDC buckle up for this apec
thinks that maybe we can get a
smartphone that runs off you know your
body's kinetic energy until you die and
then Scott Wyatt says it's Apple so at
WWDC they'll have a major announcement
of more watchbands and I don't that is
wrong actually I know that's half joking
but that's totally legit I'm sure it'll
be another her mez watchband for $1000
yeah no one will buy and in closing
thoughts just want to throw it a couple
of quick nice trivias here on this date
1973 Ethernet was invented by Bob
Metcalfe also this was the release date
of pac-man in 1980
