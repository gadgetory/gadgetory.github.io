and we're gonna take a look at Roku's
line of budget streaming video players
this includes the $50 Roku LT the $60
Roku one and the $80 Roku two which are
all currently available all of these
boxes have a similar design there's
small glossy and they sloped towards the
front giving them a sleek look
they're not super compact like the
Google chromecast nor are they quite as
sleek as the Apple TV but they're
good-looking boxes especially for
something that'll sit under your TV
unlike the flagship Roku 3 all three
also have analog video ports on the back
so you can still use them with older TVs
of course they also have HDMI as well as
built-in Wi-Fi to connect to your home
network
the purple Roku LT is the cheapest model
at 50 dollars and it's only available at
online retailers it includes a standard
remote and it's a good one with the
simple layout and convenient buttons to
jump directly to services like Netflix
and Amazon Instant like all Roku boxes
you get access to a huge library of
services including Netflix Amazon
Instant HBO Go Hulu Plus Pandora MLB TV
Amazon Cloud Player Spotify and Rdio
although note that there's still not a
dedicated YouTube channel on the Roku
the LT also has Roku's great
cross-platform search feature so you can
see what service is a specific movie or
TV show is available on the big
difference with the Roku LT is it's
limited to 720p video output which makes
it a good fit for smaller TVs where you
won't notice the difference as much for
10 dollars more you get the $60 Roku one
which comes in black and is nearly
identical to the Roku LT except it adds
full 1080p output for $80 you can get
the Roku 2 which adds dual band Wi-Fi
for more reliable streaming from
compatible routers plus it comes with
this great remote the remote works for
your Wi-Fi direct so you don't need to
point it at the Roku to control it plus
it has a headphone jack on the side just
plug in the included earbuds and your TV
automatically mutes so you can listen to
your streaming video without disturbing
anyone else the Roku 2 is an
especially great value if you love the
nifty remote on the Roku 3 but you don't
need all the bells and whistles that it
offers but even though these cheaper
Roku boxes are great values for most
buyers I still think the $100 Roku 3 is
worth the extra money it has a lot of
geek friendly features like an Ethernet
jack an SD card slot a USB port and a
motion control remote but the real
reason it's better is it has a faster
processor it's not a huge difference
from the Roku 2 but it is noticeable and
we think for just $20 more it's worth it
especially for a device you'll probably
use all the time there's also the Apple
TV in the Google chromecast to consider
which are good options if you're heavily
invested in the Apple or Android
ecosystem but if you like what Roku
offers these budget boxes are all good
values especially for secondary
locations where you may not need
everything that the Roku 3 offers I'm
Matthew moscovia and this was a quick
look at Roku's budget streaming video
players</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
