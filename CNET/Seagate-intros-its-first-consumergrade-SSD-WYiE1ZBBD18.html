something today even never seen before
that's right but the longest time I've
been bugging seagate to make something
else other than the traditional hard
drive and today in an extreme effort to
make me happy is introduced a very first
is first solid state drive for consumer
the seagate 600 now this new solid state
drive here come in the standard 2.5 inch
design similar to that of a normal
laptop hard drive and that means it can
fit in any laptop or desktop computer
physically and that's one thing very
special about this new drive and that is
it come in the regular seven millimeter
thick which I have right here and it's
also available in the five-member thick
that I don't have which make me cut
unhappy because I'm so used to having
everything but that's okay because the
difference in thickness that then change
the drive capacity or performance both
virgins come in three capacity 120 gig
240 geek &amp;amp; 4 80 gigs that are slated to
offer up to 500 megabyte per second in
sequential read and up to four hundred
megabyte per second in sequential write
in random access it offer up to 80,000 I
ops according to Seagate the new see get
sick of the drive is the first solicit
drive that require about the same power
consumption as a regular laptop hard
drive as spin at 5400 rpm and that's
quite a lot and that means the drive
here is probably most suitable for a
desktop than for laptops now to make up
the fact that it forget to send me the
five millimeter thick Virgin of the
Seagate sick hard drive seagate send me
something else and that is the Seagate
signal pro solid state drive now this
dry is very similar to the seagate 600
but it's a lot faster has longer life
endurance but it's also a lot more
expensive now the question is how
expensive is expensive and I don't know
which really make me unhappy because I'm
used to knowing everything but I will
soon and so will you if you go read the
full review SF com of the Seagate
sikander drive
but the fastest way to Phi the review is
follow me on twitter facebook or google+
because i'm very fast at posting my
content that I believe that's good for
the world and that's because I'm dome
low and this has been a very quick look
at the very first solid state drive from
seagate the seagate 600 with a hint on
the seagate 600 pro</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
