the spiritual successor to the
automaker's SLR and SLS supercars
only now which sort of evolved into a
super sports grand tourer
meant to compete with the likes of the
911 and the Audi r8 now viewed in
profile it looks to me like the Porsche
911 is the most direct competitor of
those two models the GTS and it share
very similar proportions and a very
similar roofline and if you walk around
back it even kind of looks like
Mercedes's whole sill ripped off the
911s rear taillight cluster
however Mercedes has chosen not to hang
the engine over the rear end like the
Porsche or over the rear axle like the
Audi instead it's gone with a front
amidships configuration for its v8 that
means the engine sits ahead of the
driver but behind the front axle that's
how we end up with this extremely long
and exaggerated front hood and one of
the biggest differences between the GTS
and its predecessors is the doors the
GTS s door is open and closed like this
not like this not like this but like
this these are not billionaire doors
people
humorous pop-culture references aside
super sports grand tourers like the AMG
GT are as much about drama as they are
about outright performance so the lack
of dramatic doors to step down to
regular doors is well a bit
disappointing for this generation
fortunately there's plenty of drama to
be had coming out of the tailpipe
especially in this race mode we're just
going to put the active exhaust in its
loudest most aggressive setting
we've also got Sport Plus sport and
comfort settings that are going to allow
you to dial down the performance and
aggression from fast and furious down to
daily driver acceleration from the v8
engine is locomotive like that is to say
that it is smooth it is strong and well
it's loud and the handling of this grand
tourer even in its most comfortable mode
is going to be pretty firm the car stays
really flattened the turn then gives you
really good feet of the pants feedback
coming up through the chassis and into
the sport bucket seats steering on the
other hand is a bit over boosted and
doesn't offer as good fingertip feel as
I would like but that does kind of help
the car feel a little less twitchy and a
little more planted what I do like is
that the steering is very direct and
weights up nicely when you chuck it into
a turn and you can really sort of feel
the vehicle working around you so the
state of the pants feel sort of makes up
for the lack of fingertip feel in this
vehicle
firstly pink it's gonna be with that
very long hood we've got out friend
which can make nuvaring in very tight
quarters a bit tricky you've kind of got
to get used to having the equivalent of
the length of a smart fortwo between the
steering wheel and the Mercedes logo on
the hood the other problem is going to
be with the rear quarter visibility the
blind spots on this vehicle are a little
bit bigger than I'd like but to its
credit there's not a whole lot of
vehicle back there to keep track of
ergonomics are good they're not Porsche
good but this is a very comfortable car
all the controls are where you'd like
them with one exception that's going to
be the shifter which is located way back
here and probably the worst bit of real
estate on the center console with an
automatic transmission and paddle
shifters you're not going to be touching
it a whole lot when you drive around so
even that is a little bit forgivable I
know no-one came here to talk about fuel
efficiency so I'll just say that during
about 250 miles of testing I've averaged
about 18 miles per gallon which is
pretty good for a vehicle this powerful
when you consider the way that I've been
driving regardless of which setting you
find yourself in the GTS does a really
good job of making the driver feel
awesome and making the drive feel
special but it doesn't really feel like
a race car even when you put it in the
race mode you really start tossing this
car around it starts to feel a bit like
an apex Road car which is a good thing
it's very comfortable the drive is very
relaxed you can go ridiculously fast
this car but I don't know if I'd want to
go ridiculously fast on a race track the
2016 Mercedes AMG GT is a car that will
turn heads everywhere you go both with
its will gorgeous looks and with it's
extremely loud exhaust note the thing
that I like most about this car is the
way that it makes you feel if you give
the GTS enough road it will make you
feel like a race car driver on the
street even if it doesn't necessarily
back it up with race car performance it
is a super sports car in the truest
sense of the word later this year
Mercedes will also launch a GT with no s
that's a little bit more toned down with
a little less power and the gt3 version
for those looking for something
race-ready pricing for those hasn't been
announced but we expected they'll
bracket this Brut in the suit nicely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
