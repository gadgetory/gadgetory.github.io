yes yeah we feel like we're kind of
kindred spirits because we like to say
be good humans on the show and you guys
really put out a message of positivity
and a lot of your music yeah so fun and
it's so you just want to go out and hug
random people like that you should and
be good humans is so totally our message
we try to drive that as much as possible
we're all about that love how about that
one it alive yeah i love the we saw a
little taste of your video on the on the
way back from from break and you guys
have very positivity in the videos too
yeah well we try to make people feel
good we hope that if people leave a show
or turn off the record feeling better
than they did before they put the record
on or came to the show then we did our
job literally the exact cville that we
have as long as you feel happier after
you're done watching this tomorrow dealy
your we've accomplished our goal times
it sounds cool yeah we have cool jobs
you guys we all have we're like voltron
ting right now so it should be like
double the positivity yeah there's so
much positivity in the studio right now
it's almost like a gas leak I'm
concerned nobody should light any
matches or any spark I'm all about that
kind of fire you guys are a legit la
band right yeah well you guys we met we
talked about this right before we came
to the studio you guys have known each
other for ever valley kids long time uh
yeah we grew up in the valley with a
handful of the other boys in the band
and two Midwestern transplants in the
band but mostly we all grew up together
we did theater together when we were
super young amazin very la jewelry
musicals yeah love music yeah okay so
you have to tell me what you guys did
well one was called Cedric sharp in the
case of the missing domination original
also they were riveting stuff this year
yeah absolutely a Cedric sharp in the
case of the missing donation and we were
also in five phony fairies hills
and phobia always play sound like super
great band names right really a music
festival plays that we full of fans
named after plays with time that's how
you know it's actually LA because it's
not like you did grease and you know
it's people wrote original stuff to
please the kids who were writers they
were really into being writers to know
and they were actually pretty good the
songs were good I still remember the
song so they must have been decent you
know well from okay so from the all of
that when you were younger to what you
guys are doing now you're you're
recording full-length studio albums this
is this will be your third one yes
September you guys are really excited
about that yeah is it that did we hear
it correctly that you guys just finished
recording like yesterday just finished
yeah ventilation thank you we're very
excited about it yeah third record a lot
of bands don't even get to make a third
record at some point so we're just
really excited to be building our
collection and you know yeah working on
a stache continuing on ya dream yeah
it's great to be you know a real working
touring band where and you guys have a
really strong and connected fanbase like
thank you that's a thing a lot of people
are you know maybe separate it a little
bit from their fanbase like you know a
Beyonce like you feel like maybe you
know we are fans of beyond to go beyond
I make such fans of us you guys are fans
of your fam we love our fans we have a
really special relationship with them
and like with things like Twitter these
days it's like we can go to a show and
be like oh it's super indie kid we don't
even a real name we just know his
Twitter handle and well we know is maybe
now's right but that's a it's an
interesting way for us to make
connections with people that you can do
10 years ago even yeah we live in this
day and age exactly where we can meet
and contact directly these people who
are responding to our music we're buying
our music we're coming to our shows and
form our own relationship with them so
it's it's really special thing to tap
into and you you're able to sort of be
musicians in the digital age in a
completely different way because you
have a one-to-one relationship with your
audience right there's no no it's really
special totally we we can tweet out you
know hey what songs do you guys really
want to hear on this next tour and they
can help us write our set list which
we've needed help with so many times
Senate's great doesn't be like well you
know what a lot of people on Twitter
want to hear this song so let's make
sure we put it in the set list it's also
a really interesting way to use social
media like I wouldn't necessarily think
of if you were in a band but then
something that makes so much sense once
yeah I really think about it well the
show is there's as much as it's ours we
want to make sure that they're getting
what they want out of it and and direct
communication is really great way to
accomplish that it helps us gauge what
songs people are into it sometimes that
we might have our favorites and what we
want it what we want to do in play but
it's nice to see what songs are people
are responding yeah through our socials
it's also cool so be on Twitter because
obviously that's like one of the biggest
what are some of your favorite social
media platforms right now in terms of
use like are you finding different types
of fans in different places yeah I'm all
about that snapchat life I'm all right
yeah you snapping like three times of
you watching here call me Katie Scorsese
because I liked loved making my little
snap story movie naps AZ yeah Katie
snaps AZ there you go and you should um
he will but uh yeah it's really fun to
just kind of put something out there and
know that there's an audience out there
who's who's following your story who's
engaging with it and it gives them this
way to kind of see behind the curtain to
look into our lives and to say like okay
well when they're not on stage this is
what it looks like this is what life on
the bus looks like and this is what like
backstage or like a preview of our new
music like we've been yapping just like
us you know someone's recording guitar
solo they can hear a little snippet of
it but you know then it goes away and
they're like ooh I'm here you want to
see what it's like to have your new song
sung by a tiger person right right
because some punk might want a face swap
and just pretend that you're one of your
other bandmates for the day it's really
not to mention when it's like early and
you're just feeling like you haven't
gotten that morning glow going yet you
just throw a filter on that morning go
here you filthy yeah dog filter everyone
looks good on the boat is good yeah
that's great are you guys are called the
Mowgli's yes we are very geeky and we
the reference how did you come to that
name uh so many reasons we often joke
that if we had known that our lives were
going to revolve around this project at
some point we probably would have
thought twice about the name but I'm
kind of glad we didn't because it just
suits us and it works just cuz nobody
can feed you after midnight now right
yeah well we're very inspired by you
know by the story by rudyard kipling and
by just the kind of energy of this dog
jungle book and and I know an gremlins
yeah it's all works as long as you think
of a crazy weird little critter when you
hear the name or it works ya know and
it's it's sort of that again like that
sort of it really does kind of play into
that character in the jungle book and
also in gremlins because it's like these
sort of carefree like well like they
just want to really just live their
lives have fun like it's their adorable
raised in the jungle like little wild oh
yeah all right speaking of young wild &amp;amp;
free you guys are about to embark on a
tour you starting Santa Barbara right
what what is the light the days and
weeks before a tour like how do you
prepare to go on tour it's it's will you
never feel like you're prepared first of
all we've been touring for about four
years strip pretty consistently for four
years straight we never feel prepared um
but a lot of lawyers will get right
before so you wanna make some family
time in before you go and yeah friends
and say you have your you have your
family like make all your favorite
dishes like yeah that you're gonna miss
out on I go all time in before how to
get that girl zombies boy yeah um so
it's it's fun you know it's a lot of
just soaking up home what's right out
there it's can't you kind of just get in
the grind of it and it's all of a sudden
you just gets kind of like a well-oiled
machine and you can't really prepare for
it it just is it something that you do
and then all of a sudden it's just it's
part of you and you're crushing these
shows and going along with it it's like
building a muscle or something that
every day you're doing the show and
getting more comfortable with it yeah
and we spend a lot of time trying to
promote the shows and get in touch with
the fan base that are in the cities
we're going to so we know we're going to
portland we you know want to reach out
to our friends and fans in portland and
let them know we're coming
a lot of prep like that goes into going
all across the country we actually it's
kind of a wasn't it was before yes we
just is we just came back from like a
crazy all across the gay and then we
came back and we're finished we just
finished the record and now we're doing
the West Coast branch so it's actually
some really great cities we get to go to
like San Francisco and Portland geneseo
we have an LA show coming up at the
Troubadour which is hometown show very
exciting always the best photo shows
like I mean you love your fans but when
you are in a band it's always great to
have a hometown because it's all of your
family you have people that don't
necessarily get to come to your shows
like it's good and watch you do what
you've gone most of the year working on
this thing and for them to finally see
what we're working on and the show that
we're putting on around the country is
really rewarding that girls in the
musical way right we're like that's what
they've been doing when they were in at
my birthday party you know and also that
I like I think that's an interesting
point to make in terms of you know
technology is not only used by you guys
to stay connected to your fans also
really you stay connected your families
because us can be on the road for a
really long time I cannot imagine how
people kept in touch with their friends
and their partners and their family
before we had Hillary telegrams cards
postcards there you go yeah like no wish
you were here like but it must have it
must have been really hard because it's
you know we we get the gift of face time
and sure you know snapchat is timing so
fun on the road yeah so it's really fun
and it feels really good to see you know
these people back at home I like
hijacking her face times I'll come back
on the bus and she's like talking to her
friends he's like is that Torah and Jen
give me your phone okay see ya and
you've known ever so long i'm sure all
of her friends and family are your
friends yeah totally Natalie that's very
