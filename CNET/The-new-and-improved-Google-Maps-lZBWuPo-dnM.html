we're checking out the shiny new google
maps whether you're on an iPad iPhone or
Android device this staple app will
without question give you the best maps
experience available and iOS users will
be especially pleased with the update
because Google Maps now works full
screen on the iPad as well just as
before Google Maps offers a powerful
search function for both general queries
and specific addresses you can add
layers to show things like traffic and
satellite images and you can jump to
Street View to get a ground level look
at an area for some spots you can even
get a 360-degree look inside a building
when you're searching for say a
restaurant with Google Maps the sliding
card at the bottom of the screen gives
you all the vital info you need plus
user submitted photos a menu reviews and
any special offers that may be available
from this screen you can also quickly
jump to directions now the great thing
about google maps directions is that it
defaults to what it thinks is the best
mode of transportation based on where
you are and it offers a number of route
options to choose from all with
estimated travel times for voip our
navigation just hit the start button on
the bottom and if you happen to run into
a pocket of traffic while navigating
google maps will automatically suggest a
quick detour if one is available the
explore page is all so new and it offers
a number of local recommendations for
places to eat drink shop and more and
finally there's the offline maps feature
which is a little bit different with
this newest version of google maps on
android it's right here under the search
bar just tap the offline button and the
portion of the map that was on screen
will get cached for offline use not as
intuitive as before but hey it works on
iOS you'll need to type in ok maps and
the section of the map you had on screen
will be cash for offline viewing as well
the new google maps is available now in
the App Store for both iPhone and iPad
and on Google Play for Android device
