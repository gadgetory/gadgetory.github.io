browser tabs when he tweets I'm Bridget
Carey this is your cnet update guys
Kanye West needs our help he may even
need someone to start a Kickstarter for
him to be able to afford some recording
software well that's what the artist
deadmau5 is suggesting as he's mocking
Kanye for a foolish image he tweeted you
see Kanye tweeted out a photo of his
computer screen to show off so music he
was listening to but oh no Yeezy broke a
cardinal rule of screenshots do not
reveal your browser tabs with a closer
look you can see that our little easy
was look it up the serum sound editing
software made by exper records and then
another tab has pirate bay opening
torrenting something with xfer so you
could make the conclusion that he's
pirating the editing software and that's
just what the artist deadmau5 accused
him doing on Twitter the software costs
under two hundred dollars something
Kanye certainly could afford but that's
not really what makes this awkward you
see both dead mouse and Kanye were
together on stage a year ago to stand up
against digital piracy supporting the
new music streaming service title and
Kanye has spoken out against sites like
pirate bay there have been reports that
he's considering taking legal action to
sue the pirate bay but maybe he'll need
to borrow some money to afford a lawsuit
someone created a go fund me page to
help Kanye but the site was shortly
taken down alas if Mark Zuckerberg won't
give a money the funnest projects I
wonder who else he can ask well maybe
there's some type that can help poor
Kanye with his finances the square cash
app was just updated recently it's
designed to make it easy for friends to
send money to each other kind of like
venmo but now on square cash you can
store money within the app almost like a
digital savings account and there's a
new startup called checkbook let you
send anyone a digital image of a check
to an email account which from there can
be deposited into someone's bank account
or I suppose you could also print it out
businesses have to pay one dollar per
check but for everyone else it's free to
send 50 checks a year so that's 50
payments you can
send to help Connie from becoming a
starving artist and if you ever travels
to San Francisco he could pay for a
burger at McDonalds without ever taking
out a phone or wallet google has a brand
new hands-free payment program it's
testing in select places it lets you pay
without taking anything out of your
pocket you till the cashier that you'll
pay with Google the cashier has a
program that looks for nearby phones
with this app and sees if your face
matches any users located in the store
and then charges you mmm hands-free
burgers that's it for this tech news
update you can head to cnet.com for more
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
