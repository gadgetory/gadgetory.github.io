little sporty coupe and it still is but
in the wake of the rear-wheel drive
Scion fr-s it's got more than a few
enthusiasts wondering well why would you
bother with this front-wheel drive both
sports car
let's hop behind the wheel of this 2014
model and see if the old girls still got
a few thrills left in her now post FRS
the Scion tC s had to get a lot more
aggressive to keep a tracking eyes so
it's gotten a lot more angular that's
gonna start around here at the back with
this big chunky C pillar and this very
angular roofline and it's gonna come
straight across to a very flat roof and
that front we've got these blacked-out
eight pillars that give it sort of a
floating roof illusion and visually sort
of slim the profile of the car making it
look less chunky and more sporty now the
2014 Scion tC
doesn't have a ton of options it arrives
in its base form with a pretty good
cabin tech system in the center of the
dashboard here we've got this pioneer
head unit that looks suspiciously like
something that you'd see in the
aftermarket and that's because scions
whole push is that they want to make
these cars easily upgradable so you
could just yank this whole thing out and
drop in another system if you so desired
if you decided to leave it in there
though you wouldn't be too bad off
you've got a touchscreen interface with
a wide range of digital audio sources
including bluetooth for hands-free
calling and audio streaming we've also
got USB connectivity that's also going
to be standard and we've also got am/fm
and HD radio very interesting to see HD
radio this far down in Toyotas sort of
hierarchy we've also got a button format
but if you press it it doesn't actually
do anything that's because we don't have
the optional bespoke audio system now
looking at the pictures and the specs
online that bespoke audio system looks
like this exact same head unit but with
the added ability to do GPS navigation
with locally stored maps and there is
also a bit of app integration through
scions
application that's gonna let you do
internet radio streaming from your
Android or iOS device
now coming out of the system is a
Pioneer stereo system that's got what I
count to be about eight speakers
scattered around the cabin most of them
are going to be right here and
front of the vehicle we've got a wolf
fur a mid-range and a tweeter in each of
the doors sound from the system is gonna
be pretty good if we pop into the audio
system right here and look at the EQ
we've got a couple of different settings
natural here and feel feels gonna be
more bass heavy here is gonna be a
little bit more mid-range and high heavy
so that you can actually listen to
things like the human voice that are
gonna sound a little bitter there and
natural is gonna be your flat setting
now surrounding this head unit is an
interior that a bit cheaply made if not
nicely functional but you've got to use
a lot of plastic to keep this thing at
about twenty thousand dollar price
points even though we've got a couple of
nice creature comforts like our dual
pane sunroof which is really nice it
sort of lighting up and making this
really kind of dark cabin feel a little
bit more Airy as you drive there's also
a little bit of weirdness for example
the air vent up here are rectangular lis
shaped but that one over there on the
passenger side is round
it just looks odd and out of place
doesn't match the rest of the cabin
there's also a couple of signs of scion
cutting corners to keep the cost down
for example this vehicle doesn't even
come standard with daytime running
lights now behind one of the more
attractive front ends and all of Toyota
dome will find Toyota and scions 2.5
litre four-cylinder engine now that's
gonna use direct injection to get you
about 179 horsepower and 175 pound feet
of torque not bad for a coupe that
weighs about 3,100 pounds that's gonna
be paired with a six-speed manual
transmission or as in this case a
six-speed automatic putting power to the
front wheels and the EPA estimates that
you're gonna get with the automatic
about 23 miles per gallon in the city
and 31 on the highway I've been getting
about 25 during my testing which is in
line with those EPA estimates now as I
said earlier 179 horsepower 175 pound
feet of torque if nothing to thumb your
nose at in the car
sighs the Scion tC has really good
initial tip-in on the throttle the first
couple of times I've pulled away from a
traffic light in this car I just kind of
shut off way faster than I thought I
would part of that's do I think to the
weird pedal placement which means that I
end up stepping down on the pedal more
than stepping into it which is making it
a little bit odd to modulate but there's
just really good torque from this engine
now when you get up to speed this
automatic transmission does kind of let
you down a little bit there's a little
bit too quick to jump up through the
gears and it's a little bit too sort of
hesitant fortunately there is a sport
mode you flop the shifter over into the
sport mode and things get a little bit
more aggressive the computer tends to
hold its gears a little bit longer and
choose lower gear that you have better
access to your throttle response keeping
the engine more alive if you drive
around the sport mode is also
technically a manual shift mode you can
push forward to upshift pull back to
downshift
being able to manually shift your gears
means that you can have a little bit of
fun with this car and one of the great
things about this TC is its suspension
setup is pretty good for a car in this
price range
the 2014 Scion tC in typical Scion
fashion is very easy to price there
aren't a whole lot of options that
aren't dealer installed wheels or
stickers this one's gonna start at about
just shy of $20,000 for the manual
transmission version but our six-speed
automatic equipped version is gonna be
twenty thousand nine hundred and
sixty-five bucks that's gonna include
your destination and everything if the
price out of the door there's only one
option that you should really care about
and that's the bespoke audio system and
at 1198 dollars that's going to add
navigation and be priced pretty
competitively with aftermarket systems
so go ahead and shop around before you
