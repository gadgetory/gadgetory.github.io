we're looking at the Samsung powerbot
vr9 thousands is a new thousand dollar
robot vacuum from Samsung not the first
one that they've done but their newest
and like you can see it's a little
different than the Roomba and neato
models I've got here this one's got the
cyclone force turbine like motor sitting
here this copper part along with the
translucent bin sticking out and that's
unique that's different from these two
would kind of hide the bin beneath the
hood I like that approach quite a bit
you can see when there's a clog you can
see when the bin is full it needs to be
emptied with room Bonito you've got to
check it's under a hood you can't just
see it on the flip side though it is a
larger robot vacuum it's over 5 inches
tall it's got about an extra inch of
height over these two models so it's
going to have a tougher time fitting
underneath your sofa it also doesn't
have a handle and that comes into effect
because it's a heavier vacuum it's over
ten pounds you can pick the Roomba and
the neato up with one hand pretty easily
thanks to the fact they've got handles
but the Samsung power bot doesn't have a
handle you're going to need two hands to
really pick this thing up now the power
botton navigates a lot like the nito
does it figures out the lay of the land
and then goes up and down and rose and
in a very neat orderly precise fashion
and that works pretty well I was
impressed with how it found its way
around our test space and how it picked
up all the stuff that we asked it to
although it did have some trouble
finding its way around the sides of the
base station so up against the wall next
to the base station there were some
spots that got missed and quite a few of
my tests you can also navigate the power
bot using the remote you can steer it
manually like a twit car or you can
shine this laser dot on the floor and
tell the robot vacuum where you want to
go it can track that dot and go right to
it
that's a cool feature might be helpful
if you have a specific spill that you
want the robot vacuum to address other
features include a dust sensor here
that'll tell the vacuum to work a little
harder tacks and dirty spot your carpet
along with this silence mode that'll
quiet the vacuum that haven't run at a
less rigorous output to minimize the
sound I like that that's a nice feature
if you're watching TV overall I was
satisfied with the power box performance
it kept up with Roomba and neato in my
test although it never beat them and
that was a little disappointing given
that it cost a thousand dollars these
cost six or seven hundred there's also
the neato XV signature pro that costs
450 those are much more affordable and
they managed to keep up and even beat
the power bots in performance tests so
which it was a little better and
also talked that the robot vacuum aight
get integrated into smart things
connected home platform with that camera
that it uses acting a sort of a roving
security droid that can check out areas
of your home while you're away so i
might wait to see how that develops see
what dyson brings to the table see if
there are new models from Roomba and
neato this year and for now probably
passing on this power bot thanks for
watching check out the rest of our
reviews at cnet.com for CNN appliances
I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
