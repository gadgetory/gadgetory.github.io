made a whole series of nin toasters and
posted them on stupid fingers calm and
go super medical technicians in the
Netherlands ran a full CT scan on an
ancient Chinese statue of the Buddha and
discovered a monk was entombed inside
the mummy inside the statue is the only
one of its kind ever found and is
believed to be a Buddhist master named
Lee Kuan of the Chinese meditation
school who died around 1100 AD
attempting an ancient self-mummification
process to reach a state of higher
enlightenment monks who had achieved
this type of self-mummification would be
venerated in temples and would become a
living Buddha while those who had failed
would remain entombed but respected for
their attempt

youtube user and eerie felt so good 0 is
