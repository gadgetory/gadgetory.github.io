help humans I'm Bridget Carey this is
your scene that update meets Milo an
expressive two foot tall humanoid robot
that resembles something out of a
Japanese anime cartoon he speaks slowly
as he plays games and teaches trivia to
kids he even throws dance parties but
this isn't just another talking toy Milo
is designed to help children with autism
while you may think his dancing skills
could use some work there's actually
something incredible going on beyond the
wires and gears research has shown that
children are opening up and engaging
with Milo better than with human
teachers children on the autism spectrum
were found to engage with the robot 87%
of the time compared to 3% with a
therapist kids with autism can feel
comfortable with computers but
communicating with people can be a
challenge
Milo serves as a bridge and his
expressive face helps teach social
skills research says children using Milo
in therapy have increased eye contact
body language and friendliness created
by Dallas based company Robo kind Milo
is being used now in 50 schools as an
autism therapy tool Milo was just one of
several robots on display at the Robo
universe Expo in New York City robots
are predicted to be one of the fastest
growing industries in the world and
although robots have been serving in
assembly lines for decades now some arms
on the factory floor are getting more
human-friendly
check out Baxter from rethink robotics
when Baxter is working at the assembly
line his eyes give him some human
personality but they also are a safety
feature his eyes give a clue on which
arm is going to move next normally robot
arms in a factory have to be surrounded
by a protective fence because you know
they can kill you if you get hit now the
fence is not necessary because they stop
when detecting any resistance robot arms
are also easier to program for smaller
or mid-sized businesses I was able to
program this arm in less than two
minutes without any coating to create a
series of positions you can physically
move the arm to where you wanted to go
now
next and it just remembers next time you
go shopping a robot could give you
assistance Lowe's home improvement is
using these rolling information kiosks
if you need to find an item just say it
or type it in and it'll show you where
it is and it leads you to the aisle it's
located the maker fellow robots says
it's learned a few lessons in early
tests one frustrated customer hit it
with a shopping cart on purpose but
other robots could even follow you
around new bot ik had one called the
doog that demonstrates how signage can
follow you on a show floor like a little
puppy
