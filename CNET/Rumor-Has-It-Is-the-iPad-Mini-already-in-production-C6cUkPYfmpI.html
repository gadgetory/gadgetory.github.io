and this is rumor has it the show where
we round up the week's biggest tech
rumors and so on which one seemed like
they might actually come true and
remember that you can vote on all the
rumors too so keep your eyes out for the
pull in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet with scorekeepers and
eager consumers in somewhat of a
consensus about a sep tember 12th
release for the iphone 5 the rumor mill
turns its attention to what the heck the
new iphone is going to be like nowhere
else a French gadget site named that way
I suppose because Parisian descendants
of Sartre like their tech rumors with a
side of existentialism posted images of
an allegedly redesigned iPhone nano SIM
card slot you can see that the supposed
at iphone 5 nano SIM is considerably
smaller than the micro sim in the 4s
okay so it looks smaller and I've never
really heard of a nano-sim what is it so
a nano sim is a smaller version of the
micro sim which is what the iphone
currently uses in a lot of global phones
the nano SIM isn't in production yet but
it's been approved by the European
equivalent of the FCC gotcha so does
that mean that the phone is going to be
smaller actually no the reason to shrink
the sim is not so you can make a tiny
zuly undersized iPhone hello God is that
you hello no the actual reason is so
that you can cram a bunch of other stuff
into the phone that do other things like
I don't know maybe a pico projector or a
lipstick our second rumor is about a
mystery HP tablet that's been showing it
stability head a couple times in the
last three weeks the tablet popped up in
a photo in one section of HP's website
and then it also showed up in an HP
commercial it's like the where's waldo
of tablets there's no word on whether
the mystery tablet is actually something
they're going to make or if it's just a
nonworking mock-up to show that HP is in
the tablet game but either way nice one
HP your subliminally reminding us that
you exist in the tablet world well
remember the HP touchpad I loved webOS
in fact let's pour one out for a
long-forgotten homie
here's our third rumor digit times
reports that HTC is readying a large
phone tablet hybrid AK a phablet to
compete with Samsung's Galaxy Note the
anonymous sources suggest this phone
will sport a 5-inch display have android
4.0 a qualcomm snapdragon processor and
will come out before november now there
are two important notes to bear in mind
when considering the likelihood of this
rumor first HTC was one of the first
filmmakers to go big remember the evo 4g
that thing looked huge what came out but
now it actually pales in comparison to
Samsung's phones which tower over it so
trend wise this makes sense of HTC wants
to keep up secondly the taiwanese
manufacturer really needs a kick in its
bottom line in the second quarter HTC
reported a sixty percent lower profit
than the same quarter last year people
actually really love the HTC One X but
it's just not proven to be the breakout
product that HTC needed right but do you
think it's right for HTC to pin all of
its hopes on a phablet who do you Joe
that actually uses a samsung galaxy note
let me think actually no one our biggest
rumor this week is about the
long-awaited iPad Mini which you and I
actually have a bet about I know
according to an analyst with NPD
DisplaySearch production of the seven
point eight five inch display slated for
use on a smaller version of the ipad
should begin in august if this pans out
it means that the iPad Mini is on
schedule to be released at the end of
2012 which is what recent reports have
indicated anyway and don't forget the
email that was on earth that the apple
vs samsung trial from apple's head of
internet software and services in which
he wrote about how a 7 inch ipad was a
great idea and he made me even already
talked to Steve Jobs into it it's really
funny though the email says I expressed
this idea to Steve several times since
Thanksgiving and he seemed very
receptive the last time can't you just
imagine this guy accosting steve jobs in
the elevator and on the sixth time Steve
Jobs like okay fine whatever you say I'm
into it just leave me alone I want to go
all right I know I mean not that we've
ever done that to our boss to get this
show in any case I'm still on board with
the ipad mini I think this rumor further
supports that it'll come out in the
all i have to say hell to the no on this
one I still don't think that Apple is
going to make an ipad mini I think I'm
going to get to humiliate you when I
improved right on sep tember 12 what do
you guys think vote on this while we go
ask people of San Francisco what they
think i have heard the rumors that an
iPad Mini is coming out I think that it
would be an interesting product and
we'll take a look at it when it comes
out and see if we want to buy it do I
think they're gonna do it yeah I
wouldn't put it past them that's what
Apple's known for inventive new ideas to
beat the competition everybody's making
like a medium-sized I've gadgets so I
think Apple would definitely come up
with some kind of a smaller screen I
think it should be bigger because I you
know for people that just really can't
see there were glasses we wouldn't need
something bigger to see and if they did
come out with an ipad mini would you be
interested in one I think I'd want to
know you know what's gonna set that
apart from other tablets that are out
there how much do you think it'll cost
199 dollars no more than four hundred
dollars that's for sure I would get it
if I was an Apple user that's what the
people on the windy streets of San
Francisco had to say about an ipad mini
screen already secretly being in
production let's go see with the cnet
council things the scene that councils
composed of five editors who cast their
votes anonymously their opinions are not
an endorsement by Cena or CBS
interactive obviously because these are
rumors folks and the cnet verdict is no
the cnet council agreed with me that the
ipad mini screen is not already in
production although two of them agreed
with you okay fine but three of them
agreed okay fine thanks to everybody who
tweeted to us about the rumor has it
launch party we look forward to meeting
all you guys next week at the party
thank you guys that's our show don't
forget to share your rumors with us at
rumor has it at cnet com or call one
eight hundred 750 cnet and thanks to
this week's sponsor ebay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
