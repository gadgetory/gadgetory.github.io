tri-band router from lynxes now is huge
you really need a big home before
getting it because otherwise it will not
literally fit through the door now is
huge because one of the most powerful
routers on the market with the combined
Wi-Fi bandwidth of 5300 megabits per
second rivaling this rtac 5300 from asus
right here now both of them share the
same amount of antenna which is more
than I can count but the links is here
actually have eight Gigabit LAN port and
the issues here has only four more ports
mean you can plug more devices to your
network before having to buy a switch as
for the Wi-Fi the router is really super
fast in my testing with the top sustain
will will speed up some 700 megabits per
second
keep in mind that I tested it with
client that has the ceiling speed must
lower than those of the rarer why well
because there was no faster Wi-Fi client
on the market that set the router high
Wi-Fi specs are only for show for now
and make it future proof now the links
is here has excellent range my testing
too and chances are it's Wi-Fi network
can cover a large home but in case it
doesn't it now support seamless roaming
meaning if you use a maximum Wi-Fi
extender with it it will make the
extended Wi-Fi network be one with the
original one allowing devices to move
from one to another without an
interruption now other than that the ER
United 500 here has similar features set
as other router from the Linksys smart
Wi-Fi family one thing of note though is
parental control can actually block HTTP
website and that mean if you want to
keep your children away from Facebook
you can so if you have $400 to burn this
is a great router as long as you can
handle its side by the waiting is so
huge
links is going to call it the dong
router but for that it's still not big
enough you see I have to get a second
one but that's only because I'm Domo
