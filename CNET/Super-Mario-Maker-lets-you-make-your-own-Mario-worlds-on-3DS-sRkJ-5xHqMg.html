out the Nintendo switch it doesn't come
till next year so what do you do for
your Nintendo retro fix thankfully
Nintendo has a solution on the Nintendo
3ds that's a great way to kill a lot of
hours Super Mario maker do you remember
this on the Wii U if you don't hey this
is an awesome game but it's not
necessarily what you think it's going to
be super mario maker debuted on
Nintendo's Wii U console last year and
it was a fantastic idea you make your
own Mario levels and you share them and
you download ones other people make it's
infinite Mario not only does the game
feature for different Mario game types
from the 8-bit Mario up through the Wii
U new super mario brothers u can make
nearly anything that exists in those
games and it's platforming heaven but
it's also a smart lesson in the basics
of game design also my kid loves it the
3ds version is all of that bottled up
including dozens of levels that come
included and hundreds more that Nintendo
has curated from all of those Wii U game
levels that were put up over the last
year not all of them put a lot of them
so there's plenty to do and you've got
that build your own level mode which
feels a bit like Minecraft but you
cannot upload those levels online or
share them with others unless you send
them directly to another 3ds owner which
is super sad it wastes a great
opportunity to make the sort of
community that already exists on Super
Mario maker for Wii U but imagine if
this could have been portable and
livingroom playable at the same time you
could connect them and share across
right now you have to buy two separate
games that don't work together between
Wii U and 3ds maybe the Nintendo switch
will offer up a perfect Super Mario
maker that works in both modes this 3ds
version is still a great package if
you've got a system but don't expect to
share all your Mario genius with others</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
