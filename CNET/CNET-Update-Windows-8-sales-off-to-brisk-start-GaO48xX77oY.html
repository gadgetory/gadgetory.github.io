weight I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update Microsoft has sold 40
million windows 8 licenses since it came
out October 26th that's 40 million in
one month when windows 7 came out it
sold 60 million copies in two months so
we'll have to wait until the end of the
year to get a true sales comparison
analysts have been expressing concerns
about windows with one recently saying
that Windows 8 is off to an awkward
start with sluggish demand the whole new
look is Microsoft's big bet to better
compete in a time where people are
thinking about getting an iPad instead
of a laptop and Microsoft has not yet
released any sales figures on how many
surface tablets it's sold it costs forty
dollars now to upgrade to Windows 8
you'll be able to easily share more
holiday photos and videos over gmail
because now gmail is letting users
attach 10 gigabyte files but you can't
just attach at the normal way there's a
trick you first put the file into your
Google Drive account and then you can
insert the file into an email message I
guess you could have previously attached
a link to the dry file before but this
just makes it easier with a dedicated
button the feature is rolling out over
the next few days there are a ton of app
updates to keep an eye out for if you
share videos on vimeo it just launched a
redesigned free iphone app users can
create and share videos from the app and
navigation simpler the ipad version is
in the works skype also updated its iOS
app now users can log in to skype with a
Microsoft account and chat with contacts
on messenger hotmail and outlook.com and
you can edit account details and use
animated emoticons streaming music
service rdio updated its Android and
Apple apps with a new design there's
also a remote control feature that lets
you pause the station feed on your
laptop and pick it back up on your phone
or tablet Xbox Live has an update that
fixes some bugs with SmartGlass and Xbox
music if you haven't tried it yet
SmartGlass is the new app that lets you
control what plays on your xbox with
your phone or tablet outlook.com that's
Microsoft's new free email store
service has its own android app now for
anyone who couldn't already support
exchange activesync emails in a blog
post microsoft said there are 25 million
active users of the new email and about
a third of them are gmail users trying
outlook.com for the first time that your
tech news update you can find links to
all of these stories on the blog sina
