to watch videos of cats playing piano
but YouTube will soon announce plans to
let some channels charge a monthly fee
for their content a move that may
alienate some users I think nowadays
there's enough free content out there
that nobody's gonna pay for it most
content is expected to remain free of
charge early online reports say YouTube
will initially offer 50 channels with
each channel subscription costing as
little as two dollars a month YouTube's
really made an investment in what they
call premium content so what you're
likely to end up paying for it shows
that are incredibly popular already
there are networks like The Young Turks
which I think has an aggregate of a
billion views people may already be
interested in paying for that but
they're also creating shows with
well-known celebrities with people who
you already want to watch and that's the
kind of content they're going to ask you
to pay for in a statement youtube said
we're looking into creating a
subscription platform that could bring
even more great content to youtube for
our users to enjoy and provide our
partners with another vehicle to
generate revenue with paid subscriptions
YouTube would compete with the likes of
Netflix Hulu and Amazon which have
successfully gained millions of paid
subscribers and created original content
what we're seeing now is almost the
creation of new kinds of TV networks and
each of them like the existing TV
networks has their own distinct
programming the BBC has already said it
would not be introducing fees for its
youtube channel youtube will reportedly
offer to subscription options with and
without advertising that could make a
difference for some I think it was fine
as is what the ads are pretty crazy it
would be nice to have lessons and
there's another benefit for users so you
may pay for netflix and Netflix original
programming but those same shows might
not be on hulu they might not be on
YouTube so if you have favorites on
YouTube or shows on YouTube that you
think you want to watch specifically
this is a good way to kind of put
together an ala carte package of
programming which you cannot do right
now on cable in other words a cable cord
cutters dream in San Francisco I'm Sumi
