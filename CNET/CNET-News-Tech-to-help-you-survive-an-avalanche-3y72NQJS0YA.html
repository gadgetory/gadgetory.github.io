it also carries considerable risks the
Holy Trinity of avalanche safety tools
is a must probe is to look for someone
buried in the snow and then the shovel
to dig them out and a beacon the
absolute necessity to find someone when
you can't see them beacons can both emit
signals when you're lost and receive
signals when you're searching for
someone the newest in beacons is a third
antenna oriented vertically if the first
two across this way and that one can
tell depth other backcountry staples
include Avalon's that reduce the risk of
carbon dioxide poisoning of buried in
snow and the unfortunate event that
you're caught in an avalanche you're
more likely to be rescued faster if
you're closer to the surface an airbag
helps you float to the top to use it
yank on this trigger airbag system from
mem moot with its horseshoe shape is
designed to prevent head neck and chest
injuries current airbags inflate using
air cartridges filled canisters aren't
permitted on airplanes but a new kind of
airbag hit stores this November Black
Diamond has developed the halo 28 pack
which uses a jet fan for inflation
tistic show that you'll have a shallow a
burial if wearing an airbag versus not
as for the tech to avoid while some
smart phone apps give the impression
they offer beacon like features they
fall short in many ways including
battery life and loss of signal range in
snow conditions arguably more
significant is the incompatibility of
these systems with existing rescue
systems as well as the non compatibility
with the apps themselves ask any
Avalanche expert there is no
get-out-of-jail-free card there's a
general idea out there that if i have
this equipment and i know how to use it
i'm safe and that is really not true
equipment is no substitute for education
an avalanche safety course
a good start in Lake Tahoe I'm see me
