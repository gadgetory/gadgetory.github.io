when they in veiled hololens goggles
that combine a computer speakers and a
3d augmented reality display but as cool
as the demo video was what are we
actually going to use this for i'm
donald bell and this top five i'm
counting down the best uses from
microsoft hololens so far as I can tell
starting off at number five let's just
get this out of the way holo porn I
can't be the only one thinking this and
if we're being honest I'm only putting
this at number five to keep things
relatively classy I mean really how long
before you can conjure up a virtual
companion in the privacy of your own
home if human reproduction grinds to a
halt over the next few years I'm blaming
Microsoft at number four design the
Microsoft demo video featured all manner
of design professionals and engineers
using hololens to create manipulate and
visualize 3d renderings of objects and
virtual vehicles this totally makes
sense I mean what designer wouldn't love
to see their 3d designs pop off the
computer screen and into the real world
you'll feel like a god coming in at
number three instruction there's another
theme here that kept popping up from
Microsoft you could have the
instructions for fixing or assembling
something laid out right in front of you
doctors could learn surgery on virtual
bodies it could give you an edge in golf
or chess poker or twister or thumb
wrestling or beer pong ice curling knife
throwing it can even help you through
that awkward first encounter with your
virtual partner at number two making
your home smarter forget about Internet
connected thermostats with one upgrade
you can turn every surface in your home
into a display and get your email on
your refrigerator you can check the
weather on your toaster eat cereal on a
table made out of animated gifts it's
like your own personalized acid trip and
that brings us to my vote for the number
one use for the microsoft hololens
gaming after all this is from the same
team that came up with the Microsoft
Kinect also that moment in the demo
video where the guys the living room is
transformed into a Minecraft world how
cool is that
you and your virtual BFF could spend the
exquisite moments of your afterglow
mining your carpet for precious
materials that build up your virtual
fort the future is going to be pretty
weird so there you go five of the best
potential uses from microsoft's hololens
augmented reality goggles but that's
just my opinion if you have a better one
you can let me know over on Twitter or
you can visit top-five see Netcom for
more top fives like this
I'm Donnell Bell thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
