Brian have you met our new producer John
Kim Jong ok what's up Johnny tomato I'm
a big fan of yours so hook you up
watching you and I really love you cool
right on well um you know what welcome
to team man hey guys the fruit box is
here oh yeah see you around one what's
cooking brian Tong here and welcome to
the apple by for everything good and bad
inside the world of Apple Apple music is
here you've been able to play with it so
let's talk all about it now the first
thing I like and really love is the
beats 1 radio station where you can
actually find and hear new music real
information about the artist and it's
not the same 20 tracks played over and
over Plus Zane Lowe just kills it also
the for you feature now it uses
algorithms from the previous beat
service but it's custom playlist
suggestions I constantly change based on
the artists you like our money and
that's as long as you can find artists
you listen to but one of the things I
don't like about it the interface I like
its modern look but its navigation and
organization is all over the place when
a song is playing it appears in this bar
at the bottom that has to be expanded
but it's a little too skinny you have to
press on it to access any of the music
controls and then minimize it and then
your playlists are two steps away in my
music I hate that now I'm not dumb but
an easy you I was not the priority here
now the other useless part connect Apple
music is trying to push it out as a new
social platform but really it's artists
are still trying to get their PR person
to post things for them it doesn't add
much value at all and I wish I could
just get rid of it now as always there
are some Bugaboos with a service and
Apple isn't exempt from this the first
one is how to stop the Apple music three
month trial from auto renewing its not
very obvious so here's what you all need
to do and this works for your iOS
devices and itunes app on your computer
just press on the silhouette icon on the
top of the app then
go to view Apple ID on iOS or in itunes
go to account info and you'll sign in
then find the subscription section and
go to manage from there you find your
Apple music membership you can turn the
auto renewal to off and yes you are
welcome but the biggest issue with Apple
music to me is turning on the iCloud
music library it's really like a
rebranded version of itunes match and
that's what's scary this feature isn't
turned on by default and you need to
enable it to add songs from the
subscription service to your own
collection and playlists and I know a
lot of people had problems with this and
we're wondering why they couldn't do
that see it's essential to using Apple
music and that's what turns me off the
most sure it gives you those benefits
for the service and the goal is to merge
your collection together into one piece
but my issue was when I first used it it
replace some of the songs I had with the
censored versions mess with the metadata
and all the album artwork I had hunted
down for someone like me it was horrible
so I turned off iTunes Match had to
revert my collection with time machine
and I'm not alone people are just now
experiencing this for the first time
with Apple music and the iCloud music
library now I see how valuable streaming
services as well call me old school but
I still like to own my own music but if
Apple insists on using the iCloud music
library and messing with the current
collection I can't do that and you
shouldn't have to do this to use Apple
music and you know what that's a bad
apple yes it's good depending on what
you want like every services but you
know what it's not always for everyone
alright we still have apple iphone 6s
news and it's a biggie 9to5 mac has
revealed that the 6s will look nearly
identical on the outside but the changes
will be under the hood like every iPhone
s iteration their source claims the 6s
will have the same thickness and width
there looks to be no space and no cut
out for a dual lens camera system that
was rumored and the bottom design is
exactly the same with the position of
the headphone port a lightning port
speaker and microphone now one of the
biggest improvements will be internally
thanks to a new Qualcomm chip known as
the 9x 35 Gobi modem platform that will
bring major performance improvements
over the 6 and 6 plus that's capable of
delivering twice the LTE download speeds
the new chip is also more power
efficient which could translate into
improved battery life 9f imac also
reports the motherboard inside is
narrower and more compact which could
mean a slightly larger battery for the
success and combine all this with iOS 9
s new power saving features and
optimization and we could be getting a
significantly better performing next gen
iphone and ipod touch bands i hear you
all there is still hope for you after
all the recent release of itunes 12.2
with apple music support revealed an
image of new colors for the ipod touch
nano and shuffle we saw blue gold and
dark pink that we have never seen before
when users were setting up or restoring
a new ipod I repeat new colors we have
never seen hope is alive and apples home
kids support page released a full list
of it supported siri commands and you'll
be able to do a lot more with a smart
home like st. hey Siri turn off the
lights or turn on the coffee maker
here's your coffee mr. Tom thanks John
hmm or even hey Siri set my bedtime
scene yeah oh and before we go ladies
and gents it's been a big week in music
and tech with the release of Apple music
but let's even turn back the clock and
celebrate a huge moment in Apple history
the first iphone yes I was in line for
this guy eight years ago and it still
even works but let's go back way back
back into time and celebrate the sony
walkman 36 years old this week you use
the technology from the Stone Age called
cassette tapes and had these things
called buttons that you had to press all
right that's going to do for this we
show you can always email us at the
apple byte at cnet com or to me at brian
Tong they so much for watching it will
catch you all next time for another bite
of the Apple
what's cooking Bryant on here and
welcome to the Apple but for everything
good and bad in the world of Apple shoes
