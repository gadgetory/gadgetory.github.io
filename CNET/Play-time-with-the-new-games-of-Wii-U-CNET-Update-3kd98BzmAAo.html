I'm more stressed out over zombies I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update last week you heard that Facebook
automatically changed the email address
displayed in your profile to be the
Facebook email that no one uses well the
drama just got worse many smartphones
sync contacts with facebook and that
means address books were auto updated
with the useless facebook emails do
yourself a favor make sure the right
email is listed in your profile if you
think you're missing emails click on
messages in the left hand column then
click on other because that's where
Facebook highs emails sent to you by non
friends the Android operating system
comes out with frequent updates but not
all phones even new ones can always get
those updates android 4.1 october is
only on ten percent of android phones
last week google just came out with 4.1
codenamed jellybean but you might be
waiting months to see that so in the
meantime you can always read up on our
full review of android 4.1 by now you've
heard that Nintendo's coming out with a
new gaming system this holiday called
the wii u it revolves around using a
touchscreen game controller no price or
release date has been set but I got a
chance to demo some of the first games
for the new system and when it's done
right it does add a new level of fun to
casual gaming if you're playing with
others the person using the gamepad
controller may have a completely
different role in trying to hurt or help
other players in Super Mario Brothers
you Mario and Luigi are controlled with
the classic wiimote but the player with
the gamepad has the power to create
extra blocks to help save them from
falling or help them get to
hard-to-reach places the screen can
sometimes surprise you in the wacky
challenges of game and Wario use a
swiping motion to pull back an arrow on
the touchpad and watch it fly at the
targets on the television if the bad
guys get too close though they can hop
on the gamepad screen and then you guys
smash them with your fingers it also
adds new features to Wii Fit and one
workout challenge I focused on the
gamepad screen to aim my water gun at
approaching enemies while doing lunges
the best experience is when game
designers got creative with you
a touchpad in simple ways where I didn't
have to worry about looking back and
forth between the two screens and that
wasn't the case with zombiu the touchpad
had some perks the screen in fact gave
me more to do with looking down to touch
my inventory to load weapons or hold up
the screen to see in a dark room it's
stressful enough dealing with zombies
but having to look down and think about
what's going on that second screen under
pressure that's a skill that takes
getting used to I think I'll just stick
with those Mario games for now that's
