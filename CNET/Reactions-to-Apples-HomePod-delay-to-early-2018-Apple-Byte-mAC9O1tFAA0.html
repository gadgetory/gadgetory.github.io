another kind of one of those small
little add-ons we like to throw in here
I guess we should start calling them
Apple bits or something like that but
look the big news that just dropped is
that Apple officially said that they're
going to be delaying the home pod for
release sometime in early 2018 I don't
know how you feel about that so let's
first of all just check out their
official statement we can't wait for
people to experience home pod apples
break through wireless speaker for the
home but we need a little more time
before it's ready for our customers
we'll start shipping in the US UK and
Australia in early 2018 and so when I
see that quote in here it there's really
two reactions that you probably have for
all the Apple fanboys the diehards are
like come on Apple get it done get it
done right I'm ok I'm patient I'm
willing to wait we want the right
product there's also another side of me
that thinks ok hey this is two years
back-to-back air pods last year we're
delayed the home pod this year is
delayed these are two hot new products
that you're supposed to deliver in the
holiday season get it together you know
I think there's also a part of me that
says hey I just bought an iPhone and
spent a thousand bucks I could use the
time to save it for that money but I
think that ultimately we want a good
product but the same time don't over
promise for us and under-deliver so the
in sales you want to always kind of
under-promise and over-deliver but now
we're getting this two years back to
back it's just not a good look we talked
about how the air pods were delayed last
year and if we want to say okay when
does this happen where these missed
steps happened before historically well
let's look at the air pods they were
announced at Apple's September keynote
back in 2016 they were promised for late
October and they didn't come in late
October in fact Apple had a statement
very similar to the home pod so this is
what they said at the time the early
response the air pods has been
incredible we don't believe in shipping
a product before it's ready and we need
a little more time before air pods are
ready for our customers so that's what
they told us sounds a lot like what we
saw earlier with the home pod but this
is what happened it didn't go out to
late October they ended up starting to
ship or make them available to purchase
the air pods that is December the 13th
so that's about a two and a half three
month delay from when they originally
expect
come then on top of that not only were
they available December 13 I like to say
available there was a six week shipping
time on them and that went as far out as
like late July of 2017 so pretty much
even though they were available they
were really hard to get we know Apple
had some issues getting them out but
then also they didn't have enough
inventory to support it so it's not like
you're saying okay they're here they're
ready people couldn't buy them until
recently so that's kind of a boo-boo on
their side but you also look at some of
these other historical things this is
not their first misstep you go back as
far back as like 2011 and I don't know
if you guys from the gals remember the
iPhone 4 the iPhone 4 white model was
delayed somewhere around nine months
because they had some issues with UV
protection but this was a phone that
came out nine months later the the thing
though is that they still delivered the
iPhone 4 on time it's just that they
didn't deliver the iPhone 4 in its white
color on time so now we go back to the
home pod and we think about okay is this
product look when I first saw the
product when they announced it it was a
little underwhelming for me compared to
what's out there we know it's a 349
price tag it looks like a lot of things
it could be like a scratch post for a
cat it looks like a big ol roasted Marsh
- marshmallow like a big ball of yarn
you see a fabric store it could be a lot
of things fine let's get over the looks
but from the technical aspects right you
have this 360-degree sound speaker ray
that's nice but the two technical things
Siri Siri is a whole lot better in 2017
I will give it credit but it's still not
nearly as good as what the Google
assistant is it's not nearly as good as
what Amazon's
echo has with Alexa so they're already
behind in that aspect and then when you
also talk about music services from all
documentation and all indications even
to developers the only native music
service that is going to be supported on
the home pod is just
Apple music and to me that's an issue
makes it just a really limited device
coming out of the gates
so now let's like look back and think
about how Apple used to approach this
and yeah you could call me old fogey
like oh those days are gone
look Apple is a different company but
back in the day Apple the SJ era they
would surprise us but then they would
actually deliver on that surprise within
the date range that they that they stole
it wouldn't be three or four months
later it wouldn't be you know 12 9 12
months until a product could actually be
purchased and that's that breeds
goodwill that was part of the magic of
Apple and when you do this two years
back to back and you don't deliver
during the holiday season right when
everyone is ready to buy not only are
you losing an opportunity the Google
home max is coming out so knows one's
platform they're all there they're gonna
be ready to purchase an apples home pod
that should have been part of that mix
that's already behind it smart speakers
is not part of that mix and when you
start kind of disappointing your
consumer base and just the general
perception it's it becomes a letdown in
Apple shouldn't want to feel like they
want to be anywhere associated with
letting down their customers it wasn't
that way before and it shouldn't be
moving forward so fine well let's talk
about they say early 2018 let's be real
that's gonna be more like March 2018
they're not gonna rush it for January
Apple has sometimes had March events
maybe we'll see something with mac books
or with Macs and iPads in March but I
wouldn't expect it like Oh early 2018
this thing's coming in January I could
be wrong we're shooting this just to
talk about it but let me know what you
think Are you disappointed in this does
this change how you feel about Apple do
you love the fact that they're holding
off and you don't care just give it to
us when it's ready
I just think even when it's ready it's
not gonna be that great of a Wow Apple
product and ultimately it's just a bad
look and ultimately it's a bad apple so
thanks for watching this leave your
feedback in the comments let's talk
about it and there you go that's another
Apple bites Apple bits wrapped up piece
