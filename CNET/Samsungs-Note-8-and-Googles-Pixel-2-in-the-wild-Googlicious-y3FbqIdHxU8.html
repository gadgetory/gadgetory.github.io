welcome to Google it's just for
everything inside the world of Google
we've seen leaks and renders galore over
the last week around the next pixel -
phone but GSM arena has posted photos of
the smaller of the two which brings a
smaller glass panel on the top rear area
that no longer goes past the fingerprint
sensor with most this model covered by
stickers now you can also see a two-tone
flash on the back as well the front side
features two front-facing speakers
photos were also recently shared by
VentureBeat who reported the new pixel
phone will remove the 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack and the gsm arena tipster
backs that claim up now these photos
line up very well with the early renders
there was no confirmation if it will
have the rumored squeezable frame or an
always-on display the pixel stood out
last year earning the highest-performing
camera ranking in the industry when it
was first released but it looks like
Google is still sticking with a single
lens rear camera for round 2 while other
flagship phones are going tool and if
you weren't sure that a new pixel phone
is coming soon as part of Google stores
back-to-school event you can get up to
$200 off on a current pixel phone and
the deal gets even sweeter because
they'll throw in a daydream headset now
the pixel 2 is coming and if they stick
with last year's timetable it will be
here sometime in October alright more
leaks in this time it's Samsung we're
close to Samsung's August 23rd unpacked
event where we'll finally see the
official unveiling of the note 8 but if
you want to see it early
keep watching thanks to images from my
everyday techcom now they were taken
down but you know what on the internet
everything lives forever the front of
the Note 8 is expected to bring a six
point three inch 20 960 by 1440 Super
AMOLED display with in an almost bezel
'list design the pictures if real
confirm the expected dual lens camera
that has been rumored to be to 12
megapixel sensors you can also see the
new s-pen which looks a lot like last
year's with buttons on the top and sides
- just wait a couple more weeks for the
official announcement and you know we'll
be covering it live here on CNET ok
after a few leaks of their own the
Samsung Galaxy s8 active has been
officially announced by AT&amp;amp;T
and only for AT&amp;amp;T customers it's a
ruggedized version of the galaxy s 8 and
will be available in meteor gray or
titanium gold and you can go to 18 t's
website and get it now
all right everyone was bummed out that
Samsung couldn't get the fingerprint
sensor on the front and glass panel done
in time for the s8 it looks like Apple
won't have it either and a new report
from kji securities says even the Galaxy
S 9 will not include an under the glass
fingerprint sensor but the report also
says the first Samsung phone with the
under display fingerprint scanner will
be the note 9 and Samsung doesn't feel
the pressure to risk it with the Galaxy
S 9 since Apple appears to have dished
it with their upcoming iPhone 8 this
stuff is still a long ways out but did
you think I wasn't going to tell you
this alright another story from
Leakesville the LGV 30 is another phone
that's had its fair share of render
leaks but this time hit records website
showed off the device with users who had
hands-on with it the videos have been
taken down but I'm calling this a
marketing ploy since it's LG who has a
long-standing relationship with Joseph
gordon-levitt and hit record and let's
be real
LG needs all the buzz they can get for
their phones okay on some quick notes a
couple months back and update broke the
ability for people to use their phones
hotspot with the chromecast but that
change has been fixed and you can now go
back to streaming content using your
phone's connection to the chromecast and
that's real nice okay YouTube has
finally rolled out the ability to share
videos and have mobile chat about those
shared videos in the US Canada has been
able to do this since January 2017 but
it's been improved over that time and is
now available for Android and iOS users
you can access it in the shared tab in
the YouTube mobile app alright that's it
for this week you can email me at Google
issues at cnet.com or tweet me at brian
Tong thanks so much for watching we'll
catch y'all next time for some more of
that Google issues
you're delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
