designing up a watch about how to really
reveal all of the great ecosystem of
applications on this device and we
wanted to build it in a way that was
really easy to find and use so we've
connected it to the digital crown so if
I press the digital crown at the top
here it takes me out to my applications
very easy to get out to my apps and I
can pan just by simply swiping on the
screen here I can also get an overview
of all of my apps just by rotating the
crown that will zoom out to a universe
of apps now to launch apps it's very
simple of course you just tap on one of
them here's the clock and to customize
your watch face you just force touch on
the display and it goes back a little
bit now I can simply swipe over here and
I can choose another watch face now in
addition to your looking at information
you may have information coming to you
and when you're notified of things on
Apple watch we're using the taptic
engine to give you feedback on your
wrist it's just like somebody tapping
you on the wrist very gently and even if
you're sitting right next to someone
they won't be able to tell that you're
getting notified it's very subtle but
you'll field on your own wrist and if
you do choose to look at something
that's coming in you just raise your
wrist and the notification will come in
just like this here's a calendar
invitation and then I have buttons that
are specific to that type of
notification different buttons will come
with different notifications here it's a
calendar invite so I can accept or
decline or maybe I'm totally going to go
except now you might also get other
notifications
here's one from Johnny I'm going to
press reply and now we've created
something called quick board to enable
really quick replies to messages that
you're getting and you can see here
we've actually analyzed the text that's
coming in and picked out some things you
might want to just tap on and send back
now I can also use dictation to reply
okay that would send either an audio
recording of my voice or can convert
that to text and send it or I can use a
new selection of animated emoji that
we've created for Apple watch so we've
got a Photos app here and now of course
precious photos number in the hundreds
rather than a couple and if I'd like to
I can tap on photos and bring them in
larger on the screen here and I can look
at them one by one just by swiping one
other app app I'd like to show you as
maps of course it shows me where I'm at
here at Flint Center
and I can pan around just by swiping so
we can see the neighborhood I can also
zoom out with the crown if I rotate the
crown it zooms me out I could see more
of the area now if I'd like to look for
things around me you can bring up a
context menu for maps my force touch and
here I have a search command and I can
find things by dictation my favorites or
if I recently search for things I can
just tap on those so we've got whole
foods here let's get directions to Whole
Foods I'll just tap there it's going to
calculate find the local Whole Foods
here and you got the hours and you have
also a phone number if you'd like to
call home foods and you have directions
walking and driving so let's get walking
directions to Whole Foods
so it's figuring out the best way to get
there now and I'm going to press Start
it's going to a little simulated walk
too so you can see how it goes here now
while you're walking Apple watch will
give you a taptic feedback on each turn
so you'll know whether it's time to turn
left or to turn right and those feelings
are different for each direction so you
can actually know without even looking
at your watch which way to go it's like
having this invisible guide with you we
have two new applications in Apple watch
the first is the fitness app the fitness
app monitors all of your activity and
movement throughout the day and the
second is the workout app the workout
app allows you to set specific goals for
specific types of workouts like cycling
or running Apple watch brings together
the capabilities of an all-day fitness
tracker and a highly advanced sports
watch in one device you can wear all the
time it can track a wider variety of
activities because it's able to collect
more types of data it uses an
accelerometer to measure your total body
movement it has a custom sensor that can
measure intensity by tracking your heart
rate and it uses the GPS and Wi-Fi in
your iPhone to track how far you've
moved
Apple watch requires the iPhone because
it's been designed to seamlessly work
together like with handoff where you
might read an email on your watch and
then respond to it on the iPhone the
email appears right in the lock screen
of your iPhone it's really cool of
course Apple watch works with iPhone 6
and iPhone 6 plus but we've also
designed it so that it will work with
iPhone 5 iPhone 5c and iPhone 5s Apple
watch starts at only 349 dollars
and it will be available early next year
and it is worth the way</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
