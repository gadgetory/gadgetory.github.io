alameda california inside they are
making vodka let's go and take a tour in
360 degrees i'm here with kaylee a head
distiller now this doesn't look like
your typical distillery what's going on
in this room so this is our workshop and
quality-control lab back here we do all
of our quality control proof checks
pretty much anything we would do at a
typical distillery but we also use this
space to innovate all of our new flavors
and expressions at hangar so you've got
my test still behind me here we can do
everything from cool vodka distillations
on this to flavor creation which will be
working on a little bit this is where
the magic happens kaylee takes dry Delta
breeze infused in 190 proof vodka and
separates them from the alcohol so these
are like nice Lucy elderberries they've
been absorbing that alcohol all week
we're just going to throw these guys in
here and then we'll add a little bit of
water and still the rest of the flavor
we're doing a pot distillation when
you're making vodka you traditionally
use a vodka column that's what this guy
is we would use it if we were using you
know wine or some sort of grain mash to
make vodka but right now we've already
got 190 proof vodka so we're just going
to go straight to the top distillation
hot distillation let's a little more
water come through the water will bring
through flavor which means we'll get a
little bit of the flavor compounds out
of the elderberries with the alcohol and
the water as it comes through it should
be very delicious so yeah I think we're
ready to go by this little guy up and
let it heat up and yeah we'll just have
to wait for it to get hot enough so boom
now it's just waiting watching the pot
boil so we've just seen some small-scale
distillation now let's take a look at
how it's done on a really large scale
take a spin around and I'll catch you on
the flip side
so this is very similar to the small
still on this pot would be almost
exactly like what we were using to make
the flavors we make all of our core
flavors on this big pot the two columns
next to us help us achieve 190 proof
which is what we need to make vodka
vodka can be made from absolutely
anything as long as it reaches that 190
proof which is ninety-five percent
alcohol so right now we're distilling
wine into vodka so we've got the wine
running through the big column and or
the big pot and it's starting to go into
the first column where we are fortunate
to go through evaporation condensation
multiple times that we can separate the
water from the alcohol a lot more
efficiently inside the distiller
chambers fill with boiling alcohol it
vaporizes into the next chamber and the
process repeats over and over again
leaving behind impurities with each step
bubbling away it is it is bubbling away
where we're in about full reflux here on
the bottom section of the column we're
still in the process of heating up the
the next few sections finally the
finished vodka gets bottled along a
conveyor line and packaged into boxes
where it sent out to over 50 states in
the US and internationally to the UK and
Canada
