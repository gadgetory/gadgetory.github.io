and right now we're taking a first look
at the Motorola MOTO X born from the
union between motorola mobility and its
recent corporate master Google a lot of
people have been eagerly waiting this
device but let me make this very clear
the Moto X is not a nexus phone for
developers and tech enthusiasts neither
is it a google play edition handset for
Android purists instead think of the
Moto X as a unique collaboration between
motorola and google to target ordinary
smartphone users with nimble performance
a compact and comfortable design along
with some really whiz-bang Android
abilities Motorola says you can expect
the Moto X to ship in late august early
September of 2013 for a suggested price
of one 9999 it should also hit 80
Verizon Sprint and US Cellular a
t-mobile version is apparently in the
works but it's not clear if it will be
an unsubsidized model or not if you're
expecting the Moto X to have a
top-of-the-line laundry list of parts
well forget about it essentially using
the same hardware as Motorola's new
droids on verizon the X is powered by
Motorola's x8 computing system unlike
the true quad-core processors driving
today's mobile hot rods like the HTC One
samsung galaxy s4 and LG g2 the x8
system is based on a dual-core 1.7
gigahertz Snapdragon s4 pro chip still
that doesn't mean the Moto X is slow far
from it in fact backing up the processor
is muscular quad-core Adreno graphics a
healthy two gigabytes of RAM plus two
additional cores a natural language
processor and one for contextual
computing running a special Motorola
flavor of Android 4.2 to jellybean the
Moto X uses these cores to perform some
pretty wild tricks the first is
touchless control meaning that after the
X is trained to recognize your voice it
listens out for your command when you
utter the phrase ok Google now the phone
perks up tied into the Google now
advanced search tool you can then ask it
to perform a number of tasks such as
looking up facts navigational directions
or simply setting
finders making appointments or
initiating calls another one of the Moto
X's tricks is called active display
instead of having to fire up the phone
screen each time an alert comes through
the display will pulse with notification
icons touching the icons in the center
of the screen tells the ex to display
more details dragging them upwards wakes
up the phone and lets you jump directly
to the email text or social media alert
in question much of what makes the Moto
X really compelling though is its design
this is one really really well-crafted
phone trust me realize that from the
moment you pick it up it has a sturdy
feel with reassuring heft there's even a
little dimple inside the motorola logo
where you naturally place your index
finger it all adds up to an outrageously
comfortable fit in the palm by default
the Moto X is available in two colors
black and white what's really
interesting though is that Motorola will
provide a moto maker website to create
moto X's in a myriad range of custom
colors customers can even have their
handsets stamped with personal
engravings for added distinctiveness
compact and trim enough to fit into
tight pants pockets or other cramped
locations the Moto X is about the same
dimensions as the LG Nexus 4 yet manages
to shoehorn in a larger 4.7 inch 720p
OLED screen it's bright colorful and has
nice contrast even when viewed off angle
above the display is a 2 megapixel front
camera while below it well there are no
physical keys at all you do have virtual
buttons for back home and recent
applications the back of the Moto X
houses its 10 megapixel main camera and
LED flash while the sensor isn't
technically a sharp as competing phone
cameras Motorola says it's clear pixel
technology let's send 75 percent more
light than ordinary handset imaging
systems Motorola also simplified the
cameras app interface both paring down
the number of settings and virtual
buttons it also pushed the settings to
the left side out of view still there
are modes for HDR and panorama the Moto
X's camera is also designed for speed
twisting the phone in your wrist twice
quickly causes the camera app to launch
from any application or when the device
is asleep touch anywhere on the screen
to snap a picture or long
us to shoot multiple shots in a row
sliding your finger up and down zooms in
or out while swiping right to left opens
the gallery you can take stills while
recording video too still there are
modes for HDR and panorama of course as
with any smartphone there are some
drawbacks for instance the standard Moto
X comes with 16 gigabytes of internal
storage that's not a lot of space
considering there's no SD card slot to
add more data breathing room
additionally while the Moto X uses a
respectably sized 2200 milliamp battery
it isn't removable I'm Brian Bennett for
cnet.com and this has been a first look
at the motorola moto x</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
