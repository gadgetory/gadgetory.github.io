here with the dyson DC 41 animal
complete vacuum cleaner now this is a
very very high-end vacuum it's 649
dollars about as expensive as you're
going to find and it promises
top-of-the-line performance
so naturally we wanted to figure out
just how top of the line of vacuum this
is so we put it through a comprehensive
series of tests we did pet hair and
cereal and human hair sand sawdust
nuts and bolts you name it we threw it
at this vacuum to see what it could
handle and overall this vacuum did very
well it is a top of the line high-end
vacuum it does extremely well one of the
vacuuming things up however I have some
major qualms with it that make me say
it's a no by now let's take a look at
the design of this thing when you hear
the word dyson when you think about
dyson products at dyson airblade dyson
vacuums you probably think a good design
you think these are products that are
cutting-edge and they're made in the
laboratory and they're very advanced and
they're just meticulously plotted out
but the problem with this vacuum lies in
the design first off you can't bring it
out of its standing position without
yanking it you can't step on it
somewhere there's no button you just
have to give it a good yank and I hated
that I felt like I was hurting it every
time I put it down and what's worse if
you don't put it down all the way these
back wheels here won't pop up and get
out of the way and it makes it so it
vacuums very poorly and it's an easy
thing to miss so you have to kind of be
careful with it then when you're putting
it back up it doesn't always snap into
place the way it should you hear a click
but you need to click it and give it a
little extra oomph to make it stand up
if you don't it'll fall right back down
and I can't tell you how many times
during testing I would click it up to
put it into a standing position only to
have it fall back down towards the floor
and I'd have to dart down to catch it on
top of that let's take a look at the
wand the wand reaches pretty far it's
got a lot of attachments that's what you
get with this dyson animal complete
aside from the attachments the hose
itself just isn't very good it's not
designed well there's no handle there's
no good place to hold it like I said it
performed very well it got a 9 out of 10
in performance but in terms of design
Dyson's notorious for good design
and this is not well designed so I'm a
little stunned by it now all that out of
the way there are a lot of good things
about this and there's a reason at 649
dollars not just the performance it also
gets the dyson ball which is very good
as for the canister itself it's got a
nice size it's fairly easy to open and
dump out and close but if you look at it
it's just got a lot of little plastic
kind of flimsy parts that move around a
little too much the plastic itself is
supposed to be the same stuff they make
riot shields out of dyson is very proud
of that and i have no doubt that it is
very strong it's not going to break or
crack but the rest of this plastic here
that's not riot shield material right
there and that doesn't really inspire
our confidence so I guess the point is
if you like Dyson vacuums if you love
this design and think the Dyson is a
really quality brand sure this is the
best vacuum they've got it's going to do
very well it's going to clean up any
messy throw at it but I think there are
better vacuums out there with better
designs that do just as well this is so
expensive it needs to be perfect in
order for us to love it and it's just
not for CNET I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
