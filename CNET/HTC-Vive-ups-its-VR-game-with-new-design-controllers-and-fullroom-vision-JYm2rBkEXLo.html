reality platforms coming this year an
HTC vive is one of them it's been
delayed a bit but you can see why there
is new hardware and we got a chance to
take a look at the vive pre the latest
development hardware here at CES in Las
Vegas and this is what it's all about
the first thing you notice is that the
headset is lighter weight it also has a
front facing camera that scans the room
and allows you to enter a mode called
chaperone that lets you see other things
in the room people furniture and
navigate even while you're wearing the
headset I was even able to check the
time on my watch there's also new
controller design both of them are
lighter weight the little touch pad has
been moved to the bottom and it feels
more comfortable the other change has to
do with lighthouse these are the light
sensors that's fit in the corners of
your room there are now more compact
their wireless and they look a little
more attractive when you put them on you
can tell that everything looks clear HTC
said this is because of a reduction of a
mirror effect which minimizes is sort of
a dirty window effect you got before
basically means the fish seem clearer
and the virtual offices seem crisper and
poppier everything looked a lot more
vivid during my two demos the blue which
was an underwater aquatic simulator on
the deck of a sunken pirate ship and job
simulator where I tried to
unsuccessfully make coffee and turn on
my computer HTC intends to sell the vibe
as one complete system controllers
headset and room sensors that's a
differentiator from other virtual
reality platforms coming out in 2016</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
