it's not their best-selling kind of an
odd conundrum so what do you do about
that first of all you make it look a lot
more macho let's drive the 2013 Porsche
Boxster and check the tech now some
perspective for you non Porsche files
the Boxster and its cousin the Cayman
are the only mid-engine cars in the
Porsche production line and arguably
therefore they have the best crash
mid-engine cars are the ones that always
tend to handle the best and yet the
boxers always kind of gotten that little
pat on the head like Oh aren't you cute
Porsche remains the oddball among German
cars with a touchscreen and a little
small controller compared to outtie BMW
and Mercedes who have non touchscreens
and elaborate control knobs Porsche then
hampers themselves by having one of the
more non intuitive user interfaces it
almost feels like it was designed to be
tidy more than useable not awful just a
bit opaque and it's in a foot race with
Honda for most years since he needed
overhaul this round dial screen on the
right side is one of my favourites a lot
can go on in there and it's always well
laid out all the modern inputs are here
am/fm satellite radio discs bluetooth
streaming audio USB as well for your
iPod when that iPods connected the
scrolling and navigation are quick and
clean
sport modal sharpen up your powertrain
responsiveness suspension button here
will firm things up underneath the
Porsche active suspension is a full
adaptive rig if you option that missing
in our card is the Sport Chrono Package
you can always spot it by the analog
chronograph in the dash the auto
start/stop defeat button didn't get much
use from me I left auto start/stop
engaged and I don't think it's set the
car down more than twice in a day so
fine by me cup holders were a big leave
out in the original Boxster now Porsche
seems to be compensating with these
elaborately designed swing arm units
that can actually be dressed with the
aluminum cover when deployed Wow okay so
this 2013 Boxster as you can see has a
lot in common with its siblings in terms
of the cabin tech and even the cabin
design but things are very different
back here or should I say about here
tucked in the middle where you can't see
it is the Boxster engine 2.7 liter
direct injection flat six dry sump
design that means the oil doesn't just
drip down to some belly pan it's pumped
in under pressure from an offshore
reservoir that allows the engine to be
less high and sit lower that drops the
cars center of gravity the numbers 265
horsepower a rather slim 206 foot-pounds
of torque
rev this guy zero to sixty five and a
half seconds while doing 20 30 mpg now
those numbers are for our car a
six-speed manual also available is a
7-speed dual-clutch they call it a PDK
that'll reduce your 0 to 60 time by 3
tenths and raise your mpg by 2 miles so
it's a win/win but it does add 3,200
bucks
and the beginning of a Boxster is it's
very pure and it's mid-engine it's their
simplest car yes but it's one of the
most fun to drive there's not too much
power it's not a ponderous machine the
handling is really tremendous even
though it does get sneered at a bit now
we're driving a standard Boxster not an
ass or anything hotter and I like that
because you can and will use all of what
this car can do you can't say that for
most Porsches they have too much on tap
you aren't able to drive all of it in
this case you can it's really
exhilarating the fit and finish on this
car has always been good but in this
generation they've really stepped up the
sophistication this is no longer a raw
kind of car in terms of cabin comfort
totally dialed in very quiet when the
tops up very well behaved now with the
top down and of course the big different
series you've got this new very grown-up
Porsche cabin now that's taken DNA from
modern 911s and really from the Panamera
is where this whole design look got
started it's a real sybaritic type of
Boxster even though it's meant to be
there you know leanest experience all
the controls are very direct and fairly
heavy on this car another Boxster trait
it's a great clutch and gearbox not my
favorite in the Porsche line but given
the price I guess that's okay
steering response is very direct and
clean I'm fine without it being in sport
mode there's not that much more to be
dug out with sport mode on and the rides
plenty firm without getting into the
sport chassis but you've got those
available if you get into a really great
road or if you drag this thing the auto
start-stop with a manual is a real messy
affair I don't like auto start-stop on
manual gearboxes I think it's OK on
automatics it was very uneven and
unpredictable on this car overall I'd
say this ignore the sneers that are
attendant with a Boxster just get it in
drive one and enjoy the experience and
don't worry about what everyone's saying
or thinking about you this is a great
driving car and obviously it's your best
bargain in the Porsche world
you can configure any Porsche a thousand
ways but to make it easy
let's go CNET style by spending fifty
five five and here's how we do it fifty
thousand four fifty is the base car plus
destination add the infotainment system
with bose option that package is forty
five sixty four touch screen LCD
navigation head unit Bose audio
satellite radio and HD radio to add
voice control of nav phone and radio
functions is a paltry but ala carte five
hundred and twenty bucks and if you want
the PDK gearbox that's thirty two
hundred as I mentioned there is no rear
camera available on a Boxster and when
the tops up you'll wish there was
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
