phones wool for starters they're both
powered by Android that's right this is
subterra asteroid the world's first
Android powered car stereo receiver
let's pop it our test car and see what
it does see what's interesting about the
asteroid is that and you bring one of
these into the car it's no 3G access
point when you plug it into the USB port
in this car it basically turns it into
the Internet connected car stereo that
it's advertised as for example you have
road trip there's a Google map software
that'll allow you to get point A to
point feet there's also an interesting
tuning radio app for the extreme audio
and podcasts from the internet but there
are a couple of caveats
for example that Google Maps software it
doesn't give you live turn-by-turn
directions and update basically it'll
give you directions from where you are
to where you're going but you have to
manually advance them with the skip
forward and skip backward but but it's
not all bad I mean for starters there's
a really great voice command system on
here that allows you to push a button
and by saying the name Gorillaz and
it'll do it just like that you've also
got a really good hands-free calling
system and because the asteroid comes
with a dual microphone system that has
noise cancellation and echo cancellation
it's also one of the best sounding
hands-free calling systems that we've
tested
Optimus Prime
aunty his dry
my biggest issue though comes back to
those ABS because they're gonna really
make or break this car stereo it's what
makes it stand out from the basic sort
of mech free receivers that are on the
market for about a hundred bucks less
the good thing though is that parent is
actively pursuing more partnerships with
more at partners until then I've been an
Salon good when we've been taking a look
at the territory</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
