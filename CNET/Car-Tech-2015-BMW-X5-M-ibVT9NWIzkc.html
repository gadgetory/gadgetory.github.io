and you're definitely with the new x5s a
more otherwise a quick spotters guide
includes very much a softer look a down
the sides of the car a very busy angular
aggressive face on our M car of course
Em's also get these functional scoops
down on each lower chin corner as well
as a set of functional blade exits right
behind the front wheels and the badging
is a dead giveaway as well
now an x5 M isn't just a performance car
it's a profit car and a status car and
this one's beautifully turned out I mean
look at this kind of chainmail - trim
hearing on the doors and we've got this
power tilt up acoustic dispersion thing
on the dash part of an almost 4,000
dollar Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen audio upgrade and
of course M style sports seats but let's
get down to the technology we've seen
the iDrive head unit before it's wide
and big and bold it looks like it moves
up and down it doesn't it's not touch of
course it's German nothing too new on
the controller turn kick click and
writing and pinch and zoom touch pad on
top of the knob 2 of my favorite
features though include the connected
drive menu which has the BMW online to
go do relatively freeform online search
basically for things you want to NAV -
the downside is dog SLO 3G the other
nice touch I do want to call out here is
how they do satellite radio you can
change the way it lists the channels by
either channel name or by artist name
that's a much smarter way to look at
channels than by their name but enough
in the infotainment which we've seen
before let's get to the drive controls
that means so much when you've got an M
car put it simply there are more ways to
set up this powertrain than there are to
leave your lover I counted at least 60
we start here with a very different
shifter this is an M style shifter has
no Park position you can tell
immediately you're in an M car and below
that you've got three profiles for what
they call Drive logic this is the
aggression and how hard it holds the
various rpm points on the gearbox over
to the left that little speedometer
looking thing that's your power delivery
how aggressive it ramps up power
delivery under the pedal below that
you've got your suspension settings
again three levels also we have air
suspension in this vehicle also an
active anti-roll technology and below
that that tells what nature of steering
assist you've got from the acure
electric steering rack aid you're going
in a straight line by the way there's no
assist at all to keep the energy loss as
low it only dives in when you move the
wheel and all of these different
settings can be mushed together and
saved under two macros you see there on
the steering wheel M 1 and M 2 now the
other big basket of driving tech is
under this one but
here is your driver assist technologies
which they call intelligent safety
frontal collision warning technology and
it also aids braking to have collision
mitigation pedestrian warning where the
vehicles going to see pedestrians in
front of you and give you warning lane
departure warning is exactly that it's a
warning with a stick shaker on the wheel
if you're drifting out of your lane and
you get some indicators in the dash but
the vehicle doesn't bring you back in by
itself and finally what they call active
blind spot detection which isn't really
active again it doesn't bring you back
from a collision it just warns you of a
collision now up here under the schnozz
of our x5 amp it's a four point four
liter v8 kind of quake but very modern
with its fully adjustable valve train
the BMW is famous for direct injection
of course and the turbos you could
almost call it a quad turbo setup
because they have dual twin-scroll turbo
one on each bank 567 or sets up three
percent last year and five hundred
fifty-three pound-feet of torque that's
up 10 percent zero to sixty even though
it weighs fifty two hundred pounds is a
flat four seconds that's getting up and
going your mpg is where you do pay the
piper a bit 14:19 I would imagine if
this wasn't an exempt truck style SUV it
would have a gas guzzler tax but it
doesn't and these ex 5ms are all
eight-speed automatics not dual clutch
but a straight-up fluid based torque
converter automatic and they're all
all-wheel-drive
underway one word hard the seats are
kind of like church pews and the
suspension is unforgiving is Mother
Superior regardless of mode so much so
that the x5 M actually rattles on iffy
pavement in spite of its rear air
suspension and active dampers the power
comes on nice and hard too and it's easy
to modulate that's high praise for
nestled inside a big vehicle the only
exception is when you're cruising in Top
Gear and need something right now then
it takes a moment to unbundle the
OverDrive's
at no point that I wish this car had a
manual or dual clutch by the way all
wheel drive is biased toward the rear
but it can do a hundred percent there or
to the front and can split torque across
the rear axle to turn the car in not
just point mx-5s have always been
premium suvs and once you go and you're
really premium that's why we're talking
a hundred thousand dollars to start then
you got to add three things to go seen
that style and I think skip to others
driver assist Plus is less than two
grand for a whole slew of driver assist
technologies that I think are a good
value the executive package makes me
grit my teeth it's forty five hundred
bucks so I only want about half of what
it brings like the HUD the active LED
headlights I could live without the
ventilated seats and heated rears but
that's the package the joy of driving
this thing does not include parking it
so spend the paltry five bills on
parking assist to handle the steering
I'll skip the bno for 3,700 I bet the
base Harman Kardon sounds really good
and I'm not sold on night-vision cameras
yet in general and when they're way over
in the center stack I'm really not all
they were pushing 107 grand the way I
would do it that's nowhere near fully
loaded the x5 m is a specialized vehicle
and you've got to be comfortable this
idea of a large ish SUV that is also a
track machine I don't know that it makes
a lot of sense but if you want it you
want it and this does it exceptionally
well if you're not convinced to the
concept there are plenty of other very
capable fives that don't have the ammo
