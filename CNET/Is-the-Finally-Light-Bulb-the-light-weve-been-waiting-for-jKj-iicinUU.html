buying a light bulb your options
typically boil down to incandescent
fluorescent and LED but the finally
light bulb is a new option that wants to
give you an alternatives now before you
get worried that there is a fourth light
bulb category to keep track of keep in
mind that this is actually more of a
fluorescent than anything else
inside you'll find mercury and other
fluorescent gases that interact about
electromagnetic electricity in order to
produce the light that's really the same
thing that a CFL does just it gets that
electricity to the gas in a different
way the benefits of that approach is
that the finally light bulb can promise
to last 15,000 hours that's longer than
the five to eight thousand hours you'll
get with the CFL but not as long as most
LEDs that can promise up to twenty five
thousand hours it's also not quite as
efficient as an LED it uses 14 and a
half watts to put out a state at 800
lumens most LEDs nowadays are well under
10 watts to do the same thing the big
claim here though is better light
quality and that's where I begin to have
some problems with this bulb first off
it's not quite as bright as advertised
we clocked it at 589 lumens an hour
integrating sphere and that's well
underneath the state at 800 lumens we've
seen similar problems with brightness
and other fluorescent bulbs we've also
seen poor color rendering scores and a
finally bulb wasn't much different if
you look at this picture of an
appetizing looking bowl of M&amp;amp;Ms lifts by
the finely light bulb you can see that
the colors all look kind of muted and
the whites kind of yellowed out it's not
a great result especially when you
compare it to a 60 watt incandescent you
can see the whites a lot better there
the colors pop a little more and it's
brighter overall now the finally light
bulb does get some things right with
color quality especially when it comes
to skin tones we tested this out by
holding my hands in two separate
compartments of our light box that's a
60 watt incandescent on the right and
the finally on the left you can see that
it looks very similar the hands both
looks nice the skin tones get
complemented by the light and the reason
for it has to do with the way the bulb
is emitting light now if you look at
this graph this is a very wonky looking
graph but bear with me now an
incandescent and an LED will produce a
graph that's a smooth sloping line the
fluorescent lights we test all have
these kind of spiky graphs and those
spikes are all the different gases in
the bulb that are interacting the
electricity to produce light that
specific
parts of the wavelength so you get a
spike for magenta a spike for greeny a
big spike for yellow all of that adds up
to the way the bowl looks with the
finally bulb you can see that nice
healthy spike in magenta that's very
helpful for skin tones you can also see
that spike in the invisible infrared
part of the spectrum that tells you that
the bulb is trying to sort of enhance
the way Reds pop that spike isn't gonna
make the bulb any brighter but it is
going to make red to look a little
better so it does do something's right
with color quality overall though I just
don't see the value here this is a ten
dollar bulb and you have to taste
shipping as well there are tons of LEDs
that cost less than that right now
including dimmable ones you can't dim
this I say stick with those unless
finely lowers the price for more check
out my full review at cnet.com and field
your light bulb questions to me on
Twitter for CNET appliances I'm right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
