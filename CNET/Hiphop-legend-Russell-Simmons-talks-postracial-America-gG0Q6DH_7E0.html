CES on Paul Sloan executive editor and
I'm excited to be joined by two people
at the cutting edge of media video music
and its rapid transformation as we all
watch and listen anywhere and anytime
first Russell Simmons often called a
hip-hop mogul and business magnate who
got his start when he teamed up with
producer Rick Rubin's create def jam
records in the 80s bringing us everyone
from the Beastie Boys to ll cool j &amp;amp;
Public Enemy he's done much more of
course he's created fashion lines TV
programs movies even financial service
products to name a few and now he's
running a DD all def digital which is an
original content youtube channel aimed
at what he calls a post-racial America
next to him is Brian Robbins a film and
TV director and producer who runs
awesomeness TV which is one of the first
original channels launched on YouTube
the two are now part partnering on all
that digital thank you so much for
joining us Russell I understand it's
your first time here at CES I know you
haven't had time to walk around but
impressions why are you here tell us
what you're what you're here for all I'm
here primarily I mean my youtube channel
is about the same pursuit I've had in
beginning like discovering talent and
crossing it through different media and
this is the place to be so I'm here
because I basically have to I mean smite
who had done my whole life and and I'm a
little late I think being here but I
it's funny that I'm late but the
industry itself seems that have this
huge white space where there's all this
integration that happened through
hip-hop and that in media has not
happened really you know online as much
as it could so if you take vincent's you
know there's not been a one black
comedian since def Comedy Jam hoosick
emerged as crossed over and let's i
would say Kevin Hart but he hasn't yet
either so it's Hollywood and media in
general has not like advertising like
music like other industries have
embraced a new America and so for me I
want to buy a TV network but they wanted
to offer me very minimal subs and start
crawling and I thought I didn't really
want a young person tell me what content
to release or what to expound on and so
this for me is my network this a DD all
deaf
all def music all def poetry all def
Comedy all deaf you know this whole
space of America is underexposed and so
for me building this network and with
YouTube's help and Brian who I've known
for 20 years that date you yes that's I
this but so doing this for me is the
next most obvious thing to do so a DD by
the way I think one of the great names
just for this ad degeneration online for
this moment you look at things that if
it doesn't happen this second you press
the button but you watch a TV show for
15 minutes and after 15 minutes you say
I hate this this sucks and you sit there
for 15 more minutes to be sure that you
hate it but on but I think people are
learning to broaden you know the
appreciation and and more content is
being viewed for longer periods of time
so what will we expect to see and when I
mean you said it's focused on the cool
side of pop culture b.e.t for YouTube
what's it on the right I don't like to
be teeth every time they say black they
say or diversely they say it's a more
black stuff I mean it needs to be more
black stuff but this integration that
Hollywood are they all liberal and nice
people but they don't really understand
it is America if you watch Jerry
Springer and the rest of the world in
the suburbs of Cleveland is integrating
and if it does if it's not a post-racial
America there's a potential oh and
that's what people want to see Hollywood
should be in the front and since
Hollywood is not the internet is whether
I signed yesterday for instance
spokenreasons like he could be the next
Chris Tucker right he's online he's like
the number one online video blogger in
the urban space but they don't see him
and so I'm here to kind of like
integrate and move forward culture you
know but for all these new channels and
new opportunities isn't it these in
these in these industries are still
driven by hits are you not with my kids
hey Brian I mean what's the opportunity
for a YouTube channel it's a giant
opportunity a telomere experience never
be 25 years ago no one knew at ESPN and
MTV and Nickelodeon CNN no one knew what
the cable what's cable and you had to go
you know operator by operator through
the country to get clearance today on
YouTube there's 850 million unique
people on the platform
850 million you're able to reach from
day one some like older or younger
person who knows nothing about what
you're doing tell you what to do it it's
it's exciting and I'm sorry I will cut
you up huh how do they find you how does
it grow that's what I do I make people i
mean take something that's that's
emerging and and spread it across all
forms of media and through this genre
I'll do this this because changed a lot
right so when I made launch small lil
for instance on the WB we had a huge
outdoor campaign and commercials
everywhere and stuff like that today on
awesomenesstv my audience is all teens
and tweens and I know how to reach them
I don't need a bus and a billboard I can
tweet to them I can Instagram to them
they're on facebook I don't need a 20
million dollar marketing campaign to
launch a video television show anymore
and it's and it's proven like we're up
you know six months with 60 million
views 300,000 subscribers from zero six
months ago awesomeness TV news on TV the
same thing will happen with a DD Russell
has two million something Twitter
followers you know these artists on
youtube that you don't know he said
spokenreasons I probably have no idea
who's spokenreasons is right he's a kid
a comedian on YouTube who has a million
subscribers a couple hundred million
views but he's undiscovered well we're
going to rediscover him and let the
world know who he is so is this how new
genres are going to happen I mean could
when def jam came around when you guys
yeah I mean that this is the opportunity
to let the people speak and also to you
know if you pay attention and nurture
talent which is my whole life's work you
know nurture town and that emerges
aren't so the record business long long
ago stopped developing artists they SAT
there and waited for artists to develop
themselves and they'd fight over them
when they got hot and it's about
curating because it find out when the
chase them you know when or if you don't
have in your heart you have you can just
look at numbers and so that's the
reality that entertainment is you know
this it's becoming more user-friendly
and user-generated stuff is becoming the
key I mean we don't have a Justin Bieber
we don't have you know Diggy my nephew
eat he didn't call me save us how do I
get a record deal I saw his his video
that he made for nickel on TV and he was
a star I called my brother like they've
have you know your son is on TVs like
yeah I heard like so you know that's
real talk I mean people are doing you
know on their own and and I think they
need help obviously and navigation
through the whole media world and they
need to take what they're doing online
and spread it and either broaden what
they're doing online as well yeah so
what's your view of the music industry
now we're going to start a music company
as well all deaf music will be music
from your people we're going to curate
and build out a multi-channel network
and we're going to help people you know
build their own and that's going to be
part of our process so the music thing
we just partner we have announced yet
but we just announced today our
partnership so only one announcement a
day right but I think it's important
that that people nurture them to I think
the record companies they don't realize
it's the 360 business I'm an
entrepreneur I used to look at the
contracts all rights would bring me even
though i left the record business they
want to own a pc of sneaker well they
don't make sneakers they don't they want
to own a piece of your film could work
but they don't know how to produce a
film they don't they want to do TV with
you but they don't really know anything
about television they're kind of a
stagnant business it's not
entrepreneurial as people who work in
the rec they still call it the record
business I mean in a little so i think
that there's a music there's a to
exploit people's position in the music
business or brand in the music business
I'm broaden their brand and use it for
it all that people want to be is a
business but it's not really being
monetized in ways that I'm sure that
ways to monetize music that are coming
and there's always new ones but you know
until they figure out how to monetize
music they not a 360 business right are
you fans of Spotify Pandora these
services seem great for consumers but
musicians I think that you know the
musicians themselves can find ways to
monetize and they direct more and the
brick-and-mortar a system that the music
business has at this moment is not
benefiting but as music gets exposed
more artists should get you know greater
benefit and they will and so what's it
all look like a couple years from now I
can't I'm
that's a question I'm not sitting there
trying to analyze every day I don't see
every innovation that comes in that
pushes out I remember bringing them naps
didn't say why don't you talk to these
guys they're like we won't talk to my
cell k sure and I was lit by that time I
was almost done so you know I saw it I
remember this kind of stagnant but they
learned a little bit I guess after I
tuned the only thing to care for lunch
they were forced desperation look you've
done so many different kinds of
businesses is there a thread that ties
them together well my partner Brian what
he built with awesomeness is not to be
it's like it's unbelievable and and I
think that what's going to happen online
is going to really have synergistic
value for anything that I do and it
already doesn't have it in that company
I do have a Content company which I I
built up over the last few years called
global Brian and I and I see this this
thread this next America in that
that company is proof of concept that
there is this integration and and this
is call community that needs to be
spoken to but not segregated so I'm
already doing that and I think that's
what I'm looking to do now with a DD
okay there's so much more but
unfortunately we are out of time nothing
you're not 11 he was welcome to jump in
socket he's good I'm sorry thank you
thank you russell simmons and brian
robbins thanks so much for being here
we'll take a quick break and cns UK uk's
jason jenkins will be here with the
panel he calls the British are coming
stay tuned
