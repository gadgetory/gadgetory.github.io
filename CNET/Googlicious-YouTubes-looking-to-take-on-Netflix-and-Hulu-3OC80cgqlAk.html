with the Google issues for everything
google that we can pack inside of a show
there's always plenty of action and a
lot around YouTube lately now according
to Variety Google's video behemoth is
exploring a subscription video service
that would compete directly with Netflix
Hulu and others YouTube has already
started negotiating deals for its own
service and in the report an unnamed
YouTube partner says the company not
only wanted to discuss a licensing deal
but it's very aggressive in moving
forward quickly now we know viewing
behaviors are slowly but surely changing
in TVs not dead yet but online video
continues to grow as a more and more
legitimate piece of the revenue pie now
the youtubes is also adding a couple new
features including their new cards
feature that allows creators to add
interactive pop up like cards on top of
your videos that can be displayed on
both desktop and mobile google hopes
this will be a slicker way to eventually
replace annotations and inform viewers
about other videos merchandise or
playlists and have a sleek look as well
and 360-degree videos are now also live
on YouTube Google promised they'd be
coming in January and they're exactly
what they sound like you can use her
Android device and move your phone
around to look around the scene on your
desktop browser you can drag your mouse
around to see the different parts of the
video it's really cool stuff and with VR
headsets getting more momentum more
content like this is going to help push
the platform forward all right the
president of HTC America says HTC has a
big announcement for us customers on
Wednesday which could possibly point at
the u.s. availability of the new HTC One
m9 it's another advancement in the line
with a new metal finish 20 megapixel
camera with a sapphire lens and their
new flavor boom sound with Dolby Digital
support plus the ability to instantly
connect to different speakers for play
music but something also be aware of
according to Dutch website tweakers who
are running the gfx bench benchmark test
well the HTC One m9 recorded a surface
temperature around 55 degrees Celsius or
131 degrees Fahrenheit
yeah that's hot now it's a benchmark and
phones do run hotter during these tests
but it could support some of the
reported issues with a Snapdragon 810
processor overheating now we're not
saying this will happen to you and it
was run on unfun alized software but
this is the one case where you don't
want to be the hottest phone on the
market and if you like phone renders
here's some for you Twitter account on
leaks recently showed off a few press
renders of the LG g4 which if true has a
design that is more of a hybrid between
the LG g3 and the latest G flex 2 now
with this design a full metal body seems
unlikely and early reports from Korean
media claimed the design would be
radically different than the g3 with the
metal mixture body and Sony Xperia fans
can take a look at this latest leak from
on leaks as well at the z4 which really
aligns with some of the design elements
that we've seen from the Xperia z4
tablet that was launched earlier this
month alright that's going to do for
this week's show you can always email us
at Google licious at cnet com or tweet
me at Bryan Tom thanks for watching
we'll see you guys next time for some
more of that Google Isha's
