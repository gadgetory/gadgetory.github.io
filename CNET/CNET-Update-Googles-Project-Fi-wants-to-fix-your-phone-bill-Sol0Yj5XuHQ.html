with its phone I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update Google is
challenging the status quo for the
wireless industry it just launched its
own mobile service in the u.s. called
Project Phi and it is so crazy simple it
could change the future of wireless
service if other companies follow but
not everyone can sign up right away you
have to request an invite and it only
works on the Nexus 6 phone Google
developed a special SIM card for the
Nexus 6 that jumps between multiple
networks you see Google then build its
own infrastructure from scratch Google
is piggybacking off Sprint and t-mobile
cell towers switching you between
whichever carrier has the stronger
signal it also automatically connects to
nearby open Wi-Fi hotspots when
available because open Wi-Fi is sketchy
Google says it is encrypting your data
to protect it from hackers
now pricing for project Phi is very
straightforward and there's no annual
contract everyone pays $20 a month for
unlimited calling and texting data is
$10 for every gigabyte that's it so if
you want three gigs of data every month
your bill comes out to $50 but what if
you don't use all the data Google will
credit you back on the next bill for
data you didn't use if you had 800
megabytes to spare one month you get
eight books back the opposite is true
for when you go over you are only
charged for what you needed if you went
over 400 megabytes you're only charged
an extra four dollars international
travelers will also like this feature
you won't be charged more for using data
when you travel to more than 120
different countries international
texting is included in the plan and
international calls are 20 cents a
minute even though most people won't be
able to switch to this Google will still
influence change in the industry when
Google shows consumers there is an
alternative out there other carriers may
follow with more attractive offers and
that's all Google wants if this service
leads to better plans and we're gulping
down more content from the web no matter
which company we get our service from it
just benefits Google we saw this with
Google Fiber the home internet service
that is a hundred times faster than what
most
have at home the prices and availability
of one gigabit speeds encourage
competitors like AT&amp;amp;T to expand coverage
and compete with Google's prices Google
is not alone in some of these ideas
republic Wireless a small company based
in North Carolina announced it will also
pay back customers for unused data the
wireless world is changing fast and
there are new ways to think about how
you pay for service take for example the
messaging app whatsapp Android and iOS
users can now both make voice calls
through the app so you can talk to
anyone internationally over a data
connection that your tech news update
you can head over to cnet.com for more
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
