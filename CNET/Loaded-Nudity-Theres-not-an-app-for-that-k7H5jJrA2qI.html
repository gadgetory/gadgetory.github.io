Natali Morris and it's time to get
loaded amazon has acquired love film
which is Europe's version of netflix
love film is a movie rental and
streaming service this relationship is
not completely new Amazon already had a
forty-two percent stake in the company
nintendo announced pricing and
availability for the 3ds this is the 3d
portable gaming system the device comes
out on march 27th and it will cost 250
dollars it will come in black or blue
and have over 30 titles optimized to
play in 3d including Madden NFL street
fighter and the legend of zelda you can
now port your own phone number to google
voice originally Google assigned you a
new number when you signed up for its
voice service in order to use your
google voice number the service would
have to forward calls to your other main
number it was a little confusing now you
can change or pour your own number into
your account and Google will start using
that as your call out main number it
does cost twenty dollars and the feature
is not yet available to everyone when
you think of mobile facebook you think
of iphone or android right well facebook
wants those without smartphones to join
in the mobile fun too they launched
facebook for features phones this week
which is their nice way of saying this
is for those of you without smartphones
it works on over 2500 devices from nokia
sony LG and more and it does most of the
things you want to do in facebook
verizon wireless customers who recently
bought a phone will want to get the new
iphone can now get a two hundred dollar
gift card towards the purchase of an
iphone this will make it a little easier
if you want to make the switch but you
do have to pay the non subsidized price
for the phone t-mobile is rolling out a
service that will prevent you from
texting while driving which I sincerely
hope you are not ever ever doing the
application is called drive smart plus
it calculates the speed of your car and
puts the phone into driver mode this
will forward all calls to a Bluetooth
device and intercept all text messages
so you won't even see them it will auto
respond to the messages with an i'm
driving message you can overrule these
features they say you're the passenger
in the car the service cost 499
and only works with the optimus t for
now and finally about that playboy app
for the iPad it's not really a nap after
all pc magazine reports that playboy is
getting around apples no adult content
rule by bringing its content to the ipad
via the web browser so i guess you could
say that when it comes to naked ladies
there's not an app for that that's your
news for the day if you want more about
any of the stories we've talked about
visit cnet com / loaded I'll see you
tomorrow I'm Natali Morris for cnet.com
and you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
