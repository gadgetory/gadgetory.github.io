sometimes you just don't want anyone
else seeing what's up on your laptop
screen HP has a clever solution to what
we call visual hacking which really
means someone peeking over at your
screen and seeing what's on there it's
an integrated privacy filter that HP
calls sure view I've seen it before but
this is the first time I've gotten a
chance to review a laptop with it built
in in this case it's the 12 inch HP
EliteBook X 360 the filter sits dormant
until you press the f2 button then if
you're outside the immediate head-on
field of view the image quickly fades to
white and becomes unreadable it's a cool
idea and mostly works but it's not
perfect this doesn't do anything to help
when someone is looking right over your
shoulder and the screen only truly
washed it out when you're pretty far off
angle how effective it is depends on
what you have on screen and how hidden
you want it to be it's easy to make
basic text unreadable but people may
still be able to make up some details of
a video you're viewing or perhaps some
semi embarrassing photos from 2007 using
the privacy filter also knocked about an
hour off battery life which was only a
bit over seven hours at best anyway
beyond the shore view filter this is a
pretty good crossover laptop which means
it's a very secure business system but
cool-looking enough for regular
consumers think of it like a 12-inch
MacBook but with better processors and a
fingerprint reader and facial
recognition login just remember to turn
that privacy filter on before you start
watching movies at work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
