don't you well think again I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your scene that update
amazon nose ear eaters and tablets but
its next area to conquer could be
smartphones a report from bloomberg has
the media buzzing again about the idea
of an Amazon smartphone we heard this
last year from analysts but now
anonymous sources are saying that
Amazon's buying up wireless patents to
prepare just think if Amazon knocked the
windows phone off the number 3 spot we'd
have a smartphone industry led by the
a-team Apple Android and Amazon now this
might not happen anytime soon or even at
all but do expect to hear more about the
next kindle fire we here amazon will
announce some new tablets at the end of
this month google showed the world what
a computer on your face can do with its
demo of google glass but google was not
the only one toying with idea of a
headset device olympus published a press
release about its own prototype of an
augmented reality pair of glasses that
would display information on the lenses
and it would connect to a phone via
bluetooth apple doesn't want to be left
out of a party either it filed a patent
in 2006 for an image to be projected via
a head-mounted display apparatus and it
was just granted that patent but you
know who had the first augmented reality
headset that's right startrack baby
Wesley warned us but you know we just
didn't listen in other news we're
watching Netflix is having a good week
how about that Netflix reached a new
milestone customers have streamed more
than 1 billion hours of video be sure to
download updates to windows come tuesday
because microsoft is releasing a patch
to fix 9 security issues one of them
being tied to Internet Explorer 9 and if
you're at a GT customer and your phone
is lost or stolen you can report it to a
team t and has a device blocked from
ever being used because why would a
thief to want a phone if it's bricked
this will also apply to tablets it's a
crime-fighting effort all national
carriers stand behind 18 he's just the
first to make it happen great news you
can now own the first 4k resolution
movie to purchase even though you don't
even have a 4k TV set to view it on but
those are you rolling your eyes allow me
to explain 4k goes beyond 1080p and
right now it's something only cinnamon
thusi asst talk about but
a beautiful 50 minute film called time
escapes will be the first 4k film at the
public can buy and if you want it on a
USB Drive it will set you back just 99
bucks as far as TVs go toshiba pushed
the release of its 4k TV 2 sometime next
year that's your tech news update for
today for more on the stories in today's
