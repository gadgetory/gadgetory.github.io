Microsoft put on the best tech keynote
we've seen in all of 2015
here's why Microsoft has shown us
hololens before but each time we see a
demo it just gets more insane this time
it was wearable Holograms otherwise
known as Project X ray you now have a
gauntlet and a shield on your arm to
interact with the game soon you'll be
able to fight robots in your living room
and every single game is different as
hololens adapts to your surroundings
say goodbye laser tag hololens is coming
they say leave the best to last and
that's what happened with Microsoft's
first ever laptop the surface book with
12 hours battery life a glass trackpad
and weighing 3.34 pounds it threw down
another gauntlet during the keynote a
dynamic fulcrum hinge lets the 13.5 inch
screen move freely so it sits neatly
over the keyboard but it can also be
reversed or detaches completely to
become a tablet its unhinged literally
this is supposed to be the most
productive phone you've ever picked up
but what does that mean the best way to
see that and probably the most fun way
to see it is to see how continuum really
does bring the PC from the phone
Microsoft's been talking about continuum
for a while now but we finally saw what
it can do the feature lets you plug in a
Lumia phone into a monitor then connect
a mouse and a keyboard to turn it into a
fully fledged PC except it's a PC that
fits in your pocket cuz I can be
productive like a boss wherever I am now
there are subtleties in this product as
we changed everything that you will
never see there are some that you will
but you will feel every part of this
product when you pick it up I promise
you you will feel it the original
surface kicked off the tablet as Hybrid
trend with a surface pro for pushing the
boundaries even further
sporting Intel's new skylake processors
Microsoft says the pro 4 is 50% faster
than the MacBook Air there's also a new
pen that can launch Cortana attached to
the screen via magnets and even has an
eraser
now all Microsoft needs to do is work on
a better word than lap ability that's
the term to describe using the surface
on your lap
and often many other tech keynotes this
year the enthusiasm of Microsoft's
presenters was a nice bonus you ready to
see this phone are you ready to see the
phone now alright finally fashion
choices always deserve a special mention
and Microsoft had a fedora hats off to
that for more on the latest Microsoft
