editor here at seen it and I'm going to
give you a first look at the ZTE reef
for virgin mobile now with this phone
version mobile is getting a couple
things it doesn't have before line is
getting a water-resistant device it's
also getting a phone made by CTE which
of course the big Chinese company that's
still growing here in the United States
start out with really basic phones but
now it's getting into smartphones like
this fortunately what the ZTE reef
doesn't bring to Virgin Mobile is a
handset with 4G LTE which virgin mobile
now has and you don't get the latest
Android operating system so little
disappoint on both of those fronts but
the water is this some thing is nice the
only weird thing is when you look at
this phone you don't really think it's
water-resistant you know bottle water
resistant phones they have rubber on the
outside they have a lot of closed ports
they're very kind of heavy or sturdy
this just doesn't feel like that at all
that's a plastic back feels really light
in the hands not that lights a bad thing
but just doesn't feel like letters and
phone as I said I've talking asleep the
3.5 millimeter headset jack doesn't even
have a cover the mic USB does now this
couple reasons for that is that well
this is a lot of resistant phone so you
can dunk it in water you can do it for
up to 30 minutes in a metre of water
it's not designed to withstand elements
like dust and salt fog and all the other
things you might see on a you know like
a little nextel phone or the GZ 1
commando so not that device but it is
water resistant so you could leave it by
the pool maybe at the beach and it
should be fine overall though a pretty
standard Android design a plastic
Android rectangle is some people like to
say there is a pretty nice display
pretty bright and colorful all the usual
customization options is adding folders
or icons or deleting them you can go
back and forth through the five home
screens at the bottom of the display you
see there's that standard app tray tits
up to five apple for apps one is there's
the menu right there so you can change
that one but has four eps you can swap
out that stays constant on all the
screens you cycle through down below or
three touch controls there's a back
button there is the settings or the
submenus also and
there is a home key there is a 5
megapixel camera well stocked with
features photo quality is fine nothing
to scream about but you know get cheap I
also shoots video there's a big speaker
down there which actually gets pretty
loud on a speakerphone I was pretty
surprised behind the battery cover
you'll find the micro SD card slot you
also have to remove the battery too it's
not under the battery it's just kind of
beside it like I said the phone isn't
hot on features it does have android for
dot 1 it is not 4g LTE virgin mobile
doesn't operate that network it has a
couple phones out there that use it it
is on 3g and i notice that even the 3g
speeds that it has our run kind of slow
of course virgin mobile doesn't operate
its own network remember that so this is
running on sprint's network sprint
actually owns virgin mobile's so is
using the big network is using something
has a lot of coverage but just didn't
really like the 3g speeds and then you
have all the usual google apps and
productivity features organizer options
Wi-Fi Bluetooth GPS so pretty standard
mid-range brilliant features virgin
mobile stocks it with some bloatware
like there's this feature which is
virgin feed which shows you some popular
music news stories and sort of use will
sort it on there's a lot of icons that's
stocked with like Wikipedia that
BuzzFeed they have twitter they had
Instagram or there's also the mobile ID
packs which then you can sort of give
your own different identities and a
download certain wallpaper it's another
feat other apps to go with it call
quality was pretty good didn't have any
major complaints but overall a pretty
mid-range phone I just was disappointed
that in stock a little more a couple
more features but it is nice the Virgin
Mobile get something you can take it for
I'm Ken chairman and this is the Virgin
Mobile reef
