most expensive TVs you can buy today the
big one is a 65 inch LG e7 and the
smaller one is the 55 inch LG c7 so why
do I say best for letters o LED also
known as Olay organic light-emitting
diode screens produce the best picture
quality scene it has ever tested with
perfect black levels and deep vivid
colors and unmatched contrast the 2017
versions are better than ever but
compared to last year's OLED TVs the
improvements are minor the new sets can
get a bit brighter and looks somewhat
better with HDR TV shows and movies but
that's about it
both of these TVs delivered basically
the same awesome pictures so styling is
what sets them apart the e7 has a
speaker bar along the bottom for better
sound as well as a glass border around
the frame the c7 looks more minimalist
as a smaller edge around the screen so
it's basically all picture each one is
razor thin just a quarter inch deep when
seen from the side although it's a bulge
along a bottom for the inputs and other
necessaries LG packed different remotes
into each TVs box the oval-shaped one
for the c7 and a longer silver one for
the e7 you can wave the clickers around
and navigate the TV's menus with
identical and relatively easy to use 4k
and HDR streaming comes courtesy of
Netflix Amazon and Vudu complete with
Dolby vision if available the c7 and
seven are both only available in 55inch
65inch sizes so if you want something
larger or smaller you have to get an LCD
TV instead compared to OLED models LCDs
exhibited worst picture quality in our
tests with a brighter shade of black
worst image contrast and lower quality
when seen from off angle some high-end
LCDs can get brighter than these all
adds but so far I haven't tested any
with better overall picture quality
aside from that great image quality the
main difference we know LED and LCD is
price the c7 is pretty much the least
expensive 2017 OLED TV you can buy it
still cost a fortune and the speaker bar
equipped isse evan is even more
expensive prices will come down
throughout 2017 but even so we expect
these sets remain among the most
expensive on the market at their sizes
if you want the best you can pay the
price however nothing beats all it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
