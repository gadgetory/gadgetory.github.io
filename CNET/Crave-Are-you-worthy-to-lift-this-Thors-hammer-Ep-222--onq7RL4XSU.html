you're just happening this week on
CNET's crave blog 3d printed bikini can
help clean up contaminants in the ocean
as you swim the sponge suit bikini was
designed by an electrical engineering
professor at UC Riverside in California
named Mirri Ã¶zkan and has the ability
to absorb pollution in the ocean as the
wear swims in the water
the suit is made of a sponge-like
material that repels water and absorbs
pollutants it's kind of gross if you
think about it that after you take a
swim you come out with all this gunk in
your bathing suit but others are not so
quick to judge awarding the sponge supe
bikini with the top prize in the reshape
15 wearable technology competition read
more about the sponge suit bikini in the
crave blog post Dawg monitoring Tech has
moved from home security cams and puppy
feeding balls to full-on dog tail
wearables with dog stars tail talk which
claims to be the world's first emotion
sensor for dog's tail talk is a wearable
band for your dog's tail that helps you
understand when your best friend is
happy sad nervous or angry the wearable
connects to an app that sends you
messages letting you know if your dog is
happy or stressed the F out go to the
blog to read more about tail time
oh come on stay haha get it following up
on the laser razor story we talked about
a few weeks ago the scarp razor laser
which claims to shave your face with
lasers
was kicked off of Kickstarter for not
having a working prototype a spokesman
from Kickstarter told CNET we require
that from the beginning backers are
given a realistic sense of where the
project stands in the development
process in the Star praiser laser
product pitch video we see a mock-up of
what the razor laser might look like but
we never actually see it in action we do
see for a few seconds someone using a
laser to remove hair in the video but
not a prototype of the razor the
creators of the scarp razor laser did
post a demo video of the razor laser
being used on one of the creators risks
but stated that it was only a proof of
concept prototype and didn't really cut
the hair all too well the scarp razor
laser had already raised about four
million dollars on Kickstarter which was
far beyond their initial goal of 160
thousand dollars for the Kickstarter
campaign the scarp razor laser creators
are not discouraged though by the move
at Kickstarter and have moved their
crowdfunding campaign over to IndieGoGo
electrical engineer Alan pan also known
as sufficiently advanced on YouTube has
built a replica of Thor's hammer
also known as mule nerd that only he is
able to lift obviously because he is
worthy
were they Alan used the microwave oven
transformer electromagnet connected to a
composite of touch sensor attached to an
Arduino Pro Mini computer which upon
applying this fingerprint he activates
the powerful magnet and allows him to
lift it off the metal surface in the
video Alan challenges unsuspecting
people in Venice Beach California to
lift Thor's hammer and they all of
course fail that is until Alan touches
the handle which scans his fingerprint
and turns off the magnet allowing him to
lift Milner to everyone's amazement you
can watch the entire Thor's hammer video
embedded in the crave blockbusters show
