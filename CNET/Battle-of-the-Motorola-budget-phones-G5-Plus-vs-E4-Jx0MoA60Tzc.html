avocado toast at $4 coffee instead of
saving money
I like avocado toast and coffee so what
about saving money and other parts of
your life like your smartphone instead
of paying six hundred and fifty dollars
you can pay $300 for the Moto G five
plus or a hundred and thirty dollars for
the Moto e for two of my face but which
one should you get welcome to the
wonderful world of Motorola budget
smartphones so let's talk build the Moto
G 5 plus is metal the Moto e 4 is
plastic but it's back and battery are
removable also the e 4 looks like a
chubby iPhone 7 the g5 + has a beefier
processor and twice the RAM and
everything is quick and breezy in use
the e 4 actually does pretty well with
what it has playing games handled well
the only time of those Schlag was
opening the camera or processing a shot
both phones have a fingerprint reader
and motos nifty shortcuts that turn it
into a mini trackpad swipe left to go
back swipe right to show reasons to have
to go home and long press to bring up
Google assistant but the camera is where
the biggest differences come out the g5
plus has a 12 megapixel camera and
Confused 4k video images are nice and
have a good detail the Moto e 4 has an 8
megapixel camera into 1080p video images
are ok but have less dynamic range of
detail than the g5 + Viviani 4 is well
pretty bad but the e 4 does have an LED
flash for the selfie camera so that's
cool right both phones do have some
shortcomings like no NFC which means no
Android pay and the cameras don't have
optical image stabilization so what's
the verdict here if money is your
absolute concern you can't do better
than the 130 dollar Moto e 4 but if you
want a budget phone that has a more
premium feel and
teachers the key five-plus is the one to
buy either way
imagine all the avocado toast and coffee
you can buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
