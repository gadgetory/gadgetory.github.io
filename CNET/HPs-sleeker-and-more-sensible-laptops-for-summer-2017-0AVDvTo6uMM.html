HP's just refreshed the key models in
one of its too many consumer laptop
lines in this case its envy which is
then not quite as cheap as pavilion and
not quite as expensive the spectre line
the updates come - its clamshell NV 13
and 17 and that lines convertible x360
they also updated the spectre x2 2 and 1
to improve its experiences a laptop
first thing you'll notice about the new
NV 13 is that it's a lot more premium
looking with narrower screen bezels more
attractive speaker grille and
positioning and updated keyboard design
and layout plus it's got the other
design changes we've seen in many of the
2017 models including the new logo in
fact it looks eerily like a Spectre
17-inch version on the other hand has a
similar overall designed to its
predecessor but the connectors an SD
card slot have been moved to make room
for a built-in optical drive there's
also the choice for dual storage in the
inside those changes are in keeping with
the laptops primary function as what we
called in the olden days a desktop
replacement no skinny bezels here though
HP made some similar cosmetic changes to
the envy x-360 including the spectre
like narrow bezel on the display but for
the most part you just get more recent
component choices such as seventh
generation Intel processors in addition
to is chewing the core M processor in
favour of a more powerful option for the
spectre x2 HP brings similar design
updates to the keyboard and displays the
rest of the Spectre line it also has a
new higher resolution display with a 3x2
aspect ratio and a more solid keyboard
there gearing it toward productivity and
away from movie streaming still has the
fat display bezels though
