camera and quad core processor the
Samsung Galaxy s4 is packed with
impressive hardware and as I'll show you
it has a redesigned interior and is
easier to disassemble than its
predecessor I'm Bill Detweiler and this
is cracking open despite its larger
screen and new internals the Galaxy s4
is nearly identical to last year's s3
model in size shape and overall design
the new phone has a 5-inch display with
a resolution of 1920 by 1080 at 441
pixels per inch
our AT&amp;amp;T version has a 1.9 gigahertz
Snapdragon 600 processor from Qualcomm 2
gigs of low-power ddr3 ram 16 gigs of
built-in storage a microSD card slot and
18 megapixel rear camera 2 megapixel
front camera NFC support and even a our
blaster so you can use it as a TV remote
now a variant without LTE is available
with Samsung's own 1.6 gigahertz eight
core Exynos 5 octa processor and buyers
in South Korea the phone makers home
country will even be able to get an LTE
version with a 1.8 gigahertz version of
the Exynos 5 processor and not only does
the new Galaxy have some of the most
impressive specs among Android handsets
it's one of the easiest to disassemble
and repair thanks to a user replaceable
battery the back cover pops off with
just a fingernail
now after moving a few Phillips screws
you can pop the circuit board cover off
with a thin plastic tool or metal blade
once you've removed the cover you can
detach the speaker assembly compared to
the s3 Samsung redesigned the interior
of the s4 the main system board is
located at the top of the handset
instead of the bottom the battery
compartment has been shifted down
slightly and instead of a single board
that runs the length of the phone
the
s4 has a mainboard at the top and a
daughter board at the bottom after
detaching a few connectors and removing
a pair of screws you can gently lift out
the motherboard the rear camera comes
off next followed by a small board which
houses the sim and microSD card slots
after detaching a few more connectors
the daughter board comes out it houses a
microUSB port and what appears to be a
microphone along the top of the front
panel assembly are the vibration motor
front camera assembly earpiece assembly
which also houses the IR blaster and
front facing sensors and the headphone
jack now on the s3 many of these
components were joined by a single
ribbon cable that was glued in place
thankfully Samsung separated each
component on the s4 this means you can
replace one without replacing the others
the s4 is front panel and display are
fused together if one breaks you'll need
to replace both and you'll need to
remove all the other components in the
process still the s4 is one of the
easiest phones to disassemble that I've
worked on in a long time having cracked
opened the original Galaxy S s2 s3 and
now the s4 I've been impressed by the
hardware improvements and design
refinements Samsung has made with each
new model the s4 is a worthy addition to
the galaxy line now for more information
on the s4 including real-world tests and
pricing information check out Jessica
