you see a lot of familiar names iPads
and iPhones kindle fires and galaxy tabs
few libertarians and a smattering of
Sony and Canon pocket cameras for
reasons that are beyond me at this point
in history but today we're going to just
skim the top the freshest stuff that's
on fire the top five products
trafficking on cnet that were reviewed
in April or May of 2012 here we go
number five the Nokia Lumia 900 this is
the smartphone that is trying to resets
Microsoft image as not making a
smartphone anyone who doesn't work there
when by its hot looking especially if
you don't get it in retina ripping blu
runs windows phone 7.5 which we love and
cost as little as forty nine bucks that
said all the looking in the world has
yet to raise microsoft and nokia beyond
a rounding error in the smartphone
market but the strong interest in this
phone sets the table for windows phone 8
devices later this year number for the
HTC One S featuring the much-awaited
Android for ice cream sandwich skinned
with HTC's Sense for interface it's got
a killer camera an amazing display all
driven by 4G and it's in a thin sculpted
body with that slimness you do lose any
expansion slot or removable battery but
this is still the best thing t-mobile
has in their entire line and makes other
carriers a little envious which doesn't
happen a lot with timo number three is
the asuste transformer pad tf300 sort of
a transformer prime for folks who want
more want to pay less and don't mind if
it's flimsy a sous has carved out this
kind of one company industry of making
convertible tablets that actually sell
the tf300 is a steal at three hundred
eighty bucks Street not including
however the hundred and fifty dollar
keyboard dock that you just plain wanna
steal instead of paying that much but
this is currently the best value in an
Android tablet as far as we're concerned
that's why you're tracking it down on
cnet number two kind of comes out of
left field to be honest it's the
logitech ultrathin keyboard cover you
know
that thing you've seen it on everybody
else's iPad we call it the best
accessory ever for ipad 2 and the new
iPad it's the best executed cover and
keyboard in one it connects with magnets
like apples Smart Cover which means
it'll also fall off on the sidewalk the
same way that does good thing it's
fairly cheap at 99 bucks by an extra and
put your laptop on ebay number one is of
course a smartphone but that doesn't
narrow the field much the winner is by a
mile the galaxy s3 this is Samsung's
current flagship phone doesn't even come
to the u.s. till summer of 2012 we got
an early look at it with 4g 4.8 inch
screen for core cpu and android for ice
cream sandwich now half the traffic to
this phone may be coming from the haters
who've been criticizing it for having a
plasticky case a mere 8 megapixel camera
and perhaps jettisoning the quad core on
the way to the US but religious wars
have always been a quaint part of tech
so there in a nutshell are the five new
products you need to know about that
you're probably already searching for in
a couple months will replace them all
with a whole new list so come back for
that video and see all the rest at top
five cnet com I'm Brian Cooley thanks
for watching
