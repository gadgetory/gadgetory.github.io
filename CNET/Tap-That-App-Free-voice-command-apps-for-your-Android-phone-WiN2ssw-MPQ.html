this is seeing that TV and you're
watching tap that app the show where see
you next editor responding the hottest
EPS in the mobile space and get our
phone screen all finger print so that
you don't have to
hopefully my phone will stay relatively
clean today because I'm talking about
voice assistant apps for Android phones
programs that let you tell your phone
what to do with a little more than the
sound of your voice and since I'm a car
tech editor and most people I know tend
to think of voice command as an in-car
activity I'll be focusing on apps that
work best when you're behind the wheel
now first up is Robin it's been
generating a lot of buzz this week as
they would be Siri fighter which it kind
of is but mostly isn't Robin can do a
number of things but she seems to be
tailored mostly for in-car use
focusing on traffic data destination
search parking and navigation you can
probably tell that by the Google map
that's the apps home screen find a
coffee shop does it have a good reading
Robin can also search for fuel prices
get weather updates read your Twitter
feed aloud set reminders and tell you
really bad jokes the interface is a bit
beta and outside of basic show me a
place and then get me there sort of
commands Robin still has much room for
improvement but the developers say that
new features and commands are constantly
being added I do like the conversational
tone of this free app and the fact that
it speaks your answers back so you can
keep your eyes on the road dragon go buy
nuanced features great recognition
accuracy and hooks into many other apps
now some of those apps like Netflix are
best left out of the car but others like
setting reservations using open table or
finding venues and restaurants using
Yelp can be very useful in the car
find Pandora karaoke on Yelp
however dragon goes interface is a bit
cluttered and attention intensive for
dashboard use and with no spoken
feedback you end up looking at and
touching the screen a lot more than I'm
comfortable with while driving so be
sure to park before getting too deep
into any dragon searches it's free like
all of the apps in today's roundup
there's also Vlingo voice assistant with
in-car beta easily one of my favorite
voice assistant apps for in-car use and
the most hand three of the pack with its
wake up command feature hey blingo but
we've already covered Vlingo on a
previous episode of tap that app which
you can find by searching CNET TV
finally let's take a look at an app
that's probably already on your Android
phone and being overlooked the stop
Voice Search app now most of you have
probably never looked twice at the
built-in Android feature but Google's
voice search will not only let you
search the web but you can also use it
to get directions initiate navigation
send text message and emails to your
contacts said alarm send yourself
reminders even cue up music set an alarm
for 5:00 p.m. text Optimus Prime you've
got the touch listen to Jack White well
that's it for this week's episode of tap
that up I've been Antoine Goodwin with
cnet.com you can follow me on twitter at
ant goo and if you've got an app that
you'd like to see tapped send it to tap
that app at cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
