at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
now I'm checking out the key on by
geeksphone running the brand new
operating system Firefox OS now firefox
OS looks quite simple it's quite
reminiscent of Android in that it has
various home screens food to swipe
around swipe to the right and you'll see
quite a lot of bold icons a bit quite a
bit like iOS and over to the left you'll
see groups of icons grouping together
social and local and and music tools
you'll find a way along the bottom the
important tools of your browser your
contacts messaging and your phone it's
built on html5 which Mozilla who makes
Firefox OS records will allow people to
build apps much more simply as it's an
open platform the interface looks quite
simple and fairly attractive but it is
too early to tell if it offers enough to
really be a compelling choice the phone
itself has a 3.5 inch display with a 480
x 320 pixel resolution so it's not going
to be as pin-sharp has phones like the
galaxy s3 who have 720 displays around
the back you'll see a 3 megapixel camera
as well as a bright orange she'll
probably to do with the fact that it has
Firefox it's powered by a 1 gigahertz
Snapdragon processor which is far from
powerful going against some of the quad
core chips are seeing in a lot of new
phones but it should keep the essentials
ticking along nicely and as its html5
nothing should really be that demanding
of it but we'll see how it performs when
we give it a proper test geeksphone
tells you that the key art is going to
be available for just over a hundred
dollars when it goes on sale in the next
couple of weeks it's going to be selling
it through its website and hopes to be
able to ship it all over the world
although wasn't able to confirm whether
it will be definitely in Europe or the
US so I think we're going to have to
wait and see exactly where it'll be
happy to ship it to I'm Andrew Hoyle for
cnet and this is the geeks phone key on
running Firefox OS
