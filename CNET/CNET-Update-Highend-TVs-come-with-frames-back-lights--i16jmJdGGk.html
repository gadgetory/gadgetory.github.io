Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update this week we're learning about
many new gadgets computers and
televisions at a tech show in Berlin
called the IFA or Aoife as some say
Lenovo is rolling out with new PCs and
major updates to its yoga tablet laptop
hybrid there's the IdeaPad flex 14 which
bends its screen back by 300 degrees so
you can prop it up just to use the
touchscreen if you want more flexibility
there is the ideapad yoga 2 pro and the
thinkpad yoga which both fold flat or
you can go big with the IdeaPad flex 20
inch portable all-in-one we're seeing
more computers act like oversized
tablets Lenovo is also making a 7-inch
android tablet called the idea tab s5000
and that's coming out in December the
latest television technology is 4k or
also known as ultra high-definition and
Philips just unveiled its first model
and it also glows from behind the sides
with technology called ambilight it
involves rows of small lights around the
back of the TV casting a soft glow
against the wall that complements the
colors on the screen but like most ultra
high-def TVs you'll be paying more than
5 grand for one and if you're going to
show up big bucks for a high-end TV
there's also LG's new OLED television
the gallery which comes with a picture
frame and speakers nestled behind it you
can see the speakers when the canvas is
cut away OLED screens are in some
smartphones and tablets but only now is
it being made for televisions so with a
picture that's good I guess LG figures
you want to frame it there have been
some interesting add-ons for smaller
screens as well unveiled that the show
was a new type of case for Samsung's
Galaxy s4 smartphone the new pocketbook
s4 case has a built-in e-ink screen
which could be handy for people who
frequently read on their smartphones but
don't want the eye strain and it saves
on battery life but no price or sale
date was given outside of the show
Microsoft announced that the xbox one
will launch on
number 20 seconds and stores are taking
pre-orders now for the
five-hundred-dollar game console it will
be out exactly one week after Sony's
PlayStation 4 we're continuing to learn
