1020 is simple 41 megapixel camera
that's basically the camera that I want
to have with me in my pocket at a music
festival like this so let's ro test it
the Nokia Lumia design has just been
really appealing you're such a nice
bright colored phone super customizable
lots of colors and the windows phone
interface is really attractive so you
feel drawn to it right away and as a
camera phone it's the right way it comes
with a wrist strap which I find to be a
delightfully camera friendly touch
overall I always am really drawn to
these phones i really like using it i'm
comparing photos it's what's happening
there thank you so the iphone 5 is
currently the best smartphone camera on
the market and it's the main reason that
some people keep that phone this is
taking direct aim at that so it's a 41
megapixel camera that's so many
megapixels that is almost a novelty it's
way more than you're ever gonna use and
it's really just a stunt to get people's
attention but that said it's pretty
amazing when you look at your 41 you can
megapixel image then nokia is built in a
lot of cool camera features so you have
all these smart features where if you
take a photo of a sequence it'll choose
the best shot for you you can choose a
really great action shot and you can
sort of like specify movement there's
filters so they're making it really fun
to use and a really camera oriented
phone and I have to admit I've been
really impressed with images mainly
though I think everybody uses their
smartphone to just take snapshots and
upload them somewhere the snapshot part
is really good the uploading part is
problematic so you can upload a photo
directly to Twitter it doesn't integrate
that way with Facebook and then the most
crushing drawback of all is that you're
taking beautiful snapshots and you
cannot Instagram them there is no
Instagram available for Windows Phone
an Instagram is said that they're not
gonna build it Instagram your photo I
wish I could so for kind of the point
and shoot social sharing you are super
crippled and it's such a bummer so the
negatives that i have found are mainly
the shutter speed all the bubbles like
totally disappeared by the time the
shutter got it you can do it yes thanks
bubble guy the shutter speed is so slow
on this phone it takes a long time to
load up the camera you kind of press
this button then the image appears and
then it's another second or so before
the actual camera controls pop up so you
probably already missed your shot but
even assuming that you haven't then when
you press the camera button the actual
shutter and click is super slow you know
what I have to compare with my iPhone
because frankly I think this is shameful
give another phone watch this boom yeah
and ready bub no problem no problem so I
actually think that the Lumia 1020 is a
great phone for festivals because the
stage isn't going anywhere so you don't
have to worry about the slow shutter
speed and you're gonna get great shots
that you can zoom in later so that you
can pretend that you were closer than
you are that's it at the end of the day
i don't think i would buy it i'd rather
have a phone with a great camera that
can do everything and like the iphone
instead of a phone with a really great
camera they can't do very much else
