lineup since 2005 I've been of a hole
during a fuel conscious era wouldn't you
say
and they haven't used the dart nameplate
since 1976 it's way back in their past
until now let's drive the 2013 Dodge
Dart
completely new check the tech let's see
other resurrections go how to say the
Dodge starts a completely new clean
sheet design is not exactly true it's
based on Europe's Alfa Romeo Giulietta
which several models are built on
remember Fiat owns Chrysler now but this
car is thoroughly American and its
manufacturer the car is built in Toledo
Ohio
the engines come out of a plant in
Dundee Michigan and it's got a much more
American look than its European
counterparts much more weaponized then
say the Fiat viaggio which is also a
stable mate one of the first things
dodge had to get done was to say
something in the cabin and this has a
very stylized cabin especially at this
price point you've got a nice design
language here some of the materials are
a little flimsy but that can often be a
first-year model thing but of course
your eyes are drawn to the main event
the 8.4 inch you connect touchscreen
this is not standard on this car but at
the rally trim I doubt you'll find many
of these on Lots that don't have it so
let's go that way
interesting how they've taken almost a
tablet approach a persistent ribbon of
functions at the bottom think of those
as your apps basically though you don't
install them they're all part of the car
am/fm and saturated Irae do little
disappointing there on the player side
you get all your other sources your
optical disk is in here in the console
very strange facing up where it's dying
to intake a big gulp so they put a
little door on it to keep that from
happening
USB is also in there as is SD card I'm
never going to use SD card I'd rather
they give me HD radio instead but that's
what I'm left with
and of course standard hardware aux jack
and bluetooth streaming the bluetooth
streaming does not give me metadata at
least not on an android 4.0.4 phone as
we get to navigation you've seen this
guy before on Chrysler and Mopar
products it's the big goofy preschool
looking
garmin nav but don't laugh this is the
highest rated navigation system
according to a JD Power I think in terms
of usability you put consumers in here
who are not hoity-toity geeks and they
say yeah I like it
I get it but let's say you want to use
voice command that buttons over here on
the far left and the way the dart works
is anything you see on here is valid
voice text I like that it doesn't pop up
another menu when you hit the voice
button to give you the things you can
say 2 3 5 2nd Street San Francisco
California if you say 235 seconds
straight simple one would you like to
begin yes
and that's how it works see it say it
it's a good idea but the real question
all this bags is that interface on the
screen is so simple do you need voice
command for it as I was using voice to
drive it I don't think I was saving
really any mental cycles it was keeping
my hands on the wheel but it wasn't
reducing my concentration on the tasks
in fact the voice is a little more
complex I think than just reaching out
and touching that now here's an odd
frustration kind of like in Acuras until
very recently you have to voice buttons
all voice commands for everything but
phone are this one like I just showed
you if you want to do a voice command
for the phone you have to press the
phone button that's not elegant now
sometimes in a cheap little car the
little things are what matter the most
not the upholstery what's under it a
Smuggler's box under the passengers but
so crafty it makes anything in it look
suspicious or it is
okay to the engine-room on the new dart
your base motor would be a 2 litre
inline-four fairly conventional stuff
this is not that this is an
unconventional Lindley t-midi 1.4 liter
inline 4 turbocharged intercooled not
going out to the standard six-speed
manual or even a 6 automatic but to a
six-speed dual-clutch automated manual
there's a whole lot and a very little
amount of tech done to the hood in this
car 160 horsepower same as the base
engine but on the torque very different
184 foot-pounds that's all more than 30
above the base motor 0 to 60 about 8.2
seconds nearly 2 seconds faster than the
base engine car and delivering 27 37 mpg
because then little cylinders don't and
can't drink much but as I've taught you
many times specs and numbers on paper
don't mean responsiveness on the road
let's go find out which we have here
while the overriding experience of
driving a Dodge Dart with this
powertrain is one of a question mark the
question is how are the pedal the engine
and the transmission communicating
apparently by u.s. mail because there's
enormous delays between sending the
message in it being received this is not
a responsive powertrain power delivery
is rubbery and a real loopy feeling it's
almost like you've got a CVT a
continuously variable transmission but
instead we have this dual clutch manual
but it's not a well-executed one as a
result it's not a car you like to drive
hard because you don't know when you're
going to get power or deceleration
certainly not when you call for it with
your right foot let's write an
experiment I'm going to accelerate here
on the gas and when I let off I'm gonna
say off and you'll see what the RPM does
off
it's a shame because the suspension and
undercarriage this thing feels rather
nicely done firm enough to be sporty but
not so tight that it's spending a
portion of its time airborne it's a car
that feels like more than its high tens
of thousands of dollars base but this
powertrain this particular one to me is
a killer luckily there are the two
others that are quite different
architectures so you've got a chance to
sort this car out by ordering it with
something a lot more responsive and a
lot more shall we say delivering on the
promise of that sheet metal on the
outside
okay pricing I'd be angry at the dart if
it weren't so damn cheap and stylish 18
995 for this rally which is near the top
of the line then nickel-and-dime your
way to go seen that style 595 for the
UConnect interface the big screen 500
more for nav iPod SD card USB 300 more
for voice command and Bluetooth in all
this car is under 25 delivered though I
would run not walk from that powertrain
to little displacement and too many
clutches wait for the 2.4 liter tiger
shark engine which will be the new top
motor and try that with a 6-speed manual</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
