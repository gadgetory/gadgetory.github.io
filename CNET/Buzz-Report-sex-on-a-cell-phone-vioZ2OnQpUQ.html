buzz report this week Microsoft and
Yahoo break up I am apparently safe from
sharks and Brian Cooley returns but
first it's the gadget of the week the
gadget of the week is the HTC touch
diamond it's pretty much sex on a cell
phone 3g touch screen windows mobile 6.1
built-in Wi-Fi Bluetooth and integrated
GPS integrated GPS a 3.2 megapixel
camera and no availability in the u.s.
until the second half of the year at
least but you see until a 3g iphone is
released this is all we have to get
excited about you know I'm saying and
now for the news break up unless you
live under a rock you know that
Microsoft walked away from that who to
yahoo never to return Microsoft is all
you're too difficult maybe I don't want
to rush into anything with you anyway
and Yahoo was like good jerk no means no
and Microsoft was like fine good luck
doing any better and Yahoo is all Nene
and Yahoo's friends were all shareholder
lawsuit and if any of you still care
just go to news com but trust me on this
one thing Microsoft will be back in news
that is awesome this week scientists say
they may have figured out how to safely
repel sharks biologists have been
testing small discs made out of a rare
metal alloy called palladium neodymium
when the metal interacts with seawater
it produces an electric field that's so
far makes sharks stay away the
scientists hoped that the disks will
work in open water and could eventually
help prevent sharks from getting caught
in fishing nets I am hoping they will
work well in open water and will soon be
embedded in the swimsuits that are sold
at Old Navy
okay let's have a quick look at what's
clogging the tubes this week it's the
Empire Strikes Barack
even as we speak there though okay yeah
right everybody's supposed to get a
Hillary Obama campaign so look at this
okay I think that's a pretty appropriate
way to introduce Brian Cooley and this
week's installment of what the hell with
Brian Cooley amazing many car engines
today put out 300 400 500 horsepower
what the hell is that in this dawning
era of four-dollar gas we're all in a
snit the car makers haven't engineered
more efficient cars but they have in the
last 35 years cars have become vastly
more efficient at generating power from
a gallon of gas but like a badly run
company very little of that has dropped
to the bottom line we know as mpg
instead we have cars that are much
bigger much heavier and much faster
admirable engineering stupid end result
pulling a 40 300-pound cadillac SRX from
0 to 60 and 6.2 is primarily penis
enhancement look I'm a car nut and I
have a showrooms worth of late 60s big
blocks at home but that was them we just
can't not along any more dutifully
impressed each time a car maker
increases horsepower while fuel economy
basically stagnates I mean talk about
mission creep the honda accord debuted
with 68 horsepower and schooled the
industry for a decade before it ever had
a hundred all while being more fun to
drive than almost anything else that was
on the market today the most popular
record has 268 horsepower and you can
damn near fit a 76 in the trunk of an 08
look car makers have reams of market
research that tells them we look down
our noses at appropriately powered
appropriately sized vehicles so you're
in the driver's seat on this one I'm
Mollywood and this has been the buzz
report thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
