against a robot in a virtual reality
world well here is your chance this is
the off-track obstacle motion tracking
system
you can see the wear out here has an
oculus VR headset on with a couple of
trackers on it plus alpha double play
Obama has a couple of them scattered
anything as well there are 23 WESH 2
trekking cameras all around this degree
theaters keeping an eye on the action
plus there's also one reference camera
not to talk to and what that's doing is
feeding back into this dysplasia giving
you all sorts of data about what's going
on X Y position orientation and the
positioning of all of the
different parts of the body that has the
tracking on it actually play the bits a
little bit earlier on and it is a lot of
fun a lot of disorienting as you might
think even though you are playing
basketball and tossing the ball back and
forth with envy I had said on this there
are also a couple of different truckers
on the basketball as well so that's how
you can see where things are playing out
in the VR world this is the oxy truck
