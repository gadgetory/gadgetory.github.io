see I am very well per ticket today and
that means something cool gonna happen a
magic trick that's right I have you here
a cup full of nothing but cocoa and to
show there's nothing at inside I have a
empty cup right here I'm gonna pour it
over there you go nothing but cocoa now
I'm going to pull something out of that
with my hands Oh a candy that's pretty
amazing isn't it now me being amazing as
I write it just now is to show how I
pull a solid object out of a container
full of liquid materials which bring us
to this machine right here the noble 1.0
from XYZ printing now this one here is
the very first stereo lithography or SL
3d printer that is affordable enough for
you to buy costing just $1,500 I know
that's not cheap but other sl3 printer
can cost double that or even more the
reason why they so expensive because
this type printer can print objects of
very high quality
take a look here this object is printed
by this printer and this one here same
object was printed by a different type
3d printer you can see how different it
is and this one here was not even
printed in the highest setting of
quality now the way this machine work is
very similar to what I just demonstrated
I'll take a look here we go
as you can see that's one object it just
printed and if you notice it's upside
down and that's because the print
platform here just pull it up from this
tank of liquid now this liquid here is
called resin which is the pre material
for SL 3d printer during a print job the
printer would pump the liquid from this
bar oh right here into the tank after
that the platform low it's out into the
tank now underneath the tank there is a
laser light that shy on the platform
when exposed to the laser light the
resin cures and solidifies layer by
layer to create the three
the object so the way it works is
actually really cool and it can make
very high quality object what's the
catch well there are a few of them now
first of all is praying very slowly now
this puppy right here take about 13
hours to finish and mostly because the
printer cannot bring in hollow form but
always solid and that also means it uses
a lot more material than other tire
printer for example with one borrow of
resin right here
one pound I can bring about three of
these objects and that's very expensive
because this borrow here goes for about
sixty dollars it's also worth noting
that the printer never uses all of the
resin in the tank so the left over here
if you do not bring regularly it will be
wasted another thing is the object here
need to be washed by alcohol before you
can use it or you can stay sticky and
wet for a long time which is why I have
all these protection here now all thing
consider this one here is a very cool 3d
printer but it's kind of expensive to
buy and even more expensive to use so
unless you are very rich or you have a
strong passion for 3d printer I'm not
sure why you want to buy this really but
for more on this check out my full
review at cnet.com and by the way we
have everything kind of in group here we
have a two puppy sue in crapper hoax
let me do one more thing here we go
voila another candy you see I always
have my stuff
and that's because I'm don't know this
has been their first look at the noble
1.03 printer from XYZ print</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
