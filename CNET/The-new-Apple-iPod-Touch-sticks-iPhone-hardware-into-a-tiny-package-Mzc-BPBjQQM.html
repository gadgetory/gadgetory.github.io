checking out the new iPod Touch now this
tiny little gadget does many of the
things your iPhone 6 does for fraction
of the price but it sits in a really
weird place as far as gadgets are
concerned the iPod Touch is small it's
got a four inch screen with a resolution
of 1136 by 640 pixels that works out to
326 pixels per inch it's also really
light at about 88 grams that makes it
pretty much identical to the fifth
generation iPod Touch it's replacing so
here's what's new inside you'll find the
iPhone 6 is hardware that means Apple's
a a processor and that m8 coprocessor
which handles motion tracking all of the
games and apps you love on iOS who work
here though you will of course need to
stick to Wi-Fi as there's no cellular
connectivity the camera hardware isn't
identical you're getting an 8 megapixel
iSight camera but things are a little
slower on the iPod touch the aperture is
a little narrower and video recording is
limited to 30 frames per second or 120
frames per second in slow motion the
iPhone 6 can double that but it's still
HD and the test shots I've taken aren't
bad
I'll definitely circle back with more
here soon the iPod Touch is also quite a
bit cheaper than the iPhone 6 it starts
at $199 for the 16 gigabyte model and it
works all the way up to $399 for the 128
gigabyte model there is of course no
contract an unlock iphone 6 start to 649
and then there's the monthly service fee
to factor in so here's the thing devices
like iPod used to be a great way to
carry our massive music libraries around
but our smart phones pretty much handle
that nowadays then devices like the iPod
touch became great fitness companions so
you could no taking for a run or taking
to the gym but we're probably using our
smart phones to do that too and there
are things like smartwatches that are
trying to muscle in on that space this
could be a neat gadget to give to a
child as a sort of starter gadget but
I'm pretty sure they'd prefer the larger
tablet they're probably already using so
where does that leave the iPod Touch
let's figure that out head over to him
to learn more I'm Nate
