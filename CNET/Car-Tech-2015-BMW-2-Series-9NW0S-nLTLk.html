of model changes right now the three
recently in two-door form became the
four now the one loses its lease on life
and becomes the two here's a 2 Series
Coupe only bigger than a 1 so it doesn't
fit in the dinky categories smaller than
a 3 so it doesn't cannibalize the
company's cash cow from the size of 3/4
views here's what I see it still has
kind of that tragic truncated rump of
the 1 Series but they got rid of that
sad mouth scallop on the side that made
the one that like it was melting and
bending in the middle
overall it's a car with a little more
presence but they can still bring it in
at a price that's going to be in the
zone of folks who would never spend 40
on a car that's a hot zone because
Mercedes reason introduction of the CLA
has been on fire and that car starts at
just a tick under 30 before destination
so all the Germans are rushing to do
something cheaper and I'm in front of
the m235i which is the hot rod model of
the - they'll have the inline six that
everyone knows and loves but the car I
think is gonna be really interesting is
that guy the 228 I with a 2-liter turbo
for the puts out 240 horse gets 260 and
five point four seconds and still
delivers 23 35 mpg overall to me that's
a great story and again a car that's
going to be starting somewhere around
$33,000 so 33,000 or so when this guy
arrives for a car that looks like a BMW
not so much like a BMW they only sell
over there that's an important sticking
point in the American market but they
gotta be careful not to go too far up
and carve away the bottom of 3-series
it'll be an interesting sport to watch
but I suspect they've got a hit on their
hands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
