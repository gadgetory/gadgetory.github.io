show-stopping camera lenses on the back
like the Huawei peeps mini Pro but the
regular old p20 here is still a pretty
good phone there are two cameras on the
back with plenty of photography tricks a
roomy 5.8 inch screen and oodles of
storage for all the photos and super
slow-motion videos that you'll take but
let's take a step back and look at
design I have it in black and blue but
the p20 also comes in that killer
iridescent shade called Twilight that I
can't wrap my eyes away from but
whichever color you get this phone is an
absolute fingerprint magnet if you don't
have the cloth get used to wiping it on
your clothes the p20 fits pretty
comfortably in my hands the bezels are
slim but there's a chin at the bottom
where the fingerprint reader goes I
don't really mind this since I can
unlock the screen when the p20 is flat
on a table or a desk but the button is a
little narrow now we get to the
controversial part the knotch I know a
lot of Android fans absolutely hate this
and if you're one of them Huawei at
least gives you the option of masking
the notch in the settings remember if
this changes nothing except that you
have a smaller screen footprint to look
at but hey if it makes you feel better
anyway let's talk about the camera I was
happy with the photos that I took on
this phone it has the 12 megapixel rear
lens for all those colors shots and a 20
mega pixel monochrome lens that adds
shadowing in detail but while we've
frozen a lot of extra settings to
portrait mode for the front and rear
cameras portrait lighting effects like
you see on the iPhone 10 and super slow
motion video
there's also night mode which takes
excellent photos and dark restaurants
and bars there is also a default feature
where the camera software detects where
you're shooting and automatically
adjusts the settings
say a close-up a portrait or photos with
a big blue sky this AI intervention can
all feel like a bit much but if you love
camera tricks there's plenty to play
with and the photos are pretty good
huawei tops android 8.0 oreo with its
own emotion UI layer I'm not a big fan
of this look but you can customize with
themes and drag and drop icons to
rearrange them on the screen and come up
with a layout you like oh and there's no
headset jack on this phone you have to
use the USBC adapter dongle that comes
in the box if you want to plug in wired
headphones if you're deciding between
the p20 Pro and the p20 there are a few
other things you have to think about you
always save the best features for the
p20 Pro the OLED screen the bigger
battery and full water resistance you
don't want to drop the p20 into a bath
but at least it is splash proof this
phone won't sell it all in the US and if
you buy it off the Internet make sure
it'll support your carrier network bans
wherever you live I like the huawei
Pete's money and I think it's worth
looking at as long as you don't require
every cutting-edge innovation that a
phone has to offer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
