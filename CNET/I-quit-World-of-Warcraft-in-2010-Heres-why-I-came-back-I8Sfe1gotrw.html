Here's why I came back</b></h2><h5 class="post__date">2016-11-04</h5><div class="container"><div class="video-responsive"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8Sfe1gotrw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><div class="post__text">and I look back and it's weird cuz I
look back on and really fondly but I
would never ever go back never ever ever
okay I'm totally playing warcraft again
I wasn't planning to do it it just kind
of happened but it's really a testament
how great Wow Legion is that six years
after I quit playing the game I'm way
back into it
one of my favorite things is the story
now previously in wow I was never really
into the story out just like going into
places and killing a bunch of stuff and
then seeing my character it gets
stronger but now I'm really into the
story and I think there's two reasons
for this one is presentation there's a
ton of cutscenes and voiceover that
makes the story friesen dated like
really cinematic that really works for
me the other is the story is actually
good Blizzard made some really ballsy
moves and stuff with your watching like
I can't believe they're doing that and
then they actually do it and it's really
satisfying they really make your
character feel like they're in a really
important part of the storyline in one
of the ways they do this is to artifact
weapons artifact weapons are basically
the most powerful weapons in the game
and they really make a big deal about it
when you get these weapons that you
think they put this really awesome font
on the screen of the name of the weapon
they plays dramatic music even though
everyone in the game has these weapons
they really do a good job of making you
feel like you're special when you're
using them it's pretty awesome but I
feel like I'm kind of getting a little
bit too far ahead of myself because I'm
not playing this game that there's no
boosting so what is boosting boosting is
basically when you take a character of
any level press the button that
character immediately becomes level 100
you see in Legion you have to be level
100 to play the latest storyline it can
get kind of addicting because Legion
comes with a free boost for any one
character and then you can buy a boost
for 60 bucks after that and i purchased
two and then there's level scaling so
usually in while and previous expansions
in the new areas each area will be
designated to a certain level range but
here each area scales to your
appropriate level so no matter if your
level 101 / 10 3 or what have you the
level will scale the enemies will scale
to be appropriate for you the quest will
scale the appropriate for you and the
really advantage to doing this is that
the area's never expire so even when
your level 110 you're still going back
to these areas because there's still a
challenge there's still stuff to do one
of the best reasons to go back to these
areas is world quest now what a world
quest world quests are basic
Lee time quests that give you really
meaningful useful rewards and I've been
able to gear up really well just by
doing world quest like I've been able to
get like really powerful gear just by
running these quests every day so there
are two things I learned and come back
to wow and one is that even if I quit
again I'm probably gonna come back you
know I just really love this world I
love being in this world and i really
love to see all the improvements they
make over the years and the second thing
is never say never just when I thought
it was out they pull me back in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
