cnet.com and I'm here to show you the
jvc flats these are a rather cheap pair
of headphones and I'm always on a quest
to find good cheap headphones these come
in right around twelve to thirteen
dollars and what's impressive about them
is that they're comfortable they're
lightweight and they also sound very
decent for $13 headphones why do they
sound decent well they're well balanced
they don't push the bass too much they
don't push the treble but they offer a
decent amount of detail and a decent
amount of bass and they sound really
pretty decent of course you can't expect
the world from $30 headphones and these
aren't going to measure up to say $100
headphones but they do measure up pretty
well against thirty to fifty dollar
headphones you will get a little bit of
distortion in some of your tracks if you
crank the volume and they're not
incredibly clear but again 13 dollars in
terms of their build quality they held
up pretty well in the few days that I
use them they are lightweight and they
fold flat they do not fold up these
aren't on your model and they do come in
multiple colors they won't fit
everybody's ears equally well but they
will fit most ears and the key thing is
they are lightweight so if you're
looking for a headphone you don't care
that much about losing but you want them
to be decent these certainly fit the
bill and I have no problem recommending
them particularly at their price point
I'm David Carr noise and those are the
jvc flats headphones thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
