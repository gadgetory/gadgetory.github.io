cnet.com and right now we are taking a
first look at the brand new Motorola
Droid mini
now if you're familiar with the Droid
Razr em from last year you won't find
any new surprises really in the design
of the droid mini it looks very similar
has a very small screen well it's
actually 4.3 inches actually the one
thing that's interesting is that this
screen on the droid mini is an LCD
screen as opposed to the Droid Razr m's
AMOLED screen from last year so it's a
little different at at 720p resolution
which is sharp for you know most things
and you can also see it has a 2
megapixel camera on the top has the
three capacitive buttons for Android
jellybean which is what it's running
running 4.2.2 on the back you've got a
10 megapixel camera and an LED flash now
10 megapixel sounds a little weird but
it apparently uses a larger pixel size
that hopefully will help it perform
better under low light conditions all
the features include the new Motorola x8
processor in reality it's actually a 1.7
gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm processor
but it has a bunch of different cores to
help it keep up with the demands of your
mobile life so dual core processor
graphics dual core processor application
also has a processor for contextual
searches so basically this this device
will be able to listen to you if you
train it properly it will enable you to
conduct searches just by talking to it
you don't even have to pick it up it
also connects to Verizon's 4G LTE
network for fast data price and
availability for the Droid mini is
August 20th it will hit Verizon stores
for $99 and is actually available right
now for pre-order I'm Brian Bennett for
