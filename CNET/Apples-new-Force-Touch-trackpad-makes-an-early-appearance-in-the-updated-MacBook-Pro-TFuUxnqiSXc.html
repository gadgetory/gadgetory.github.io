I'm dan Aykroyd and this is Apple's 2015
version of the popular 13-inch MacBook
Pro like the previous couple of
additions of this particular laptop it's
got apples retina style display which is
a better than 1080p display obviously
the pro line is thicker and heavier than
the macbook air line but again it has a
higher resolution display has some other
higher and options this guy has been
updated for this year with Intel's new
5th generation of core i series chips
otherwise known by the codename
broadwell you've also got a faster flash
memory trip kind of the SSD than you
have in last year's model I'm the other
big change here is that this is the
first laptop to actually feature Apple's
new force touch trackpad you're going to
see that as a key selling point on the
upcoming 12-inch MacBook that very thin
very light system that should be coming
out soon from Apple but the first place
you can get that is actually this single
13-inch macbook pro model we've played
around with it it's actually a lot of
fun you click down on the touchpad you
feel like it's depressing and clicking
you press down harder and get a second
click like kind of a step click but it's
not actually going up and down it's all
a little bit of haptic force feedback
that tricks your finger into thinking
you're actually pressing on the button
not not a particular use in a thicker
laptop like this but in something that's
very thin where they can eliminate the
need for the touchpad to go up and down
potentially very useful one thing you
can do here is you do that second deeper
click on let's say a word on a web page
and you can get some contextual
information about it whether it's a
definition or Wikipedia entry or a map
connected to an address so there's a lot
of fun things you can do with that it's
kind of like an enhanced right click
other than that this macbook pro looks
and feels a lot like the previous couple
of versions one nice benefit from having
those broadwell chips we got an extra
hour to of battery life out of it this
guy on our video test ran for about 15
hours which is great and of course it
starts at the same 1299 as the previous
versions i'm dan ackerman and that is
Apple's 2015 13 inch macbook pro
