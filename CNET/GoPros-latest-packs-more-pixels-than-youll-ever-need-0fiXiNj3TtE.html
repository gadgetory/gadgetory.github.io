cnet com and we're taking a first look
at the all-new freshly announced GoPro
hero3 now we've got in front of us here
the Black Edition which is the
top-of-the-line model the hero3 is about
thirty percent smaller than the previous
generation it's also 25% lighter when
you pop the camera out of its case it's
only 20 millimeters thick of course the
case makes it a little bit thicker but
you kind of want that on there for the
waterproof and shock resistance that the
GoPro cameras are known for that sort of
rugged ability to pretty much toss it on
a surfboard or slap it on the side of a
dirt bike and not have to worry about
your camera or the footage in destroyed
now inside it's actually got a two times
faster video processor now what that
does is it actually allows it to crunch
more pixels so with the Black Edition
here you can actually capture up to 4k
video that's that ultra-high
cinema-quality HD video at up to 15
frames per second there's also a
slightly lower but still extremely high
resolution 2.7 k resolution that you can
capture at it up to 30 frames per second
now down in the standard high definition
resolutions you also get bumps in your
frame rates as well you can capture
1080p video at up to 60 frames per
second 720 at about 120 frames per
second and if you want to jump down to
SD video to jump all the way up to a
blistering 240 frames per second for
some super slow-mo capturing there now
the camera comes with a new case that's
got a new locking mechanism on the top
there's also a new flat lind that covers
the glass now that's actually going to
give you less of that sort of like
barrel fisheye distortion but there's a
little bit of that left in because it's
GoPro signature look because you've got
this ultra wide-angle lens that captures
about 170 degree field of view now the
previous generation of GoPro cameras you
could buy a Wi-Fi BacPac that added
wireless connectivity to this Wi-Fi
remote so you could control up to about
50 cameras with just one little key fob
from anywhere within Wi-Fi range this
current generation has Wi-Fi built
into it can actually pair the camera up
with the remote and you get a duplicate
of the display kind of cool if you've
got the camera on the front bumper your
car and you decide that you don't want
to trigger it until you actually get out
of pit lane we've also got a couple of
new inputs the HDMI connection is shrunk
down to a micro HDMI connection here to
save space your full size SD card slot
from the previous generation is a micro
SD card and you've also got a mini USB
port that's used for charging and
thinking the new GoPro Hero black
edition retail for 349 and comes with
the case the Wi-Fi remote and a couple
of its x rays to kind of get you going
on mounting this on whatever you choose
to mount it on there's also a silver
edition and a white edition kit that has
a slightly slower video processor that
loses the 4k and 2.7 k video capability
and offer slightly lower frame rate caps
on your HD and SD video for 299 and 199
respectively well I've been antuan
goodwin with cnet com and we've been
taking a first look at the gopro hero3
black edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
