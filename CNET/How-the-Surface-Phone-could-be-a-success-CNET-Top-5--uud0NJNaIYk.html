introduce a surface phone these are the
top five ways a surface phone would be a
success at number five beer for life
picture this Microsoft introduces a
surface phone that comes with free beer
as long as you actually use the phone
the surface phone also would come with
an anti drunk function no calls or texts
to exes on this phone next to MJ for
this idea at number four a brand new
audience a huge alien population is
found on a new planet these aliens have
evolved similar to us but they don't
have phones Microsoft brokered a deal
with the aliens to get them phone's
surface phones at number three rename
the surface pro so Microsoft decides to
build a phone functionality into the
surface pro then Microsoft can
triumphantly declare that the surface
phone is the leading 12 inch phone on
the market success thanks to Ed on
Twitter for that one at number two iOS
and Android go extinct every iOS and
Android device on earth would experience
a catastrophe at the same time both
Google and Apple abandon the mobile
dreams but Microsoft a dozen maybe then
and that's a big maybe a surface phone
to be a hit I asked you on Twitter what
would make a Microsoft Surface phone
successful and here were some of your
answers Kurt says telepathic interface
Samuel says the phone would need
everything Android or iOS has right now
plus a ton of features that can't fit
into one tweet and finally Marco said
nothing even if they make the most
advanced phone with the best screen
camera and battery life no one will bias
due to the operating system and by the
way Marco is a Windows Phone user and
the number one way a surface phone would
be a success is if it was transparent
with Holograms the surface phone would
have to be similar to the hololens but
you wouldn't have to wear it on your
head
imagine a clear piece of rollable
plastic and it somehow protects images
in the air so what I'm saying is
Microsoft would have to invent the tech
you see in movies and then the surface
phone would be a success look I really
like Microsoft by the way but there is
no foreseeable way for the company to
make a dent in the current market it
will take a miracle from Microsoft to
reclaim the mobile space best
