with a taste of their own medicine I'm
Jeff Bakalar filling in for Bridget
Carey this week this is your CNET update
so it's no secret that the relationship
between uber and New York City taxis is
toxic to say the least
uber has decimated the taxi industry
here in New York poaching drivers and
sending the cost of a medallion down
hundreds of thousands of dollars sure
uber offers a better product and nicer
cars to ride in not to mention the taxi
industry has not been able to match the
ease-of-use that uber provides that
might change with a new taxi hailing app
it's called arrow and it works a lot
like uber zap but just for NYC taxis the
service promises overall cheaper fares
and no surge pricing which is a total
goober disaster here in New York right
now the service is in beta with around
7,000 cabs but it'll eventually be
compatible with all 20,000 yellow and
green taxis in New York users can store
credit card information in the app and
pay just like they would with uber
now if arrow does work and starts to
catch on the yellow taxi cab legacy here
in New York might just find a way to
live on so guess what a billion people
use Facebook on Monday that's right for
the first time in the company's history
think about that just for a second okay
one out of every seven people on the
planet logged into the social network in
a 24 hour period is it sad is it telling
of the world we live in I don't know but
that's a lot of freaking people Google
has set a deadline of September 1st for
when Chrome will start to block all
Flash content that isn't quote central
to the web page
this means Auto playing video ads those
animated sidebars you know all the junk
that lives on the gutters of the
internet all that won't work anymore but
don't think for a second that ads are
going away anytime soon the move away
from Flash is actually to drive html5
development which can do everything
flash can just better
rest in peace flesh I sure as hell won't
miss updating you every four days and
finally the consumer launch of HTC's VR
headset vive has been delayed to q1 of
2016
HTC will only have a limited quantity of
vive headsets this year the HTC and
valve collaboration is likely oculus
rifts closest competition so now the two
are much more likely to release around
the same time that will do it for this
episode of update for the very latest
head over to cnet.com from our Studios
here in New York I'm Jeff Bakalar</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
