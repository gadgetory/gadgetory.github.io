LG Display these guys are one of the
biggest TV display manufacturers in the
world and they make panels for everybody
including LG Electronics of course
they're most known for their OLED
display technology so let's take a look
at some of the coolest new devices they
have first up is crystal sound
technology this is LG displays brand new
way to make the OLED panel itself behave
like a speaker so you put these little
transducers behind the the display panel
and it creates sound just like a regular
speaker the advantage that the sound is
less directional you have to worry about
it being from the side or aiming below
it's also a neater design thing because
you know to make room in the cabinet for
the speakers themselves of course sound
quality is going to be quite what you'd
expect from a dedicated speaker inside
the television and maybe not even as
good as a dedicated surround system but
at the end of the day it does make sound
come out of TV screen and that's pretty
cool even cooler is the wallpaper
display seen here in a 77 inch size
which is absolutely gigantic this is an
OLED technology that now it's earlier
buy LG electronics no pricing yet on the
77 inch sides the first I've seen it in
person so you can see it's gigantic and
the best part incredibly thin the panel
itself is right around three millimeters
thin you can see from the side here it's
just crazy thin completely against the
wall you put it up on your wall you're
going to seem like a piece of art on
there instead of you know an actual
television mounted of course the
disadvantage is extremely expensive
especially in 770's eyes I'm guessing
you know twenty to thirty thousand
dollars they also make a 65 inch size
again no pricing yet but that'll be
close to ten thousand of course OLED is
also great for commercial applications
not just stuff that you see home one of
the coolest things that they've shown is
this kind of 77 inch OLED flat dual view
display so it's shown here on a rotating
pedestal
Heol it's so thin that you could put 277
inch panels back-to-back and align them
in a portrait mode so people are
actually almost life-sized when you look
at it that rotates inside you can see
it's extremely thin there's also the
ability to bend these OLED TVs so you
can see here on a column display imagine
like a column in an airport or something
like that this one is clad in six
77 is vertically aligned OLED panels the
curve is just enough to go right around
the edge of the column and of course it
looks really cool you can kind of circle
around and see this is one amazing
looking display and person actually
thought it was an actual photograph
instead of you know video when I first
looked at it there's also the ability
for OLED to be transparent this display
here is about 45 percent transparency
they tell me you can actually see behind
here there's some flowers in the front
you just run the display over it so
again commercial applications that's
pretty cool now LG Display actually
makes its bread and butter making LCD
not OLED displays so there's plenty of
LCD on display too here's the commercial
application used for these crazy aspect
ratios you can see these screens are a
lot thinner and narrower and in some
cases taller and narrower than a
standard television the idea is that
they can fit in different places for
example a menu board above a fast food
restaurant something like that LG also
has approved some of its display
technologies so they're talking about
their IPS panels being better being
better from off angle there's also a new
nano technology that approved the color
and they say that their HDR technology
is better on all these displays to
finally for LCD we wouldn't be complete
without an 8k television aka is a
tremendous number of pixels way more
than the 4k TVs you see today but this
guys is 65 inch size of those pixels are
incredibly small the details are insane
on this thing downside of course it's
not available to sale any time soon and
there really is no 8k content but of
course you always going to see the
future here at LG display that's quick
look at all the cool new displays at the
LG display booth at CES 2017 I'm David
Katz bye for CNN</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
