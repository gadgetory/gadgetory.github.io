McQueen robotic remote-control racecar
might be the best toy based on Pixar's
movie cars that we've ever seen it also
might be the most impressive example of
a toy created to look like a real
animated character but it's also another
sign that the robots of tomorrow are
aiming for personality McQueen is the
first robot car made by Spiro it's
clever bb-8 opened up a new territory
for realistic movie based toys and
McQueen is the next in a series heroes
engineers work with Pixar's animation
team to develop McQueen's realistic
moves and expressions
it has capacitive sensors a speaker and
it's made to drift and do tricks a phone
app acts as the remote lightning gets
about 40 minutes of runtime per charge
and can race it up to 6 miles an hour
and it can also react to the original
Cars movie if you watch along with it
kind of like bb-8 did with the force
awakens you can drive lightning around
and make it say things or you can use it
like a regular RC car or without any
phone nearby lightning will still react
to your touch and have a few things to
say rusty only brand I trust this is the
first Sphero toy with a screen here it's
lightnings eyes and it's the first that
can make its own noises spero says if
this is the first of five products
coming this year this one's already a
big step forward in movie replica
realism what's coming next</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
