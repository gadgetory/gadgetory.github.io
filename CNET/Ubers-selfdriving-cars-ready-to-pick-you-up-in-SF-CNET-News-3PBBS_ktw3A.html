being in the driver's seat another
person will be in the passenger seat to
analyze data uber is using modified
volvo xc90 s equipped with lidar and
several cameras to see their
surroundings uber did not specify how
large its fleet of self-driving cars is
the cars are allowed to operate within
San Francisco only rides will cost about
the same as an uberx ride there is one
tricky point with this whole arrangement

companies to obtain a permit for
autonomous cars Boober does not appear
to have a permit but argues its cars
aren't truly autonomous sent a person is
in the driver's seat for more
