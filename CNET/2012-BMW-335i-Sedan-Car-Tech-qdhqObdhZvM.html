frugally or are a high school trust fund
kid the 3-series tend to be your ride
this is what made the company and it
only keeps getting back let's drive to
2012 335i sedan and check the Peck
this is BMWs bread-and-butter the 4-door
3-series sedan without any M it's not a
retractable it's nothing special except
the cars that people who drive a Camry
today typically aspire to let's get
inside
nothing too surprising inside this 335
for 2012 you've got the iDrive
controller and of course the iDrive
related screen wide screen but not as
big as you'll see in some of the more
expensive BMWs among the highlights I'll
call out the media sources just about
everything you care about is in here
we've got of course am/fm HD radio
you've got in here an aux jack USB which
is also for your Apple devices streaming
Bluetooth which is working kind of
intermittently for me I've tried it on a
couple of droid phones and I'm getting
at best media playback no meta tags and
no logic control no Track advance back
and forth there's a premium audio system
we have fitted on this car it's about a
grand it's a Harman Kardon upgrade I
don't know if it's just my ears in this
car I couldn't get it to sound good no
matter what I did I went to the bass the
treble on all the other settings I dug
into the equalizer which you get with
the HK system I couldn't get it to sound
anything but either shrill on one end or
totally tubby on the other with every
source now under the connected drives
menu here at the top this is connecting
through my smart phone to give me a
wireless live internet connection for
things like news weather stuff that you
don't care about while you're driving
but I do get interested when I get to
Google local search and here you do a
free-form search to find things which
you can turn into a nav instruction for
example that to me is absolutely
brilliant
now let's move on to some of the driver
assistance technology you can
option upfront cameras here obviously
the rear view cam is almost common these
days but we also have optional front
cameras on this car as part of a package
that look out both corners of the front
bumper cover three choices on the
gearbox in this car you're going to get
this 8-speed automatic with this ice
cream scoop paddle thingy at BMW does
now and no paddles as kind of the main
variant of this car there's also a
freebie a pic to get a six-speed manual
for no extra charge you can also get an
8-speed sport automatic for five hundred
dollars more and that would also include
paddles and different tuning in response
and this little rocker switch next to
the shifter lets you choose one of
several profiles for the drivetrain
starting with the lamest being Eco Pro
lame in terms of performance but it's
great because it optimizes the
efficiency of the vehicle which has by
the way auto start/stop and brake
regeneration when you hit the brakes
you're actually generating juice to go
back in the battery so the alternator
doesn't do all the work and therefore
lessening the drag on the engine
increasing efficiency auto start/stop
drives me nuts in a BMW it's not that
smooth so I use that button right there
to switch it off but you're going to
live some mpj and then you've got
comfort which is really your normal
balance mode for this car and you can
also go to a sport setting it's going to
sharpen up things like shifting throttle
response etc and our car has the head-up
display also part of an optional package
or you can get it all a cart it gives
you a really great multicolor very
bright heads-up of the most important
things right there in the windshield
so under the hood is a venerable three
litre BMW inline six they're putting
these in just about everything they make
and for good reason it's a great motor
turbocharged in this case not all of
them are but this one is the twin scroll
turbo it's one turbo with to scroll
profiles inside of it to work at
different parts of the RPM band that
means it's very responsive the numbers
300 horse 300 foot-pounds of torque
gets this roughly 3500 pound car no
lightweight up to 60 in the low 5 second
range it's a good number while
delivering 20 30 mpg if you go for the
manual or 2333 will be automatic I bet
you're going to get oh by the way notice
this same basic engine is in the 640 I
we recently drove but there it gets 315
horse 330 foot-pounds of torque so when
you see a 3 liter twin scroll turbo on a
BMW it doesn't mean the outputs the same
just the architecture oh by the way I'm
very excited about this low tech
innovation this hood latch no longer
looks like something from one of the Saw
movies which it did on recent BMWs this
huge hook meant to haul your brain out
through your sinuses now it's relatively
benign thank you and they also got to
get rid of the label that says don't
lift your head up too hard
now winter on the open road in this car
it's a strange mix of impressions you
get first of all that engine just won't
quit it's one of the great stories in
propulsion the power just keeps coming
it appears to be this flat chunky torque
curve all the way up till it runs out of
breath and that's way up there but the
transmission in this car is kind of
letting me dead we have the base eight
speed and it's just sort of this
disconnected kind of Numb thing down
shifts aren't great up shifts tend to be
strangely delayed sometimes and it
doesn't seem to be the match for this
motor that's why there's a sport eight
and a six feet Daniel bear in mind
though that six feet is going to make
the car slower and more gas-guzzling
you can't of course shift this car
manually even with the base transmission
by getting the panel over here on the
left side but I feel that if you have to
shift an automatic to get good results
out of it it's not a great automatic and
the sport mode here is also a big help
but it makes the car too high-strung for
everyday driving and stop and go and
commute and I'm almost certain it also
clobbers mpg because it keeps those rpms
way up there so this car needs a
transmission ectomy option the Sport
Automatic oh by the way a ride quality
in this car is probably not what you
expect from something that will cost you
typically north of 50 grand it's kind of
intrusive kind of utilitarian a lot of
road noise and tire drumming and the
occasional sharp input coming back from
the suspension even when I'm not in
sport mode that may or may not delight
you depending what you expect from a
luxury sports sedan
pricing of modern 3:35 is an exercise in
how did that turn into a $50,000 car
that's about with these cost well
equipped now base is 44 grand delivered
but to go see that style you got to add
a few things the tech package with the
apps the head-up display and GPS
navigation that's going to run your 3100
driver assist with the blind spot tech
and all those fancy cameras almost 2
grand more premium audio as I mentioned
just shy of a grand and finally you may
want to go for the sports 8 speed
because I wasn't crazy about this one
all in these are no longer affordable
cars to most people but they are really
well built have one of the great engines
in human history and their technology
remains cutting edge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
