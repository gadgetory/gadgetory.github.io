almost upon us and what do you expect
maybe something with a lot of touch with
a lot of crazy folding origami shapes
some sort of futuristic laptop well this
isn't it this is the sony vaio 17 and
this is an old-fashioned traditional Big
Bone laptop that is seven pounds it is a
17 inch display it has 1080p resolution
and a lot of upgrade options
it starts at $650 which is pretty
reasonable and if you want to go up to
what this has our review configuration
has a quad core Core i7 processor AMD
graphics 750 gigabyte hard drive 8 gigs
of RAM it comes in at about $1000 that's
not bad for everything that it's got
including a blu-ray drive so it's really
soup to nuts pretty complete laptop so
what's the problem well it's really not
all that touch friendly now I never
thought I'd say that because I don't
really like the idea of touchscreen
laptops yet but the fact is this
trackpad is really small and Windows 8
is really designed for touch you really
want to trackpad that's as large as
possible and this one is not that small
but compared to the amount of trackpad
space that you've got available here and
the fact that it's offset a bit to the
left it's frustrating to use and it's
inset and if you can see it here but
it's actually a little bit lower it's
not flush and if you're going to be
doing one of those swipes for charms
that comes off the edge of the trackpad
when you use Windows 8 you'll know what
I mean it's really hard to pull off on
this now
as Seth Rosenblatt and others have
pointed out there are other ways to
access the app tiles with in Windows 8
and swap between you can go up to the
top of the screen you can use a keyboard
command but I want to be able to do it
the way I want to do it and that
trackpad is holding me back and I think
it would hold you back too now it's not
enough to be a deal killer on this
laptop but this really isn't anything
inventive although it is a new product
within the e-series that sony makes
which is kind of a mid-range almost
budget II line of laptops and not
unattractive a kind of a nice clean
white and black two-tone look very sleek
looking but definitely not thin this is
nothing that you haven't seen before and
if you want to buy into something like
that now regardless of
those eight and you feel like you want
to get a laptop that's got a lot of
bells and whistles well this is it but
how many people are asking for a big
large screen laptop I'm not really and I
don't know if you are either
I'm Scott Stein and this is a look at
the new Sony Vaio g17</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
