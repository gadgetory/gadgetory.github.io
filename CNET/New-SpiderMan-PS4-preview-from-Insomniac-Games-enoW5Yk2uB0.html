hey where you going
New York web slinging crime-fighting
this is insomniac games spider-man and
the rest of the game lives up to our
preview we're looking at another
contender for game of the year but this
isn't just any Spidey you've seen before
this is a new Peter Parker not based off
a single comic or movie and designed
specifically by insomniac for this game
the characters no matter where they are
they always like pop off the screen so
in terms of what's classic about
spider-man obviously the red and the
blue I looked at did Co suit which is
very classic very clean and I especially
loved the web patterning that you see on
the classic classic suit where again
there's a lot of room to breathe
characters very graphic on screen if
you're super spider-man fan you'll know
that spider-man doesn't only come in red
and blue he comes in a bunch of
different colors so it's really cool to
just get that super wide variety there
are a lot of suits and you will not be
disappointed my time was with the first
few hours of the game and in that time I
got to swing through the city beat up
bad guys and sling webs every way I
could we didn't want to do an exact
one-to-one replication of the city we
wanted to make Peter Parker's New York
City we want to make spider-man's
New York City and at this point of the
game spider-man has been spider-man for
eight years so he's been protecting to
say the entire time and they all know
him so the city of Shu reacts to
spider-man as the game evolves and the
story evolves and I think that's one of
the cooler things about our city is that
it really does reflect the narrative
there's a lot going on in the city and
swinging Spidey around town takes a
little bit of getting used to but once
you have a feel for the controls you'll
be launching between skyscrapers with
ease I don't want to give too much story
away but you'll definitely see some
familiar faces as for combat insomniac
says it wanted an improvisational feel
and it seems to have succeeded you have
a pile of abilities at your disposal
during fights from melee juggling to
your web slinger x' to gadgets and
you'll also be able to use the
surrounding environment to your
advantage if you're wondering about
collectibles it looks like spider-man is
full of them I caught six different
kinds of tokens for Peter to snag
including tokens for finding his old
backpack strewn around town and if
you're hoping for good Easter eggs come
on
this is insomniac we're talking about
there's time
Easter eggs new game there's tons for
Marvel fans there a ton for insomnia
fans and they're just a ton of Easter
eggs just in general for gamers
spider-man swings onto PlayStation 4 on
September 7th</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
