into a lightning connector turning your
iPhone or iPad into the display for its
20 megapixel one inch sensor f-18 camera
and that's not its only trick I'm Lauren
from CNET and this is the DxO one to use
the one you slide down the cover to turn
it on and to pop out the lightning
connector then plug it into your device
if you stick it in upside down it's good
for selfies DX's app lets you work in
automatic mode or with manual settings
you can shoot DNG RAW files as well as
DX OS proprietary super RAW format
superraw files have to be processed on a
computer which the bundled software does
automatically when you connect via USB
using the supplied software and it
leverages the power of the computer to
do a much better job of noise reduction
than can be done in a tiny camera the
photo quality is of course better than
you can get out of an iphone or ipad and
it does a great job with selfies in good
light it's about the same as a similar
full camera like the more recent models
in the Sony rx100 series the JPEGs that
it produces in low-light aren't quite as
good but the super all versions are
better the rotating lightning connector
is convenient if a bit wobbly the camera
doesn't fall out though it's also not
really fast enough to focus and shoot
anything moving faster than a walk and
the time it takes to initialize when you
turn it on can be a bit frustrating plus
while it charges fast via USB and you
can recharge it while you're shooting
via a portable power pack the battery
life is poor and it's worse for
low-light shooting it's also kind of
expensive running six hundred dollars in
the US and five hundred pounds in the UK
but it's a great creative adjunct to an
iPhone or iPad if you really feel like
spending the money and don't mind
dealing with some quirks before the next
firmware upgrade quirks you say you'll
have to read about them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
