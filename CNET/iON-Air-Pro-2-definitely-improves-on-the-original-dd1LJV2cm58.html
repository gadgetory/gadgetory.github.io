look at the ion air pro 2 now like the
original air pro this point of view
camera is lightweight at less than five
ounces and fully waterproof down to 30
feet without a housing it's also very
easy to start and stop recording just
slide the big switch on top and it gives
off a little vibration so that you know
it's recording it also uses the same
Quick Connect mounting system as its
predecessor but can also be used with
anything with a standard 1/4 inch
tripod mount also returning is ions pod
system that among other things lets you
add Wi-Fi for previewing and uploading
video on an iOS or Android device as
well as controlling the camera and
changing its settings with iOS it works
well but with the Android app it's newer
and still a bit iffy so you might want
to check the app reviews on Google Play
to see if anyone's having issues with
your particular Android device now keep
in mind even though it has very good
battery life at two and a half hours
using the Wi-Fi will definitely run the
battery down faster so what is new with
the two is its sensor now 14 megapixels
up from 5 it has a mic input for adding
an external mic which is good because
the audio from the built-in mic isn't
great and the updated lens expands the
cameras field of view up to a hundred
and eighty degrees video quality is very
good and it records two resolutions at
once one for sharing over mobile
networks and one at full resolution
which goes up to 1080p at 30 frames per
second all in all it's not perfect but
for the $300 asking price you get a lot
of camera and very good accessory
options making it one of the better
action cam options available
I'm Josh Goldman and that's a look at
the eye
