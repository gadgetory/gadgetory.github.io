welcome to Google ishes is all the
Google that we can put together each
week so let's get to the show and
there's always new Android gadget news
and rumors and the latest buzz is around
the ACC's one alleged successor known by
its code name right now as m8 it's also
known as the shorter way to say mate on
urban dictionary in case you didn't know
now the leaked pictures don't show much
other than a cutout at the top of the
rear panel which is expected to be for a
fingerprint sensor eville Ock's is now
reporting that the HTC m8 will be
launched by AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile Verizon and
Sprint and released around februari in
2014 on a similar timetable to the ACC
ones released last year now Apple's
released its crop of iPads for the
holiday season but we're still waiting
to hear when Google will drop the latest
updates to the nexus tablet line now
according to the latest rumors from
highlight press the new Nexus 10 is
being held back for a simultaneous
release with the rumour nexus 8 that was
published in this picture accidentally
by Google and notice for its thinner
bezel now might seem strange with the
new Nexus 7 already out that they would
also introduce the nexus 8 but it's
still very possible and we're still
waiting to get the new Nexus 10 so we'll
see if the googs gives us something
before the holiday shopping season now
there are also tons of stories about the
mystery google barge project we showed
you footage of the actual project itself
and we wanted to give you guys an update
now according to the SF gate the final
project is envisioned to be an
unprecedented artistic structure with a
dozen or so gigantic sales that almost
look like fish fins in this artist's
rendering of the project now Google
issued a statement calling it an
interactive space where people can learn
about new technology and the company by
and large LLC who submitted the barge
documents describes it as a studio and
temporary technology exhibit space it
will be a 50-foot tall 250 foot long
structure made of recycled shipping
containers flanked by these sales and
the idea is for the bars to stay docked
at different sites around the San
Francisco Bay for a month at a time so
we'll be keeping an eye out to see if
there is anything else
the situation all right we know the
Nexus 5 is out and brings a lot of the
cool new bells and whistles for KitKat
but not every phone can get the update
or anytime soon so here's a cool how to
to get the kitkat launcher on your phone
right now first thing you'll notice
about Kit Kat is the clean look of the
new home screen launcher compared to the
look of Android 4.1 on the Samsung
Galaxy Note 2 it's a huge change and one
that I am ready for thankfully the
xda-developers forum has the APK files
you'll need to install this new launcher
you can find the link to the forum on
the original cnet post for this video or
on our interactive player the launcher
comes as a zip archive containing three
APK files my advice is to download these
to your computer for now now while those
download make sure that your phone is
ready to use these files first you'll
need to be running Android 4.1 or later
you can check that by going under
settings and then clicking the about
device option next still need to make
sure that your phone is able to install
software from unknown sources back out
into the settings menu select security
and check the box for unknown sources
now let me take a minute right now to
say that you should always back up your
phone whenever you're going to get to
tinkering like this worst case scenario
if this thing gets bricked I don't want
you emailing me with sob stories of
losing your precious pictures of your
newborn baby back it up my conscience is
clear all right now going back to your
computer open the zip file you've
downloaded and you should see three
separate APK files my advice is to send
each one of these in a separate email to
yourself using an account that you can
check on your phone once you've done
that refresh your email on your phone
and you should see the three APK files
as individual attachments the first one
to install is pre-built GMS core tap it
install it and hit done next install the
velvet apk then hit done finally install
the Google home apk and then hit open
with any luck you should see the
introduction to the new google launcher
now a couple things to note here first
to change the wallpaper configure your
home screens or add widgets now you're
going to tap and hold on the home screen
you all
see a settings option here that is
specific to Google now if it's not
already activated this is a good time to
do it once it's on swiping all the way
to the right will reveal your google now
cards and that's all there is to it
thanks Donald some very cool stuff there
and remember guys back up your phone
first all right now there's a few new
google glass stories to update you on
the latest Google glass XC 11 update
adds commands to search through your
google calendar and the ability to get
directions to home or work with the
direct voice command so you can bet a
lot of people will be saying all right
now when Google glass originally
launched everyone was trying to get
their hands on them even through ebay
but Google was the activating units that
were not being used by the registered
Explorer program user they have now said
they no longer have plans to disable
devices anymore and they recently
started giving explores three invites
for other people interested in glass
before their consumer lunch and to usher
in a more you know mainstream appeal new
york-based Rochester optical plans to
provide custom prescription fashion and
sports lenses for glass that will be
available to purchase in early 2014
alright guys now we asked you to send us
some of your thoughts about Motorola's
project are up from last week's show
booth Minh box from twitter says i would
call it the lego phone except boothman
it's not made of legos now Miguel
Saldana rights in with I think this is
going to change the mobile world much
more than flexible displays hey Miguel I
think ara definitely has the potential
if the platform can take off the right
way with developer support over time so
that's what really makes this
interesting all right guys that's gonna
do for this week's show email us at
Google licious at cnet com or tweet me
at brian Tong thanks so much for
watching all the Google goodies this
week i'm brian Tong and we'll see you
next time for another taste of google
