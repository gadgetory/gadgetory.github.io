are agreeable you know you guys Lonely
Island really reached out to me and
Fremont says with the internet where
YouTube before YouTube was the YouTube
we know it is today right you kind of
helped push that forward as a platform
if you guys could kind of look back and
take us back what did that feel like
because this is when Internet video and
content was very new like what was that
like to see the success of how lazy
Sunday just kind of really exploded
online and on digital devices
it was exciting it was awesome and rad
yeah Oh coding of YouTube really paid
off
yeah well I was mostly to be fair to be
fair I've mostly just worked on the
player and then these guys were more on
the working in the backend the stuff you
know it I want to give a lot of big
shout for these guys because the players
the flashy thing yeah I got to be really
had to get into yeah and nobody ever
because you can't really see the back
ends unless you're at the office over at
YouTube Dan yeah you know Silicon Valley
it is you know yes it's a very elegant
clean efficient yes and I think I've
worked you guys like I think maybe we
know that people obviously watch they
didn't create YouTube but it sounded
sounds like what's you did what you wait
you guys didn't create you to consumer
imply I thought that's what we were
implying anyway it's also because I'm
just thinking about it now that he's
saying it that we don't because we don't
know how to do right code right oh yeah
yeah that was a major hindrance in us
helping out this guy uses tabs yeah but
I mean you guys yeah because people we
know now people are watching TV less I
mean it was kind of a model of look
people aren't doing appointment viewing
television as much but they watched your
video they shared it they liked it that
became more important so was it kind of
weird for you guys to seem that change
you were there when it changed well the
the sites that we were putting our
videos up on before besides our own
website were it was like heavy calm atom
film and I feel like we're like very
early like but they you'd like send your
tape in and get a
it was hard to get a video online it was
expensive but it was super exciting we
you know you worked at SNL and for the
35 years before us it was just air and
if you wanted to see something again you
had to either record it or you had to
wait for a rerun and all of a sudden we
made lazy Sunday in the next morning my
brother email being like hey you can
actually watch it somewhere so yeah it
was excited</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
