you I'm Bridget Carey this is your CNET
update
the Consumer Electronic Show continues
to roll along and here at the Las Vegas
Convention Center the show floor has
opened with companies demoing their
latest innovations for 2016 the media
gets some early peeks at products and so
far the stars of the show are the large
home appliances we're in the dawn of the
smart home age and companies are showing
off how mundane washing machines and
refrigerators can evolve the most wild
of all is a new family hub refrigerator
by Samsung it brings a new meaning to
Netflix and chill when you have a giant
21 and a half inch screen on the door
we got a closer look and there's more to
this fridge than just throwing a tablet
on the front you can use the screen to
purchase groceries with a new MasterCard
app just make a list of what you need
and when you're ready it'll deliver your
order from Fresh Direct or shop right
just be careful on giving your kids the
pin number for ordering or you may end
up with 17 different cartons of ice
cream and Oreos the fridge also has
cameras inside of the doors so if you're
at the store and you forgot if you have
milk at home well just open your phone
app to look inside the fridge Samsung
also plans to integrate this with Alexa
that's the voice control assistant from
the Amazon echo the idea is to have
Alexa technology inside the fridge
itself this futuristic fridge arrives in
the spring for five thousand dollars LG
has a smart fridge that has a
see-through front panel when you knock
on the door it's not exactly much of a
time-saver from just opening the darn
door but another feature is pretty cool
if your hands are full you just stick
your foot in front of a sensor on the
bottom to pop open the door I'm not sure
if that'll also pop open when your pet
sits down in front of it perhaps in the
near future you won't have to buy a
separate washer and dryer LG's twin
washing machine can also dry your
clothes so not only does it wash two
loads at once but the main washing bin
can switch into a dryer a startup
company called marathon is also doing
this and it's two on one machine is
going for $1,200 whirlpool showed off a
dishwasher that can order detergent from
Amazon when it calculates that you're
low on soap and whirlpool also has an
oven that will talk to your nest smart
thermostat to alert you if you left the
oven on when you left the house so
not all shopping sometimes it's safety
and here's some smart tech that really
sucks no really the LG cord zero
canister vacuum tracks you to follow you
and move with you as you clean around
the home so you don't have to lug around
the engine it's like having a little pet
vacuum those are some of the highlights
from CES 2016 but there's so much more
in store this week coming to you from
the CNET stage at the Las Vegas
