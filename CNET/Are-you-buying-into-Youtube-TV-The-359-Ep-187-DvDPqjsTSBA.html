Studios it is Wednesday march first my
dudes and it's time for episode 187 of
the 359 podcast and on today's show
hosted by alfred eng we feature our good
friend David Katz meijer back from a
long hiatus it's been wait wait way too
long since you've been on the show
Alfredo how are you doing what are you
doing on the show today today we're
gonna be talking about youtube TV yeah
very meta right now well youtube decided
that it wants a piece of the cord cutter
action so we're gonna take a look at if
it's actually worth getting for
thirty-five dollars a month and also uh
motorola deciding they're not giving up
on modular phones so that should be
interesting to look at personally I've
never put them out on my phone but I'm
interested in it so who doesn't like
Legos I mean if it worked like Legos I
would totally get that but it's this
whole thing I'm just not interested in
it that much yeah but Motorola loves
them and they're doing pressing on with
them that could be their niche I mean it
probably it's gotta be their niche
because no one else is used is doing it
all right so we're gonna go ahead and
get into the show recording the four
minute podcast or to be more deadly
accurate three minutes 59 seconds
exactly please go ahead and submit your
comments and questions are interested to
see what everyone's perspective is if
you would be a subscriber to you tube TV
if you yourself mod your phone or would
mod your phone more accurately and we'll
be back to hit you up in the chat in a
exactly three minutes and 59 seconds
from 32
welcome to the 359 where we talk about
the top tech news of the day I'm Alfred
Aang I'm David Katz Meyer youtube
announced yesterday would be launching
its own live TV channels for thirty-five
dollars a month taking on services like
sling TV DirecTV now playstation view
not to mention you know traditional
cable companies you get unlimited cloud
DVR and you can watch across all your
devices but what I'm wondering is you
know there's so many different services
out there already what advantages does
YouTube have over its competitors now
the big one is it's YouTube so you know
everybody knows YouTube YouTube street
at billion hours a day that recently
announced so they are huge and they're
bigger than anyways others you mentioned
so YouTube has the potential you know to
get that brand recognition people who
know YouTube's you know what I'll just
try it out for 35 bucks a month I don't
like it I can always quit that's really
the main benefit of all these guys but
whoa sorry I mean what I'm wondering
those but when it comes to services how
does that work you know it doesn't have
advantages in terms of that I know that
YouTube is a much bigger name than all
its competitors yet what can it actually
provide me I'm not a name brand guy yes
so once you've cut through the name
thing you look at the for services now
if you include YouTube and the main
differentiator for YouTube is that cloud
DVR so the other two main services
directly now and sling don't offer the
cloud to be our PlayStation view does
but it's reportedly less popular so that
right there is really cool you can
basically pretend that you know you have
a DVR except it's in the cloud if
YouTube does it well it'll be a great
service that it to have all that storage
and they haven't announced the numbers
or anything like that but you know
basically you just say all these shows
to watch later on your own time which is
really cool the second big thing with
YouTube is that you do have simultaneous
streams so they announced that you can
do three simultaneous streams at once
other services PlayStation view offers
that directly notice to it as well you
can have different bunch of people sign
into the service at once we're sling TV
only allows you to do one sanal taenia
stream so somebody starts watching to
the part of the house that $20 month
service cuts off but sling does have a
second tier where you can add those
simultaneous streams so we'll know more
later but right now YouTube has
announced local TV channels on a bunch
of different markets and they're going
to launch you know major markets early
and you get your major channels but they
do have some holes of the thing for
example there's no CNN there's you know
a couple of other channels missing so
they
night had those before they launch well
I'll not know with the lack of channels
in terms of price range versus what you
get how does you know you tube TV
compared to its competitors especially
for cord cutters who are looking to save
every sign yeah we don't know yet again
with cord cutters music is really
popular because it allows you to kind of
slice and dice taz this fewest channels
but also the cheapest 20 bucks a month
DirecTV now has a lot of different
channels and they have you know
generally really good channel coverage
but you know they've been some technical
difficulties with that service so you
got to kind of look at the channels
again YouTube hasn't launched yet they
have been finalized yet about their
channel services we don't know how
exactly they stack up but I think
they're going to be pretty good when
they finally launch all right on the
next note we've got some news coming out
of Barcelona Motorola is not giving up
on its mods which is a key feature of
its phones especially the Moto z2 one of
the more innovative moves for phones in
recent memory on Sunday motorola showed
off a new power pack another mod that
you can attach on to bring Alexa onto
your device and another one the gamepad
for a mobile gaming do you see this as a
risky move as something that people
would actually you know by or is it it
hasn't really caught on with any other
companies yeah I think there's a reason
for that I mean personally I don't use
even a case on my phone you know it's it
once you start adding different things
to your phone you go where's the cost
benefit here usually the base phone is
the selling point so you know until they
can guess it popular over there the real
problem is that they're competing
against you know Samsung Apple everybody
else has a lot better market share so
it's going to be tough I think LG
floated some mods on their phones for a
while maybe something that can really
get your battery up without make the
phone too bulky would be really cool but
beyond that I don't really know that
people want that kind of stuff i mean i
think it's interesting i think you know
android users have always wanted to mod
their phones i think that's why they
prefer android / iphones where they can
you know put all these different widgets
and things like that on their screens
but now it's coming down to hardware so
if you like this story please check us
out on cnet com thanks for listening
all right I for one am hella on board
with YouTube TV nice just as an avid
user I've been a cord cutter for a long
time loud and proud but we've got some
good questions in the chat about
comparing its side by side for so for a
lot of people like myself and like
Matthew in the chat we've already got
netflix paid amazon paid hulu um and
then like at best maybe pair rabbit ears
in the house kind of thing too much what
I do yeah and and the whole question is
does live TV appeal to people still like
now when you think about TV it's not
live it's I want to watch what I want to
watch when I want to watch totally on
demand whether it's from a DVR whatever
I think that's maybe where the the cloud
DVR comes in because you know you set up
your your shows to record all the time
they're always going to be available you
know to do some searching for them you
don't have to come up empty I mean if
you get two channels you know you can
record the shows on DVR no that's pretty
cool if they make the interface as easy
to use as Netflix something like that I
think that's a big deal you know a lot
of times youtube is pretty overwhelming
yeah with the amount of stuff they throw
at you and finding what you want to
watch it's pretty tough one of the
interesting but that's YouTube proper
would write you think they'd kind of
refine youtube TV into its own identity
you'd think but what I was about to say
one of the things that they announced is
that they're actually going to integrate
search results from regular YouTube so
you search you know for NCIS or a
regular network show and you're going to
get not only the results from YouTube TV
you're also going to get countless clips
or whatever that you know use that that
search term so you're going to get all
that at once it's going to do a little
like a fire hose they're gonna have to
do a really good job of keeping that
manageable and not overwhelmed I think
it'd be interesting if you could watch
live TV without having to DVR right
through the search function like if I
wanted to watch an episode of Jeopardy
that aired yesterday but I didn't
personally record it right I can be able
to go back and then you know put that on
as if it were a live TV and and and
that's a served that's available on a
lot of the other services and just
linked TVs they allow you to do what
they call like a 72-hour jump back where
you know something aired in the last
period of time you can go back and
immediately do it whether or not you
recorded it and that's kind of the
antithesis of hulu who make you wait an
extra X amount of days before recently
broadcast can be made available to you
yeah yeah
the 24-hour delay at least a lot of
times though it's contractually
negotiated so we'll see what happens by
bringing up who I think they Derek said
that they're coming out another live TV
service later this year yeah they
magnetic 11 months ago right yeah so I
got a good look at that at CES in
january and i was really impressed
because hulu obviously is the king of
the on-demand shows that you know you
want right now so you know netflix
doesn't have current shows generally
amazon you gotta pay individually for
them so you got prime is again not
necessarily current shows but with who
really rules that niche and if they can
combine their you know their awesome
on-demand library with this live TV
service and make it all great then you
can cancel that other stuff i mean
that's the real goal here is if you're a
cord cutter you don't want to pay for
you know 30 different services and again
adding something like a youtube live for
35 bucks a month that's a big ask if
netflix costs you know 15 or less now to
just clarify to some late comers to the
chat this is different than youtube red
yeah this is about YouTube itself
becoming its liable net yes sorry this
is YouTube giving you ABC NBC you know
Fox all of these channels versions of
those channels yep absolutely and so
these are live you know you turn it on
you get your local news for example you
get you know you get the news services
you get Fox Sports um you know looking
here they got golf they got National
Geographic so you know there's all these
services there of course it's not as
much as your normal cable TV Live
service has it's not even as much as
directive you now and places view right
now they're still in negotiations so
there's still you still got to tie down
deals with for example CNN right and TNT
and these big cable services they don't
have yet right and Dwight in the chat
he's pointing out the youtube has
already had a robust experience with
live broadcasting but it's different
this is actually about carrying official
network channels through a youtube
streaming service in real time yep this
is just like regular cable TV official
commercial television coming to you via
a YouTube portal yeah and one of the
things i didn't get to mimic podcast but
it is a big deal for youtube is
obviously it's all about mobile so
everybody watches youtube on the phone
so the idea here is you be able to watch
all these live channels streaming on
your phone to again the same thing
that's link TV and all those other guys
offer
and and they're gonna obviously I think
and when they first launched accent
mobile the only device they mentioned
for TV that will carry it it launches
chromecast which makes sense because
Google makes it and chromecast and
youtuber really easy to use together
mm-hmm I mean it that's one of the
quintessential chromecast experiences
you have like a phone and everybody can
login to the chromecast on the big TV
and everybody can pass her on the phone
and throw big videos up there everything
like that you'll be able to do the same
thing with YouTube TV and you know it's
it's a pretty intriguing marriage
between youtube and you know it all the
videos of them before and this live TV
thing I think it'd be really cool Danny
in the chat as asking if it's um 100%
pre bundled services or how much a la
carte do you think they'll allow zero
Danny you get what you get and you don't
get upset oh they have like I said that
they're launching with Disney ESPN NBC
CBS fox the weather channel so you know
you you get a handful of channels
largely similar to a sling TV packet
really absolutely so again it's a you're
gonna have to compare these
quote-unquote skinny bundles you know
it's skinny because it's cheaper than
cable and there's fewer channels but
it's still a bundle there's no ala carte
yet I mean the exception of course is
premium channels showtime they've
announced for youtube they don't have
HBO yet interesting Lena but I think
they probably will by the time they
launch showing HP would play that close
to the chest with HBO going all that
well HBO is also on these other channels
too so you can as a view subscriber you
get HBO package same thing with sling so
you know they're already playing ball
with the other competitors in the reason
why they wouldnt already do with YouTube
to as long as they can charge for a
premium yes they're there all the things
of 15 bucks and what up what I'm
wondering is you know you know when
you're subscribed to a cable company you
can kind of log into another website
using your cable subscription you can
just live stream it through there right
where's somebody else's cables yeah
pretty much so what I'm wondering is you
know if I have a you tube TV
subscription would I be able to
theoretically be able to do that if I
wanted to watch I don't know the FXX
like marathon yeah so that's another
little weird thing that happens with all
these services so that's called
authentication hmm and the idea is you
know if you're a subscriber with cable
TV and you you know ESPN you can always
log onto ESPN now and watch stuff from
there they have a great yes peon
that was really good but you know you
got to have the cable authentication you
know view places view is really good
about offering authentication for almost
all the channels that they support so
you can watch those apps really well
with you sling TV on the other hand only
has a handful they have a bunch of
channels that should support
authentication like TT a lot of sports
stuff but they don't actually do it I
think ESPN is the exception so with
that's still up in the air with with
YouTube TV if they're smart yes they'll
support authentication for all the
channels that they offer all that stuff
is part of the negotiation so yep you
know to turn the green light on for that
kind of capability is still up in the
air a lot of times you got to go in and
check it out yourself a lot of times you
know they don't offer as much
authentication as they should Tyler and
the chat wants to know do you think that
fiber would play any part in to this
service ah good question maybe they do a
bundle or whatever google fiber's pretty
limited and availability but it's been
kind of stalled right yeah and I feel
like they've backed off it a little bit
and and but you know again youtube TV
won't be a villain nationwide either
when it launches its going to be
restricted to the major markets where
they're able to get FOX NBC ABC
affiliates and CBS to sign on so I think
that's the real limiting factor that's
historically which probably stopped
apple from from rolling out a similar
live TV service and it's it's you know
there's a lot of these other services i
mentioned do offer those local channels
but only in specific markets I'm just
kind of interested how would play out
i'm definitely got my attention just as
like i said a cord cutter but it would
be kind of nice to be able to go back to
the art of flipping i forgot what that
was like you know yes what would you be
doing that though with YouTube TV though
if it's chromecast it's not like you're
I mean is that how you'd be flipping it
when I would home and that would be kind
of part of the experience because that
seems kind of quick to say yeah that's
what I was just like I get plenty of
satisfaction of the programming I enjoy
so many non-red YouTube channels for
original content but I'd sometimes I'd
love to watch like agents of shield in
real time kind of them just being the
comic book geek that I am but I haven't
done that ever yeah so bringing that
experience back into my life without
having to pay you know let's leave the
corporate names out of cable services
some of which we have expressed prior
disinterest in that would be nice
but aging I think food we said 35 bucks
yes that's a fair price and and and if
you if that's if you watch enough live
TV to justify that price then yeah
you're you're in good shape and and
again if if if you really want that look
at sling because they start at 20 bucks
a month and see if they got enough
channels for yeah because that's a big
savings and I enjoyed the sling I did
trial sling it but I legitimately was
able to kind of step back and like I'm
still not using it as much as I probably
should and if I paying for it and a lot
of people are in that boat where it's
all about what habits you have which
shows you want whether you want to sit
down and do it and also you know family
members like I got a wife and kids and
my wife can't live without Bravo so
that's a consideration for a lot of
people to it's like do they offer the
stuff that my family does and that's
where this whole simultaneous streams
comes in so again sling you get the base
back in front of us so much you only
watch one at a time so so many other
part of the house or even on another
phone or something turns on a stream on
the same channel yours turns off yeah so
one of the things that YouTube
negotiated is this ability to watch
three simultaneous streams for the 35
bucks a month again view and DirecTV
also allow those simultaneous streams so
is it also three for them uh view is up
to five and the I think DirecTV now is
to base package so those are all
contractually negotiated with all the
guys so again those things those details
are pretty important and the kind of
thing where you discover at the end of
the day like wow this isn't exactly like
cable TV there's a lot of restrictions
here there's other restrictions on
mobile for example NFL games are highly
restricted there's a lot of things out
there that you did aren't really an
issue with cable TV that you've got to
consider with all these services a lot
of people in the chat are bringing up
antennas and how playing with local
channels yep um a couple things on that
antennas are fantastic I myself have a
pair of rabbit ears but I have live in a
basement apartment in my reception is
crap yeah and that's a lot of times the
problem with that service even when you
get an extender or the higher better
antennas the outdoor antennas you're
still kind of screwed to certain extent
in certain markets local channels would
be included yeah in the YouTube TV but
i'd be curious you know what be kind of
cool is if you could change your
locality right right so for those of us
who maybe grow up into place now live in
a different place if I could like tune
back in and get my hometown for a minute
that be kind of neat yeah you
no yeah that's a big negatory that they
would offer they probably offer all a
car before they offered that did Asia
again that's that's the negotiation
thing and these guys want you to see the
things that you want to see I think of
it's similar to out-of-market
restrictions for mlb.com where you know
you can't watch your local team and I'm
using streaming although sometimes you
can now with authentication but at the
end of the day those things are pretty
highly regulated I should be cool a
premium level though like throw extra
five bucks in any other market and the
what the workaround for that is to go to
your local news channel's website and
then just chromecast the entire tab
touche have done that but i'm from a
time i'm from a tiny town where that's
not website mmm they barely have a TV
channel they're uploading you know the
fatigue is gone abroad yeah on a dial-up
modem fret there so on the 2012 election
right now all right that's as curious to
see where this is gonna go I think
that's probably a good spot to leave it
for the day we're just about out of time
thank you David anytime Thank You Alfred
