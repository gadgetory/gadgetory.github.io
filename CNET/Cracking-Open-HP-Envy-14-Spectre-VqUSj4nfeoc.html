panels the HP Spectre is definitely one
of the most stylish ultrabooks on the
market but is this machines beauty only
skin deep I'm Bill Detweiler head
technology editor at tech Republic and
I'm going to crack open the HP Envy 14
Spectre unlike the MacBook Air there are
no tamper resistant screws holding the
spectres case together
I began cracking open the machine by
removing the battery cover and then the
battery next I disconnected a few
internal cables removed all the external
case screws including two hidden under
the unit's rubber feet and removed the
near-field communication module I then
popped the bottom half of the case loose
from the top half and gently separated
the two disconnecting a handful of
ribbon cables along the way next to come
out was the SD card reader the headphone
jack followed by the solid-state drive
and the hard drive and volume control
circuit board the touch pad was the last
component I removed from the upper case
now moving over to the spectres lower
case I first disconnected the lids
display and antenna cables then remove
the hinge screws and the lid itself I
then removed the wireless card cooling
fans motherboard and power ports screws
and the motherboard itself lastly I
disconnected the RAM power port and
removed the cooling assembly with that
our teardown was complete so what did I
learn about the Spectre from our
teardown well first the machine is well
built and relatively easy to disassemble
and I like the fact that most parts can
be replaced separately the
user-accessible battery is also a nice
touch as is the easy to reach SSD now
our test unit came with a single 128 gig
drive but HP appears to have put a spot
right above it for a second SSD not only
can you swap out the storage unit but
unlike all the other ultrabooks I've
cracked open you can also upgrade the
unit's RAM as it's not soldered to the
motherboard on the downside there's no
way to get to the
ham chip without removing the
motherboard also the specter is a bit
thicker and heavier than other
ultrabooks it's a full pound heavier
than apple's 13-inch MacBook Air and
acer's aspire s3 and it's only slightly
thinner than the MacBook Pro lastly
while HP touts the spectres outer
gorilla glass panel is tough and scratch
resistant which it probably is it still
concerns me to have such a large piece
of unprotected glass on my laptop
now I haven't conducted any puncture or
shatter tests on our machine so my fears
of opening my laptop bag and finding it
full of broken glass may be completely
unfounded I sure hope so the specter is
definitely an eye-catching Ultrabook and
as our teardown shows its well-built has
solid hardware and is easy to work on
but it's also on the pricier end of the
Ultrabook market as of this taping an
entry-level Spectre with a core i5 CPU
four gigs of RAM and a 128 gig SSD
retails for $13.99 now upgrading to a
core i7 and a 256 gig SSD raises the
price to 1899 this is a full-featured
Ultrabook with a full-featured price for
TechRepublic I'm Bill Detweiler and this
has been a cracking open of the HP Envy
14 Spectre
