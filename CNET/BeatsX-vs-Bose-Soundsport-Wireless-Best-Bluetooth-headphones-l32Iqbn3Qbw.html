stand out in the search for the best
wireless earphones beats and Bose both
are $149 they share similar specs and
design so how do you decide which one is
right for you this is beats x vs bose
sound sport wireless let's start with
design and durability the beats have a
flat thicker wire that connects the
earbuds together and come with three
different tip designs in different sizes
bose have a rounded wire and you get one
type of wingtip in three sizes those
claims to be water and sweat resistant
while beats are not officially labeled
as such the beats honestly I really like
them because they have a little tiny
magnet on the bottom they clip in they
hang around my neck all day and in the
ear they also feel super light when
you're wearing them just don't make the
mistake I made and get the white because
the material is a little bit sticky so
it it does attract dirt picks up
everything huh sorry if the birds by
comparison are a lot larger than the
biggest you know they stick out of the
ear quite a bit but I did find like
thanks to these wingtips like they never
fell out when I was running or biking or
doing anything particularly active so I
wasn't afraid that they were gonna fall
out there is a clip at the back too
which is super useful I know I really
liked it because I could just clip it on
and then when I wanted to just drop him
down I didn't have to worry about they
would fall off my neck the remote was
positioned really well and that's
something that I didn't like that the
beats was that I just couldn't naturally
find my finger pulling on that remote
but I will save the clip you mentioned I
don't like the fact that it's not
attached to the wire yeah I know myself
and give me two days and that little
clip would have been lost
both up Bluetooth headphones that
connect to iOS or Android the beats have
apples w1 chip designed to pair quickly
with newer iOS devices Bose has NFC so
you can tap and pay Android phones
quickly to test the range we're gonna
walk out across this soccer field and
stop when the signal drops out
what what it's a little bit more still
going very jittery and cut then quite
make it to the halfway line but I go
further than I thought we had to do this
test multiple times because the results
were a toy it's consistent in general
the boys got further but the sound
completely cut out when the signal
dropped the beats cut out earlier but
the sound was intermittent and when I
turned around to face the phone I could
actually hear it clearly again and I got
a lot further both head phones have a
remote on the wire to adjust the volume
accept or reject calls skip tracks and
even summon your assistant text mom
I'll be home soon
so let's talk about sound quality
obviously this is one of the biggest
decision points in this comparison now I
really like the sound of the Bose when I
compare them to the beats these guys
sounded a lot more richer there was a
little bit more bass it was more
definition I could definitely hear
different parts of the track but I have
to say when it comes down to the design
these ones are a little bit more open so
it lets in a lot more exterior noise and
sounds which you know it's probably
safer for certain application I mean for
sure I think the beats just because of
the different tips you can get a lot
more sound isolation you won't have to
crank up the volume quite as high so in
that sense it might not be as rich but
you do get more of the sound itself
because you're not listening to ambient
noise now if you're out running I like
to hear what's going on around around me
because if there's a car coming for
example you want to be aware of that and
it's at that point it's a matter of
changing up the tips but I did feel like
those let in a little bit more so and
and the balance between the ambient and
the music was a little bit better with
those so I can have a total conversation
with you right now wearing you down
playing music and we'd be totally fine
here I would presume so all in all the
sound from the birds right
bates claims eight hours of battery life
while bose is six the beeps charge be a
lightning cable which works out if
you're already an iphone music and it's
a faster charge five minutes of charging
will give you two hours of playback
compare that to the Bose that charged
with microUSB a 15 minute quick charge
gets you only one hour of playback time
so yes in theory you can look at this
tiny little light indicator to figure
out how much battery you have left but I
never want to do that so I would have to
go open the phone and look at the
settings to figure out how much battery
had left which was really annoying
another annoying part of this was that I
never knew when it was parent when it
was not so sometimes it would drain the
battery and some to other times it would
just shut off on its own and it was kind
of a flip of the coin so frustrating so
what I did like about these a lot was
that as soon as you turn them on and put
them in your ear it keeps you just say
hey you have 60 percent battery left and
I'm like great I know exactly how much I
have sorry so good and the other thing
is you can also go into the companion
app and see that battery level as well
and what you can also do is see that
auto power off setting you can change
that so if you're forgetful like me and
you just don't turn them off manually
after you've finished your run or
whatever you can set 20 minutes you can
set an hour so you don't come back to it
next time in the battery's totally dead
like see your favorite thing and least
favorite thing about the bus go okay
putting me on the spot but my favorite
thing is sound quality to me that is the
most important thing about a headphone
if it doesn't sound good I'm not gonna
wear it
so sound wins for me and the least
favorite thing is the size of it like I
didn't honestly feel it until I wore
debates by comparison but now I know
it's bigger and it feels heavier oh
that's my least favorite thing but what
about you
I will counter that and say that my
favorite thing is the design for sure I
like that I can wear them all day and I
don't even notice them they're so light
my least favourite thing is that they're
not as intuitive as I would like it was
a lot of guesswork when they're paired
when they're not paired how much battery
I have left and I just I don't feel like
guessing yeah that point
well now it's up to you we want to know
what you think beats X oh boy sounds for
toilets let us know in the comments
below also let us know what else you
want us to compare right here</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
