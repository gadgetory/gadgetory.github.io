and Apple recently announced some of the
new features that we can expect to see
in iOS 5 4i devices when it's released
this fall but we have the developer
version so we wanted to show you some of
the hidden features in iOS 5 you might
not know about
now customization has always been one of
iOS his weaker points and they aren't
bringing widgets but there are other
ways to trick out your phone
how about keyboard shortcuts going to
general and your keyboard settings and
you can now create a shortcut you type
in that will display a phrase to make
life a whole lot easier apples also
improved the accessibility options that
can be helpful for all of us you can
turn on the LED flash for alerts but you
can also turn on custom vibrations on
your iPhone now it's not what you think
so you guys can stop giggling now go-to
sounds and find vibration patterns you
have the ability to enter and use
pre-made ones or create your own custom
vibration by tapping on the screen for a
contact that you know is more important
than others now on the iPad you can also
use a custom gesture to open different
menus on your screen by turning on
assistive touch at the moment you can't
assign it to unlock your screen or
launch any apps but it's probably coming
in the future and the multi-touch
gestures we've seen from previous builds
have returned in iOS 5 the Notification
Center is one of the big revamps and you
can create the alert style if it's more
important the option to view it in your
lock screen and how many notifications
show up at one time you also have the
option to purchase more ringtones or
alert tones in the preferences if you
check out the photo app it allows you to
create albums on your iDevice and also
move photos into different albums Safari
the web browser has a nice option that
allows you to open a new page in the
background instead of interrupting the
current window you're viewing and the
weather app has a panel for your local
weather instead of adding a new one for
every city you visit and for all you
sketchy people with something to hide
you will now be able to delete
individual calls from your call list
plus one of the biggest ones you can't
see right now iOS 5 supports 1080p video
playback which sets them up for better
video output directly to TV sets and
higher resolution displays for future I
devices now there's plenty of other
features buried in here but we wanted to
show you a few of them that you can
expect to see in the fall I'm Bryant on
with your first look at some of the
hidden features in iOS 5 use it wisely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
