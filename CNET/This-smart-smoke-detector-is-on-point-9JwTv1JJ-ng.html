and appliances here with the second
generation nest protect a $99 smoke and
carbon monoxide detector so as the
second generation of the nest protect
this model looks pretty similar it has
that same stainless steel mesh design
it's available in both white and black
finishes and it has the central on/off
button there in the middle but nest did
pare it down a little bit and you'll
find that it has more rounded edges and
a slimmer profile altogether setup is
pretty straightforward the app will ask
you a couple of questions and guide you
through the entire process it took me
about 10 minutes from start to finish
including basic installation which will
vary based on whether or not you got a
battery powered or a wired unit the one
I got was battery powered which made it
a little more straightforward so just
keep that in mind the in-app
functionality is really solid the nest
protect nest cam and Nest Learning
Thermostat all appears side-by-side so
if you have multiple nest products
they're really easy to access together
in the app you can also do integrations
with those products so if the nest
protect senses smoke or carbon monoxide
emergency their smoke your nest cam will
record a clip so that it captures the
security event that you can review at a
later time the nest protect also has an
if channel so you can do a lot of
different third-party integrations so if
you want your Philips hue bulb or lifx
bulb to flash red in the event of a
smoke or carbon monoxide issue it can do
that basic functionality works well too
as you know the first generation protect
had a feature called wave that was
recalled and was not reintroduced for
this second generation model but this
unit does have a feature that lets you
silence the alarm from your app I also
like that it has audio alerts it will
give you a heads-up if there's a
potential issue and a full-blown warning
if there's a real concern taken all
together the improved overall design
enhanced features including the remote
silence feature on the app and the
integrations with other nest products
and if to make the nest protect 2.0 a
really solid option for more check out
