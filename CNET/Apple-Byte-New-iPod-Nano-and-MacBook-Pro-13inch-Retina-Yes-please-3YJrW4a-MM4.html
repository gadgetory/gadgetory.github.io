welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
and the hot rumor this week is new
evidence of a 13-inch macbook pro with a
Retina display now digit times continues
to tap into its supply chain and claims
that Apple is back on track for retina
display 13-inch macbook pro after
reported manufacturing delays and now
has a chance to debut before October
this year to add more fuel to this fire
a geekbench to benchmark submitted late
last month identified as MacBook Pro
tend to appears to be the retina display
13 inch pro in question but has not been
confirmed now last month an online
battery test also identified an
unreleased computer known as MacBook Pro
10 to that was believed to be the same
machine the new macbook pro listed is
shown running a 2.9 gigahertz intel core
i7 ivy bridge processor with a specific
billed amount line but only for gigs of
ram it's geekbench score came in at 7806
which is lower than the current 15-inch
retina macbook pro but higher than early
2011 13-inch MacBook Pros so we'll just
wait and see if this will be the next
retina display computer now an iPod news
yes I said it iPod news the ipod nano
might be going retro according to
Japanese blog Macotakara they report the
new ipod nano will not be square shaped
like the current model instead the new
nano will allegedly have a rectangular
screen that will probably be a
touchscreen and we'll also have a home
but it's also rumored to feature a new
dedicated iTunes service bringing new
features and ditching ping wait you
don't remember ping oh my gosh ping
what's up dude I haven't seen you so
long like I'm Daniel well not that ping
but I pretty much hated the square nano
design a lot of people loved making it
into a watch nerd alert so if this is
legit I'll welcome it back with open
arms now Apple has also ceded the gold
master of OS 10 mountain lion to
developers this is the final version of
mountain lion that will be available
publicly to users some time in jail
by now there's a rumor date of July 19th
that hasn't been confirmed by anyone and
I know there's a lot of you that can't
wait for this cat to get out of the bag
i crack myself up sometimes alright in
that so great news apple recently pulled
all 39 of its products from EP removing
the green certification from its
products now EP is a non-profit group
backed by manufacturers and the US
Environmental Protection Agency the
decision might have been related to the
new design of the new Retina Display
MacBook Pros that have their batteries
glued into the case and can't be
disassembled for recycling cities like
our own San Francisco where we hug trees
and separate our compost have gone on
the record and said they will no longer
buy Apple products because they require
epeat computers now I know this isn't
the sexiest story it probably won't stop
all of you from buying new machines but
we'll see if they change their stance if
more cities do the same all right to the
quick bites a few key apps have new
updates the Google+ iOS app now includes
full iPad support integration of the new
Google+ events feature for picture
uploads and you can now join and start
hangouts directly in the app and even
stream it to your TV / airplay which is
pretty slick also the Twitter app
received an update with expanded tweets
improved search and my favorite new
feature the ability to now get
notifications from specific accounts
directly through the app instead of over
text messages now we've also talked
about Apple's I travel application
concept in the past and the Cupertino
kids have been granted the patent for
their NFC enabled I travel
transportation ticketing app that was
filed back in 2008 it's a very detailed
filing for implementation and used for I
travel and even with NFC being adopted
slowly it hints at the feature being
really taken seriously by Apple for the
future alright guys it's going to do it
for this week so it's a short one i'm
off to comic-con but we will return next
week with a fully loaded one email us at
the alpha beta cnet com I'll write you
back i'm brian Tong thanks for watching
we'll catch you guys next time for
another bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
