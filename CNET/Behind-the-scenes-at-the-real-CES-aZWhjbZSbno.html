cnet trailer I'm Emily Dreyfuss I'm
gonna give you a little tour thanks so
much for coming let's start out with the
kitchen as you know we here at seen I'd
like to be incredibly healthy so all we
eat are red vines I'll have one right
now um planner is pinched a lot of three
muskateers bars there are many those so
it's totally healthy oh you want one
great there's more where that came from
um also yeah we have oh these are my
favorites the butter cookies when things
really get dire in here and we're doing
my 25 live blogs all right like 15 of
those it was kind of a scary sight to
see well but the absolute most important
part of the kitchen area of the Cena
trailer these are delicious coffee it's
delivered to us twice a day from a very
friendly lady who's a local in Vegas um
and it's sometimes warm sometimes not
some warm but who cares we're not picky
in the cnet trailer then
sandwiches yum yum yum yum yeah that's
what I thought on day 10 these are the
that these sandwiches won the best of
CES sandwich award they are made with
croissants it's kind of magic also I
think things we just got a little bit
low-tech around here at the end of the
week um oh this I want to show you is
the East Wing of the cnet trailer it's
inhabited by not seen a tights actually
these are game spotters game spotters in
the wild um so we just let them hang out
there cuz the trailer is so vast and
huge there's room for everybody it's so
huge in fact that we have a backyard
look at our porch so it's made out of
rusted steel it's a little rickety
sometimes I I struggle late at night
that I think it's pretty cute and it has
the it's the best place for viewing the
only piece of art that we have in the
Cena trailer we're really into
aesthetics around here as you know we
like fine lines and design and as you
can see ya this is a great example of
modern design but really the best part
is the balloon
seen that balloon sometimes late at
night when it's windy in Vegas I'll be
walking back from the bathroom like lost
suddenly all I can see or other bloggers
around and then we Rumble my home with
this see that balloon it's pretty
wonderful okay come back inside so I can
show you more magic we have to be a
little bit quiet because our cnet
editors are hard at work but they've
given me leave to show one image of them
really fast there they are okay no back
to me oh that didn't happen you did not
just hear a belch from the pit but
really that is where the actual magic
happens there's no bedroom the cnet
trailer so this is the stand in this is
our lovely white board as you can see we
don't use that because there's something
called a computer where you don't have
to write with pen you can actually type
and then email it to each other i'm not
sure you knew that as a scene that fan
um we have trash cans they are made of
cardboard who knew that was a thing when
you're done with that you just owe the
entire trashcan away oh and what are we
doing in this room oh hey guys I didn't
see you there well let me take you a
tour of the west wing of the cnet
trailer come on oh here we have the West
Wing it's pretty awesome digs right
that's what I thought when I first saw
where we were going to be spending 24
hours of our time let me show you the
best part about the West Wing the view
pretty awesome right
come on let me show you some more of the
west wing of the trailer in here we have
what once was a bathroom it's now
utility closet check out these boxes
come on let me show you another bathroom
this trailer is so amazing we've got two
bathrooms that don't work check it out
clawfoot tub jacuzzi it's all in here
guys we really crank up the tunes late
at night and we all have a party in here
it's pretty awesome come on let me show
you some more of our cnet trailer right
here you've got the sink that doesn't
work this is where we like to complain
that we can't pour our coffees down and
so at the end of the long day of editing
all you've got are empty and half empty
and mostly full coffee cups laying
around we don't know where to dump them
so we just leave them everywhere anyway
that's all we've got for you guys today
thanks for joining us at the scenic crib
yeah trailer I'm so glad we got to show
you what the real CES is like you
thought that there were lots of vendors
you thought it was all like in some sort
of magical Vegas ladies you were
incubating damn it it all happens in a
double wide in the mashing lot mm-hmm
all right thanks for joining us we gotta
go now see you later hi bye be careful
