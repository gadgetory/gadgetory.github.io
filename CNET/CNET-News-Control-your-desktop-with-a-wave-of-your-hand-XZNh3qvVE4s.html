wag of your finger leap motion is making
it happen the goal is to fundamentally
transform how people interact with
computers and and to do so in the same
way that the mouse did here you're
seeing a you're seeing my fingertip and
this is sort of the direction of my
finger here's one of the path is tracing
out and of course everything's
everything's in full 3d so you can see
you know we're tracking that too we're
not just tracking the fingertips we're
also tracking the tracking the entire
hands so here's my entire hand you can
see very small motions of my fingertips
are very easy to pick up of course you
can do more than one hand we can do
other objects there's like my arm or you
know here's here's chopstick right here
subtle motions are immediately occurring
on the screen and so that there's no
there's no distance between sort of
thought and response this is a social
networking data so you see lots of
little connections between the the
people with little triangles and sort of
what's going on here and generalist like
this would be very complicated to
visualize and very difficult to interact
with and here we're interacting with it
as it was sort of a physical thing maps
just got a lot more interesting we have
way more accuracy than it's probably
necessary for pinch to zoom but you get
a really good responsive sort of touched
like feeling I can zoom in and I can go
up and down I go left and right but also
I can also do of course all these things
simultaneously in San Francisco i'm
