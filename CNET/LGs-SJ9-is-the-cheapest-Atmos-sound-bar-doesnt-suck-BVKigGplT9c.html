the LGS j9 is a Dolby Atmos sound bar
it's capable of generating overhead
effects in the newest movies it has two
dedicated drivers on top which bounce
sound off the ceiling at you at 750
dollars the LG is now the cheaper sound
bar we've seen with the technology and
it adds some features the Samsung rival
doesn't have first up is chromecast
built-in which lets you stream music
from your phone or laptop to one or
multiple speakers as well as from with
Google home speaker secondly the LG can
stream audio from your LG TV over
Bluetooth the sound bar can also pass a
4k HDR signal and decode Dolby true HD
and high res music but sadly DTS support
is limited to DTS surround given that
the main speakers are located in this
thin two and a quarter inch high front
panel the sound relies heavily on
support from the 12-inch square wireless
sub this makes the sub Barry directional
and so you need to place it as close to
the sound bar as you can otherwise it
can sound bumi and make music sound very
disjointed FX movies though they sound
great the illusion of height is rather
good and the subwoofer is capable
excellent slam if you want dedicated
surround effects you can also buy a
separate surround package for a
reasonable 130 bucks as good as a sound
bar is though and its price you're
probably better off with the more
refined sounding Samsung hwk 850</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
