things that we're putting on phones and
small tablets and today it's not even a
complete view but to get the full view I
need to talk to you about universal apps
because we are building a wide family of
universal apps that will round out the
experience on phones small tablets and
PCs and what we're doing is creating a
family of apps that will be built in
that will give our customers everything
they need for modern productivity so I'm
going to show you a series of these apps
I'm going to show them to you on the
phone and the pc and i want you to think
about how they make the experience
rationalized and easy as you go from
device to device and they offer that
mobility of experience that Terry was
describing the first one I'm going to
focus on is office word excel and
powerpoint will be included in Windows
10 on phones and small tablets and
they're going to deliver a consistent
highly rich and highly complete office
experience on those devices but I am
going to show you a PowerPoint and so
once again you'll see I open PowerPoint
it's that familiar office look with the
recent list right there I'm going to
open a very large and complex PowerPoint
presentation here we go and I want to
point out that recent document lists it
does Rome from device to device from
version of office to version of office
so if I'm using full win32 office on my
pc and editing a document in my onedrive
or onedrive for business that recent
list roams across devices when I open up
this PowerPoint presentation i want to
show you once again here on the bottom
of the screen we brought the familiar
office ribbon right to the phones at bar
experience and i can switch here to
transition view to slide show view or to
review view just as I did on the phone
but I'm not going to do that instead i
want to show you how great a powerpoint
presentation can look when it's
projected using any of the recent phones
which have hugely powerful processors
and very fixed parts so in this case i'm
going to pan through this and you'll see
watch the screen how smooth the
animations and transitions are
on slide animation I'm going to keep
going you'll see the hardware
accelerated slide transitions and then
again a slide animation and once again
hardware accelerated transitions slide
animation our outlook team has been
working on a new universal app version
of outlook mail and outlook calendar
which will be on the phone tablets and
PCs you'll see here's that same code
it's literally the same code written to
our universal app platform I was showing
it to on the phone and here it is on the
PC it looks very similar on the PC it
has this personalizable image which I've
set to my son and I let me open the
calendar and you saw on the pc i did
this in a familiar way just by clicking
the calendar right down there in the
bottom something lots of Outlook users
are accustomed to and here you can see
the calendar is rich and attractive it's
familiar it's high performance I can
scroll around all these items on any
device that you own even cross-platform
devices phones where you're taking
pictures we have a 1 Drive app and its
built-in on Windows devices that uploads
your images to onedrive on the PC we're
sinking your images down from onedrive
to the pc so they're available locally
offline as cloud this photo app is
aggregating together all of those photos
from all of those devices and giving you
one simple view of your collection three
more apps i'm going to show you i'm
going to go even faster so you get a
sense of overview the first one is our
people app which we're implementing
again as a universal app one time across
these devices it a grits all the people
you care about across social networks
and it lets you perform quick actions
like making a call or sending a message
or doing a Skype video call next up our
music experience which we're continuing
to evolve across all these devices and
what you'll see here is how we're using
the cloud to add a song to a playlist
and then it shows up magically on all
your devices that's because in about a
month or two months we're going to add
support to our system for you to put
your music collection in onedrive and
have your collection stored in the cloud
so you can make changes to your
playlists or to your collection on
device and they're automatically
reflected on all your devices next up i
want you to see our maps experience
which starts with some cortana
integration cortana has recognized the
traffic is slow so you could open the
Maps app on your PC find an alternate
route send it to your phone and then
when you use the turn-by-turn directions
to drive somewhere and you arrive you
can have Cortana remember where you
parked your car and then when your
events / she's there to help you find
where you parked so that is a quick tour
of our family of universal apps</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
