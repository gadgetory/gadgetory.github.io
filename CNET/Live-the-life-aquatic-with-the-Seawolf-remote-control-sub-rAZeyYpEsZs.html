nen Gang Show floor at Computex 2015 in
Taipei
now aerial drones might be all the rage
but if you thought that Gordon was
clearly the superior of the Tracy
brothers and that Thunderbird 4 was the
best vessel then he might get a kick out
of the sea wolf from TT robotics the Sea
Wolf is basically a remote control
submarine it can go down to a depth of
five to eight meters and clock up to
about three-and-a-half kilometers per
hour you're not setting speed records
but you are going at a nice pace to get
some good footage and that's the whole
point of it the front of it takes a
mount for your GoPro three or four so
you're getting HD underwater footage
just from the boy you're staying dry on
the bank I guess don't be too fooled by
the name there's actually two different
models of it one's only for freshwater
whereas the sea wolf fpv does sea water
and fresh water and that's the one you
want to take out to the ocean
battery life is are not too bad 50
minutes and if you're using the
ocean-going fpv version you've got a
separate boy that kind of rides along
the surface up top and helps make sure
you get a good remote control signal the
GoPro enable that sea wolf is launching
in August and it's probably going to
come in at around $1,000 u.s. no formal
pricing for UK or Australia yet so it's
an expensive toy but by having a look
here I'd have to say it's a pretty damn
fun one I'm Nikki Lee with sinner comm
and you can get more competition news
and videos on the website</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
