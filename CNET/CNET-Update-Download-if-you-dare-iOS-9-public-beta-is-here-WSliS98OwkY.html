and facebook gives you more control of
the newsfeed hi I'm Bridget Carey this
is your cnet update adventurous Apple
users can now download a beta version of
iOS 9 which is the upcoming operating
system for iPhones and iPads apple
released its public beta on Thursday
afternoon and this is the first time
that the public can download a beta of a
major Apple update before you had to be
registered as a developer now Apple
showed off iOS 9 in June but the final
version won't be coming out until
sometime in the fall usually it's when
the next iPhones released the update
will mean big changes for iPad users
with split view multitasking and
floating videos for picture-in-picture
action and app windows that just slide
out without you leaving the other app
iOS 9 also has public transit directions
in maps more features and notes and
Cirie has expanded search features just
know that if you do go on apple's
website to download it this is a beta
meaning Apple's still working out the
kinks and there will be bugs apple also
release the beta of the OS 10 Mac
operating system known as El Capitan
switching gears to social media Facebook
is making changes to the newsfeed
facebook has given you power in the
settings to say who you want to see up
burst on top of your feed you know like
people you actually care about why
because Facebook's newsfeed can be
frustrating although you may be friends
with 900 people the algorithm really
only shows you posts from about 200
people and pages that you interact with
most and it has this formula to
calculate what it thinks you think is
most interesting even if it's an old
post anyway now you can take back some
control from the algorithm in the
updated newsfeed preferences you can
select the people and pages you always
want to see these settings are now in
the Facebook iOS app and it's rolling
out in the coming weeks to Android and
the desktop in other app news the
meerkat live video streaming app just
added new features and it's making a
bigger push on facebook to stand apart
from the more popular periscope meerkat
now lets you broadcast with someone a
feature called cameo litter invite
someone to take over your broadcast from
their phone but they
only can take over for 60 seconds and
since periscope is owned by Twitter
meerkat is tying in with facebook to
promote your broadcast with your friends
and your meerkat streams will stay alive
in a library where anyone can look up
your old streams but you'll choose which
stay public meanwhile t-mobile continues
to spice up the mobile carrier battle in
the u.s. in its latest move to stand
apart from the competition it's allowing
customers to use their phones in Mexico
and Canada without any roaming charges
and customers can call Mexican and
Canadian numbers from the US without
paying any extra fees that starts next
week on July fifteenth that's it for
this tech news update but there's always

York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
