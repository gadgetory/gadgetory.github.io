like there's so much about the energy
how do you take that energy and amplify
it in a way that sort of translates what
the person's feeling and what they
trying to Express
we're looking at a part of the music
extech program which is our ongoing set
of collaborations with music artists
where we use our technology and really
interesting and innovative ways so today
we're here with Alison Wunderland and
her team and we're revealing what their
new stage show is gonna look like for
the Fall Microsoft actually approached
me about potentially working with me on
visuals and I'm a big fan of what
Microsoft does especially with artists
and on the creative side so the way it
works is if we got the Microsoft Kinect
cameras so just like the video games it
scans your body and you can interpret
that to create graphics and so he placed
two of these cameras one really close up
front so we can see the facial
expressions we can see the hands
reaching out playing with the dials and
really get up close with a DJ the one
behind her is a bit further back so the
in that case we can catch the whole body
the Kinect is coming in with the depth
cam and it's letting us instead of
putting effects on top of a camera feet
it's letting us literally change her
into fire and so we have ten different
effects it's really easy for the DJ to
press buttons and activate all these
cool visual effects inside the visual
for the stage it's all touchscreen so
you just press a few buttons you move a
few sliders and the rest is moving
automatically through the programming so
we get a lot of performance power out of
the surface yeah we were really
impressed with the surface book because
at first we expected to have to run all
these visuals on a big powerful computer
and we started testing on the surface
book initially and it could handle
anything we were throwing at it so yeah
it's a it's a powerful little computer
it's just like an another element to add
to an experience of his show honestly I
wanted a part of my brain to be out
there for people to see and hear at the
same time working with somebody like
Alice in Wonderland in
amazing part of our collaborative
experiences where we were able to bring
together connect and surface and her
desire to really connect with the people
coming to her show it's just a really
good medium for 4 TDM and this type of
this type of scenario you know you don't
know what where shows are going to be in
10 years so so to be able to like be one
of the people to say yes to something
and develop something really early is
super cool technology's always moving
and I want to move with it
