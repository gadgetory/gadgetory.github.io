the v40 thin queue its third premium
phone of the year next to the v35 thin
queue and g7 right away you'll notice
that the most eye-catching thing about
the v40
is that it has a total of five cameras
three rear-facing cameras and two
front-facing cameras the rear setup
includes a 12 megapixel standard lens
with optical image stabilization a 16
megapixel wide-angle lens and a 12
megapixel telephoto lens with 2x zoom
with these two other cameras you can
take a photo with a wide field of view
so you could fit more content in each
frame and you can also take dramatic
bouquet style portraits speaking of
portraits the v40 has a bunch of
lighting tools too similar to the iPhone
which adds studio light qualities to
your photos one tool called triple shot
takes a picture on all three cameras
with a single tap of the shutter it
saves it as three separate images as
well as a moving gif
there's also sinha shot which enables
you to make hypnotising animated cinema
graphs that you can share on the front
are a 5 megapixel and an 8 megapixel
camera together they take portrait shots
as well and you can adjust the
background blur after you take a photo
you'll also get google lens to look up
objects and landmarks and native AI
features that optimize camera settings
besides the camera the v40 has a sizable
six point four inch display a
water-resistant design a headphone jack
and a google assistant shortcut button
which you can't reprogram to watch
anything else unfortunately if you love
photography the v40 is worth considering
for its shooting options and high-end
specs but if you're more of a casual
user the phone can be a bit overwhelming
there are two AI systems baked in here
for instance and you may end up using
some tools like Sena shot only once in a
while
also when it comes to image quality a
phone like the iPhone 10s max takes
comparable and at times superior photos
but it's more straightforward to use
lastly keep in mind that other Android
phones including the pixel three and one
plus sixty are expected right around the
corner so if you can wait a bit then
wait all your options until after
