make a phone call during a flight the
Federal Communications Commission is
considering lifting a ban on using

possibility it would still be up to the
airlines to set the rules some may allow
people to use their phones others may
have a quiet no phone seating zone but
to make a call you may also have to pay
an extra fee just like paying for
in-flight Wi-Fi it's not easy for
retailers to compete against Amazon
during the holiday shopping season but
Walmart is stepping up its game and
launching several promotions to lure you

available online Thursday morning even

retrial to determine the additional
damages Samsung owed the Xbox one
