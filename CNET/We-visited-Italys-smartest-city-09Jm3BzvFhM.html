rebuilt its churches and homes after
destructive earthquakes and wars that
date back to before the Roman Empire but
this ancient town is transforming itself
into a city of the future and in the
process beating Silicon Valley at its
own game
I've come to Mussina's town swear to
watch the popular noon bell tower show
my tour guide is University of Messina
professor Antonio Puglia people but he's
given me a tour of a future city I point
at the church without changing
practically deposition the system
realized that this is the main church
and provides the information on the
church itself I'm getting a glimpse of
an experiment of smart men it's a
university led effort to try to
transform Messina and other Sicilian
towns like Catania into the smartest of
the smart cities so what does it mean to
be a smart connected city this is Sicily
after all not Silicon Valley and there
aren't a bunch of delivery drones or
self-driving cars and we thought yeah
but Sicily does have sensors lots of
them in lots of places they're tucked
away in some parking lots bus stop
streetlights and buildings this is one
of the boxes that we have distributed in
the city about 35 of these boxes that
you can see us on the map the idea is to
build from the ground up a citywide
network of sensors including tapping
into the ones in people's phones we want
to use the same unifying technology to
dialogue and interact with all of these
objects the data like temperature and
whether a taxi is nearby can then be
used to make life better in the city
more efficient
for example there's a camera in the
airport that shows if it's crowded so
you can decide if you need more time to
get through security there is a thermal
camera inside that trust me to real-time
information that you will see also on
the website of what money there's also
an app for mapping potholes so the city
can make quicker repairs so this phone
just recorded a pothole this map here
real-time actually shows you where the
pothole was reported what time and if
enough of them get reported then the
city will go and fix it there's a
prototype of a smart garbage bin that
can tell the city it needs emptying when
the trash reaches a certain level
there's a solar-powered bus stop that
charges your phone monitors air quality
and tracks traffic pattern do the buses
get better and make the buses better you
can find an open parking space in
reserve it while we are driving then if
we decide to park there app will
indicate the available parking place in
your Bible we are so we can reserve and
they will drive us to the place the
technology is magnetic sensor that is
developed with the components produced
by STMicroelectronics now I know what
machine is doing may sound a little
familiar after all you've probably
already used an app to hail a ride or to
pay for parking but this is one of the
first times that someone's really tried
to bring it all together the key is all
the open data from the sensors and the
resulting services are accessible
through a single site that's where smart
may is ahead of the game so one single
access point that can be used and
personalized it person by person so in
that case I really believe that it would
be part of our normal life and people
will realize that they can really live
better the project already has partners
including chip makers developers and the
government smart may is still in the
prototype phase but they've proven they
can make it work we have now this kind
of technology we have
this kind is level of knowledge in our
university and also because our national
government has decided only now to put
the money in this field the local
government has committed about 13
million euros to tech projects like
smart cities now they have to get
ordinary people to buy into it
so you have to convince them that this
service can really improve their life so
they are in some sense force or obliged
to use these services as a something
normal one problem is that less than a
fifth of residents are using their
phones to access city services this also
seems like a massive privacy scandal
just waiting to happen though it's
something the team says they're mindful
of
but despite these hurdles Messina and
Catania are pulling ahead in the smart
city race many bigger cities are taking
a more conservative approach by focusing
on individual projects instead of
connecting an entire city Chicago is
digitally mapping its underground to
prevent construction accidents while
Louisville is using sensors to listen
for nearby alarms to respond to fires
quick
the fact is it's challenging to make big
changes in a big city you have to make
some choices you can't do it where is it
that you have the maximum impact how do
you make when you talk about it relevant
to people and not threatening but
welcoming and that's what workin still
it's odd that in Silicon Valley the
cities that house Facebook Google Apple
and Twitter haven't yet become
futuristic connected cities sure there
are driverless cars and you can use your
phone to pay for parking meters but
there's no single way to access at all
so why is this place in the edge of
Sicily on the verge of becoming one of
the world's first truly smart cities
well one reason is the government which
is going to spend millions of euros and
political capital and make it happen
the other is that technology is better
than it's ever been but it's not a
guaranteed success if people don't use
this then it's kind of a loss but that's
not going to stop them from trying
