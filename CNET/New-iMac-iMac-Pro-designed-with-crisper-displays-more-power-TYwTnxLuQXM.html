bunch of new updates but they're all
under the hood still there's a lot
that's been amped up most notably the
move to Intel's cable ayk CPUs which is
the code name for Intel's current
seventh generation of core I'd ships the
21.5 inch IMAX can now get up to 32 gigs
of ram in the bigger 27-inch IMAX get up
to 64 gigs of RAM which is pretty much
what high-end content creators are
looking for these days the built in AMD
Radeon graphics get an update too and
USBC continues its march across the
computer universe with IMAX adding two
of these ports to the back end
Thunderbolt 3 support the 4k and 5k
Retina displays on the IMAX are also
brighter and Apple says they can now
display up to 1 billion colors if you're
looking for something a little more
different Apple also teased the new iMac
coming by the end of the year and it's
called
the iMac pro it looks like a standard
iMac but it's in a darker space gray
color not the lighter silver of the
standard IMAX oh yeah and it's
completely different on the inside too
with pro level Intel Xeon processors
including crazy 18 core models and AMD
Radeon Vega graphics it'll even support
up to 128 gigs of ram apple says the
iMac pro is the most powerful Mac ever
and it's going to start at a
surprisingly modest $4,999 at least
modern buy high-end desktop standards
you'll be able to get that by the end of
2017</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
