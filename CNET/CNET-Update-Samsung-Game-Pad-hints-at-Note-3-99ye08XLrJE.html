next note I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update when Samsung announced
details on the Galaxy s4 smartphone the
company also unveiled some new
accessories like the gamepad it's a
video game control pad that attaches to
the galaxy s4 and other smartphones it
uses a bluetooth connection but here's
what's interesting if you go to the
Samsung website to find out more about
this controller it says the gamepad will
work with phones that have screens with
4 inches to as big as six point three
inches but Samsung doesn't have a phone
yet with a six point three inch screen
the biggest phone now is the note tooth
that's a five and a half inch screen so
this could mean Samsung's planning the
note 3 to be even larger does the role
need a 6.3 inch phablet and more
importantly well pockets be able to
handle a phone that big there's a
revolution brewing in the cable
television industry verizon fios is
hoping to convince media companies that
it should only pay fees for a channel if
their subscribers actually watch that
channel for more than five minutes right
now they pay a fee for every single
subscriber this report comes from The
Wall Street Journal but it's not just
verizon that wants the system to change
cablevision recently sued by a calm
because it didn't think it was spared to
be forced to pay for less popular via
comm channels in an all-or-nothing
bundle if these television providers get
their way don't expect your TV bill to
being cheaper but maybe it could
stabilize cable costs or companies might
be able to afford to offer you a few
more perks google reader is shutting
