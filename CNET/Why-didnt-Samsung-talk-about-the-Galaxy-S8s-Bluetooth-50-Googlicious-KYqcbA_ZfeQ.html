Google issues for all the things people
you can think of the Galaxy s8 is still
a hot topic because surprise it's an
Android phone so let's just start there
and let's start with all of you
oversensitive fans who thought I was
hating on the Galaxy s8 guess what I
praised it multiple times called it the
best looking phone and a great phone for
Samsung fans but you still can't take it
what someone just says one thing
critical about the phone you want grow a
pair now Samsung moved the fingerprint
sensor to the back we know this because
their plans to embed it in the front
panel didn't come together in time a lot
of you in the comments made a point to
say they want you to use face unlock but
to Samsung really want you to use it for
everything recent videos have proven
that you can unlock an essay as long as
you have a picture of that person's face
yeah that's not secure at all
now even Samsung themselves admitted
that facial recognition is less rigorous
than fingerprints and it cannot be used
for samsung pay so now it feels like
there's different biometrics handling
different things
the one thing Samsung should have been
bragging about was the addition of
Bluetooth 5.0 that was buried in the
spec sheet it's the first smartphone
with 5.0 inside of it on planet earth
with even better sound quality twice the
speed and four times the range which
means you can stay connected from a lot
further away from your phone and how
about pushing two sets of wireless
headphones at the same time your phone
can't do that either like no phone can
do that except for the s8 right now now
there's no surprise here but just in
case you wanted to try the Galaxy s8 it
won't work with your gear VR VR heads
tried it and only got an error message
unless use a workaround for phones
running nougat and root access that's
not available on the s8 right now so
Samsung is pretty committed to its gear
VR platform and that makes sense
now Bixby is one the new software
features for the new s8 but a bunch of
smarty pants from xda-developers have
pulled Bixby and Samsung's new launcher
from the galaxy s 8 for you to install
on other Samsung phones there's no route
needed you'll just need a Samsung device
like the s7 runny nougat and run the
installation process to get the cleaner
and the new app drawer and more now that
also means you can get access to the new
s8 stock wallpapers like this starry
night sand dune I know there's plenty of
you that love this stuff so go to this
link and get them all and if you want to
finally say we're number one Android is
now the world's most popular operating
system overtaking Windows now according
to StatCounter
looking at combined usage across
desktops laptops tablets and smartphones
android usage hit thirty seven point
nine three percent just edging out
windows thirty seven point nine one
percent it's really a technological
milestone since Microsoft has held its
position as the worldwide OS market
leader since the 80s and a huge
breakthrough for Android that had a
global internet usage share of just two
point four percent five years ago now
StatCounter only measures Internet
connected devices which eliminates
computers that might be used offline for
a specialty task but Windows still
dominates both laptops and desktop with
an 84 percent market share so now you
can tell all those stats your friends or
impress that special someone
alright let's get to some of your
reactions to the galaxy s 8 I asked you
about Joey Colgan said I think the
galaxy s 8 is the first non iPhone
smartphone in a while that makes me wish
this was out back in October so I could
have bought it instead because this is
the future of smartphones that dudes
hashtag team Samsung now Fabien Torres
writes in with the three things that let
me down about the s8 are the placement
of the fingerprint sensor no dual lens
camera and battery size that's fair
enough
my t gia king writes in with I was one
of the not convinced I really like the
phone but once you get past the screen
size it's really hard to argue why not
buy the galaxy s7 edge so you're telling
me size doesn't matter
alright that's going to do it for this
week you can email me at Google issues
at cnet.com or to me at brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for some more of that
