bat you mud and rock types move along
nothing here for you to see you see see
net those tech reviews and everyday
reviews we're not going to go off-road
and check the trail rating on this guy
that's not what we do well maybe a
little I'm talking to the 80% of you who
buy these things because you want them
to be mall rated this isn't just a cute
little Suzuki with a chunky square body
this is a Jeep it's the real deal and
along the way you make some sacrifices
the first of which is it's the only
American car in production that still
looks like an 88 now let's go inside now
the odd battle between trail rated and
Krissie continues inside this vehicle
you've got a big old serious transfer
case lever down here and all handy gear
shift that's normally a 6-speed manual
by the way we have the 5-speed automatic
in this car and you got some simple big
round gauges in front of you and lots of
big mae√≠n size things to hang on to but
then the prissy kicks in little BS like
the little since 1941 embossed in 1941
typeface I don't need that now what are
these Tonka truck air vents here and all
this chrome and there's chrome
everywhere we've got controls on the
wheel and voice come in and power locks
and power windows and power mirrors and
you can get automatic temperature
control and there's a big mishmash of
here of trail meats shopping mall here's
your base head unit it's okay it's kind
of what I would get in this car I would
not bump up the either 1000 to 1800
bucks more for a six and a half inch
touchscreen unit which has Garmin
navigation we've seen before it's
childishly simple but highly rated and
depending which of those two systems you
pick up you'll end up getting Bluetooth
and streaming audio and some voice
recognition or not skip the LCD it
doesn't belong in any vehicle that you
can reduce to nothing more than a
chassis with a roll bar around your head
now outside the Rubicon there's more
evidence of the weird split personality
of a modern Jeep first of all notice the
hinge here at the base of the windshield
yes the windshield as in dansou view our
will fold flat when you're driving
around the Serengeti and want a mouthful
of bugs the problem is because of modern
safety specs this thing has to be bolted
down so you've got to remove by my count
18 bolts before this thing can fold down
on these nice little bumpers and clip on
the other hand the hood folds all the
way back to give you a great engine
access when you crap out in the boonies
the problem is nothing prevents this
from getting a huge dent from the
windshield header now that's a pizza
technology this thing could use and
notice when you go to lift that hood
it's secured only by to external rubber
clamp downs and then a quick latch
underneath no interior lock so when you
need to steal a battery for your car
this is the one you want to look for in
a parking lot now luckily a Wrangler
still has all kinds of open top options
you've got this sort of t-top deal - the
t it's two plastic panels that unhitch
from inside and come clear nice overhead
space and of course the rear part this
whole cap comes off as well but it
requires a few bolts be removed you can
also pull the doors easily on one of
these guys in fact you can still get
them with half doors and plastic windows
but unfortunately to have easy to remove
doors
you lose door checks you have door stops
these canvass things but the door
doesn't lock anywhere so your shins are
going to look like hell as long as you
drive one of these now big improvement
in the Wrangler for 2012 it goes from
the dog motor it had for the last
handful of years to Chrysler's
well-respected Pentastar v-6 this is a
3.6 liter v6 variable valve timing it's
a modern engine that's going to crank
out 268 horse and 260 foot-pounds of
torque gets this guy up to 60 in six
point seven seconds quite respectable
while delivering a 17 21 mpg base
gearboxes 6-speed manual as you should
order or you can whistle
out and get the five-speed Automatic
like we showed you a lot of things in
this engine Bayer laid out differently
than a normal car to make it ready for
anything you've got this reverse mounted
alternator so splashes hit the water
proof back not the pulley nose front you
got a big high airbox up here of course
to let you forward streams without
getting drunk on water speaking of
getting drunk I like this you got an
easy pullout overflow coolant bottle I
guess you can fill up in streams on a
bad day I would turn that into a sneaky
bourbon snatch okay now underway our
little friend rides on 17 alloys and 32
inch tires so you've got a Jones in this
vehicle you're probably not used to in
the Honda Civic you trade it in to buy
it there's also a knobby thing that goes
on at low speeds you got to get used to
because this kind of a tread on a tire
makes up sound and feeling at low speeds
over on this side you've got your
electronic axle lock for front or rear
or both there's also a button here
called sway bar that will electrically
disconnect the sway bar when you're
really out in the chunky stuff climbing
rocks or what-have-you
you can disconnect the sway bar so you
get greater articulation on the front
wheels they can have an extreme degree
of difference in height of what they're
gripping while not tilting the body with
them I'll tell you the thing is
surprisingly bolted together you don't
hear as many rattles and such as you'd
expect from something with all these
panels and all these kind of sheetmetal
apparatus and that spare hanging off the
back
but enough of this freeway driving let's
go do what 80% of you will not do 80% of
the time and get in the mud
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
