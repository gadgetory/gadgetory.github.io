time it's time for another episode of
the 359 episode 116 with Roger Cheng and
Joan souls Minh good afternoon good
afternoon Wow I think it's 117 by the
way huh is it a 117 00 episode yeah I
don't know that's your job you gotta try
fess up well I think it's 17 teen mom I
don't shortchange us but one episode but
what Ben would prefer it this is a way
Ben wanted it um thank you all for
joining us we've got a lot to talk about
Google just finished up it's it's big
hardware event lots of products phones
chromecast ohm speaker we are still
talking sex very exciting kind of I
don't knows what is a very excite it's
kind of a sleepy it's kind of a sleepy
event I felt like they had a lot of
products they have a lot to be excited
about but I felt like it guy kind of
bogged down with a lot of right now only
Google would kick off its presentation
with like a three-point example of how
its deep learning has evolved hahaha two
or three days way this is the hard work
okay like where the actual products but
where's the aluminium like like the
Shaffer daddy where are those give me
the shiny stuff like it like a look at
not not this kind of esoteric deep
thinking AI that's gonna take over our
world whatever don't tell me how to get
creeped out by you Skynet show me pretty
sure exactly alright so as always if you
have any questions leave in the comment
section Brian will pick out the best and
will we will try to answer them all and
so let's get started with the podcast so
right now we're gonna record the podcast
will be back in three minutes and 59
seconds from 32 welcome to the 259 where
we talk about the top tech news of the
day oh crap we want to throw in a writer
Jane and I'm Joanie salzman so Google is
ready to turn over a new leaf the
company has introduced the pixel and
pixel x el sol to high-end superphones
designed specifically to combat the
iphone 7 and Galaxy s7 and is a break
from the Nexus line of phones the more
interesting thing though is that the
fact they spend so much time not only
time of the
but talking about the Google assistant
talk about the the AI that would power
this phone I mean was it the smart move
to kind of like go the hardware event in
the lead with talking about algorithms
well Google is definitely a hardware
software marriage company they have
their hardware so that you use their
software so it does make sense that they
focus a lot on all the things you can do
with their phones because that's what
they exist to do right now is this a
phone that would be interesting to you I
noticed when they had a big like pop up
bubble of all the things you could ask
the assistant in the phone yeah some of
them are things I can't even imagine
myself ever asking like help me pack for
a trip to New Orleans can you ever ask
huh think of asking your phone no but
that now has me interested in good New
York ones do you think are you going to
be tempted none really I mean it's it
seems like a decent phone a couple
things only holding it back is it's an
exclusive for verizon I mean get it
unlocked through google but if you want
to get through carrier you hit by two
verizon and it's actually there's this
probably bloatware they're gonna be like
the usual verizon stuff I don't know
it's you know I'm an iphone user and a
samsung user I don't know if this is
enough to kind of get me to change my
ways I'm curious what you think of the
much-touted camera do you think it's
really differentiator yes sir oh stephen
Shankland had the exclusive deep dive on
that camera the software that they use
to kind of stabilize images make the the
camera shutter work faster image
processing better it's definitely
impressive the they touted EXO scores
it's it's I guess rated now is the best
camera ever but not on a phone on the
phone on the phone sorry but they didn't
that the results haven't come in yet for
the iphone 7 plus so we're not sure yet
if it's the very very best it's the best
rated right now for now they did they
omitted that fact right they just said
it's the best ever but i don't it's
interesting enough but i like a lot of
people like a camera isn't enough they
gave me the switch phones right away
there were a couple subtle jabs at the
Jack presents yes yeah they still have
the headphone jack which makes a lot of
people happy no I you know I thought for
second they're gonna just make the jump
to us bc but fortunately they kept a
jack alright so today wasn't all about
google reuters reported that yahoo had
built-in tools to in its mail client to
allow the NSA to sniff all incoming
emails that's hundreds of millions of
messages which could make it the largest
effort to bulk collect web data in
history so that's you know for Yahoo
that's they just came off the hack
they've got this revelation now that
mean it seems like just one hit after
another right it does and it makes you
wonder what verizon's yeah yeah right
like I mean they're already kind of
reports that Verizon was a little
nervous after the hack came out and now
now this it's just sort of more bad news
in it I don't know how this reflects
upon Marissa Mayer's tenure SEO there
yeah it's getting rough in her final
days that's for sure yeah so I don't
know it's uh we'll see if there's any
other revelations from yahoo I feel like
it the last couple month it's become
sort of a dumping ground for for bad
news but which do you think is more
damaging to company's reputation at
something like a hack mr. massive hack
or cooperation with uh with the US
government monitoring that's a really
great question i mean it i think there's
a lot of equal weight between the two of
them but i would say the cooperation
just because you're complicit in giving
away that customer information this cup
is a couple apples sort of state the
grounds take their position and
defending our data and so what company
ID yahoo does that kind of looks
terrible it looks bad yeah alright for
more all these stories check us out at
cnet Roger Cheng and I'm Joanie salzman
thanks for listening the important
question yeah which color pixel did you
like I think the important west's which
color home speaker do you like there's
more option I saw well you know I was a
little overwhelmed by the sheer
combination of colors and materials I
wasn't sure where to go with much blue
much is over by the way but
I can't remember what is it much blue
it's really blue really would like much
blue better so it's dog it's the Doge
meme come to life by those marketing
people are on point with this must mean
fodder it's interesting to note the
really blue sold-out like seconds God
was gone the limited it don't bother
making it your favorite cuz you can't
have it yep I was wondering if Verizon
was gonna sell the blue phone since
their their big red their big red how
could they sell blue phone there's no
blue well 1818 t would have been the
natural partner yeah it actually cares
because ATT always locks up these
exclusives so it's interesting the
verizons the main partner yeah yeah I
don't know it feels so retro to have an
exclusive carrier I agree it is very
kind of like this weird throwback and it
I don't think it's really effective
throwback at this point like right you
know the arguments always if you get an
exclusive deal you get marketing support
you get you know Marky position in the
stores but I mean as the last couple
years have shown like anyone who struck
an exclusive deal is really just sort of
a like the fire phone was exclusive
phone HTC first the facebook phone
obviously you don't remember all these
phones that only I remember because I
matters be our phones at all failed and
they're all exclusive so we'll see I
mean Google is definitely there selling
these through their own site but I get
the sense that only the hardcore Android
folks are going to want to get that
phone through the site most people still
buy their phones at carrier stores will
Google assistant be available on Nexus
phones oh that's good question your
phones in the future yes yeah I don't
think I don't know if next is gonna
that's a really good question they
didn't really address that they've kind
of the kind of stopped talking about
nexus actually like I believe they've
already kind of commented saying that
they're they're not they don't have any
plans to build a future Nexus devices
and they didn't mention Nexus at all
today so I mean I don't know if it's
actually mean go back to it do you think
it with a forthcoming firmware update
it's possible possible yeah I don't know
if there's like special computing power
or something in the phone itself that's
required to run Google assistant but
yeah I don't know yeah ah micro SD card
no right
nope no um let's see what about the same
questions every day but alone well some
of us didn't sit at their desk and watch
the event the entire time we were paid
to do true front-facing speakers that
was that mentioned do I think they're
just rear spelling bottom splatters
because that's what I think I saw we've
got a photo gallery on cnet if you want
to full like detailed close-up pirates
look I said I didn't think I saw did we
figure out what those the yesterday on
the show they're talking about the
little dots were those stereo
microphones I think they might be
directional Mike's the pick up pick up
your sound not not speakers but actually
yeah pick oh but would that even work in
favor of like noise cancelling I don't
know I think it's more intended to make
Google assistant more okay pick up your
voice a lot easier that's a thought
water resistance we kind of went over
this again a lot of resistance nope Shh
fall behind then uh still scanning still
scanning ah we got good comments thanks
everybody for jumping in I what you
think of the VR though yeah yeah yeah
it's not all just about the phone I just
wish I know of a phone geek so of course
I'm gonna focus on that I'd oh I thought
daydream view was really interesting
it's cheaper than the galaxy view nice
gear VR sorry the Samsung gear VR it
looks more comfortable looks more a
littler like plugging in the gear has a
fabric material ya see ya like that
seems like I wouldn't want to share it
I'd be less I'm triple share true can't
really wipe that down as easily yeah
yeah you know what I that's true the
main reason i have my gear vr is to
share it with other people like so they
can check out this computer this is what
we are is exactly and then i put it back
in the closet i never use it again
that's that's the extent of VR for me
i'm curious good like they've talked
about VR for a little while now do you
think that Google getting into VR in a
real way like this is actually going to
change things are we still kind of a
slow trajectory to people you know
binding and jumping in a VR um I think
that though it's the lowest price point
I assume high quality VR
yeah if it beats Samsung by the way but
the downside is you need to have their
phone right to work well right pixel is
gonna be the first one compatible with
it but they said any any phone that's
daydream compatible which I believe yeah
I think it's phones that run on probably
newer phones that run on Android 7.1 and
have a certain come display i think it's
an AMOLED display that's I think crisp
enough to handle the VR imagery I think
that'll make a big difference how much
device support how much yes most
empowered element you know how many
different kinda smart I know I agree cuz
right now if you buy gear VR you'd buy
samsung phone alcatel has one as a super
cheap headset our VR headset but again
only works with that phone so to have to
have a VR headset that you can use any
phone with be definitely helpful yeah
this Christmas season or holiday season
is gonna provide a lot more sort of
transparency you're not transferring but
give a give a good picture of where we
stand with ya normal people I'm still
I'm still skeptical about people
actually buying this for just because if
it's really at least this year if it's
really just pixel I don't really know if
people are going to want to buy this
thing will Google be like some carriers
and allow bootloader unlocking without
voiding the warranty I think I've been
told that I'm not it's not confirmed but
i believe the unlocked version that you
can buy from google will have that
possibly i'm pretty sure the verizon one
does not right i'm just throwing out
speculation this yeah well certain the
verizon one will not have that yeah how
do we feel about the appearance of the
phone some of the people are being
critical about how it doesn't resemble
the previous pixel products like the
chrome be and how it just looks like
another iphone yeah i mean from the
front it looks like an iphone without a
physical button but back has that weird
glass thing what do you think about that
that kind of two-tone look it's like
glass and metal I don't think about it
really yeah yeah I like that they called
the edge of it a wedge
they called it a wedge they called they
said I've had a wedge or better hand
holding oh oh really oh yeah I like
that's never I've never heard of a
definitely heard the word wedge well I
was paying attention Betties not seem
that doesn't seem like a word you'd want
to use to describe a sexy looking to buy
a wedge it's no aluminium know him at
all I'm sure this also has aluminium
arik air was an air airplane grow
aircraft grade aluminum aluminium that's
what they always say no that's like the
default doesn't matter how cheap the
phone is or how expensive component
aircraft aircraft grade had a mini uh
they demonstrate how fast the
fingerprint scanner worked no they
didn't begin to see that no but you know
what last last year's was pretty snappy
I mean and they're all like it doesn't
matter what manufacturers I think they
all kind of use the same fingerprint
tech from a specific company so I mean
it's the fast enough last year I'm sure
to be fine this year and your daddy
wants to know do we have to press the
home button to bring up Google assistant
oh no you ok Google Google yeah and what
I figure that's got to be at least a
setting that you can toggle on and off
kind of thing right yeah hello imagine
just saying okay Google constantly for
stuff I mean I say Alexa when I talked
to echo hey what's okay that doesn't
feel cumbersome but it's also two
syllables to four syllables so I don't
know is that is that more it's also a
little more natural just say someone's
name say something I'm right ok Google
yeah like saying okay girls bit more
stilted to me yeah I don't know I never
ok Google with anything same here then
again I don't I don't say hey Siri other
so I don't either I'm not a big fan of
the you know what I'm hey Siri work for
me was during the Apple presentation
well I think Tim Cook said hey Siri my
phone actually responded oh my gosh
Timms talking my phone dialing device
video ok say it knows tfboys except
bosses in the room I need to pay
attention I mean to be honest we all
kind of perk up a little bit when we
know their bosses well that's
that's true theory has just become more
human that's what that's what yeah
that's good that's the goal right visual
intelligence is fear of your boss oh
this is a total tangible danwon watch
westworld I haven't seen it yet no I
want to but I hate waiting but in
between weeks and so oh yeah I just I
just saw it the premiere episode last
night it's about AI so it's often but
yeah it's about soiree I evolving to the
point where it's human-like and then it
started to break down sorry I'm a little
have a little loop sorry I know I know I
don't even know how i found the time to
watch it but anyway in between keynotes
and on that note yeah we should probably
could've wrapped it any other last
points or questions not on good comments
and questions thanks everybody it's been
fun joining you in the aftermath of the
google i don't have a kindle now for
this the hash tag made by googling yeah
there was a lot of stuff made by google
although actually was made by HTC so was
it really made by them very keynote much
phones hahahaha much blue he not over
much tired much tired yeah pixel alright
