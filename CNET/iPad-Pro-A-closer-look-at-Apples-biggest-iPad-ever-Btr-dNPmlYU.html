point 9 inch iPad it's a larger screen
it's also got a faster processor and
it's got new peripherals like this
pencil to work for you and for
professionals what does that mean can
this replace a computer well I work with
this for about a week and a half and
this is what I like the most here's
what's great about it sighs this is a
twelve point nine inch iPad 2732 by 2048
pixels that is a lot and it feels like a
big-screen TV running iOS apps it's
fantastic for games for watching movies
and you can spread out documents and
webpages and really see a lot if you
split screen apps then you can make out
to almost nearly iPad size apps side by
side and it starts to feel even more
like a computer than any iPad before
pencil Apple separately sold
pressure-sensitive stylus as a marvel it
costs $100 but it offers you a wide
range of pressure sensitivity tilting to
be able to control brushstrokes and
pencil like shading and it also enables
quick lightening charging directly from
the iPad itself with the right supported
art apps
this thing feels like the best stylus
I've ever used keyboards and connectors
apples got a new smart connector on the
side of the iPad that should allow all
sorts of inputs right now it just works
with keyboards and a couple of the ones
out of the gate Logitech's iPad pro
keyboard and Apple's own smart keyboard
have great keys and feel comfortable but
they're expensive they're over $150 each
and you can already get Bluetooth
keyboards that work for the iPad that do
just fine and cost less optimized apps
and better split-screen ones if you can
find apps that take advantage of this
iPad pro screen resolution and it's more
advanced a 9 X processor you're gonna
get some great photo editing tools
graphics apps and things that are a
little more powerful than get on another
iPad and split-screen apps look great
but you're gonna have to find the ones
that take advantage which right now
there weren't as many as we would have
liked what's not great size as big as
this is it's also harder to carry around
this thing's going to require a laptop
size bag while it's lightweight for
sighs it's still wide and long and more
cumbersome and loses some of that great
iPad portability sometimes it's not that
much different from an iPad really iOS 9
still allows the same type of
split-screen apps that you can get on
the iPad air 2 or even the iPad Mini 4
you get more screen real estate but
you're not getting any new types of
interfaces on the main screen no new
ways to deal with apps in the dock and
it feels more like a blown-up iPhone
than it should under the hood it's more
powerful but I wanted even more cost the
iPad pro starts at $100 but if you add
in 228 gigabytes of storage in the
pencil and the keyboard you're climbing
into the price of a premium laptop do
you need this iPad pro is it the
computer of the future it depends I mean
if you're a creative professional who
really likes using a super accurate
stylus with some art apps then maybe but
this is expensive and it's not exactly
where I need it to be which is to be
something more like a computer it's day
1 of where the iPad is going and where I
hope it's going is something somewhere
between an iPad and a MacBook but for
now for my editing needs I'm probably
going to go back towards that MacBook
