town and this is a big one
meet the gear s3 does it look like a big
bold luxury sports watch that's the idea
building on the same concept as last
year's clever around gear s2 watch and
it's rotating bezel that bezel acts like
a giant scroll wheel it dials up apps
and widgets and now can answer calls to
the gear s3 is considerably larger than
the s2 though it's a 46 millimeter watch
which even felt big on my hairy wrist on
a thinner wrist
it looks pretty pretty large the bezel
is bigger the cases bigger that's
because it does more is a larger 380
milliamp battery promising up to a day
more battery life GPS now comes standard
and all s3s can make speakerphone calls
the LTV equipped s3 frontier can work
without a phone and use higher speed
data connections Samsung pay comes
included but this time there's also MST
Samsung's way of making payments at
nearly any credit card terminal not just
tap to pay it should work in more places
than Apple pay or Android pay and the s3
has improved water resistance shock and
dust resistance and a more scratch
protective gorilla glass screen the s3
has got some music chops too it connects
with Spotify to stream over Wi-Fi or LTE
and there are a few new apps like nest
for thermostat control and ADT personal
security for a triple tap SOS call from
your wrist mostly the gear s3 and it's
two designs classic and frontier are
meant to be bigger bolder additions to
the line the s2 will still remain on
sale which might be samsung's way of
saying if you don't like big sporty
watches choose something else instead</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
