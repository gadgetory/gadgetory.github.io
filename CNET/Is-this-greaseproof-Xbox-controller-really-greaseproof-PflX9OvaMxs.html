today fast food and controllers were not
a good mix grease ooh and no grease ooh
I mean just look at the evidence but
that's about to change
so this is the player unknowns
battlegrounds Xbox wireless controller
and it's special for two reasons one its
celebrating the release of play unknowns
battlegrounds as a full game version 1.0
but it also it's its greaseproof the
truth is this is a PR stunt by Xbox
Australia they actually made 200 of
these only so if you wanted to get an
Xbox greaseproof controller you have to
enter a competition on their Facebook
page and that allows you to win one at
that kind of annoys me because why not
just make your Xbox controllers
greaseproof in the first place it seems
like such an obvious idea that's right
Xbox Australia have coded this entire
controller in urethane which is meant to
make it resistant to dust you get when
you eat chips and also of course to
chicken grease so we're going to put it
through its paces today and see exactly
how greaseproof it really is and when I
say put it to a space it goes
don't judge me
greaseproof a okay so it's not exactly
science we weren't really sciencing it
up in here but we did find out that the
player knows battleground xbox
greaseproof wireless controller is not
actually grease proof but it is grease
resistant I there's a lot of source that
we got on there that didn't exactly
resist the source as such and the
cheetah stuffs well I think there's
still some in there and bits and pieces
but that's okay
I feel like chicken to eat I'm Jackson
run there's a scene it
you know I mean say you can the
controller only exists because people
are obviously eating a lot of food while
they're playing games I mean make sense
I hate feeling I play games but and it's
like a chicken dinner thing but you know
what no nice afternoon I know you know
that a talk but there's not</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
