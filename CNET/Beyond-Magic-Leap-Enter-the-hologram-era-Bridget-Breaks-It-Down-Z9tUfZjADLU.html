screen tech companies are working on
having virtual images appear right in
front of you sort of like Holograms
think of it as computing in space and
you control it with hand gestures or
with your voice
now this tech goes by a few names
augmented reality or AR for short it's
also called mixed reality the blending
of real and virtual it's a world where
anything can appear in the palm of your
hand but you may need some headgear to
make it happen what's it gonna take for
this kind of mixed reality to be our
everyday reality
go let's start with the easy stuff
augmented reality is pretty common in
social media and mobile gaming we've all
seen plenty of those silly selfie camera
effects pokemon go had everyone catching
cartoon critters around their
neighborhoods you can even see what
furniture looks like in your space
before you buy it yeah let's put that
right here mm-hmm looking good
that's all a are and it doesn't always
look perfect but phones are getting
smarter with processing these effects
soon you will see multiplayer AR games
in an early demo we tried with Apple we
can hold up an iPad to play a slingshot
game that looks like it's sitting on the
table even though nothing is really
there but yes yes I know this is all
still on a screen so when will we get
games floating in front of our eyes
that's a bigger leap so to speak a
startup called magic leap is now selling
a headset that can make it happen
there's also a headset from Microsoft
called hololens which has been out for
longer both are a bit pricey that's
because they're not really meant for
average consumers these companies are
hoping developers will tinker with the
tech to come up with cool apps they each
have similar effects but hardware is a
bit different with magiclip one you wear
goggles with special tech in the lens
and it's tethered to a little computer
pack that sort of looks like a CD
walkman clipped to your waist the
goggles do not work with glasses so
folks who wear glasses need to use
contacts or order special prescription
lenses that's not the case with hololens
it works with glasses and look ma no
computer pack no cords the hololens
headset is Wireless and it fits like a
crown with a transparent screen hovering
over your eyes both make it seem like
computer images are floating in front of
you and the images look a little
transparent but they can stick to one
place so you can move around the object
you may see these companies share
example footage where it looks like an
entire room has been transformed around
you and you're now living in this
amazing virtual hybrid world
but that's not quite the case when you
put on these headsets your field of view
is limited the computer effects don't
show up in your peripheral vision now
you can only see the Holograms straight
ahead of you it's sort of like looking
through a window frame into a
holographic world where you have to turn
your head around to see it all this
hololens example footage conveys that
idea more clearly hololens has some
educational and business application
demos you can get an anatomy lesson by
seeing body parts up close from any
angle see a building model come to life
by putting yourself inside of it learn
to make a repair by jumping on a live
call and getting guidance on steps to
take with real-time animations some
programmers have even tinkered with
life-sized video games like this Super
Mario concept we tried out last year
careful of the goombas with hololens
there are also little cartoon characters
that can fly around you or you could
just make one fall off your table poor
little guy these headsets have sensors
that map out the room to detect walls
and objects making it appear that the
virtual things are walking on and around
your furniture and you can control it
with hand gestures or voice commands
developers have shared similar effects
for magic leap in this case a little
rock man is throwing boulders your way
that you have to block and dodge and a
cartoon car could zip around the walls
of a room the tech is still in the early
stages and it's pretty cool that we're
living in a world where all this is
possible but you are not going to want
to spend two or three grand to see
little special effects on a head
computer until there are more
applications so is there anything more
reasonable that will show up on this
planet anytime soon well here's
something for just $200 Lenovo's Star
Wars Jedi challenges it's the home
budget version of the experience the
headset is powered by your smartphone
and sensors on the ground and in a
lightsaber prop will measure your
whereabouts in the Jedi training
simulator go figure it's the toy world
that's bringing this experience home in
a more affordable way Hasbro has an
man masks called hero vision it's
powered by a smart phone inside the
visor and it scans icons on a glove to
create an Avengers training battle game
it's under 50 bucks there are other tech
companies exploring the space so we may
see things advance pretty quickly there
is another company called leap motion it
tracks hand gestures with AR it has this
open-source build-it-yourself headset
called project Northstar you can see how
advanced the software gets even when a
hand gets in the middle of it and the
company also posted a video showing
virtual ping-pong and how quickly it can
keep up but it's still a bulky headset
we reported that Apple is also working
on its own headset but what form that
will take or if it'll even come is
unknown for it to be the future of
computing it needs to be super light to
pop on and carry with you anywhere could
it be as light as a pair of glasses like
we see in the spy movie
Kingsman where Holograms appear through
a normal-looking pair of specs well
maybe it's not total science fiction
giants like Google Samsung and Sony have
been playing with the idea of smart
contact lenses and they have a few
projects in the works but until the tech
gets a whole lot lighter and much
cheaper we will just have to stick with
a are on the device we already own the
phone hey guys thanks for watching
so would you wear an AR headset for work
or for play let us know in the comments
what you think and you know I don't
really want to poop who the idea but
honestly I think it's gonna take some
really great games for this to make a
splash be sure to like and subscribed
and click the little bell icon so you
never miss a future bridge it breaks it
down on these world-changing issues oh
yeah that is looking
good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
