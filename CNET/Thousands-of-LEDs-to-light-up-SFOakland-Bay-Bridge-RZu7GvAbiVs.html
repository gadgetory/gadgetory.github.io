Bay Bridge sparkled and shimmered
shifting patterns of light moving across
the nearly two mile span on a balcony
nearby artist Leo Villareal creates from
his laptop using software to sculpt
patterns of light really I guess my goal
is to create a communal experience the
piece almost becomes like a digital
campfire that people can gather around
he is putting the final touches on bay
lights a work of art that will be
officially turned on tonight Villarreal
is constantly changing light sculpture
will run for the next two years it's as
if the wires there are alive it does
bring a real sense of life and animation
to the bridge electricians endured for
months of cold nights attaching 25,000
LED lights on the bridge cables it's
transforming the Bay Bridge that opened
to a claim in 1936 but was quickly
overshadowed when the more elegant
golden gate opened five months later for
more than 75 years the Golden Gate has
been a show horse the Bay Bridge a
workhorse the bridges do have a slight
rivalry you know this is a really
hard-working bridge 280,000 trips a day
we do all the heavy liftings and I think
everyone feels the same way that that
this beautiful work of humanity has its
moment to shine Ben Davis led to
fundraising for the 8 million dollar
project and brought in Villarreal an
artist already recognized for
large-scale light sculptures but never
anything this big it doesn't require an
art degree or anything else it just
requires being a human to really
appreciate it so many people are
expected to appreciate it it's projected
to generate nearly a hundred million
dollars in the local economy and become
a tourist attraction to rival the Golden
Gate at least at night for CBS this
morning John Blackstone San Francisco
