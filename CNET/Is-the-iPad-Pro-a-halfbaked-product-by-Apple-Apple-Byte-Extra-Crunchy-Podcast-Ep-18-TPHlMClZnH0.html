calling 1-800 61 62 63 eight so let's
jump into the show we're just before
Black Friday and I feel like it's my
duty my obligation to educate you guys
on some of the places where you'll want
to be for some of the best deals that
are out there what we're talking about
apple products okay just very rare
because they do not do sales Apple does
not do sales often no not often and if
historically Apple product sales if you
go into an apple store their sales are
pretty weak they'll do black friday
they'll do like a list of 10 products
and then give you anywhere from five to
ten percent off i know it's slightly
weak yeah it's basically sales tax
exactly from a mole a company that is
literally sitting on billions of dollars
going to give you ten dollars
off the seven hundred dollar iPod it's
that bad everybody it's almost a bad
apple ah alright anyways let me just
tell you a few places I'm not going to
go down this list if you guys want to
check out I gotta give credit to boy
genius report BGR calm they really
compiled this great list of all the
discounts you guys can find I phone
deals how about this if you trade in
your iPhone 5 or later you can then also
purchase an iphone 6s or 6s plus and get
a two-hundred-dollar best buy gift card
back that's pretty so that's very solid
that is solid deal right pretty solid
deal right there over almost the iphone
deals are like thirty dollars fifty
dollars here Walmart though has the
other good one iphone 6s with a two-year
contract on either 18 teen verizon save
one hundred dollars and also get a
100-dollar walmart black friday gift
card those are the two top deals when
we're talking iphone okay that's a
pretty good deal to iPad you can really
go a lot of places there are no black
friday deals on the iPad pro because
Apple ain't gonna go there okay but if
you want to look at something like the
ipad mini 4 remember best Retina Display
we talked about it last week or best LCD
display on any tablet you'll get about a
hundred dollars off if you go to best
buy best buy has a variety of iPads and
different configurations pretty much a
hundred dollars off across the board
target is doing target gift cards for
around a hundred dollars that's really
the best price that I could see out
there at least for an ipad air two
hundred fifty dollars off from staples
yeah staples deal right here 299 apple
ipad mini 4 16 gig save 100 bucks that's
Booya if you're looking at max macbooks
imax best buy is really the best place
to go you can save anywhere from 150 to
200 dollars off of those machines these
are not gift cards these are actual save
cash nice which is important no new
Apple TVs are going on sale target does
have the third generation for
twenty-five percent off which is nice
I'm not going to talk about headphones
oh wait wait hold up if you want an
apple watch the place right now target
oh yeah one hundred dollars off the 349
Apple watch that's pretty good
that's a great deal three I would buy I
would recommend someone who wants to
dabble with the SmartWatch 249 for an
Apple watch is fair to me that's that's
fair to me for what it is that's fair
that'd be fun to get in your stocking
that's a stocking stuffer if you're a
rich person so there you go some of the
Black Friday deals just to be aware of
pre black friday deals we also wanted to
keep on kind of steam rolling through
this it's gonna be a little shorter show
because the holidays but want to talk
about the ipad pro we've talked about it
like 43 fight for three or four episodes
in a row right but this is a really cool
thing hamza stood who's a developer
who's really always been able to unearth
new things from the SDKs and the code he
showed off a little quick video of iOS 9
hacked on an iPad pro now we know the
ipad pro does not have 3d touch correct
it does not have a touch sensitive
screen but this little bad boy here my
finger in my hand the Apple pencil does
have pressure sensitivity so you just
showed this cool thing where you push in
you can do the whole peak and pop pick a
pop you do pick a pop with an apple
pencil on an iPad pro nice so again for
all your listing though 3d touch on the
iPad pro but with a pencil you can pick
a pop I would be playing the video but
the video says this browser does not
support video playback what browser is
the most current version of Firefox so
that's brutal yeah I don't know here
I'll see if I can get on something else
so anyways you guys want to check that
out pretty cool also um we we know the
internet likes to break and destroy
things already told about how they tore
this Apple pencil apart they have shown
on iFixit a teardown of the Apple pencil
kind of revealing the innards of it they
like sawed off the outer plastic shell
of the coating to show this kind of its
metal innards the tip of the pencil on
the iPad pro is really unique it has
this nib and it depending on the
orientation that you put on display you
can detect that also adjust the pen
stroke accordingly to that we know of
that about that
one unique thing though here is there's
a little mini logic board like kind of
in this back end it's actually folded in
half and then is put inside the Apple
pencil it has about five different
components and only weighs a gram this
thing has antenna bluetooth it also has
a battery in it uh I fix it rated it a
one out of 10 for repairability Oh which
is as low as you can go yeah that's not
good what's the battery dies there's no
way to replace it uh there's there's
just no way to repair this thing there's
a light we know we know there's a lights
on open the way they're doing here yeah
they're using this little cutter all
that is cut it open you know Johnny I've
whenever he sees these type of videos he
probably literally weeps it's like
really sad for him this is not this is
not acceptable to what are they doing to
my pencil you do know what caught the
apple pencil like that first of all we
did a diamond cutter you need a diamond
cut diamonds it's made of diamonds
finest diamond alright um also if you're
looking around the city and you're
seeing these billboards we're talking
Apple TV Apple is really pushing for the
Apple TV with these new billboards right
that are using that a test pattern that
you see that smt that smpte those color
bars right the color bars that you're
used to seen on TV a long time ago the
kind of plane off that they're long
vertical bullet billboards or the
horizontal ins the thing that is ironic
about this though to me is there's not
even actual TV on apple TV like it's
funny yeah but they're working on that
though right or you know I on it they're
working on it this is not you know okay
foreshadowing maybe it's more shadowy
but the biggest the biggest flaw that
the Apple TV doesn't have it doesn't
have a subscription service yet ready to
roll which would have made it like
massively awesome but they're still
using the color bars that's funny I
wonder if this campaign was made already
thinking that they would have the deals
done and they didn't change it and they
still pushed it through like we can't
get our money back on this 80 story ad
thats hanging through this building
right here look at the
look at this thing hanging down here is
huge so that's my that's my thinking
they had this ad campaign done already
with the idea that TV was a part of it
because there's no part of TV that is
actually part of the Apple TV I think
that's a bad apple right it's bad it's
it's it's a premature Apple bad up but
uh hopefully they do deliver that in
2016 there are no updates on the
progress of the subscription service we
Apple is pretty much say mom even Leslie
Moonves has said that CBS is working
with Apple on that CBS finally released
their own app to stream you know cover
their shows but you have to have a cable
subscription we are waiting to see I'm
gonna get you want to take a little time
Oh actually we'll save that for our

gotta look out for you people that just
jump to conclusions and do that stuff
alright I like this one we always talk
about apple patents and some of the
things that Apple is looking to do right
this one let me just open this link
first because you know probably felt
very interesting as I open it up here
Apple has been granted their first major
public transit related patent I'm gonna
read this this is gonna benefit me
directly Apple's newly granted patent
generally relates to methods systems and
computer programming products for
determining transit routes through crowd
sourcing for determined in estimated
time of arrival of a vehicle and transit
route at a given location I don't know
about you Stephen I don't know if I've
ever heard of any you know I new taxes I
get these notifications on my phone
every morning is their company calls the
google google maps yes oh yeah yeah
every morning I get a little
notification it's gonna take you a
little while to get to work okay well
I'm gonna run a little faster thanks
google apple has been granted this pan
it's not specific enough of how it
varies maybe the fact that this crowd
sourcing might be related to iphone user
specifically but this is you know they
took away transit directions and finally
brought them back in Iowa that's right
just recently just recent months ago so
it's dude like a month and a half ago
didn't they bite they but I'm proud I
could be wrong but didn't Apple by like
a big like ways or something well
Google's of our ways yeah Google's a
part ways Apple has acquired probably
over the course of a year three or four
specific mapping type third-party
independent groups their treasure now
folding in yet they are their way major
try and catch up
we've talked about there's no reason
that Apple's compelling use Apple maps
yet no seriously that is dangerous
borderline dangerous even when i use
Yelp that's integrated with Apple maps I
copy the address and I pop it into
Google Maps because I know it's better
yeah you know everyone on Paris you like
yep yeah we do that sure people on
periscope they're green they're not in
their heads although I can't see them on
their heads they're not in their heads
so um you know we'll we'll see how this
they need all the help they can get with
their Maps we'll see how it plays out
also we told you about how Apple is
developing the next Apple watch too I'm
curious on people on periscope but they
still want the Apple watch to just just
fired your comments we'll see if we can
involve you guys in this a rumor claims
that Apple is now seeking a second
supplier for the next gen watch I see a
lot of those I'll see a lot of no's I
see a lot of f knows I see a lot of yes
yes I do yes no okay here's the thing
about this rumor that is a little
concerning apples looking for a second
supplier because quanta who is currently
their numero uno supplier for the Apple
watch their earnings were lower than
expected Apple watch sales numbers are
lower than they have expected Apple
still won't officially comment on that
and these second suppliers that they're
looking for to help them are wary of
this and they don't want to be sucked
into something where they can't make
their numbers as well by jumping into
the Apple kind of getting seduced by the
fact that it's Apple we're gonna sell a
lot and then they don't sell as many use
as they thought yes well hmm that's
that's a tough one to read it is we
don't it's very it's of course it's
super speculation let's let's throw that
out there yeah but look at a company
like Samsung who is benefited by being a
component maker tons of their components
are inside the iphone but it's different
we're talking about an iphone versus an
Apple watch yes so we'll see like do you
think do you think that they Apple
believes that a second supplier would
help you know just spur Apple watch
sales even more they just have more of a
more of a reach to their customers or
some larger you know bigger growth
ability to make more units so that
ideally buzz will be greater because
initially with the Apple watch it took a
long time for people to be able to even
buy one yeah that's right just like the
iPad pro
pencil huh which came out a week or two
after the ipad pro okay hold up i also i
pre-ordered that stupid pencil five
minutes after that thing went on sale
I've still yet to receive it oh my god
it's supposed to come this by the end of
this week where we will be gone that's
the number the third bad apple of
there's there's a lotta there's a lot of
apple been bad this week that's what I'm
saying so we'll see how that all shakes
out the Apple watch I'm in a story that
I wanted to just bring it up real
quickly it's kind of fun it's kind of
stupid it's a little foot in mouth story
I don't you guys heard about this on the
CBS this morning show Jimmy Iovine who
was part of the acquisition by Apple
when they acquired beats and is now
fronting with dr dre the apple music
service he was talking about a new apple
music add that has you know taraji from
empire legend mary j blige kerry
washington they're just grooving to
music talking about music and like
having fun well in this interview he
kind of he got some people upset I don't
know people being oversensitive or not
whatever you decide during the interview
when he was talking about that ad he
said and I quote women find it very
difficult at times some women to find
music and Apple music helps make it
easier with playlist by curated by
people now he also said I just thought
of a problem you know girls are sitting
around you know they're talking about
boys or complaining about boys you know
when they're heartbroken or whatever and
they need music for that right so it's
hard to find the right music you know
not everyone has the right list or knows
a DJ or something that's dude just
stereotyping so so crazily it's so funny
it's like it's like when guys sitting
around watching the football game trying
to decide what to listen to you wait
wait wait I had that problem that's uh
that's not a generation that's right
that's a real life issue that's real
life funny it was just like oh my gosh
like and then people are like oh now
these days everyone's gonna complain
about everything yeah you say something
like this you're gonna hear about it so
he did apologize and say he should have
chosen his words a little more wisely
but let's be honest he really believes
that that's he said that was the basis
of the TV commercial I mean it's like
yeah it's like we're those talking
points from the record label like women
have a hard time finding their music
I don't know based on our user surveys
clearly that must be an issue see guys
know exactly what song to listen to when
they're broken up I have yet to meet a
girl who has a hard time finding a song
for an occasion sorry I just go straight
the boys to men when I'm feeling that
when I'm feeling the heart when the
hearts are breaking oh man I gotta go
boys to men all the time just go water
run to try man well I was right or on
bended knee women our hearts were always
broken and clearly it's only afflicting
the women of this world clearly all
right in two quick stories to wrap
things up Apple pay update this is cool
according the wall street journal apple
is expected to launch apple pays expect
to launch in china by februari 2016 we
already know that the UK has got has
received it now with American Express
also sorry other two banks in UK are
there but Australia and Canada are under
the American Express card support for
apple pay with more coming soon Square
is also launching this really cool NFC
reader to bring Apple pay to smaller
businesses this is also um using that
chip card technology as well as Apple
pay oh wow so they haven't had a reader
like this in the past it's always just
been the slide to read but this new
contactless card reader really cool we
already already know how huge squares
for independent businesses small
businesses food trucks I like how crazy
it is um they're implementing this into
the into their ecosystem in it's smart
Apple pay and square they're both have
payment services but it's smart for
square to be like we accept Apple pay oh
sure yeah everyone should is examined
everything exactly its don't walk out
someone you know it's dumb to like take
a product offer your website because
there's competing products amazon from
like taking out the Apple TV because
they thought that it would take away
from fire TV sales no this is dumb
amazon like takes down authors books to
get books in there he knows it was like
yeah they probably took that until the
book so Jeff Bezos could put his wife's
a book on there yeah he talks about his
wife's book all the time and says like
okay there's like three interviews where
he says own it's not because she's my
wife but it's a really good book but
he's like said it multiple times I'm
like okay
amazon can be evil but props to them for
landing that rocket today did you see
that they landed a rocket do they really
let it ride it yeah where I don't know
exactly where landed I think it let you
know it landed somewhere on planet Earth
obviously but but they landed it up
right which is what Elon Musk has been
trying to do right Bezos gets it on the
first try whoa amazon prime now yo it's
a bit of pee pee contest LOL Woody's
like talk crap about a company and be
like but they also do this thing that's
so great yes all right you know what we
love you guys we want to hear your phone
calls again for you to be a part of the
show 1 800 61 62 63 eight is the phone
you might as well put on speed dial at
the end of every show we want to hear
from you we want to talk to you we've
got some calls so Steven just kind of
rip through them right all right here we
go we have a few calls and let's start
with number one hi guys my name is
Fernando Rivera calling from Connecticut
I wanted to know if we can't use the new
Apple pencil for our I guess old iPads
now is there something that's equivalent
that we can buy thank you very much long
time listener thanks bye yes thank you
so much for calling um so what you can
do actually to at least get some kind of
pencil functionality again the pencil on
the ipad pro only works on the ipad pro
but there is a stylist from 53 digital
now if you guys have ever played with
this app called paper they actually make
a physical stylus and the cool thing
about it is that it has you know the tip
for using two drawers right but also hey
i heard a voice in layer it's okay it
just goes right just goes but it has a
tip on the pencil but also an eraser
that you can use so oh really cool
that's cool check it out it's it's
actually called a pencil because it
actually has an eraser unlike other
companies that make pencils without
erasers yeah I good I also have to point
out that Sharon Vaknin did how to a
couple years ago I think it's like three
years ago on how to make a stylus that
will work with an iPad ok and I get ya
I'm not gonna hate on this ok
I'm gonna be very polite it's cool oh
it's a cool project but i'm not going to
bust out water and a sponge to make a
stylish for my freakin I'm as you know
some guys might I'm not hating I pointed
out I'm just saying this to each their
own we came to mind it's I totally feel
that's fair I'm just not gonna bust out
sponge in water and a paperclip to make
a stylus for my iPad instead I'm gonna
buy a 92 you need Scottsdale no tips I'm
not gonna comment anymore cool it's cool
hey it's cool yeah it's cool I'm seep
seep it's free all right price free okay
voicemail number two hi my name is
terrain I'm from Phoenix Arizona I was
calling to find out what's the best day
if I was going one day out of the week
for CES 2016 would be the best day to go
this is a good one okay so CES goers
although you won't see many apple
products there there's a huge apple
section for all these accessories
third-party cases companies and whatnot
CES is the Consumer Electronics Show it
is the Super Bowl for tech this
ginormous if you want to like drool over
a TV screen that you won't be able to
buy until 10 years this is where you go
yeah like really you could see
everything there like I saw televisions
underwater last year as I was walking
around 30 people racing cars with their
mind control so you know it's totally
awesome wacky wacky cool stuff like that
3d printing was made a huge splash out
at sea us a couple years ago last year
now they're like 3d printing food yeah
right well oh yeah last year we're
having 3d printed chocolates and he's
like that last year was like the year
the drone though they were drones flying
everywhere it was it it's yeah it's
still the year that it's the years of
the drone you know if you ask me so to
your question anyone that's interested
in going to see us first of all it's
only open to industry and what does that
mean you either have to be a retailer a
buyer someone who works in retail
someone who covers tech or tech there
are ways kind of get around with it cuz
I've seen people make up like sites and
then get into say that they did Tex amna
I'm gonna let you guys figure that one
out but it goes from January sixth to
ninth which starts on Wednesday Thursday
Friday Saturday if you want to avoid the
crowds go on Saturday
or even late Friday because that's when
everything kind of dies down right
everything dies down for the general
consumer who somehow is able to get in
go in the last couple days yeah now if
you want to be in the zoo where you
can't walk at all you go on Wednesday or
Thursday yes come by our stage yeah
unless you will be will be hanging out
there I mean every battle will be
bouncing around and stuff but um so yeah
that's that's my recommendation for CES
fun this totally yeah semi on Apple
related but still tech related so we
won't answer that okay and the last
voicemail hey Brian hey Steven my name
is Colin and I'm from British Columbia
Canada and I have a question about the
ipad pro do you think it would be more
useful as a Productivity tool and a
laptop replacement if it ran maca like
10 or some hybrid of iOS and medical s I
think it would make out developers more
willing to produce quality pro apps for
the platform like putting final cut pro
or logic pro because I know there's
probably some professionals out there
who want to create more high quality
video production and music production
and plus a lack of a trackpad and mouse
input is annoying to get basic core
activity done thanks i love the show
guys alright so you know question about
can it be a more productive tool if
there's a hybrid of OSN that's what last
week that is what we were i I've been
requesting the ipad pro has potential it
has the power to support this but they
don't have a proper OS that is really
gonna be able to allow me to use it like
my laptop yes it just can't be done you
can do things but there's a point where
you don't you can learn to do things
differently but it when it's really less
efficient or honestly takes more time
you're going to stop doing it on there
it's gonna slow you down tues you have
to close out it's gonna be slow and
quite honestly when you're in laptop
mode you don't want to be touching the
screen and then go to keyboard and
touching the screen you actually want to
keep it all in that one spot that's just
more efficient so uh they definitely do
that another sign and he brought up a
great point and what I've been saying
look Apple didn't even release final cut
pro or logic for their own platform to
show the potential of pro apps on an
iPad pro that's a red flag right there
to make
exactly like they help pro in the name
and the days support they have their own
pro sweet they didn't make anything for
the ipad pro now on lunch yeah mo that's
a that's a no-no so I've always said
until there's a killer app that is using
the eye pencil tech and the ipad pro
from the ground up to show us a proof of
concept that yes this is a truly pro
whether you're creative or a video
editor or something show me its full
potential in front of me so I can really
say yes this is what it's for but until
then it is still a little half-baked and
quite honestly why did I buy it I want a
large big screen iPad to consume tons of
media I read comics movies I'm on the go
all the time that's why I wanted a
bigger screen ipad with the idea that
maybe I could be a little productive
with it that's why I bought it and do I
know I spend a lot of money on but I
travel a lot so but I didn't buy it and
I've used the panel on and it is really
cool but it's not cool enough mm-hmm it
needs better apps someone's there it's
it's getting there so uh they I really
feel like they need to work on it they
are light years behind what the surface
is doing unfortunately the surfaces
bugaboo is that it just doesn't have
enough apps that's right if it made only
very cheesy and flat if it did totally
different story yeah but everyone has
their strengths and weaknesses I really
wanted to actually answer a question
that the periscopes we're giving but
they had really lame questions like if I
wanted to smoke out with them um there
were just like dumb comment like I was
like aim maybe there's that's an
educated question not actually like
answer but it didn't happen but it
didn't happen this week ah like what's
going on with your hair yes those are
important things is important are they
really no I'm just kidding people want
to know all right everybody thanks so
