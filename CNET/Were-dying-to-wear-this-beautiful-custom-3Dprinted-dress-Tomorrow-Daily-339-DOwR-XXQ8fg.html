welcome to tomorrow daily the best speak
talk-show universe and I'm Jeff Canada
are you ready for some headlines Julis
DARPA is making a robot space mechanic
that's right we have a lot of satellites
working for us up in orbit but when they
break down they become space garbage
that's why DARPA says they want to make
a robotic servicing vehicle that would
hang around in geosynchronous orbit
until a satellite requires service then
it would match orbit with the broken
satellite get information for a service
plan and complete the repair
DARPA hopes to have something like their
concept in orbit within five or so years
short yeah I think we need to get this
once those robots arrive they're gonna
see so much garbage they're gonna be
like we need all of our time yeah and a
robot Union robot over time I hope that
maybe they can fix all of our space
garbage that'd be rad pretty cool or
then when they break down then you need
a room yeah that just becomes a
conundrum I get ya all right guys we got
to talk about well for the ladies the
story is for you this is a 3d printed
petal dress that you can get customized
for your body we've actually checked out
nervous systems 3d printed fashions
before on the show and now it's making
its 3d printed petals dress available
for purchase you can even upload a body
scan to customize the dresses pattern
specifically for you and use sliders on
the design company's website to change
measurements and the style and shape of
your dress since it's custom printed
though you should be prepared to spend a
lot of money on this personalized
peddles gown they start at a whopping
six thousand dollars and go all the way
up to ten thousand dollars which I guess
is the starting price for an Apple watch
edition so it's all relative these
things are gorgeous day seeing there
ain't a motion when the way they're the
ripple and the breeze yeah and depending
on your measurements and everything the
actual physical design of the 3d print
changes to make it look as best as
possible on your specific body
I mean I think if you've got that kind
of cash why not so which of these
stories should we talk about on Thursday
well I mean they both have so much
potential yeah um I kind of like the
idea of talking about 3d printed fashion
but what about you what do you H as
yesterday I thought you might be into
that I think that's cool I like this
idea of space robots but as anybody
would but I the idea of 3d printing our
clothes specific to our specifications
is fascinating and I think warrants a
deeper discussion let's do some research
and you guys can get in on the
conversation by using the hashtag hey TD
yeah I just shouted us using that
hashtag on the Twitter's we love hearing
your comments and well incorporate them
into our discussion on Thursday and
that's it for our headlines which means
it's time for our phone talker for the
day our photogra for the day today is
Donald who shot this magnificent photo
on his iPhone 6's Donald says this shot
was taken on my iPhone success on the
Caribbean island of st. Maarten st.
Maarten st. Maarten I don't know while
sipping a glass of wine at a very
upscale resort it proves no matter who
or where you are anyone can enjoy a
sunset or everyone enjoys a sunset I
have full permission from the subject to
use the photo I give you full permission
to use it on tomorrow daily thanks for a
great and fun show to watch Donald that
picture is glorious the only way it
would have been better is if Donald was
in the shot holding his glass of wine in
front of that sunset yeah it's it's a
he's right anybody can enjoy a sunset
and those small kind of quiet moments
