testing kit and i am going to take the
plunge on camera and just like to find
out all about me i'm such a girl already
know how to spit Oh half day I guess I
love that though I mean really like this
is what it takes to get a full genetic
profile not so bad so all I do is mail
off that little box of spit and wait for
a full report on my genetic history
ancestry and potential diseases that
would have been unthinkable just a
decade ago and it's just one example of
how your health is getting more
personalized every day whether it's a
wristband that tracks your calories it's
got 5 LEDs on it so if you tap it and
actually tells you your progress against
your goal but what's also important
about it is it that it uses Bluetooth 40
so it wirelessly syncs in the background
to smartphones a toothbrush and app that
measures your brushing habits or even a
fork that makes you eat more slowly the
demo for that we have here has been
pre-programmed on a 10-second interval
and it basically means that if I'm
putting food in my mouth under 10
seconds it will vibrate to see the tech
is enabling a trend that some call the
quantified self the idea that you can
gather data about your health your
habits and your history the benefits can
be far-reaching with more accurate
aggregated data doctors could provide
better care even possibly preventing
more serious diseases like cancer and
diabetes
I visited paris-based Withings where the
company's internet-enabled scale lets
you keep track of your weight share the
information with your phone and create a
database of your behavior so you see now
my weight on the scale and in some
second I will receive a push on my
iPhone will indicate this this
measurement this scale can work both in
Wi-Fi and Bluetooth okay so this is the
last measurement I'm 875 that's
something kilogram and so it will be
added to to me to make you oh wow
they've also built a phone app that
connects to a blood pressure cuff you
just connect it on and the iphone oh
that's cool and it starts automatically
easy application and then you just press
Start button and it will start there as
a measurement it's pretty high probably
because you are not sitting sitting
somewhere and because you're and so it's
not just the monitoring it's the fact
that once you have all of the data in
one place you can see patterns and you
can yes yeah and you can share with you
you can share it with you your doctor
right now we've seen plenty of heart
rate monitors but here's an app that
detects your heart rate using your
phone's camera this one comes from azumi
oh here's how it works when the heart
beats blood is pumped into your face
which causes it to change color the
camera can pick up this information and
actually determine your pulse you just
hold it in your hand like this distance
okay
Center your face son does deb December
screen
nobody should take around 15 seconds
till you got an excellent don't 94 when
I heard you guys like it's you yeah
maybe I flew after going through a few
of these technologies I realize I might
need to watch my blood pressure and
maybe even my heart rate then of course
there's the genetic testing i did with
23andme which could tell me if I'm at
risk for things like diabetes or even
cancer there can be downsides to knowing
all about your health but hey at least
you know</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
