how you got the idea to build buddy and
what sorts of things can it do for you

Laboratory in robotics for a
professional application when you play
our defense and the kind of thing and
assistance two years ago we decided to
we wanted to transfer all this high
technology in a real foldable robot so
we have created first Cotto type and we
have tested this prototype with a lot of
people and last year where I created
blue from robotics to launch the robot
so but it is for family children and
seniors and at an example we can watch
your house when you are not there it can
patrol internal mostly and detect fire
burglar food and it can send you send

through the robot and check if there is
a real problem you can control your
smart home it can play music and kind of
help you on your deli yeah so buddy is a
modular robots you can put different
attachments on the robot for different
needs so what types of attachments are
available for the robot now so we have

developed a scanner of accessories but
