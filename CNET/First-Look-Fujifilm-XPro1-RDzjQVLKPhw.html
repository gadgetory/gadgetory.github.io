the Fujifilm ex-pro ones design and
operation are for the most part very
well executed there are only a couple of
facepalm level annoyances
well the counters not particularly
compact it is a nice size for people who
like a little heft especially if you're
used to shooting a DSLR I do wish the
grip were a little deeper though you
dial in both shutter speed and aperture
with a real old-fashioned aperture ring
on the XF lenses putting the ring in a
enter shutter priority mode setting the
shutter speed to a puts you an aperture
priority if you've got both on a you're
in full auto my one complaint with the
scheme is the slavish adherence to
history means that you're stuck with a
full stop shutter speed in shutter
priority mode I've gotten used to
shooting at speeds like an 80th of a
second on the other hand the lens's
aperture dial does support third stops
which is a really nice feature overall I
found the control layout and button
design comfortable it's kind of annoying
that when you hit the macro button you
then have to arrow over to macro mode it
should just toggle there's only a single
user assignable control as well and
given that there are multiple relatively
unused controls this is a bit
disappointing on the upside the expo one
has seven custom setting slots that are
easily accessed via the quick menu like
the X 100 the X Pro one uses a hybrid
viewfinder that can swap between a
reverse Galilean type with an electronic
overlay and a straight EVF the View mode
button on the back rotates among the
optical and electronic viewfinders and I
auto sensor and this switch on the front
toggles between the optical and
electronic viewfinders my biggest
overall problem with the design is the
placement of the SD card slot in the
battery compartment which just doesn't
work well for advanced and pro
photographers who frequently take the
card out but even worse the X Pro ones
battery compartment is right next to the
tripod mount and pretty far to the right
rather than in the middle and this makes
it a pain to pull the card when the
camera is mounted on a tripod plus it
means you can't even open the battery
compartment when using one of those tiny
tripod mount attachments for a sling
strap also the battery isn't teed to a
particular directions so
it's really easy to put it in backwards
and then wonder why the camera won't
power on as for features the X Pro one
provides the basics and nothing more
perhaps even a little less given the
price there's no on camera flash and
it's got a fixed LCD the camera uses a
new sensor the 16 megapixel x-trans
which in combination with mostly
intelligent JPEG processing delivers
excellent photo quality across low and
mid-range ISO sensitivities in
combination with the sharp XF lenses
very good detail resolution color and
tonal range the sensor itself has a
large latitude in that I was able to
shoot a couple of ISO stops down from
where I might normally be in low-light
and still get clean images in night
shots the high ISO sensitivity images
did look more traditional with that soft
grainy and hot pixel look but the fact
is with the X Pro one you really don't
need to shoot at those settings as often
as you usually do the camera also
produces consistent and appropriate
exposures and with one exception the
colors are both accurate and vibrant the
video is a mixed bag it's sharp
with bright colors and then low-light
the noise looks pretty good but it
otherwise displays a cornucopia of
aliasing soir√©e and rolling shutter
artifacts while the autofocus has
trouble staying locked the lenses are
nicely designed for manually focusing
unfortunately the X Pro 1 is also
disappointingly slow thanks to sluggish
image processing and a finicky autofocus
system the most frustrating aspect is
that the better lens the 35 millimeter
is much slower to focus than the 18
millimeter lens which simply is in a
sharp ironically the continuous shooting
performance is pretty good
stellar photo quality and a beautiful
looking mostly streamlined design make
the Fujifilm X pro on a really
attractive camera for deep-pocketed
enthusiasts but poor autofocus
performance and a bare-bones feature set
make it harder to recommend for a
general audience than it should be and a
new sensor design means RAW processing
support will take longer to appear than
I'd like it's a nice compromise if you
can't afford a Leica but want to
approximate the experience and get some
stunning photo quality to boot I'm
