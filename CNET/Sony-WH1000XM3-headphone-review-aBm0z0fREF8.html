ultimate noise cancelling headphone it
may have finally done it with hiss the
WH 1000 X mark 3
it seems as if Sony's engineers went
through CNET's review of last year's
1000 MX mark 2 and corrected each small
issue I had with it the biggest changes
to the design of the headband and
padding on the ear cups the headband is
now more contoured to your head and the
headphone has shaved 20 grams of weight
the padding on the ear cup is also a
little bit softer the end result is the
headphone is clearly more comfortable
both quiet comfort 35 is still lighter
but this model is now neck and neck with
the Bose in terms of comfort both
headphones list for $350 sony has also
moved from microUSB to USB C and there's
a new quick charge feature that gives
you 5 hours of playback from a 10 minute
charge total battery life is rated at 30
hours that's very good I was a little
critical of headset performance in my
review of earlier 1000 X models for this
headphone the engineer shifted to a new
3 microphone array system that filters
out background noise while picking up
your voice during calls the headset
performance does seem better as a result
there are a few other cosmetic changes
the exterior finish on the ear cups
where you'll find the touch controls is
smoother and the carrying case is
slightly different there's a spot for
the short USBC cable and the included
headphone cord and yes the headphone
does sound very good in Wired mode Sony
reps told me this model has the same
drivers as its excellent mdr-1a mark 2
headphone and I think this definitely
sounds better than the Bose QuietComfort
35 it sounds more natural with a little
bit better definition clarity and strong
punchy bass the noise cancelling also
matches boses and thanks to Sony's
adaptive sound control feature it may
actually be superior
I'm not going to get into all this
headphones features you can check out my
full review for that but Sony has
retained perhaps the best extra feature
the ability to muffle your music and let
the outside roll in by simply holding
your hand over the right ear cup where
the touch controls are located
once you finish talking to someone you
remove your hand and the music resumes
playing at its previous volume and the
noise cancellation kicks back in the
Bose QuietComfort 35 is due for an
upgrade and should get better but for
now Sony's 1000 MX mark 3 has taken over
the title as the top noise cancelling
headphone on our list</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
