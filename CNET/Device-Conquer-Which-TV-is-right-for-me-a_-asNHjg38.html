distance don't think all those flat
panel TVs but how they generate the
image is the majority of what you're
paying for SIA may as well understand
what's in there let's break it down and
understand the types of TV displays
okay first off LCD or liquid crystal
display has long been the volume leader
probably what you have in most or your
only TV right now LCD TVs are known for
a good - very good picture a wide range
of sizes and prices from low-cost
portables to big dollar 55 inch TVs and
they don't suffer from burn-in but they
do dim and tend to color shift as they
age now you may have guessed by now
these LCD TVs are actually the same
technology as your flat panel computer
monitor or the display on your laptop
let's take a look inside this themed
panel you actually look at is actually a
sheet of transistors that open and close
like little shutters to allow light
through and in the process they go
through red green and blue lenses also
embedded in this piece of glass that
light I'm talking about comes from this
fluorescent panel behind it and that
creates two problems first of all this
whole light panel in a traditional LCD
is always on so when this picture wants
to show some area of black all it can do
is close the transistors in that area
and hope no light leaks through but it
always does so at best you get deep gray
that's what we talk about we measure
black level on a TV and black level is
key to everything else looking really
good and these TVs struggle with it
secondly this light source back here is
pretty bulky and that makes for a
thicker TV overall enter the LED LCD for
illumination they use a strip of LEDs
kind of like these right here and mount
them behind or around the picture that
means a thin case design front to back
because the LED lights are so low
profile
you also get very even brightness and
color throughout the TV because LEDs
don't age oddly like fluorescent panels
and LEDs tend to use less energy than
other TV types okay here's where it gets
a little bit complicated there are two
kinds of LED LCD TVs edgelet and local
dimming edgelet LED LCDs have their LEDs
mounted around the edges of the TV as
you might have guessed they can be
particularly thin because the LED
lighting is pushed out to the edges
they may have some issues though with
evenness of illumination at this point
in their development the local dimming
type has a complete grid of LEDs behind
the picture screen these tend not to be
the very thinnest but they're quite
shallow and they could really go a long
way toward offering that holy grail of
LCD TVs and that is showing deep black
levels because in this case when the TV
needs to show black it just shuts off
the LED light in that part of the
picture
finally there's plasma now unlike the
LCD TVs we've been talking about there
is no separate light source in the back
behind the picture instead every pixel
that you see is a little tube of glowing
gas or plasma that emanates light on its
own unlike LCD the picture is bright and
accurate from just about any viewing
angle and when a plasma TV is really
good it still tends to be the best
looking TV technology out there now
these guys are not as energy-efficient
or cool running as led LCDs can be and
surprising to a lot of folks plasmas are
actually the best value in larger sizes
like 42 inch and above
if you shop aggressively ok now 3d don't
worry about it
all these types of TV displays can show
3d if the rest of the television is 3d
compatible the display type doesn't
determine that so I know there's a lot
here to digest but it's important to
know what you're buying when something
is this expensive and this much of a
pain that take back to the store now
what really matters is which of the TVs
should you get using any of these
technologies and for that you should
head over to CNET's TV reviews section
where our TV guru David Katz Myer keeps
us on top of the best models regardless
of display tech</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
