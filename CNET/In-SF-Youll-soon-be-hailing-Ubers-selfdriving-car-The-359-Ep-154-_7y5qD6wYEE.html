matter where you lie in this earth it is
episode 154 of the 359 podcast I was
right Fox Rubin and what's sadder is
this is a second to last show of 2016 08
oh my gosh my last show of the year
which fairway by the way our first show
was on leap day so we be going a febuary
28th Wow so our one year anniversary
won't actually be a one-year anniversary
so we're gonna hate don't go for you
like where it depends ants something
like that sure okay yeah vaguely got
that reference oh wait a minute I'm
hosting today so I guess I should talk
about what we're doing man what are we
talking about it right so so in four
minutes we're gonna try to get through
like I think five stories we're gonna
start with uber self-driving car program
in San Francisco so cnet scooped by the
way cnet scoop also Trump's tech summit
Amazon's delivery drones and also amazon
getting Prime video to 200 countries
today so very busy day it's a lot more
source you said five there's gonna be a
secret additional 10 don't do that don't
do that we're gonna flick to another one
there's there's some additional like
tech folks that are gonna be guessing
the president well as it folks are tech
people not math people it's okay yeah
now we're gonna sneak it an extra story
an extra headlines I'll try to figure
that out either way as always sending
your questions and comments Brian will
get to them at the end of the show and
let's go from there okay one second to
cough it out very sex I yea sorry I
don't even sex no I'm time to get sick
yeah at this time of year right it is
definitely here alright let's get this
recording underway and here we go we
back to take your questions and comments
in three two welcome to the 359 where we
talk about the top tech news of the day
plus whatever crap we want to throw in
I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm not reach an uber
is expected to launch a new fleet of
self-driving cars in San Francisco as
soon as today our own Dara Kerr got the
scoop on that after finding a garage in
the city filled with these autonomous
vehicles the company already has a self
in car program in Pittsburgh so Roger
how soon until self-driving ride hailing
cabs are going to be in the mainstream
we're going to be seeing these on the
streets everywhere I mean I think it's
still give me a while right this is
definitely a little test you know
Pittsburgh's out there it's board a note
that if you get into one of the
self-driving cars it's not like you're
getting in by yourself there is light
safety driver safety I love that term
patient driver just in case a car i
guess breaks down with your drives on
the clay yeah so what is a route to
actually take control of the car yes
look this is a good most of them for you
know pushing for with this initiative
this is a great scoop by our own darker
correct and yet you know it's like said
it's a great move for autonomous driving
as a whole but we're doing really it's
so early day we're getting there it's
still baby steps and you still have
these safeties you shouldn't get ahead
of ourselves right absolutely also uber
CEO Travis Travis kalanick and Tesla's
Elon Musk are taking on strategic
advisory roles to president-elect Donald
Trump that announcement comes just after
Trump plans to meet with a bunch of tech
heavyweights today in Manhattan but more
on that later today by the way that
probably means that our budget for going
to Mars is just gonna balloon but how's
Eli Elon Musk right that's his big thing
right I would love to go to Mars what's
definitely let's send Ben de Mars just
been we can do that next up more self
driving or autonomous news next up is
amazon delivery drones project kicked
off a private test program with amazon
delivering a fire TV and a bag of
popcorn to a customer near cambridge in
the UK and just get this 13 minutes
after the customer clicked the button
that's impressive that's awesome that's
really i mean all this had to have been
kind of stage right like the customer
kind of you like the whole flight
pattern was already probably put in way
ahead of time like it was it wasn't role
he was controlled but it wasn't a
simulation Russ actually happened right
and the highly autonomous drone actually
made it to extinction been just a few
years ago when when business of unveiled
this yeah you know on TV there's really
sort of looked as a blame publicity grab
right and now it's like kinda actually
happening they are very serious about
delivery drones but there are still
major regulatory and sanity hurdles that
they need to get through so this is
another one of those things this is good
to talk to with self-driving cars yeah
that this is going to take a really long
time to get into the mainstream we're
talking years so wait for that to happen
also today amazon launched prime video
in 200 countries following a similar
effort by netflix in january yep that's
pretty sweet going global matching
netflix is reach one of the interesting
parts is that china wasn't on the list
just like with netflix then what China
has its own issues right in terms of
censorship in terms of Rights actually
working in that country is exceedingly
difficult copies he chopped he's like
Google just decide it's better not to do
it my god I moved so quickly that we
still have 30 seconds left that's really
impressive well you want to tap dance a
little I guess so no let's talk more
about this autonomous stuff I'm really
interested in that so what did what are
we going to see like one of the things
that I think is really interesting also
with the San Francisco effort is is that
the DMV isn't even involved so yeah if
they get it that's actually one of the
questions because you know technically
they're supposed to have the license for
this but there aren't any better been as
we know how long it actually less on the
road yeah absolutely okay now we're out
of time if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on cnet i'm
ben fox rubin I'm Roger Cheng thanks for
listening you're just too damn good at
your job it's like I don't know I gotta
get through these cuz i was looking at
the time as you were going through them
like this is this is pretty fast I know
or fish you know we got like a megan i
did an amazing job doing the 359 and
tech- so fast really that is our slogan
so tap dance let's jump right into the
chat because there are a number of
skeptics about this autonomous driving
mostly people that are worried about the
drivers jobs but you said there's going
to be a safety driver there in case
flower malfunctions Argos Skynet takes
over that is a temper I mean that's
served the like both I think it helps
psychologically and it helps sort of
ease with the transition i mean the
ultimate goal for uber is to get rid of
the drivers for sure like that's for i
think for them that human
kinds ultimate goal is to render itself
useless well I human grind but companies
like uber I mean that's sort of what
they've that's kind of mission right we
can throw that in with amazon too I mean
the thing is with the delivery drones is
is that this is a great way for them to
lower their shipping costs you're going
to have fewer delivery drivers yeah
there gave me the stuff a lot faster but
on top of that you won't need as many
truck drivers there you won't deal we
want to do to delirium and reunions
right it's another one of those and
there's tips yeah well there are a ton
of delivery people so this is a can of
oil from the car right now yeah so
that's I mean that's uh I think that's
the biggest motivating factor here it's
you know it's not just the whiz-bang
feature of having self-driving car on
the road like it's still eliminate for
uber and particular one of the biggest
x-factors for them into the human driver
right Johnny cab yeah God job that is it
yeah that is a major complication for
them short time he does it yeah they're
those are the people that they they need
those folks so if they push too heavy
into the self-driving car concept then
there's what's going to happen a fine
line because part of their argument in
terms of ubers social impact is that
they give drivers they give people jobs
right they employ tons of folks give
them an opportunity to make money that
goes away though if they start rolling
out of fleet of self-driving cars or
they'll probably have to increase their
employ of mechanics and technicians and
true programmers that is usually what
about accountability so I mean what if
something goes wrong what if there isn't
any that's why there's nothing let's
always be hash to get the ticket the
regulatory there's no regulations around
this that's why I deal with insurance
exactly there there are a number of
regulatory issues that's why we think
that you know pump your brakes in terms
of excitement over this because it's not
coming for a while right it's not coming
in a real way for a while a lot of these
questions still haven't really been
answered you know what kind of site is
gonna sound like I'm joking but like I
enjoy taking an uber ride one smile
because I've had really good experiences
with ya uber drivers themselves yes I
know this area is heavily you know we're
all humans we all have different
personalities but I kind of like
striking up conversation with a new
friend and I personally have had a lot
of really grow
conversations and just like this kind of
cool new dude cool new lady let's chat
it goes for me was interested we're
gonna get like Knight Rider going on in
there hit may well I don't know that
could be the next thing well it'll be
night it'll be kid but kiddo tribe you
will try to sell you something now enjoy
your ride Michael yeah this is what's
gonna have joyride right by the way
there's a Frappuccino right around the
corner do you want to stop by starbucks
first there it is generally this
arrogance that's happening is is that
you're gonna end up having to pay extra
to get a human driver that's what's
gonna happen yeah so interesting I call
out to the chat would you would you pay
slightly slightly less premium to get a
Johnny cab driver though it's that robot
that's there he kind of talks to do you
like the Tory conference wait a min or
so like a fake rogue robot person to you
would you would you pay a slightly
higher premium for that is supposed to
like an actual human driver it's like
that transition for anything the midway
point between an actual human driver
like full-on kit right you'll have
Johnny Kemp so what is going to stop
somebody's face what's going to stop a
passenger from hijack in that car uh
well I mean I think well if the ultimate
is there gonna be no steering column a
altima we should be a steer well the
ultimate evolution is for a car with no
steering column right that's what google
was trying to do with way mo alphabet
and so so you might essentially be in
like a death machine rolling you towards
your ultimate demise and have zero
control is like well this is how I meet
my maker that what happened to jared is
Silicon Valley that's exactly what I was
thinking it hit up in like a shipping
container because he couldn't get out of
the car welcome to the future I do not
like this idea I'm gonna go right out
there and say I do not like this there
are ugly yellow cabs and I agree with
you I enjoy what I'm an uber car I enjoy
talking with the driver especially early
on when it was like a new thing here's
what they do they'll put skype in the
cars so that they'll have a call center
yeah just for like it'll be uber
conversation so if you're lonely good if
you're lonely in the long ride you can
just call a random uber operator mmhmm
yeah well eventually they'll just
replace that with a chat bot oh my god
you won't will at least take a job again
yeah exactly it'll be teh oh man i don't
know i just i don't like this I don't I
mean I'm fascinated by technology this
is cool there's a lot of potential for
but I don't care for in like
taking me and my physical form into
other places because I fear for my
physical form well what about what about
the drones one of the drone thing like
you know that also kind of potentially
eliminates jobs delivery men sure but is
that something that you would be more
willing to embrace the little drone
flying in and drop it off a burrito as a
consumer myself I am less afraid of that
because it's not flying me somewhere I I
am NOT of in favor of more people losing
their jobs but that again means that
there would be more jobs in the
technical building yes manufacturing
construction at warehouses but that
doesn't mean there are people who want
to fill those seats yet you know there
are people who have aspired to be
delivery people who have aspired to work
for the usps to work for the federal
government for the mail they're probably
less than thrilled with this outcome I
don't know unfortunately it's like I
said many many many years away from yeah
of course real application is is that
they really need to figure out a way to
let the public know that this is
actually safe you know because nobody
wants the like a delivery to fall from
the sky and like hit you in the head and
that's that is like a real train yeah
azizul is asking what will happen if
that car suddenly stops it breaks is
there an emergency plan in place I mean
is that all going to be automated those
are all questions answered it's a great
recognize that like look it's uber
drivers get in accidents cab drivers get
in accidents humans are obviously at
least make mistakes and so it's it's
impossible to I don't think you can
assume that any of these vehicles are
going to be one hundred percent safe one
hundred percent of the time that seems
I'm actually pretty I'm pretty unlikely
curious to see how technically savvy
those safety drivers are if they're just
they're basically to take over or are
they like like Marvin gunjan you yeah
are they knowledgeable enough that if
the car breaks down or goes crazy
they're like that person will know to
figure out the problem or troubleshoot
right on the right we all know them
emergency brake pull pull the lever pull
the cable something like that like on
the train yeah there has to be right
there used to be I haven't been in
Pittsburgh so I'm not really sure it's
well I don't know if there is an
emergency
ranked like that because that seems like
that could be dangerous for other
reasons well going more to the social
aspect of this study and we are really
just obliterating our social skills in
the for coming years I went out I went
out to eat the other night and it's like
when I was growing up and I went out to
eat with my family we went out to a
restaurant erson like that or we even
had like a group of people over for
dinner or something like that it at best
you know being a kid and the adults are
adulting and I didn't want to
participate in their political talk at
most I was allowed to have a book at the
table to entertain myself but you know
they got the kids out they were the
tablets and the phones and like they
never want to look up until their mac
and cheese shows up yeah now we're
people gonna ride around in cars and is
that no conversation that affects the
generation before us like even kid yeah
there's a wise man our kids wanted when
I was growing up people were talking
about just like the like the generation
behind us like just four or five years
difference right only there's a lot less
willingness to talk to people like
that's a shame that's why seamless
exists I love talking to you guys well I
don't know why it was very sweet abrigo
we're terrible just that's that's
definitely today well especially since
I'm hacking around mr. Casas pulling the
pessimist card though you know what
where are we going with this that we
ultimately just going to live in our
little bubbles and no one ever talks to
anyone language is one of the greatest
things that humankind can take credit
for yes yeah not text a mystic and not
emojis no not it look the concept of
automation is something that's existed
for you know well over a hundred if not
two hundred years right and automation
has created a lot of positives in
society I know that we're obviously very
concerned about the potential of
seriously disrupting a lot of major
industries but at the same time what are
we supposed to like put our heads in the
sand in like right develop these
technologies sure we should continue to
try to figure out how exactly this is
going to work and whether they are gonna
work for Canadian better places like
more of emergency services type things
you know that morning there we end up
that maybe you know where the where the
actual usage is at the truth of it
sometime there's change though there's
there's gonna be this transition period
we're sure for people organ where
there's pain where people live jobs a
lot of iteration yeah that that happens
with
every you know technological leap and
that just that just happened that's
unfortunately yeah that's just the way
it is right understand I understand it
is just it's kind of difficult to watch
happen cuz ya you can already hear the
workforce like waning into this well I I
think the thing with delivery drones is
is that I've heard this from a number of
analysts that delivery drones it's very
unlikely the delivery drones are ever
going to make it for a very long time
into cities it's much more like yeah
rural and suburban areas where there's
much more grass I can imagine in
Manhattan like drones just flying around
that doesn't mean they have to
completely rewrite the regulations
actually sylviane in the chat points
that out with all the restrictions about
drone flight in city limits with
airports you know they straight up say
we wish amazon good luck with bringing
drones here and gonna leave it to thank
you sylviane for that comment I don't
think it's gonna happen identical rural
areas the suburbs where there's a lot
more air space out there literally
places you can't take a truck up
somebody's 90-degree no driveway yeah I
think it would make a lot more sense for
Amazon to develop pneumatic tubes in
Manhattan where they could just put a
package in the tube and then send it to
you you get it really really quickly you
guys don't like that idea amazon tube I
Jeff your watch the hudsucker proxy
because I mean like I see two right all
I think I wanted the tubes to fine
everywhere I think addy in the chat is a
proponent of having us replaced by
drones on the show IV the drones are
gonna be much better than a way to come
paychecks know or just stroke like the
paycheck the tongue gets the paycheck
doing all the work okay don't go back
and get it to make sure its babies are
fast rope drug Dave who's got a mortgage
to pay yeah going back going back to the
uber thing real quick what about a back
on accountability what if there's a
person in the vehicle who it is
misbehaving of sorts let's say is there
gonna be kept at a passenger or driver
passenger capacity gets in you think all
these cars are gonna be have cameras on
them now I mean some of them already
doing imagine yeah they kind of have to
right there right good do you remember
they're watched by the system all over
again was in there you can't recite the
driver of five and like don't tell my
girlfriend right
oh god yeah yeah you're gonna be watched
there's no lodged I mean that's very
already being watched are we being
watched right now Oh the answer is yeah
this is a safe place for privacy no Ben
we're not being watched at all there's
not like 50 cameras in this room or
anything well but what I feel good okay
lets me freaking out I couldn't freaked
out because my voice was gonna give out
there for a second anyway all right
that's a good place to stop I think
there's a good place to stop Oh
everybody really quick Alfred is going
to be at Trump Tower I think he's
probably at now probably there now yeah
so we're gonna check out cnet later
today and we're probably going to have
more about what happens with the text
summon we're expecting Bezos musk notch
available by yourself Sarge me uh Sheryl
Sandberg facebook yeah yeah I obviously
Tim Cook from Apple basically all the
the largest tech players gathered in one
building right with Trump yeah we'll see
you'll see what happened we'll see if
they make any announcements or any
statement i'm hoping they talk about
this publicly but I mean from I don't
know how you're Rush's with these copies
have been so far but ahead of the round
table didn't fairly kg yeah so we'll see
most of the time like there aren't a lot
of like statements afterwards either Al
Gore showed up and then he came out and
were just like it was very interesting
godspeed Alfred yeah alrighty anyway ok
the 359 podcast is available on iTunes
tune in citro soundcloud feedburner
google play music and of course on cnet
com thanks for listening everybody will
see you tomorrow tomorrow later
