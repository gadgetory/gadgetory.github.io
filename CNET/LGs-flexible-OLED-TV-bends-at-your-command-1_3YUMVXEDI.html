seniors here at CES 2014 taking a look
at some very cool TV tech this is LG's
4k OLED flexible television so what
makes this set so special is the fact
that this screen itself can bend we've
seen a lot of curved TVs coming up in
recent months but this one you actually
have the choice between it being flat or
slightly curved now the way you trigger
that is with a button on the remote
control so it's pretty simple
and it just takes a few seconds to move
from its flat position to curved
position so why would you want it to be
curved LG tells me that having the
screen slightly wrapped around you in
that manner is better for certain things
that you're watching so it's more
immersive for sports or for movies I'd
like to sit down and really put that to
the test
one possible advantage I did spot is
that when it's curved the reflections
that you can see on the TV screen are
slightly muddled so if you've got
windows in the room that you're watching
TV and that could make those reflections
slightly less annoying flexing aside I'm
afraid it won't really come through when
you watch this video but the picture
quality on this thing is absolutely
astounding thanks to the 4k everything
is super super sharp and the OLED panel
technology means that everything is
super colorful very vivid it really
looks gorgeous the bad news is that this
set is not going to be on sale any time
soon LG told me we might be able to see
it next year but this year 2014 is a
no-go but it's a good look at what we
have to look forward to in the future
I'm Luke West great to see net here at
CES 2014 check our CES casino comm for
more
