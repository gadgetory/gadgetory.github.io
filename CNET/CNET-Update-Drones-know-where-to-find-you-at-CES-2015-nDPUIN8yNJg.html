find you I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your scene that update the 2015 Consumer
Electronics Show is just about coming to
an end we've seen quantum dot TV
technology tons of new wearables and
smart home appliances but we found a few
other interesting trends not just on the
show floor but also in the sky drones
are learning new tricks the nixie drone
is almost like a selfie boomerang you
wear it on your arm and when you want a
photo just pop it off and fling it nixie
flies off takes a photo and comes right
back to you the harder your throw the
further it goes airdog is another drone
designed to follow you around and film
you doing action sports like
skateboarding biking or surfing it
follows the Bluetooth signal on your
armband it has attachments for different
action cameras for the demo they tied a
string to the drone as a precaution but
it doesn't need a rope to know where you
are there are a few other drones that
also know how to find you the Zano is a
palm-sized quadcopter that knows where
it is in relation to your smartphone and
drones are getting smaller to the hub
sand nano q4 is the world's smallest
quadcopter no bigger than a business
card also at the show there's a movement
toward high definition audio there are
some music players that play
uncompressed sound from files that are
said to be better than CD quality the
pono player stands out with its
triangular shape and bright yellow
finish this is a device backed by Neil
Young and it plays high resolution audio
from the pono music web store it costs
four hundred dollars available now in
the US and it's coming to Canada and the
UK soon sony debuted a new walkman that
also plays high resolution audio but
it's more than twice the price of the
pono it uses android so you can load
streaming apps on it and it's available
in the spring 3d printing is also
growing for the first time we're seeing
food printers at the show the 3d systems
chef jet prints sugar and chocolate it
can make little sugar sculptures and
candies I had one it tasted like a sweet
tart but it just dissolves in your mouth
it'll cost under $5,000 XYZ printing has
a cheaper 3d food printer that can make
cake
decorations for about two thousand
dollars the 3doodler two point O lets
you build plastic figures freehand it's
like a hot glue gun and now it comes
with a battery so it's portable MakerBot
showcased a new type of filament that
prints objects made with real metal
stone and wood it's actually a mixture
of some metal powder or wood powder with
other filament to make the object look
like natural materials that does it for
update from CES but you can dive in
deeper for all the show coverage at CES
