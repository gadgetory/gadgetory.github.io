split personality I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update when you can't
decide between an Android tablet and a
Windows 8 laptop now a sous put both in
one with the transformer book trio in
its laptop form the trio can switch
between windows 8 and Android but if you
separate the screen it acts as an
Android tablet the keyboard half can be
docked to any monitor to boot up windows
it's said to get up to 15 hours of
battery life in tablet mode but asus
hasn't said how much this would cost or
will go on sale it's just one of the
many new devices were seen this week at
the Computex computer Expo in Taiwan
also at the expo acer announced a new
all-in-one desktop computer and get this
it runs Android 4.0 this 21 and a half
inch touchscreen is loaded with Android
instead of Windows the list price is
four hundred and eighty dollars but you
can find it for around four hundred or
less at other resellers and a sous
showed off a sleek-looking ultrabook the
zenbook affinity which is encased in
gorilla glass 3 it's a material that's
tough and resistant to scratches and
scuffs but we'll have to wait until
later this year for more details about
the zenbook infinity it'll come out by
September we're seeing more laptops
lately with Gorilla Glass including the
Acer Aspire s7 and that's not the only
gadget news samsung announced its coming
out with more sizes for the galaxy tab 3
along with the already announced 7 inch
version there will be an 8 inch and a 10
inch model these new tablets will run
Android 4.2 and they'll have two cameras
for the front and back sides they'll
come with either 16 or 32 gigs of
storage and there will be versions for
Wi-Fi as well as wireless 3g and 4g when
it goes on sale sometime this month and
an apple news cnet has learned that
apple's much closer to launching a free
streaming radio product it has just made
a licensing deal with warner music group
and it reached a deal with universal
last month but negotiations are still
going on with Sony this streaming radio
product perhaps called I radio would
compete against services like Pandora
Apple may unveil it next week at its
developers conference android users can
now jump in on the quirky video sharing
trend that is the vine app Twitter six
second looping video app is now
available on Android it launched in
January for people with iphones and
ipads and it gained 13 million users
what makes vine a little different is
that you can start and stop the
recording multiple times so you create
stop motion animations that's your tech
news update you can find more details on
these stories at cnet com / update from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
