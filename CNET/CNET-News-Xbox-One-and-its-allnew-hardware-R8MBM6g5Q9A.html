connected and ready it's an elegant
design that meets the needs of the new
generation the heart of that system is
raw power from 500 million transistors
and 512 megs of ram in the xbox 360 to
over five billion transistors in 8
gigabytes of RAM and Xbox one USB 3 0
Wi-Fi direct a blu-ray drive a native
64-bit architecture and variable power
states all while delivering practically
silent operation this is a modern
powerful box engineered to deliver now
and well into the future but it's how we
Marshall that power how we create the
system that works to deliver the world's
greatest games and provides the
flexibility to power entirely new
connected experiences to do this we've
brought technology from across Microsoft
to create an industry first the soul of
the new system is the xbox one
architecture three operating systems in
one the first is the best of our Xbox
operating system made even better by
providing deep in its and access to the
hardware so that creators have no limits
in harnessing the power of Xbox one for
cinematic realism the second is the
kernel of windows providing consistent
access to web powered applications and
experiences flexible powerful simple the
third connects these two operating
systems to create instant switching
multitasking and effortless control only
Microsoft and Xbox could bring this
level of power performance and
sophistication to the living room and it
changes everything the xbox one
architecture enables the new experiences
that you just saw from Yousaf there's no
waiting you can switch to your game like
it's a TV channel flip you can snap
Internet Explorer in the new Star Trek
movie but how did the TV no use of and
react to his voice we're bringing a new
Kinect sensor paired with every xbox one
which puts you at the center of your
entertainment connect is completely
redesigned to respond
instantly to you your voice and your
gestures voice is now more
conversational it's faster and it
supports the entire family and our new
proprietary time-of-flight measures the
time about 13 billionths of a second
that it takes individual photons to
bounce off of you to create
unprecedented accuracy and precision
over to gigabits of data per second to
understand your world this is rocket
science level stuff games and
applications will create new experiences
like you've never seen before</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
