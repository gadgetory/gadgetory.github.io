has it the show that rounds up the
week's biggest tech rumors you can vote
on what you think about the rumors too
in the interactive player if you're
watching on cnet this week Samsung is
looking to the future rather quickly the
color gold seems to be making the rounds
and twitter is all about shaking things
up let's get started first up at Aoife a
couple weeks ago much to nobody surprise
samsung announced its contender in the
SmartWatch ring the galaxy gear
according to Korean new site media a
galaxy gear 2 is already in production
say what the next version of samsung
Smart Watch will offer GPS improved
battery life and support for a greater
array of Android devices the galaxy gear
can currently pair only with Samsung's
Galaxy Note 3 the gear too could be
unveiled at next year CES in January or
mobile world congress in February it's
obvious that there will eventually be a
gear too but why would there be one so
close to the announcement of the first
one according to the sources the first
one is just there to test the waters of
the market before Samsung releases a
more finely tuned device nice Samsung if
this is true they're going to be a lot
of galaxy gear wearing suckers out there
who wish that they would have waited a
few months here at rumor has it we love
to speculate on colors we did it with
the iphone 5c the 5s and now it looks
like it's HTC's turn a china-based sina
weibo user published photos of what the
person says is a new HTC one featuring a
gold finish much like the iphones gold
finish it makes sense to write this off
as just a prototype or some fancy
photoshop work but according to engadget
that same person once showed a picture
of a blue HTC One which was subsequently
announced by the company so maybe he or
she has some credibility after all
either way it appears that gold is the
new orange is the new black would you be
into a gold phone let me know in the
comments and finally Twitter shook up
the social media world last week when it
tweeted that it's fine
for an IPO and according to report from
all things D it's looking to shake
things up a little bit more according to
sources Twitter will totally redo its
iOS app the new design will swap the
current tab structure for a variety of
media rich feeds that users can swipe
through it would include the standard
stream of tweets in reverse
chronological order a feed that
highlights interactions and
conversations a photos only feed and a
stream dedicated to TV related tweets so
no more breaking bad spoilers in your
feed unless you switch to the
appropriate tab I use tweetbot for all
my Twitter needs but this change might
be interesting enough that I could
switch to the native app what do you
guys think will this help first-time
Twitter users do you use twitter would
you if these changes came about don't
forget to vote and leave a comment and
ask the cnet council what it thinks the
cnet councils composed of five editors
who cast their votes anonymously their
opinions are not an endorsement by cnet
or CBS interactive obviously because
these are rumors folks and the cnet
councils verdict is yes they think that
twitter will revamp its iOS apps to hook
more users and make it easier to use one
editor I asked said that they should
since the current iOS app kind of sucks
that's our show everybody please share
your rumors at rumor has it at cnet com
or call us at 1 800 750 cnet and tweet
us and tune in next week for more tech
