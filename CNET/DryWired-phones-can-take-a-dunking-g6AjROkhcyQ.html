cnet.com and we are at mobile world
congress 2013 in barcelona right now
we're taking a first look at a really
interesting technology by a company
called dry wired and what they do is
basically coat phones with something
that uses a nano technology to basically
coat the inside components and also the
outside of the device to protect against
water they could say that it is almost
totally waterproof not quite so it's
very water resistant can survive water
submersion for about 30 minutes in a one
meter or about three feet so we're going
to just take a look and see how that'll
work we've got a galaxy note 2 here and
I'll start the timer and we're just
going to dunk it in the water this is
something I would never want to do with
my phone I have to tell you there we go
you can see the counter running
everything's fine the phone is ticking
away and we can leave this in here for
about 30 minutes without any issues
interesting thing about dry wired is
that they want to get into company's
products from the beginning so they can
put this technology into phones as
they're made and then also they want to
give it to retailers to do the same
thing two phones and after you purchase
the phone it also will work with tablets
to any sort of electronic device so as
you can see this galaxy note 2 is
sitting under water spin here for about
three minutes now apparently you can
leave this in for up to 30 minutes
without any issues and all you got to do
is just reach in here grab it and
everything is fine here it's a little
wet as you can tell but I can stop a
timer the screen is not affected buttons
no problem and there you have it
completely water resistant almost
waterproof so there you have it folks we
just took a look at the new technology
from dry wired which will protect your
phone against splashes and water I'm
