everything you have it had to be stored
somewhere everything so for me
storage is like the most underrated
aspect of computing now the good news is
harddrive become really cheap and really
high capacity there are three things you
want to think about when buying storage
the capacity the speed and the poster
price Intel capacity you want the
largest possible that you can pay for
now anything between 500 gigabyte and
one terabyte is generally enough for
most of us for daily use but you can get
more up to ten tear bag or even more
than that in network server quite a bit
in fiscal size but can give you a lot to
store space but sometime you don't
really need a lot of capacity you want
something that's fast
for example your laptop or your desktop
you want to boot really fast and to all
the application logs really fast so in
this case you want the speed and I would
recommend getting a solid state drive
which is a dry but has no moving part
and when you want to access something
it's like instance you can true between
two and a forty gigabyte terabyte or
even two terabyte and finally is the
price now if you have to cut a balance
between how fast and how musters you
want and how much you can pay for higher
price does not always mean better
because you want to buy something that
actually worked for your situation if
you're shopping for store it and you go
to see net I think the best place to be
is the best list where we list the best
devices occurred to different categories
and then you can look at the in-depth
review of each of them we do very
thorough testing at first we look at the
devices as though we are a new home user
and try to figure them out and then we
look at them from the perspective of an
expert and to figure out how good they
are compared with others now while I put
a thing about storage is that you have
to do things when everything is doing
well don't wait until something happen
before I do something so you want to
upgrade your backup or make your backups
when everything is working well
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
