what it takes to put HTC and Windows
Phone back on the map
I'm Jessica Dahl chord Francini and I
say yes now this is definitely a
flagship phone for HTC it's got a lot of
high-end specs and it's gonna be on a
lot of carriers specifically a Verizon
AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile it's gonna cost $1.99
it also comes in a variety of colors
I've got the California blue color here
which is my personal favorite but it
also comes in red a bright yellow and
black now what's interesting about this
phone couple things so it's got this
really beautiful design that even though
it's really simple it looks very sleek
it's got this really ultra black rim on
the display and the color really shines
through here on the speaker grille and
also around the sides on the back it's
much more simple looking has a soft
touch finish kind of rubbery so it
doesn't look altra premium here but it
is very comfortable to hold and it does
kind of bow out
so HTC is calling that sort of their
pillow look like somebody took a flat
live tile and they puff some air in it
be that as it may it is comfortable to
hold and looks really nice on the front
it's got Windows Phone 8 operating
system that's the one that Microsoft
just announced there is a 4.3 inch Super
LCD 2 screen on here
it's got HD resolution so it's very
bright and sharp that means it's really
nice to look at all of these live tiles
here and to deal with them open up read
web sites and of course scroll around
and navigate there are a lot of theme
colors you can choose from and HTC adds
its own signature blue theme now there
are many core features on here one of
them is going to be actually resizing
the widgets on the home screen so you
can choose small medium and large sizes
for those widgets there another feature
is tap and Sun which uses NFC to be able
to send things like documents contacts
URLs and photos from one compatible
phone to another Microsoft Office 2013
is also on board Nokia Maps runs the
mapping portion and although it does
have turn-by-turn directions there's no
voice navigation however you should be
able to integrate third-party apps and
get your voice now that way there's also
being search
on here as usual there are a couple new
features with being searched to give you
more headlines and more information
upfront you can also use voice search as
well back to the hardware there is
support for 4G LTE and HSPA+ for
t-mobile specifically there's also a 1.5
gigahertz dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
s4 plus processor which just means that
it's really fast there's a 2 megapixel
front-facing camera that will allow you
to do video chats and on the back
there's an 8 megapixel camera with LED
flash overall this phone is a really
nice package it's easy to slip in your
pocket and carry around it's pretty to
look at people want to grab it up when
they see it and I think this is an
excellent effort by HTC and by Microsoft
with Windows Phone 8 I'm Jessica's
all-court in the system the HTC Windows
Phone 8 X you can read the full review
