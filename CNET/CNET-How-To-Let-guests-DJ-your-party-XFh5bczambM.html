party but the idea is spending hours
perfectly crafting the nights worth of
music is enough to make me not want to
throw a party at all Donald bell today
I'm going to show you how to get rid of
the anxiety of DJing your own party by
putting your friends to work the key to
this particular method is a free app
called jukebox heroes available for both
the iphone and for android and in a lot
of ways it works just like a regular
jukebox you fill it up with music and
your guests get to play songs using free
credits while I'm waiting for my guests
to arrive i'm going to set up my jukebox
which in this case is my phone you get
started i'm going to launch the app then
tap create your jukebox now you have to
sign up for a free account using either
facebook or your email address and then
it's time to give your jukebox a name
that your guests are going to recognize
and a location if you like then define
what songs the jukebox is going to play
you can choose your entire music
collection or restricted just to a
specific playlist tap create and be
given a chance to invite your friends to
join in we're going to wait on that for
now and there you go your music should
start playing right away now to get this
connected up to your home stereo there's
a couple different ways you could go you
can go to aux cable and connect this up
right to your home stereo if you're
pretty trusting with your friends or you
get a bluetooth speaker but then you
kinda have to worry about wireless range
for iphone users your best bet is to
stream over airplay either to an apple
TV or to an airport base station or to
an airplay compatible speaker system to
shoot this music over to the apple TV
here i'm going to double tap on the home
button flick the tray over here to the
right and then tap the air play button
to select my Apple TV
all right now the hard part is done just
in time since my guests are starting to
arrive as they do I'm just going to tell
them to download jukebox hero to control
the music for hearing Eric here showed
up with the Galaxy Note 2 android phone
he'll download the app from the Play
Store and when he opens it up he should
find the party jukebox i created is
nearby you'll need to sign up either
using facebook or email which is kind of
a pain but the payoff is worth while
once he gets connected it's time to
start picking some songs the interface
shows you which song is currently
playing along to look ahead of upcoming
tracks and a history of previously
played songs and people who join the
jukebox you can also see how many
credits you have to spend by default
each guest is given 25 credits to start
to add a song to the growing cue tap
this button here you can browse the
collection of available songs select the
track and you'll be presented with three
options each one comes with a price you
can add the song to the back of the
queue for one credit and patiently wait
for it to come around
if Flynn doesn't want to wait too long
she can use a few more credits and add
the song so it plays next after the
current song and if Ryan really wants to
change the song and doesn't want to wait
you can make a play right now for a
hefty premium this prevents any one
particular person from dominating the
playlist and also makes it expensive to
be the jerk keeps booting off other
people's music of course is your party
and it's your jukebox so you're in
control you get unlimited credits so you
can play whatever you like and you can
skip a track whenever you like complete
with the satisfying record scratch sound
sorry guys sorry carry on that's really
all there is to it but here's some extra
tips to help keep your party running
smoothly first off it really is worth
the time to create even a very general
playlist of party appropriate tunes
nobody selects a track the jukebox is
going to pick one at random from
whatever playlist you've defined that's
great to prevent dead air but it could
get embarrassing second check the
settings on your jukebox up here in the
right corner you can change the default
number of credits or give people more
credits to spend if they're running low
you can also use this to blast out a
little text announcement to people using
the jukebox
so really that's all there is to it
that's how to get your friends to DJ
your party for you more tips like this
