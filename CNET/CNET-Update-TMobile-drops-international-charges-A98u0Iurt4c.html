international plans I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your CNET update t-mobile is
eliminating international roaming fees
for data and text messages and it has
simplified international calling rates
charging a fixed price of 20 cents per
minute when abroad this pricing change
will take effect for current customers

here is the breakdown if you're a
t-mobile customer with the simple choice
plan and you travel outside the US calls
are 20 cents a minute texting is
unlimited data also unlimited but it's
slower at 2g speeds and you can't tether
if you need faster speed while t-mobile
is happy to sell it to you as a speed
pack that starts at $15 for one day of
high-speed up to 100 megabytes now for
customers that are in the US and call
out to other countries there's a new $10
monthly talk and text plan texting is
unlimited calls to landline phones are
also unlimited for certain countries but
if you call another mobile phone that's
20 cents a minute or less depending on
the country with other carriers if you
don't have an international plan and you
use your phone in another country it's
easy to rack up a bill in one day that's
over $1,000 with team level there's no
extra plan needed talking for a half
hour cost you six dollars t-mobile also
made aggressive moves this year by
eliminating contracts in exchange for
cheaper service plans and it added an
early phone upgrade program other
carriers followed by offering different
flavors of these concepts so it's
possible AT&amp;amp;T Verizon and Sprint may
follow t-mobile by also changing
