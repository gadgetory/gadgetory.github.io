appliances here and today we're talking
about the Electrolux ultra power studio
so this stick vacuum costs three hundred
and forty nine dollars that's more than
some of the other models we tested so we
wanted to know what makes this one
special and it does offer a couple of
special features that the Hoover Linx
for example doesn't have it has three
different cleaning modes silent normal
and booster it has cute LED headlights
it has this transparent nozzle so you
can see the brush roll and I think the
design is maybe a little cuter than the
Hoover it has this dark blue and orange
thing going which is nice all around
it's very nice but it performed pretty
badly in our test out of all of the six
stick vacuums we tested this one
finished in the bottom tier every single
time it kind of feels like Electrolux
missed the mark here especially because
they're less expensive stick vacuum the
Ergo rapido performed better so while it
looks nice and it has some cute features
I would recommend skipping this model if
you love Electrolux get the Ergo rapido
it is less expensive and it performed a
little bit better but if you just want a
great traditional stick vacuum I would
go for the Hoover Linx it's only a
hundred and seventy nine dollars and it
performed fantastic thanks for watching
