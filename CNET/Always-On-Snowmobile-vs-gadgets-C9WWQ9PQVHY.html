we're here at the base of Mount Shasta
in beautiful Northern California we're
on our way to the Mount Shasta ski park
where we have a bunch of gadgets and a
layer of fresh snow to torture test them
in I have an iphone 5 a Nokia Lumia 920
and a kindle fire just for the heck of
it we're going to put them all through
their paces in a series of ski related
torture tests ranging from green circle
to Blue Square to Black Diamond let's
see how they do I think this is a green
circle drop test because i'm pretty sure
that all these devices are going to
survive but we'll be dropping them one
at a time from the ski lift starting
with our little of iphone nokia lumia
and finally kindle fire i think it's
gonna shock some people on the chairlift
hmm iphone 5 ha oops Oh nokia lumia man
this is slippery oops and finally the
kindle fire oops
oh that was expensive we'll be back
hopefully we're going to find those
again
I dropped the kindle in some pretty
beaten so though all right how you doing
buddy seriously the hardest part about
this torture test is taking new things
up out of the snow kind of adds to their
little torture there okay how you doing
oh it's on freaking out a little bit
screens changing back and forth however
it is responsive generally functional
the screen is like a tiny bit slow but
other than that it's all right kindle
fire is okay all right let's keep moving
what's next definitely want the iphone
to be okay it was me on purpose we're
testing it to see if it can survive oh
that makes perfect sense of them okay
iphone attracting a lot of attention
after falling from the lift but you
gotta say despite a little bit of
moisture and you know like a medium
length ball I mean it's a soft landing
so it's not like it was going to break
but the moisture in the cold do not seem
to be affecting it iPhone 5 is just fine
Nokia Lumia 920 had a pretty soft
landing like right on a little groomed
part all right let's see let's get our
power going here another screen no
problem we did say that this was the
green circle test and so far all the
gadgets having a pretty easy time with
the chairlift but little do they know
what's coming next this is a ski jump
and our intrepid assistant nick is going
to snowboard down jump and it ideally
land on one maybe all of these gadgets
and we're going to see how they can take
the impact okay Nick your gadgets are
placed are you in place all right let me
give you the go sign and just be careful
buddy
oh are you okay
your neck is so cool
oh that was odd are you okay all right
so you have the easy target kindle which
is not cracked just a little cold see if
we can turn this guy on kindle fires
coming on kindle fire takes a direct hit
Pierce VA okay iphone looks like these
actually may have just escaped like I've
got a nice carve line right next to him
but i think i think his body definitely
hit him huh there was impact everything
got hit let's turn this guy on iphone
good to go okay nokia lumia plus is sort
of like you know a double whammy snow
test since they've all been hanging out
here nokia lumia this is coming on nokia
lumia 920 okay check I thought Nick was
so impressive and hear everything is
working fine alright I think it's time
to take things up a notch we've been
pretty easy on our gadgets so far it's
time to go black diamonds on the bearcat
we're going to snowmobile over the Nokia
Lumia 920 the kindle fire and the iphone
now the nokia and the kindle they're
going and protected the iphone though is
encased in this side o obex hardcore
ballistic style case and we're going to
see if somehow this helps it survive the
pressure of my little arctic cat right
here
you know
alright I'm going for the middle this
time
you guys see the Kindle
is it stuck on me
the kindle stuck on my snowmobile let's
do one more run see if I was doing okay
here we go
alright
I think it's probably time to see how
these guys are doing poor kindle got
dragged twice around oh yeah oh yes we
have done significant damage to the
Lumia 920 we've pretty much shattered
the screen although it looks like the
screen is kind of blacked out right here
on the left side but still on on the
right side despite some pretty major
damage to the glass now the back though
the back is in perfect condition I bet
the camera even works maybe we'll take
it inside and see however I think we're
going to have to say that this one
generally speaking did not survive the
snowmobile attack next all right iphone
5 in the side oo Beck's case I'm not
seeing any signs of damage right off the
bat in fact kind of remarkably even this
little clip dealy it's still intact I
see no cracks maybe a little scratch
there a lot of snow and it comes on the
iphone seems to have been well protected
so compared to the Nokia this one got
off pretty easy alright let's go find
that poor kindle anybody want to take
bets on this one it went around twice
stuck underneath the snowmobile see here
you still have the scratch see the
cracks on the back oh yeah and we have a
shattered screen not too surprising
really kind of a nice spider web pattern
in the Sun there let's see if we can get
it to come on
nothing so far oh yeah Wow ok I'd like
the 920 Kindle Fire doesn't even come on
this one is a straight-up fail</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
