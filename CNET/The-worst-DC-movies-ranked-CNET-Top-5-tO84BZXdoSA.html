the DC extended universe is now up to
five movies so now it's time to rank
them let's get to it and number five is
Wonder Woman this is still the best DC
movie by a longshot
Wonder Woman shows a strong caring lead
character what a concept
it had humor and a good deal of action
that end fight is kind of a mess but
that doesn't take the whole movie down
with it at number four is Justice League
with Joss Whedon pitching in Justice
League shows what could be a tonal shift
in the DC EU we see a Superman who
smiles we continue to see Batman move
like Batman the film even used both
characters iconic themes by Danny Elfman
and John Williams okay on the bad side
Batman continues to demonstrate a lack
of intelligence and it also suffers from
it in fights similar to Wonder Woman
it's a mess coming in at number three is
Man of Steel this movie tried to ground
Superman but went too far into the
darkness I'm not talking about Superman
killing Zod Superman is killed in the
comics before nobody wants to watch a
sad mopey Superman and that's when we
got with Man of Steel points for trying
something different though
number two a fitting number is Batman V
Superman dawn of Justice let's talk
about the good things in this movie
because we all know the bad Martha
Batman in this film actually moves
around like Batman does in the comics
he's quick and he could take out an
entire game by himself and I think
that's about it there's only one left
and we're talking about you Suicide
Squad best parts of the movie the flash
and the Batman cameos the movies
disjointed unfunny and boring at times
anybody want to talk about the Joker in
this thing what's not good don't agree
with me on the order of this list or
think I was too lenient on the Justice
League let me know am i as after no see
you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
