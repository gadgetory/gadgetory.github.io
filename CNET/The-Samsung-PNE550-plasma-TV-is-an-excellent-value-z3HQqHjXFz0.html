this is the samsung pn e 550 series i'm
standing next to the 51 inch version
this TV also comes in a 60 and a 64 inch
size this review will apply to all three
this is Samsung's least expensive plasma
TV for 2012 to feature Smart TV and 3d
features talk about those in a little
bit but first I'll talk about something
else that distinguishes this TV from its
higher-end brethren that's the bezel
around the edge it's glossy black and a
little bit thicker than seen on some of
the higher-end Samsung plasmas not too
bad-looking however there's also this
nice transparent edge and the
transparent stock that supports the TV
and allows this TV to swivel of course
it's a glass top stand to complete the
look which is pretty slick in my opinion
Samsung Smart TV suite is probably the
most capable on the market unless you
count Google TV this TV has hundreds of
apps available in the app market of
course the video ones the ones you care
about and the most important video one
is actually HBO Go which is an exclusive
to this television so HBO subscribers
can use the HBO Go app to stream pretty
much anything in the HBO catalog the app
really works very well and I appreciated
the navigation the search which is an
improvement on Roku zap all told it's a
really nice app to use but again limited
to HBO subscribers the set is missing
Amazon Instant but it does have all the
other major apps including Netflix Vudu
and YouTube which are all you know again
pretty well integrated into the set
Samsung Smart TV interface is a little
bit crowded and you can customize it but
one of these you can't do is get rid of
these proprietary apps here which
include family story and a few other
relatively content-heavy but again
Samsung proprietary apps TV also has a
built-in web browser which if you use
the standard remote control is really
painful to use Samsung does sell a $99
optional keyboard however that does make
web browsing a little bit easier like
all the Samsung 3d TVs this year it
includes two sets of 3d glasses that's a
step up from most the other major
manufacturers that don't include any 3d
glasses with our active TVs other
glasses don't fit all that well however
especially if you're using prescription
lenses but again they're free you can
buy additional pairs for a twenty bucks
apiece
Samsung connectivity is standard there's
three HDMI inputs two USB inputs and a
component video input there's no PC
input but I don't consider that a major
omission
Samsung's picture settings on this set
include two point grayscale it doesn't
have the ten point or the color
management system found on higher in
Samsung TVs it's also has a cinema
smooth setting but we really didn't find
that to do anything unlike the step-up
TVs where it does improve film cadance
that takes us to picture quality which
on this TV was very good the black
levels are nice and deep but not quite
as deep as we've seen on some competing
similarly priced Panasonic plasmas so
that's actually a point against me if
you're comparing between the two color
is also very good on the set and we
appreciated the off angle and uniformity
characteristics which as we'd expect
from plasma were pretty much perfect on
the downside the bright room picture
quality this set is again less than some
of the other higher-end Samsung TVs and
Panasonic TVs we've seen it really
doesn't reject that ambient light as
well as a lot of screen finishes so you
end up with a little more washed out
appearance to the picture and brighter
lighting 3d picture quality was also a
little bit disappointing there was too
much crosstalk compared to a lot of the
competitors that's a quick look at
Samsung's a PNG 550 plasma TV I'm David
