your headphone which cost three hundred
dollars and looks nearly identical to
the beats solo2 wireless the big
difference is on the inside as a solo
three uses Apple's new w1 custom
Bluetooth chip which improves battery
life drastically and makes pairing the
headphone with Apple devices dead simple
headphone works just fine with Android
and other Bluetooth enabled devices and
the battery life rating is the same for
iOS and Android it's a whopping 40 hours
that's a huge jump over the 12 hours
that the beats solo2 wireless is rated
at and this has the best battery life of
any bluetooth headphone I've tested so
far
it also features beats fast fuel feature
which gives you one hour battery life
from a five minute charge however unlike
the new beats X which uses a lightning
cable for charging his model sticks with
a microUSB charging cable my wireless
connection using the headphone was
rock-solid and the W one chip makes it
easy to switch between Apple devices
you've paired the headphones with
overall the headphone performs very well
I've always liked its compact size and
how it folds up to fit into a relatively
small carrying case for better wear
speeds hasn't upgraded to sound this
sounds very good for on-ear bluetooth
headphone will appear two bass lovers
who prefer sound profile accentuates the
bass but manages to avoid being too
gloomy / it doesn't sound quite as clean
as beats more balanced studio wireless /
ear model which has come down in price
and is better sounding and arguably more
comfortable ultimately beats value
proposition is that it's taken the same
headphone that so many people know and
love and improved its battery life
dramatically it made it really easy for
Apple users to connect to their phones
and other Apple devices that's fine but
it would have been nice it beats it
brought down the price at the same time
considering the headphones design and
sound hasn't been upgraded I'm David
Carney for cnet.com thanks
