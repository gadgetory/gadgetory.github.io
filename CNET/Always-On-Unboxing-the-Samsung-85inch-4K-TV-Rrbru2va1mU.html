samsung's 85 inch UHD s 9 television you
know the one of the easel yeah it's
right here it's pretty big
you didn't hear sure you would have no
problem finding some living room space
for this okay whoa oh okay so this box
has the one Kinect so this is what they
call the jack pack which is basically a
standalone box that connects to the back
of the TV and has all the inputs in it
Oh our 3d glasses forceps TV accessories
oh this is the smart touch control so it
has a look at this it's got like a
little but this is your little
navigation pad here this is so exciting
you know how like I've been all excited
about Samsung's like eco packaging this
is not that
okay this is the panel where the one
connect box goes so that's basically the
heart and soul and brain of the TV so
you got one end that plugs into the
television okay this guy one connect
okay and then this already starts to
make your TV look uglier let's cover it
up so that's about all the setup that I
am gonna do I'm gonna call in the
experts to finish off the rest while I
do the specs this 4k TV screen is a
whopping 85 inches which is why it comes
with it's very own easel stand so that
you don't have to wall mount it and you
can tilt it up or down it features
Samsung's new Smart Hub software with
built-in voice and motion control plus a
built-in pop-up camera it's powered by a
quad-core processor so you can actually
do nice fast web browsing on it
the display is ultra high-definition 4k
so it's 4096 by 2160p resolution that is
compared to 1080p which is 1920 by 1080
it's four times the resolution and when
you have 4k content it looks amazing
upscaling also reportedly looks amazing
from either standard def or from blu-ray
this TV has built-in Wi-Fi and four HDMI
connections plus three USB ports it
comes with a powerful built-in sound
system it's built right into the easel
frame its Dolby and DTS premium sound it
also includes a smart touch remote
control and four pairs of 3d glasses the
TV has motion control and the feature
lets me navigate through screens and
pinch to zoom in pictures why did it
have to admit though I'm never gonna do
that except to show up plus my arms got
tired now in case you're worried about
any of this technology going out of
style since it's built into a really
heavy easel the s9 includes upgrades
free for at least a year if not more
those may include software upgrades to
accommodate future 4k hardware
requirements or even processor updates
pastand the s9 weighs 189 pounds and the
total cost is thirty nine thousand nine
hundred ninety nine dollars and ninety
nine cents for more information on the
f9 go check out our editors take @c
Netcom
alright let's talk about picture quality
for a little while so this is blu-ray
content it's being up scaled to
something close to 4k and it's like the
fancy blu-ray demo reel to make it look
as good as possible so we're gonna watch
a little bit of this and then we're
gonna plug in some 4k content because
now I know the big complain about 4k is
that there's not very much content
available but we're gonna at least look
at it and see if we can see the
difference okay look at this you can see
this detail kind of all the way here at
the bottom like you can actually see
pedestrians right here a little 3d
effect from how kind of weirdly real it
looks you can see individual cars on the
road here
look at this detail I mean I've heard
people say that you can't see the
difference between HD and 4k and I'm
sorry I'm here to tell you that I think
that's ludicrous and I'm sad to say that
you will not be able to see the
difference when you're watching this at
home because you don't have a 4k display
but just take my word for it this looks
amazing
trust me alright we've seen the 4k
content we've seen the up scaled blu-ray
content both of those looked amazing now
it's time to check out the upscaling on
some web-based content now we're
streaming always-on because we don't
want to get sued over Ethernet so the
video quality should be decent let's see
how the upscaling can do
thank you bye
noisy I mean granted we can chalk some
of that up to streaming but just saying
you got this thing you want to stream
some content from YouTube it's almost
like a little bit of a drawback that
it's so big
all that said this particular television
is not for anyone to actually buy it
cost forty thousand dollars and they
only made 250 of them it's for rich
people in Saudi Arabian princes but the
s9 series is accessible to mere mortals
there's a 65 inch version 55 inch
version and they're kind of just a look
at the future of 4k TVs and make no
mistake in five or ten years you're all
gonna have one
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
