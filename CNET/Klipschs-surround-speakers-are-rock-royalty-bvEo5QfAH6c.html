then one of the hardest decisions you'll
have to make also than which blu-ray
player or receiver to buy is which
speakers to get and if you have twenty
five hundred dollars to spend
then clich may have the product for you
the clips reference premiere RP 160 home
theater system is a 5.1 system that
features the company's new RP 160 stand
mount speakers in addition to a pair of
buy poles for the rears Klipsch is
famous for its horn mounted tweeters and
the company has completely redesigned
the tweeter for the reference premiere
series with a new horn design and a
plastic wave guide for the one-inch
titanium driver the speakers though do
keep the Sarah metallic woofers from
previous designs if you don't mind this
size or their marcher looks the RP 160
system is an excellent surround sound
package while it lacks some refinement
it's much better with music than the
previous reference to series as also
able to go very very loud if you like
rock music
I'd say audition these immediately but
it's home theater where these speakers
really shine the large sub does a good
job of low-end while the center channel
is able to live a clean sounding
dialogue sure it's not the cheapest
surround system you can buy but for the
money no other system we've heard has
the same mix of agility with rock music
and movies the clips reference premiere
RP 160 home theater system is highly
recommended
