do's and don'ts sweet by the way what on
earth is this emojis have been around
for a long time now invented in 1999 in
Japan when surfing the web it was still
a thing people said that's why there are
so many different pictures and meanings
you might not know about like the women
with bunny ears I'm Lexie civilities for
cnet time to drop some truth bombshells
about the do's and don'ts of emoji first
up do you know what your emoji really
mean or don't use them triangles above
the hands or as I like to call it the
Doritos salute this one actually means
celebration not your love of grey corn
chips home is where the heart is no well
commit to the love hotel this one might
look like how you feel after eating one
too many jalapenos but it's actually a
face of triumph I don't get it either
whistle while you work definitely don't
send this one to your boss because it's
actually blowing a kiss hay fever maybe
it's just a tired face person who just
had a ketchup bottle explode on their
face guess again because it's a pouting
face now on to the don'ts do not mix up
your emojis if you're texting someone to
say their dog is really sick this is not
the same as this and will just make you
look like this that first one is a loud
crying face and the second one is tears
of joy don't confuse them unless you're
a cat sending that message then you
could probably use this one don't just
use the default emoji keyboard for
iPhone and Android there are many other
options like SwiftKey emoji plus plus or
hip emoji never be lost for emoji
okay so now you know a bit more about
emoji here's a pop quiz see if you can
decipher this that says baby I'm
breaking up with you gotta run see ya
but remember you should never ever break
up with someone using emoji unless you
want to be known as one of these in a
mochi land this can have another meaning
apart from peach but you're actually one
of these if you have your own emoji do's
and don'ts or want to find out what a
particular emerging means hit me up on
Twitter at lexus of EDS or leave a
