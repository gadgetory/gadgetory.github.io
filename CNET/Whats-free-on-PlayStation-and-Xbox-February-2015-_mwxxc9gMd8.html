numark so you know what that means
there's new free games available on
playstation plus and the xbox live games
with gold subscription services okay so
let's see what februari has in store for
PlayStation Plus members on the ps4 it's
one of my favorite indie games of 2014
transistor this is totally unique an
action RPG that you must check out next
is apathy on I don't know anything about
apathy on because it's brand new and it
looks like it's a 2d action platformer
thing with the Greek mythology theme
going on moving over to ps3 playstation
plus members get free access to yeah cos
of 4 and thief but you know what even at
the price of free thief is still a rip
off this month betta owners will get
rogue legacy which is also a ps4 and ps3
cross by title and it's my favorite game
out of the entire PlayStation Plus bunch
of this month so check that out and
finally exclusively for Vita owners
you'll get kick and Finnick it's a brand
new adventure platformer game that's
described as easygoing you play as kick
there's a little boy with a very big gun
I don't know how easygoing that sounds
but go check it out okay its Xbox one
time this month xbox live gold members
will have free access to a game called
hashtag I darb which stands for it draws
a red box the game was created through a
series of tweets and is actually spawned
into a fast-paced sports II kind of
title I darb is all month but for the
first half of februari xbox 360 gold
members will get brothers a tale of two
sons which is so freaking fantastic stop
the video go download it and play it and
then come back because it's super fun
it's also a little sad but it's gorgeous
and beautiful and emotional go check it
out
for the second half of februari you'll
have access to sniper elite version 2
which is set around the Battle of Berlin
in 1945 so a little bit of history
lesson all your picking off Nazis just
the caveat you do of course need to be a
member of PlayStation Plus and xbox live
gold to access these three games and
those memberships do cost money but
let's be honest they're totally worth it
that's all there is to be free this
month I'll be back in March with a brand
new list of games see you then</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
