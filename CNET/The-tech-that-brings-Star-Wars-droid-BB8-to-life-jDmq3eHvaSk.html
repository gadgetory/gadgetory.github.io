trailer for Star Wars The Force awakens
bb-8 is already a star stealing the
spotlight from veteran r2d2 the newest
droid that rolled out at the recent Star
Wars Celebration convention has this
little robotic ball to thank for it
smooth moves Spiro a nap controlled ball
first came out in 2011 last year the
colorado-based company participated in a
disney sponsored contests for startups
and that's when it caught the eye of
Walt Disney CEO Bob Iger Bob saw that
the Sphero product and it rolling around
and kind of let them in on what was
being created in Star Wars The Force
awakens and asked them could you could
you bring this to life you know we felt
that if there was anybody who could
bring a ball to life it was us spiros
goal of putting a robot into every home
just got a huge boost with the release
of the bb-8 toy which will retail for
about one hundred fifty dollars through
the app you can drive bb-8 around or let
it explore on its own fans can also
record a short message that will appear
in the Apple like a hologram help me
bb-8 you're my only hope the toy is part
of a huge marketing and merchandising
that precedes the movies opening which
is set for December eighteenth in a
galaxy not at all far away Bryant on
