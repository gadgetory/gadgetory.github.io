com and welcome to Road Warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up expensive cell
phones and hot cars you know the old
saying let's start with the priciest the
Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen serene cell phone and it
is the most expensive phone I've ever
held in my hands it is a thousand two
hundred and seventy five dollars as you
can see it's like a it's like a piece of
art it's like a piece of sculptural work
of modern art here does it look like a
phone if you push it open like so it
opens with a internal power assist motor
which end of it in and of itself is a
little bit insane and on top here is the
rotary style keypad as you can see the
numbers in the circle well I guess if
you can drop twelve hundred dollars on a
cell phone that looks like a compact
case you must be pretty serene make
that's ridiculous wait till you see this
Mustang concept car with d'lonian like
doors you can see that this concept
Mustang is very voluptuous it's got very
large bulging fenders but they aren't
tacked on their very much fared into the
body of course the gullwing doors
probably are not a production likely
item inside some interesting technology
we see three LCD display monitors those
are tied into both the bullet cameras on
each door as well as the camera mounted
inside the gas cap on the very rear
janerio the designer of the DeLorean and
the original scirocco is responsible for
this Mustang concept alright open your
wallet if you can afford it you might
like this next cell phone from samsung
the so-called black carbon it is a
slider phone like a lot of Samsung
phones are these days as you can see
it's very nice and thin the first thing
you may notice is this beautiful 2.2
inch diagonal qvga display here it's
simply gorgeous and the colors look
amazing on it on the bottom is this
slippery navigation controls pretty
flush the surface and the keypad is
pretty flat as well how many phones have
white balance ISO settings and
III player oh and you can use it as a
USB storage device you cannot however
use the 2007 nissan altima hybrid as a
USB storage device but it has a nice
tech in the cabin so they're showing
this call really well equipped nice
leather appointments a nice big LCD
on-screen navigation and media center
right here Bose branded the Bluetooth
logo is called out down here's a
six-disc change with mp3 also an
auxiliary input jack next to that is the
only transmission we understand will be
available on the altima hybrid that's a
CVT a continuously variable transmission
the fuel efficiency rating will be
around 40 miles per gallon it hits the
showrooms in early two thousand seven
that's it for this edition of road
warrior on tumblr check back next time
for more gadgets that keep you armed and
dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
