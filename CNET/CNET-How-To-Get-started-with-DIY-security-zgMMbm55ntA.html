interested in home security but put off
by the high upfront cost and long term
commitments or maybe just live in an
apartment like this we're a hardwired
installation is it possible well you're
in luck with new do-it-yourself options
that put the power into your hands and
bring prices way down come on inside
we'll take a look
so how do you get started with one of
these DIY kids well the first step is to
install your home base or your hub and
this will depend from system to system
but usually it's something that plugs
into your router and in the case of
toppling security it sort of looks like
a second router now some systems won't
plug into your router if you look at
simply say if our editors choice winning
DIY kit it's got a separate home base
that plugs into your wall anywhere you
like once your home station is all set
up and plugged in you're gonna want to
put your phone out and download the app
for your system so you'll be able to
control it from your phone so by
downloading the app here's the simply
safe app you can log in create an
account and start to tell it what you
want from it and what kind of sensors
you're gonna set up once you're up and
running with the app it'll probably want
to walk you through the installation
process and that's the DIY part of these
DIY kids you're actually gonna put the
sensors up yourself now the types of
sensors that you're using is going to
vary from system to system but there are
some common denominators most of the
ones we've tested to use some form of
entry sensor this is one that simply
safe uses you'll stick this magnet onto
the door and this magnet detector onto
the door frame and they are joined or
separated you'll see that light flash
that means it's detecting the door
opening and closing and keeping track of
that for you it's a great security
feature in a great way to keep track of
who's coming and going and if someone's
coming in when they shouldn't motion
detectors are popular too you can stick
these on a table you can stick them
under a table you can stick them to the
wall in some cases by pulling the sticky
tape off put it where you want and it'll
keep track of people coming and going
through the room with a good robust kit
you'll be able to customize all sorts of
things and really take control over how
your security system operates and that's
kind of the fun part of the DIY approach
you get to really control things and
protect your home exactly the way you
want to protect it as you're shopping
around for a DIY kit be sure to consider
other options like this revolve hub this
is a master hub that will control a lot
of different devices like cameras and
lights locks under a single system and
you can really build your own system
exactly the way you want it in a
piecemeal approach and if you're
interested in keeping an eye on things
you might consider just a dedicated IP
camera like the Dropcam or the Samsung
smart camera whatever kind of system
you're envisioning be sure and keep a
close eye on our reviews and our
previews for the latest in DIY home
security
