cnet.com at South by Southwest 2012 and
I am incredibly excited today to be
speaking with Ray Kurzweil engineer
futurist author of singularity is near
and then this forthcoming book which
sounds incredible which is how to create
a mind the secret of human thought
revealed so no pressure for this book
that's a pretty big promise well I think
we actually have enough understanding
now to describe the basic mechanism of
the neocortex it's this little region of
the brain where we do our thinking my
thesis is a module that recognizes a
pattern and can remember a pattern and
it's repeated 300 million times and self
organizes itself into elaborate
hierarchies that's a keyword that's why
we can do hierarchical thinking which is
a key feature of mammals but we took it
to a greater extent so 80% of our brain
is the neocortex but I described how
that works and related to things like
creativity and innovation and
consciousness pretty well all those
issues and are you relating it to the
eventual development of those same
capabilities and machines yes that's
actually the title how to create a mind
turns out a technique that we've
actually gravitated to in artificial
intelligence it's mathematically
equivalent to what the brain actually
does not because we copied it but we
kind of arrived at the same conclusion
and I describe how that works and we
have very impressive examples now of
artificial intelligence like Watson for
example and not only just Watson
understand these convoluted jeopardy
queries but it actually sat down so to
speak and read 200 million pages of
material including all of Wikipedia
and remembered it all and it understood
it in natural language this is not hand
coded by the scientists so it's capable
of actually absorbing knowledge from
documents we've written 200 million of
them so when you look around then party
bus pause when you look around you're
sort of have most recently pegged to the
potential date of the singularity at
2045 when you look at something like
Watson and you think about your own
theory of exponential change and growth
do you feel like we might be getting
closer absolutely there's two key dates
2029 is when a computer will actually
match human intelligence it's
interesting to note that Watson even
though it actually does not understand
human language as well as a human could
get a higher score than the best two
humans put together because whatever a
computer can do it can then do that over
massive amounts of material and master
at all and have Total Recall you and I
could read Wikipedia but we wouldn't
remember very much of it it would double
in size by the time we were done
Wikipedia can can read the whole thing
in in a week and remember it all so it's
a very powerful combination this should
give us real confidence that that 2029
date is if anything conservative and
then information technology both
hardware and software which is not
appreciated will continue to grow
exponentially
so we're 2045 we're talking about an
increase in our collective human machine
intelligence of a factor of a billion
that's such a singular change that we
borrowed this metaphor from physics and
call it a singularity
I read your book and one of the things I
find really interesting about it is that
you have a fairly optimistic view of
what will happen post singularity I
almost feel reading your book like that
like it's an optimism that pervades even
through you know the terrible news that
we see today that I feel like well you
know technology will fix these problems
not everyone agrees though well first of
all this terrible news that you read is
good news that you read it because
30,000 people might die in a battle in
world war ii and you saw it at all it
was in a grainy newsreel three weeks
later on the movie theater well one
maybe you read about it in a newspaper
but only elite did that in 19th century
there's no information at all we have
much better information today about
what's wrong with the world that's a
good thing and I have many analyses and
graphs that show the same kind of
progression steadily towards better
health better wealth more education for
the developing world and worldwide all
of these measures that we associate with
well-being are continually improving so
this is not just often in the future we
read Thomas Hobbes the Charles Dickens
about how horrific human life was human
life expectancy was 37 200 years ago
that that being said there are dangers
to these new technologies fire kept us
warm but also burn down our villages
technology's been a double-edged sword
ever since we've had technology and I've
written you know probably more than
about these dangers and what to do about
them but these are not Pat answers and
this is a major challenge of humanity
how do we control the dangers let's say
of a bioterrorist getting a hold of
biotechnology and re-engineering a virus
to be more deadly I mean these are
negative scenarios that that we have to
be wary of so I tend to be an optimistic
person I think if you actually examine
human history to date and look at it
factually we are steadily getting better
and better off kid in Africa where the
smartphone has access to more
information than the president United
States did 15 years ago he or she is
walking around with a billion dollars of
communications and computation circa
1975 so we're all and it's not just
gonna be these gadgets we're going to be
applying there's exponentially growing
information technologies to things like
food and water and energy right when you
look around though let's say at some
place like South by Southwest how much
of a stake do you have in the types of
or an interest at least the types of
innovations that we're pursuing you know
I've heard people complain that at South
by Southwest it feels like the only
thing we're innovating on as a tech
community is the better ways to check
into restaurants do you know what what
could distract us from from the goal of
a really great technological innovation
well I'm fed up tunity to talk to a very
small fraction of the people here and
have encountered some very creative
companies that are working in artificial
intelligence biotechnology new
applications of communications in social
networks every area of technology and in
my view we get from here to the kind of
future visions I paint one small
innovation at a time it's not that some
lab is going to make this giant leap and
so it's all of these entrepreneurs
to meet here and that I need every day
that are gonna make that happen that was
kind of my next question is do you do
you see it as one thing that it's a like
a light row comes along electro camera
comes along and that pushes digital
imaging forward in a new direction and
it all adds up to another log method
lower logarithmic graph let's actually
have a daily newsletter sorry I read
what myself and my editorial staff come
up with and we at the struggle when we
began ten years ago maybe once a week
we'd find a real exciting story that was
a breakthrough they're now several a day
it's definitely happening faster and
faster the printing press took 400 years
to take off the telephone did better 50
years reached a quarter of the US
population cell phone bill Bevans seven
years
social networks wiki's and blogs did
that in three years well Mike four years
ago most people didn't use social
networks wiki's and blogs it sounds like
ancient history there wasn't so long ago
so things are happening faster and
faster and it's made up of lots of
innovators and the whole support around
the world really because I traveled the
world and the American model of venture
capital and angel Capital and a spirit
of innovation entrepreneurship is really
growing everywhere and that's very
encouraging so as we have access to more
information more knowledge it seems like
we also have a the potential to generate
more fear more concerned I mean what are
the is there a point at which humanity
would stop itself from progressing do we
have built-in political religious even
scientific there or economic barriers
that could slow down
this bro you know the things that get
slowed down if they do at all are very
small stones in the river like take
stem-cell research those that's not not
equivalent to biotechnology that's one
little technique and the progress has
float around it invented a way to create
the equivalent of embryonic stem cells
without embryos by taking a skin cells
dating for genes and creating what's
called an induced pluripotent cell which
is equivalent turn an embryonic stem
cell
on the ethicists who were opposed to
embryonic stem cells like this idea
because there's no embryos involved and
it's better anyway if you want a new
liver you'd like it to have your DNA and
not the DNA of some other embryo and
more and more people are now involved
because the tools of innovation have
been democratized a kid in his dorm room
can start Facebook or Google and you've
got you know teenagers like tavi
Gevinson who rules the world of fashion
she's 14 years old with her very
influential blog she's going to cover a
vogue recently and so you're seeing
young people with very inexpensive tools
who can create ideas that shake the
world and actually reach the world
market some friends and I the other day
we're talking about the idea of hobbyist
geneticists and hobbyist biologists who
now have the tools to map viruses at
home virtually at home and patient
groups are organizing not just to keep
each other informed but to actually
solve the problem they have the
motivation to cure their disease and
they have now the tools to do so
you've got a hundred thousand or million
people with a disease they've got the
skills and with collaborative
decision-making and problem solving
software which is solving lots of
different problems that's becoming quite
feasible I couldn't I would be remiss if
I didn't ask you obviously about the
future of humanity it felt like the book
The Singularity is near is pretty
positive about what will happen to
humans in a
singularity world that we will be
happily part of a new machine
consciousness and a sort of biological
machine existence but I I was very
interested in the idea that there would
be this small group of humans that
chooses to remain natural and exist
first of all there is chapter 8 the
deeply intertwined promise sources peril
of GN R which talks in pretty stark
terms about some of the dangers so we
are introducing new technologies that
are dangerous and that's really our
major challenge but as for people that
opt out we have them today called the
Amish maybe there are a few other groups
I mean how many people opt out of modern
communication technologies and so on but
it's not one thing it's not like check
here I want to be an ant yes no I mean
there's a million choices there's a
million choices on iPhone apps already
so there's going to be millions of
choices they'll be very conservative
things which you would be foolish not to
use some nanobots that basically fights
you know many or most diseases and you'd
be irresponsible not to do it then
there'd be more edgy things that are
optional and the be millions of those
and some of the early adopters some
won't be but it's gonna be very hard to
find people that opt out completely how
many people opt out now well and it
seems that that these concerns have led
to kind of what could be very useful
planning right for the kind of survival
of humanity into the
singularity University and well the
reason I write about these things and
the reason I think it's important is for
people to know where we're headed we
can't define precisely this company's
gonna succeed this technical standard
will be adopted but we can talk about
terms about what the power capacity
price performance of these future
technologies will be and it does provide
the scale to solve the major challenges
of humanity availability of water or
applying three-dimensional printing to
printing out houses at very low cost
Lego style and so on these are really
feasible ideas and people look at the
problems then they get overwhelmed
because they're assuming that we're only
gonna have 19th century tools to deal
with them but if they look at these
submerging exponentially growing
technologies it has the potential to
solve the major challenges at the same
time it's going to introduce new
challenges this issues like privacy
which you're familiar with there's more
existential risks so we have to we have
to deal with those I believe there is a
path where we have to give a high
priority to overcoming the challenges
and taking advantage of that promise do
you ever feel like you're just like the
scientist in quantum mechanics who's
studying the properties of molecule and
then changing it by looking at it
because sometimes when I look at the
predictions that are attributed to you
say 2019 we will all have heads up
display glasses I mean our Google
engineers working on those glasses
because you wrote about them I think
there's some feedback and I'm actually
trying to influence technology in a
constructivist direction the reason I
write about these things that said that
we will develop the positive
applications and also be mindful of of
the risks so we need ethical standards
how to avoid dangers we need rapid
response systems like a system that
would respond to someone put out a new
bioengineered virus that actually is in
place I've actually worked on that with
the army so writing about those dangers
is intended to get people to work on it
this is maybe a little bit of a left
turn but what about space so if you are
imagining a civilization in which we
have progressed so far that we're you
know beings of incredible consciousness
that potentially start to control the
universe is it possible that some other
species on a different planet gets there
first well I've written extensively
about that one and I've had a public
debates at SETI search for
extraterrestrial intelligence about this
issue I think the common SETI assumption
is that well this the likelihood that
any one planet has intelligent
civilizations it's small but there's so
many of them billions of billions that
there must be thousands of them out
there the problem is that that they're
ignoring what I call the law of
accelerating over chance and once the
tech a civilization gets to say the
point that we were at with primitive
radio and the Pony Express it's only a
matter of a few short centuries before
they're dealing with the kind of
technologies that I write about in the
singularity look how far we've come and
even the last 150 years 50 years from
now hundred years from now gonna have
these fantastic technologies within a
couple centuries will be doing
galaxy-wide engineering it'd be
impossible not to notice if there were
thousands of civilizations out there
doing galaxy-wide engineering and we
don't see them
that's the Fermi paradox my conclusion
is they're probably not out there you
might say that must be incredibly like
that we are the first but somebody's got
to be first in fact it's very unlikely
to have a universe altogether that can
undergo evolution encode information
yet here we are by the entropic
principle if it weren't the case we
wouldn't be talking about it so I've
written about this in the singularity
it's me I think the fact that we haven't
noticed it means we're probably not
going to notice them or that if we're
there were moving much faster well once
you get to say the point we are at it's
a very short amount of time
cosmologically speaking which is
measured in millions or billions of
years to get to a point of vast
technological reach and then what are
your thoughts on the the search for the
Higgs boson search for the search for
the Higgs boson and and I mean I assume
that it you must consider it all part of
our sort of every question that gets
answered leads to ten more questions and
ten more answers that's like how a
journalist understands expert has been
great at coming up with anthropomorphic
terms that people can relate to because
otherwise it's very hard to understand I
didn't call it the god particle so now
that came from the physics community and
not from the press now they wish they'd
never said it so dark matter that sounds
very mysterious so I think it's help
watching it to try to make physics more
understandable and because physics leads
to practical results in all of
electronics is based on physics and
based on quantum effects and so all of
these insights lead to practical
insights but understanding the world
around us is a natural curiosity we have
and one of the things were curious about
is how our own brains work so that's
what I'm
and so the book comes out in October
okay
i pre-ordered it today I want you to do
it really looking forward to reading it
thank you so much for sitting down with
us today and enjoy Austin oh well I am
great so you can see obviously this
interview that you're watching now many
more interviews from South by Southwest
and all of our coverage at CNN tv.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
