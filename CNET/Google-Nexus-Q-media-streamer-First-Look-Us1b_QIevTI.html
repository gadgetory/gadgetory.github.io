we're going to take a look at the google
nexus q now it may look like a
mysterious or but it's actually a
streaming media device designed by
google manufactured entirely in the
united states and it's selling for three
hundred dollars the Google Nexus Q
doesn't look like any other streaming
media device on the market and the
hardware is really quite impressive the
bottom half of the sphere is all metal
which makes it feel solidly built and
gives it some serious heft coming in at
around two pounds the top half is
plastic with the matte black finish and
it rotates letting you adjust the volume
and if you tap on the tiny light that
mutes it there's a ring of colorful LEDs
around the center and those lights
actually respond to music when it's
playing it's actually really fun
hardware to play with even if all you
can do is adjust the volume around back
is the connectivity and there are four
recessed ports the optical audio output
Ethernet micro HDMI and a micro USB port
above those ports are the speaker jacks
and that's because the Nexus Q has a
built-in 25 watt amplifier that means it
can power a set of speakers without the
need for a separate AV receiver similar
to a sonos am inside there's dual band
Wi-Fi Bluetooth NFC and the Nexus Q runs
android 4.0 with 16 gigabytes of flash
memory one gigabyte of ram and a dual
core processor now when you open up the
box for the Nexus Q you may be surprised
to find that there's no remote and
that's because it requires an Android
device to control it so if you don't
have an android phone or tablet you
can't use the Nexus Q at all and while
the Nexus Q is micro HDMI port can
display videos cover art and
visualizations for music there's no way
to navigate the device on screen
everything is on the screen of your
Android device now as cool as the
hardware is the Nexus Q can only do
three things right now google play music
Google Play TV's and movies and you too
and although it feels a little like
airplay when you're using it it's
actually a little different because the
Nexus Q only streams content from the
cloud so if you have media stored on
your phone you can't send it directly to
the Nexus Q it also can't handle any
other app so there's no netflix hulu
plus
MLB TV Pandora Spotify you get the idea
it can't play media off your own DLNA
servers and there's no way to view
photos even from google's picasa or
Google+ services and all these
limitations are particularly hard to
swallow when $100 Apple TV and fifty
dollar roku LT can do a lot of that and
that's the main story with the Nexus Q
it's a seriously cool piece of hardware
but it really doesn't do that much
especially for a $300 device maybe the
Nexus Q will get more features in the
future either from google or the hacking
community but right now it's just not an
attractive product I'm Matthew miskovic
from cnet and this is the google nexus q</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
