month-long mess of deals and you can
blame it on Amazon the online retailer
has been extending the weekend sale
bonanza over the years and now it has 35
days of Black Friday sales offering a
new deal every five minutes until
December 22nd but to keep you scrolling
while you're passing the stuffing it's
saving some of the biggest sales for the
five days between Thanksgiving and Cyber
Monday and compulsive sale checkers will
go nuts with this one amazon also has
secret deals you can only get by
ordering items through Alexa
that's Amazon's voice assistant which
means you have to have something like an
echo smart speaker or the fire tablet or
fire TV to place an order just ask Alexa
what are your deals to hear the sales of
the day so how do retailers respond to
Amazon well they also stretch out deals
for a month best buy started early with
offering Black Friday sales on Tuesday
Macy's and eBay started preview sales
last week walmart has been pushing deals
since the start of November and Target
is gonna spread out savings throughout
December but don't be quick to say Black
Friday is dead
after two years of not participating
Apple is bringing back its Black Friday
sale the company is keeping sales a
secret until Friday only teasing
customers with an image of an Apple
watch which would lead you to believe
there's going to be a sale on the Apple
watch
or else Apple is just being mean now if
you're more stressed about cooking the
turkey then where to find a good deal
listen up the Butterball turkey hotline
is now taking your questions by text
message that's right the iconic
butterball helpline which has nearly 50
people staffed on Thanksgiving Day to
give turkey cooking pep talks over the
phone now will answer text messages the
company has also offered help on
Facebook Twitter and YouTube but now it
can turn your shrugging
into some victory emojis technology is
also taking the Macy's Thanksgiving Day
Parade to new heights for the first time
in 64 years you can watch the parade and
all of its oversized balloon glory
without tuning in to NBC because it'll
be on YouTube Verizon's YouTube channel
is broadcasting it in
160 degrees I am Bridget Carey you can
