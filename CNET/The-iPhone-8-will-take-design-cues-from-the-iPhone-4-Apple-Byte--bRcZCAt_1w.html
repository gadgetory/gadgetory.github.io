welcome back to the Apple bite it's
episode 420 so take a deep breath and
get ready start off the new year all
right Apple starts 2017 with good news
for the air pods yes the ones that I
gave a positive review but I still would
buy them for myself just yet
new data from research firm slice
intelligence found that for December in
the u.s. seventy-five percent of revenue
from head phones sold online were
wireless models now that's up from 50%
in December of last year so yeah that's
a big jump now even more surprising
Apple's new air pods led the way
capturing 26% of those sales and topping
all of their brands since launching on
just December the 13th it even took the
top spot from the Apple owned beats
which made up 15.4 percent of online
revenue so add those two together and
Apple makes up over 41% of online
revenue since launching the air pods and
you know what that's a good apple see
contrary to popular belief people are
willing to wear toothbrush heads in
their ears alright Consumer Reports can
now recommend the new MacBook Pros after
Apple released a software fix for Safari
now a couple weeks ago they failed to
earn a Consumer Reports recommendation
for the first time ever due to battery
life inconsistencies with the results
ranging from 19 hours to 3 hours on the
same machine now the fix is still only
available through the Apple beta
software program at the moment so we'll
see how this works out for you
ok the Wall Street Journal reports Apple
is still aggressively working to create
original scripted content that could be
either premium TV shows or movies the
plan is to make the programming only
available on Apple's music service that
costs $10 a month Apple acquired the
rights to carpool karaoke and they're
producing dr. Dre's auto biographical
drama vital signs so you're going to put
other TV shows and movies not related to
music on Apple music come on stop Apple
you're drunk
C why don't you do this just acquire
Netflix with you know some of your two
hundred billion dollars in cash are
sitting on let them continue to produce
killer content roll your shows into that
platform and there
you have the destination for content you
always wanted but you know what you
couldn't do now I'm not going to Apple
music to watch this stuff
just so you can boost your subscription
rates to compete with Spotify
here you go Apple execs have told people
in Hollywood
that they hope to offer original
scripted content comparable to West's
world and stranger things by the end of
2017 so we will see now this week was
also the tenth anniversary of the
announcement for the very first iPhone
you know the phone that changed really
everything I still have the original it
still works and that was truly a special
time in tech now a video posted by sunny
Dixon shows off the two early prototypes
of the OS the iPod click wheel based OS
from the iPods Godfather Tony Fadell
that one is on the left and the icon
based iPhone prototype which ended up
becoming the foundation for iOS by Scott
Forstall is on the right both were
running what was called internally acorn
OS but the scrollwheel version runs
faster because it was a slimmed down
version but I want to show you this it's
just a fun peek at the past and how far
the iPhone has come but what about the
next iPhone the latest claims from digit
times says Apple will abandon its
long-standing aluminum back cover design
and bring back arguably one of its
greatest designs similar to the iPhone 4
you know without antenna gate please the
report says Apple's new design will use
to reinforce glass panes and a metal
frame in the middle the metal bezel will
be made of stainless steel using a 4G
process to enhance its sturdiness and
reduce costs now recent rumors have
claimed at least one version of new
iPhones released this year will have an
all glass body and this could be that
premium version the OLED model with the
fingerprint sensor embedded into the
display as well so we'll just have to
wait on it now Tim Cook has made it
clear Apple is super high on augmented
reality a new report from Robert Scoble
during CES says Apple is working with
German optics manufacturer Carl Zeiss on
creating a new pair of augmented reality
glasses Scoble says it would be a light
pair of augmented and mixed reality ones
that may be announced this year based on
what he's seen but uh let's just hope he
doesn't try them on in a shower like he
did for Google glass because that was
one of the images of what you don't want
to look like
that instantly killed any cool factor
they might have had and finally
President Obama gave his farewell speech
this week everyone was using their phone
to take pictures but I couldn't end this
show without calling out the dude in the
crowd taking pics with an iPad but that
wasn't just an iPad that's a freaking
iPad pro holy crap that's a bad apple
but I salute you you head up the damn
thing with just one hand all right
that's gonna do it for this week's show
we're back to our weekly schedule you
can email us at the Apple bite at
cnet.com or tweet me at brian tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
