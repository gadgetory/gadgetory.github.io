but it is a self-driving 18-wheeler and
it's coming to a highway near you and
jetpacks we got jet packs and also
artificial lab-grown meat menus that are
so weird the only place they belong is
here on this show tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley together join me as always punch
in the sky kale anonymous yo what up
let's get to those news yeah I just hit
it I thought we took produce are lower
my surprise on that one oh you my
favorite intro of us yo what up look
through the news right to the chase
that's not even waste any time okay I
got to tell you about Kurt men's verte
Kurt men's vert it's pretty it where'd
and interesting it's a virtual
restaurant called bistro in vitro now I
said virtual because you can't actually
go there it's online go to the website
okay and you go to the website and you
combine dishes into a three-course meal
of your choice but here's the weird
thing the catch of this is that all of
the dishes are conceptual dishes that
may someday be grown by lab made meat
lab-grown meat so you know how like
those scientists had the lab-grown meat
patty and they said oh maybe someday
like we'll have these like lab-grown
burgers yeah so here are some of the
stuff that they came up with chefs
designers and students created these
concept dishes which are super bizarre
and sound kind of gross if I'm being
honest meet Easter's meet pearls these
are celebrity cubes what do you look at
that bit of meat meat oyster that's
disgusting that's disgusting what's nice
what's your next all right you skipping
celebrity cubes celebrities well it dodo
nuggets like dodo nuggets donut Enders
do uh these are like little meat meat
since I'd kind of test tube looking
things they got all kinds of weird stuff
yeah I don't but ok so it's like
obviously gastronomy like artistic it's
really kind of gross looking but also
super fascinating to me and the they had
one that was really adorable that was
like they had one called a concept
called a pig from the backyard where the
idea is that you'd have this pet pig and
you'd go collect cells from it and grow
a sausage like out of the pig cells
without killing it or anything you
should grow like a little local sausage
and then you'd still have your pet pig
you wouldn't have to kill it for food
and the seat of a local sausage from
your pet it's really two guys this is
weird okay it's really weird but again
it's conceptual it's not real but he
wants to encourage the reason this
exists is he wants to encourage people
to think about the possibilities of this
kind of culinary experience because he
was like you know okay we're making
lab-grown meat but why does it have to
be boring why does it have to be stuff
that we already are familiar with why
can't we make meat origami like why
can't we make that's that local grown
sausage is like picture of you a little
little pet pookie pig on there um but
yeah so they're making a documentary as
well about this and that's super weird
oh that's see-through sushi see-through
meet sushi super bizarre like
transparent anyway again all conceptual
ideas nothing 100 sent real like wow
that was a that new store was a roller
coaster so such a big weird roller
coaster that we're done um but they're
making a documentary about it where
they're gonna take everybody's there's
like ratings of the different like meals
and stuff when you go to the website and
choose your three-course meal there's
like ratings and everything and there
they're gonna do a documentary where
they interview chefs about the
perception of artificially grown meats
and also take into consideration the
choices that all of the visitors this
website sort of make and and what they
end up picking on what would be
appealing to a mass audience and what is
in things like that so I thought that
was really cool and sort of a really
weird way of kind of studying for the
future like how we might have society
might be interested in sort of consuming
more strange looking meets if we can
make them that way wow that is a car
crazy super weird yeah really good so uh
no no hashtag of the day cuz we have we
yeah screw that we have some we have
some to catch up yeah skip it today so
don't worry about just break so just
take a break go play GTA online yeah you
know to whatever I do whatever whatever
floats your boat guy think all right
you're not okay so now if you had a
jetpack you for sure would show off
thats that's basically how you do
transport yourself to another place
whatever but you'd show up well that's
what these two guys did that their names
are Yves Jetman Rossi and Vince rafet
and they strapped on their jet packs and
flew over some pretty crazy places with
these these jet packs I can't wait to
that's either well they're making
together yeah
these are little plays are awesome all
right so anyway uh little plane yeah
they're like a dumbbell get really bring
Avengers oh ok ok alright so let's hear
in the helicopter yep they're in the
helicopter I like how one of the guys
name is jet man they strapped on a jet
packs and they flew over burj khalifa
which is the tallest building in the
world yeah look you got to kind of fall
dr. first fish your jetpack yeah you
can't just jump out you can't just take
off from the ground ya know you have to
it you kind of have to be in the air
force against start a little start but
yeah you can see they're basically like
little tiny planes they are like real
planes they're synchronized so there
they are they're flying over a over
dubai they also flew over a palm oh god
I'm gonna butcher these names palm palm
do Mariah and the Lima desert yeah so
there you go Palmer I thought there's
synchronized movements and action
cameras captured the flights the flight
that we're watching right this is insane
so it's pretty cool look at that there
fly there just jet packing it up yeah
they're just I guess they have clearance
for jetpacking but yeah I are there any
local laws and in the UAE are there any
laws in the United Arab Emirates about
jet pack like no jet packs I don't think
it's been an issue yet well um yeah so
there you go can we just all get jet
packs no I this makes me want to I don't
even like Heights and I feel like maybe
I would try it I don't trust you with
the jet pack whoa just myself in the jet
pack I don't yeah that's true you
would've oh trust me yeah it was
amazing just looking at the footage I
mean I just I could watch that all day
it's so mesmerizing I love how it'll
sink there yeah so very cool no no we
always are like how the goal is this the
goal is fly around over dubai let's go
yeah there you go jet pack it up nice
nice work sorry up short story fun now
you can pretty good you can dream all
right I want to tell you about this
autonomous truck it's not again not
quite transformers level not quite
transformers old but it's pretty cool
and it's actually gonna be launching
pretty close to us yeah compared to the
rest of the world there's even King
wrote a story about it Christie ugh they
could drive it so that was the car yes
like he wrote I want about a truck that
could drive me to yeah oh yeah was the
name of the truck was it a Chris I
remember
I'm like a big face on the front of it
considered like his worst movie he
directed it or whatever oh man I gotta
sign them Maximum Overdrive yeah all
right anyway okay on to the hopeful
promising this is a more of a hopeful
privacy story i'll explain why a lot of
people worried this might take away jobs
but actually not so so daimler and
freightliner unveiled what they call
inspiration which they did at the hoover
dam which people saying like dramatic
reveal with a projected video onto the
hoover dam and all this stuff is pretty
pretty awesome so this inspiration is an
18-wheeler that's also autonomous it can
drive itself it's a self-driving
commercial truck that is fully licensed
to operate on public roads in Nevada so
right next to us one state over Nevada
largely is a lot of empty Highway I mean
we do the drive to Las Vegas and that
there's nothing for most of that drive
yeah and and so it's really one tough
for people who are you know truck
drivers to get a lot of stuff done
because they have to log so many hours
in a day and it can be really stressful
they have to find out where they're in a
sleep at night they're going to figure
out you know like manifest and log Trey
you know tracking all their stuff logs
and I'll this eldest junk so they have a
system on board called highway pilot and
what they are going to do that allows
the truck and that there it is to drive
a self-drive on stretches of highway
using cameras and sensors so it can stay
in the lanes it can keep a safe distance
between cars in front and behind it and
also it can do this really awesome thing
where they can do vehicle-to-vehicle
communication so it can talk to another
truck and it can say okay like I'm going
to pull up behind you and it can get the
perfect distance away for maximum draft
and sale and and and save gas efficiency
yeah so if they have like two of these
trucks like back-to-back they can draft
like all behind each other and then like
get a whole bunch of max efficiency out
of it which is pretty cool that is
pretty cool so um they're saying that
you still need a driver in the driver's
seat obviously because you have
something somebody there in case things
go wrong plus it doesn't drive on side
streets and it doesn't take interchanges
so it's like just straight stretches of
highways like really kind of what this
is made for
what is good for Nevada because there's
a lot of that and then also they were
saying that the one really important
thing to remember is that these trucks
as you've seen if you live in the States
or anywhere where these trucks are kind
of prevalent they log a lot of miles and
because of that they're going to be able
to take that data and sort of understand
self-driving cars a lot better and make
that technology better so kind of in the
same way that formula f1 race cars sort
of inform design and understanding in
regular consumer sports cars so this
this might really help self-driving cars
kind of come along with information and
also real-world use so to explain though
why it's not going to take our jobs so
someone is still has to be in the cabin
we're not quite yet at driverless cars
so people can get this right wait job
it's pretty sweet job you can check this
there's the car drives itself they'll
have a tablet that they'll be able to
use like while the cars and autopilot
but you know Daimler made a really good
point in freightliner they said you know
this is not unlike autopilot mode in a
commercial airplane so you're you're
taking cargo and you put it on autopilot
and then the plane really generally gets
to its destination once you're in the
sky and you have to be responsible for
takeoff and landing which would be
getting off and on the freeway doing
interchanges things like that so those
that's what the pilot or the driver
would be responsible for two things okay
first of all does it know when I'm doing
this to honk the horn I feel like that
should be a sensor that should be a
built-in feature definitely could skill
what's the long ride for kids in the
desert and I want to have entertainment
so and then number one number number two
number two Simpsons already did this oh
really yeah there's day had an episode
where all the trucks are self driving
and the trucker's are faking it and so
they don't know I guess I remember that
episode now that you bring it up oh wow
so the trucker's just sit there and they
don't drive and it's like a big secret I
love that almost everything that has
happened to the substances happened
that's crazy I'm telling you that
monorail episode is gonna be hyper loop
so gonna be models but hypo oh yeah
everyone's gonna start saying hyper look
it's gonna be amazing uh but this is I
like it there's a lot of people that are
mad that it's like gonna take jobs and
all that but you stopped to have a pilot
so it's you still have to have somebody
in that seat which they're there it just
helps them be more
 with their job and they don't and
they can actually rest when they get to
a place they don't have to continue to
work and be like oh I have to do these
things I couldn't do because i was
driving so they can say like fill out
their their manifest they can log their
miles they can do it can set up
reservations at their next stop like
whatever that is yeah they can do those
things now without having to stop or and
or you know be really tired and
transportation evolves all the time like
it was it was horses and then it was
trains and then it was cars and you know
now it's kind of cars that just like
yeah that drive themselves so super
weird but you know honestly I think this
could be a good thing for everybody I
mean I super damn thing was awesome
pretty cool yeah it's pretty good reveal
so and a great place to do it because
it's in Nevada and broadcast tomorrow
daily on that to fardale let's do that
well let's try to figure out the
logistics of that by taking a quick
break and then we will be right back
it's Tuesday and it's a pretty big week
for new releases in terms of movies
because we're super excited about one in
particular where you probably know what
it is but don't click away it's tomorrow
daily
welcome back to the show we have
returned it's a tuesday that means new
things are coming out they're gonna
light in our wallets so let's talk about
them its new releases imma let you take
this I know how excited you are I am too
but are you that excited how excited on
a scale of one to ten how excited are
you for Mad Max fury road I don't even
like to use scales okay because i feel
like it insults the film itself but mad
max fury road is coming out i have heard
nothing but amazing reviews i'm a huge
like dystopian like post apocalypse re a
post-apocalyptic world and look at this
this is a amazing it's me like the
incredible thing it's mostly practical
effects gorgeous cinematography is
unbelievable i have a friend that's a
movie reviewer that like professionally
and he said I've only given a 10 out of
10 to two movies I've heard the other
one was but this was one of the movies
yeah so I can't wait this is already
apparently spawned two more movies
they're like we're gonna make two more
then they're so good we're making two
more yeah Dobby has tartan Tom Hardy and
um good old charlize drums there on yep
whoo look it's like amazing approval
apparently stunts cinematography like
it's it's all it's all good I read an
article on hitfix which is where I like
I have some friends who work there about
and the title of it was here are all the
Oscars mad max fury road should win next
year and I was just like yes like I'm so
excited this movie's getting good
reviews I I had so much hope for it it
looks like all of that like hope is
gonna pay off this weekend I'm gonna see
it I got my ticket already for friday
i'm ready to go i'm way more jazz for
this than I was for Avengers 2 that's
why I think that's fair I was I think
you can be I killed I think my carry got
my tickets to like I already have like
we got thinking one of movie theaters
where it's like an actual couch over
there and they bring about colleague
drinks and food and stuff like that
choice yeah it's just gonna be funny
when over later what in this moment just
yet but I Mad Max road fury whoo ah so
good um also coming out this week in
gaming some interesting titles ultra
Tron it vendors to aid revolts were
trying to know Ultron is coming out this
week for playstation 4 xbox one and Wii
U it previously has been out on steam
but it's a really cool little shooter
and I really really like it and I I'm
really excited that it's coming to
console because I feel like it's better
suited console gaming like you could do
with the controller on pc obviously but
this is it's a pretty cool game um so I
highly recommend checking that out if
you have a chance and then also coming
out this week a game that is very close
to meijer Final Fantasy 10 and 10 to
remaster is coming out this week oh um
which I they were doing that I had
forgotten that they were doing that
remaster they showed it off last year
here's the comparison Wow laughs God
huge difference unbelievable difference
in the two this is footage that we had
over on gamespot of the the difference
between I mean it's really it's pretty
drastic why didn't I was it look so bad
I know you remember you remember how bad
it look now but I mean obviously the
character the character stuff is is not
not as like prominent as the textures
are but it's still pretty great if you
if you haven't played Final Fantasy 10
it's one of the like last turn based
like version of final fantasy that they
did and it was one of the best turn
based ones because of the I think
something like that like scheduling
priority yeah yeah the priority battle
and then you also have the the disk
where you had the sphere you could move
around like all your skills it would
almost look like a big board game oh
yeah and you could like pick all of your
skills and kind of go around the board
also really good ending really good
ending also what's your mom Lulu Lauren
was underrated lu lu lu lu lu Raja I had
a crush on Lulu I wasn't I would I loved
or on he was sewing mysterious and cool
hit his big hike owl I'm gonna lose just
sexy that's said um also a new releases
just FYI a pseudo Castlevania game by
eage himself you see this no I it's we
don't have any b-roll for this it's it's
coming out in two years that here's why
it's on Kickstarter I wanted to do it on
back at her Hackett next week but I
figure it's gonna be old news by then
listen eage from castlevania series who
is no longer at Kaname is making his own
2.5 d castlevania like get
troit vania game oh great and it's
called blood-stained ritual of the night
which looks like Castlevania all the
arts there the music is there they're
getting wasted hater the guy played
solid snake for a really long time
they're getting him to do the voice
acting um I am so excited about this I
backed it immediately yesterday and they
wanted I think five hundred thousand
dollars and by the end of the day they
had over a million and I think today
they've had like 1.4 yeah nice yeah so
keep up the good work everybody on the
internet and you show all those crazy
publishers that a 2.5 d Castlevania ish
game is exactly what we need yeah
welcome back to voice acting David
Hayter yeah good job took too long a
break bro too long ah but on that note
we have to talk about an older user
feedback TV comedy so let's do that
we're so letters last Thursday we had so
we're having some weird special oh yeah
wait we have to explain we have some
weird scheduling things happening so a
couple episodes have been filmed in
advance like this week and then like
last week there was an episode it's been
a really long two weeks guys like just
bear with us so we're moving around user
feedback like kind of staggering it out
so today we're doing TV comedy which we
asked you guys what passed away comedian
would you want to see perform in that
hologram you realize I've gotten a year
older since then you have and you know I
am a little concerned because you're
aging much faster than is normal really
freaking me out your dish wasn't big
enough for them for me to grow faster
all right so what are they getting okay
so neelesh wrote in and said it might be
too soon but I'd have say Joan Rivers I
think that's a great choice Joker's
great stand-up comedy yeah uh Frank
wrote in and said bring back the
original Three Stooges that's a really
great idea that would be so cool love
that idea uh they've ever done like a
stage thing but that would be really
cool I would love a Three Stooges stage
you get will sasso and friends to go and
you know that'd be really fun yeah
Dustin wrote in and said I love this
idea it is so futurama my pics are
Richard Pryor George Burns The Three
Stooges the possibilities are endless Oh
hashtag the see that yeah love that love
ah yeah I like those really good it says
second Three Stooges second Three
Stooges couple people said three to a
few people said three stooges Neil wrote
in and said a bridge
median named Tommy Cooper who literally
died on stage by the way and a live
performance from Lauren Hardy my
question about this is neil are you
saying that he would also die on stela
that because that's probably his most
famous performance like I don't think
that would be appropriate in hologram
form so like people pay to like watch
this guy die die on stage that seems
terrible do you clap at the end I'm not
sure it's a like awkward clapping like
polite like weird like are we supposed
to know that everyone just stands up and
walks everyone just at the same time
single file check it out you might you
might go see it fair enough um will have
your TV Nintendo tweets tomorrow which
are really good yeah I impede all right
oh yeah totally they've totally crushed
our dias um but we have to now do our
last piece of user feedback which is
always our photog refer the day okay so
no one wrote in he shot this with his
