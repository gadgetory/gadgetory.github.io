solutions have got to be one of the
biggest ripoffs out there what you're
paying for is basically glorified water
so instead of forking over ten to twenty
dollars on one of these things I'll show
you how to make it yourself with things
you probably have at home so grab a
misting spray bottle like this one from
the dollar store and fill it up with one
part 70% isopropyl alcohol I don't have
a funnel so I made my own by using some
glossy paper here and I'll eyeball it
fill this thing up halfway with the
alcohol okay that's about half now I'll
fill up the rest with distilled water
don't use tap water here because it has
minerals that will leave a residue on
your screen I'll screw the cap back on
give it a nice shake and that's it
really that's all you're paying for when
you buy an LCD cleaner from the store
some people suggest using vinegar as a
screen cleaner but I don't recommend it
first of all it smells awful but more
importantly your screen will dry much
faster with this alcohol solution now to
clean your screen grab a microfiber
cloth give one or two sprays and then
with a little elbow grease your screen
will be good as new oh and you can use
this cleaner basically anywhere to clean
glass your TV and even your keyboard and
mouse if you have any questions hit me
