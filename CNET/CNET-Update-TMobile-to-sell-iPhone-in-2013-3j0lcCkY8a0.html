complete I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update t-mobile will finally
get the iphone t-mobile announced that
it made a deal to sell apple products
next year and John leger CEO of t-mobile
USA said t-mobile will be targeting ATT
heavily and sell it at a very
competitive price he also said t-mobile
has lost customers before because it
didn't carry the popular phone t-mobile
also will offer these less expensive
service plans if you pay for the phone
in full at once or over 20 monthly
installments and if you want to upgrade
before you pay it off you'll get
trade-in value for it but that's not the
only news from Apple some mac computer
production will be done in the US of a
apple chief tim cook so the company will
be investing 100 million dollars to move
some of the Mac production that's
currently being done overseas this won't
be a giant change it's likely that most
parts will still be made in asia and the
popular iPhone and iPad will still be
manufactured abroad but bringing some of
the jobs to the US does help apples
image in an interview with Bloomberg
Cook said this will begin next year some
IMAX already have markings of being
assembled in the USA Tim Cook is also
dropping hints that Apple is working on
a new television concept in an interview
with NBC Cook said that changing the
current state of television is quote an
area of intense interest he didn't give
away much else but it's no surprise that
this is on Apple's radar the only
question is when will this happen it's
complicated to shake up the current
deals between Network Studios and TV
providers there are also a couple of
changes in social media Google+ is
introducing a feature called communities
they can be public or private for people
with the same interests to start
hangouts and plan events Facebook is
changing the wording of subscribe to
follow more people are familiar with the
term follow so Facebook is hoping it's
more inviting to click the word follow
music streaming service spotify
announced its own follow feature so you
can get music recommendations from
different users and your Facebook
friends Zynga is already
virtual poker but it wants to get into
real money gambling the game maker just
filed an application with the Nevada
Gaming Control Board according to The
Wall Street Journal and finally be sure
