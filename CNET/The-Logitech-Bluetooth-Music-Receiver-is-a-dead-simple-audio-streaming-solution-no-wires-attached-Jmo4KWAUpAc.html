to play music off a smartphone to a
stereo but if you recently purchased an
iPhone without a headphone jack you
could forget about a hardwired
connection and that's where devices like
the logitech music streamer come into
play
this small little box is a bluetooth
receiver that lets you add wireless
audio streaming to any powered speaker
or component audio system with an open
input jack it has connections on the
back for three-and-a-half millimeter
Jack or RCA cables and here's how it
works using those ports you can hook it
up to things like a stereo and AV
receiver a TV or PC speakers and once
it's wired in all you have to do is hold
down the pairing button and click on the
device on your phone or computers
bluetooth menu and that's it
you can now stream anything off the
device straight to your audio system no
wires attached
according to Logitech the range of the
Bluetooth connection is 50 feet but I
was able to get a little further than
that without dropping the connection
your mileage may vary though depending
on the room medicine the only caveat to
mention is that there's some audio
compression that happens over Bluetooth
so your music might not sound as dynamic
as it would using say a chromecast Audio
that connects via Wi-Fi and for someone
who doesn't care about multi room
connections and isn't too picky about
sound it's definitely worth the price
for the ability to play wireless audio
from any application off your computer
or phone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
