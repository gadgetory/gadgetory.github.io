help you fall asleep at night and you
might be interested in this smart home
product called nightingale it's a set of
two plugs that have speakers in them and
you're gonna plug them in across from
each other in your room that'll create
what's called a sound blanket according
to nightingale that sort of covers you
as you sleep that sound is going to come
at you from all directions it's going to
be the different white and pink noise
settings in that app and you can select
from and the fact that you can't really
tell exactly where it's coming from
because it's coming from everywhere
makes it a lot easier for that sound
help you fall asleep
now nightingale comes from a company
that has made white noise generators for
office industrial settings helped to
mask the sound of private conversations
they've done a lot of research into
white noise and how to get it just right
so they've got some background here and
they think this is a good residential
product to help you fall asleep
the set of two nightingale switches will
be available for three sale for two
hundred and fifty dollars this month to
ship out next month when it's shipped
out it'll also have an Amazon echo
integration to its name so you'll be
able to tell LexA to start your good
night setting or to turn the night light
on or off whatever you want there's also
a channel on if so you can sync it up
with products like the Google home smart
speaker or a video doorbell create
recipes that will lower the audio of
your white noise at night if someone's
at the door or let you know if there's
weather in the morning to watch out for
lots of cool things like that we'll keep
an eye on that this year as it comes to
market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
