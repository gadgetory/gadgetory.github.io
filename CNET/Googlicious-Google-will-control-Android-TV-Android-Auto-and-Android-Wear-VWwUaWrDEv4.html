welcome to google issues for all the
Google goodness that we can pack inside
of a show now the googs really delivered
an all-out assault on almost every new
product category imaginable at Google
i/o with their plans to target the
living room with our Android TV which
still has a lot of challenges with
manufacturers to become a viable
platform after years of fail there's
also an improved chromecast that can
mirror exactly what's on your phone and
can be shared among multiple users at
the same time it was probably one of the
most exciting and relevant updates
they're also ready to get behind the
wheel and be a part of your driving
experience with Android auto they
showcased an apple handoff flight
capability between Android phones and
Chromebooks and their full rollout of
Android wear with big time support
coming out of the gates with the LG G
watch and Samsung's gear live that
attendees got to take home and the Moto
360 the product that received the
loudest cheers well developers will get
theirs later but it's still coming to
retail later this summer and Google
pretty much delivered on almost every
rumor we predicted so let's get into
some more of the nitty-gritty after the
keynote now Google and Android have
always had that label of fragmented
thrown at them but in an interview with
arstechnica Google engineering director
David Burke officially confirmed that Oh
am not be allowed to overlay their
interfaces on top of Android TV android
auto and android wear now birth
reiterated that all three of the
company's new initiatives will have
design and software done only by Google
it's really a change of philosophy and a
sign that they are really looking to
take control of their platform now more
than ever I was also just a little
disappointed that Android wear didn't
wow me that much at all in the keynote
and in person it's new and different but
it's not doing anything compelling that
makes me want to buy a SmartWatch I also
use my phone to tell me the time even if
I'm actually wearing a watch and I know
a lot of you do the same thing now will
the sexy round screen of the Moto 360
changed my mind it's my favorite
SmartWatch I've seen so far but that's
still a no so
maybe a sous is the answer who according
to techcrunch is also working on a
budget-friendly SmartWatch of their own
powered by Android wear with a price tag
between 100 and 150 dollars that's like
buying a swatch watch and I challenge
them to make one at that price that
looks better than this deep berry one
alright the biggest change will see an
Android across all platforms is designed
like we thought and president of design
matias duarte showcased what they call
material design to give a sense of
physical paper and depth that is more
colorful and helps really bring more
dimension to Android's flat look and
feel which is really trending across
almost every mobile platform and if you
guys want to check it out for yourself
and you're familiar with using the
android sdk you can download the Android
L Developer Preview at this official
link on screen to check it out and yes
you're welcome there are also standalone
android wear applications hitting the
play store right now like where calc
which is a calculator for your
SmartWatch and where a compass which is
a compass reports say Google has asked
some of the bigger name companies
developing apps to hold off until july
seven so a flood of new ones are
expected to arrive in the next week and
what about products coming out way down
the line well during Google i/o sessions
the googs announced its partnering with
LG to build a tablet that's part of its
project tango program and will be
released to consumers next year project
tango lets you 3d scan your surroundings
and has huge potential for real-time
mapping giving our devices a real human
scale to understanding of space and
motion they also talked about project
ara Google's modular foam project where
they showed off a functional prototype
that booted up and then would freeze but
they also offered a challenge for
developers and anyone who can build a
module then lets people do something
with their phone and they can't do right
now and you could win a prize of
$100,000 now Google is still hoping to
release a developer preview for project
ara this fall but guys and gals the
giveaway that was by far the coolest was
the makeshift virtual reality headset
made of cardboard that google gave out
at i/o called wait for it cardboard the
g men and women posted the parts you
would need to do it yourself but why go
through all the trouble
when San Francisco's own DODOcase who
makes all kinds of killer iphone and
ipad cases is selling the toolkit to
make the cardboard headset yourself for
just 1995 you can even use the promo
code USA one to get twenty-five percent
off and I'm just looking out for you
this thing is pretty sweet like I can
see hello Evers what the city's in here
alright but this is not the sweetest
story of the week that goes to tracking
point the smart weapon company that
released a video of its shot view
software being used to broadcast a
sniper rifles image feed through a set
of smith optics io recon goggles the
marksman doesn't even look directly
through his scope he only uses the
goggles and nails an explosive field
soda bottle 500 yards away like that
alright that's going to do for this
week's show email us at Google licious
at cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
thanks so much for watching and we'll
see you guys next time for some more of
that Google Isha's gear delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
