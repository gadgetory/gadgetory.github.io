amazing wonderful budget phone the no 35
plus last year how do you follow that up
well you could start with the outside
you could take away this micro USB port
and put in a USB see one take the screen
that's sixteen by nine and make it 18 by
9 you could take this a metallic back
and replace it for a glass one add a
second camera for portrait mode photos
and what you have is a phone that looks
decidedly 2018 but with all the things
that we love about the Moto G 5 plus
including the fingerprint sensor on the
front I'll be a little bit thinner the
Moto G 6 looks sleek and modern and you
would be hard-pressed to know that this
was affordable and that's exactly why I
like it so much and they also kept the
trackpad like gestures for the Moto G 5
plus while the moated v6 has a glass
back it doesn't have wireless charging
which is fine with me because it has
fast charging via the USBC which is far
more useful to me
the dual cameras in the motor v6 take
solid photos now these are not gonna be
on the same level as a pixel 2 or iPhone
10 or 1 plus 6 but they're good a
Motorola added a bunch of fun camera
modes but didn't go too crazy the inner
things are still pretty clean and simple
portrait mode photos are good they're
not great it does a good job separating
the foreground for the background but
photos still look a little flat video is
1080p no 4k no slow-mo but that's okay I
am not buying this phone to shoot
high-end video I'm buying this phone
because it's cheap but it doesn't look
cheap so does this mean that Motorola
had to hike up the price to add in all
this fit and finish in a word kinda ok
that's not really a word but last year's
defy+ without discounts was two hundred
and twenty nine dollars in the US for
the 32 gigabyte model the Moto G 6
without discounts is two hundred and
forty nine dollars in the US for a 32
gigabyte model Hey look 20 bucks is 20
bucks but for this price it's absolutely
worth it if you're still looking for
something more affordable
there's the Motorola g6 play it costs a
hundred and ninety nine dollars in the
US but it forgoes that glass back for a
plastic one the USBC for a microUSB and
the dual rear cameras for a single one
however the Moto G 6 play has something
that he 6 doesn't a big ol honkin
battery the battery life on the g 6 play
is impressive like the Moto G 6 there's
a fingerprint reader however on the play
it's on the back and it's cleverly
incorporated with the Motorola logo and
like its older brother it has an 18 by 9
display however it's lower resolution
and there's a flash for selfies I like
the Moto G six play but I think the Moto
G 6 is a better value especially if you
plan on having the phone for a few years
