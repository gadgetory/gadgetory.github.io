Dreyfuss and welcome to rumor has it the
show where we round up the week's
biggest tech rumor and then we vote on
what sounds legit and what seems like
it'll never ever happen we're not the
only ones passing judgment you can vote
along on all the rumors to watch out for
the polls in the interactive player that
shows up right here next to my head if
you're watching on cnet first up is a
rumor that's been swirling around for
years last week a job posting on
microsoft's site hinted that the next
Xbox some are calling it the 720 is
going to be released within 18 months
although Microsoft fought back with a
statement saying that it's always
looking for talented people to innovate
now and in the future this drives with
the 56 page document that leaked back in
June that mentioned a two hundred ninety
nine dollar xbox for the 2013 holiday
season in other xbox related news
twitter users super Daei posted what is
claimed to be an image of a connect to
an action why does it look like a
psychedelic sign warning people at a
rave that if they have a headache they
should drink water okay I looked at the
picture and it looks like some guys like
doing this belly pat like everything I
don't know I didn't get anything from
that picture well according to super
Daei the leaked image was captured from
microsoft's 2 rango development kit the
code name of next xbox and the verge
reports that microsoft confirmed it
people are concluding from these images
that the kinect is going to have greater
range and sensitivity i don't know how
they got greater range and sensitivity
from picture of colors and people doing
this but why are you guys to take a look
at it what new features do you think it
will be revealing post your best guess
in the comments section our next rumor
grand daddy of the tech world IBM is in
talks to seed struggling rim at least
its enterprise services unit according
to a report by Bloomberg doesn't sound
exciting right but analysts say the
enterprise unit which operates the
servers that store blackberry data is
rims crown jewel turns out use our data
may not be that flashy but to rim it's
basically like Scrooge McDuck's vault of
gold so what's Ivy I'm going to do with
this business at work well basically it
would be great for them because they
could control a super popular
fast and secure email system that's
favored by large corporations but i
don't think that IBM is at all
interested in buying all of rim which
would be fine with rim CEO thorsten
heins who's hoping that the company can
keep the lights on long enough to debut
the new blackberry 10 OS and turn the
company around let's not hold our breath
on that one our next rumor is about
Apple Apple told us the big innovations
in iOS 6 back at a fancy event in June
but there's plenty of the company
couldn't tell us because it reveals
secrets about the iphone 5 the iOS 6
rumor that I'm most intrigued by it
comes from nine to five Mac it suggests
that if the iphone 5 is actually taller
then the home screen will store five
rows of apps instead of four which would
be amazing for my OCD another highlight
is that you won't have to put in a
password when you get free app so
that'll save eight seconds in our lives
a precious seconds and then you can
prank your friends by downloading really
embarrassing free apps onto their phones
when they're not looking right like the
fart app I don't know what that is but I
want it remember how kind of exciting
the microsoft surface tablet
announcement was it was in a secret
location in LA it start a magic case of
many colors and the surfaces high res
screen and it can run word oh there was
just one thing Steve Ballmer left out
the price no one knows how much the
windows 8 tablets going to cost you
rumors have pegged it as high as a
thousand bucks but the latest has it on
par with amazon's kindle fire for the
low low price of 199 holy tablet wars
right but here's the rub though this
rumor comes from an anonymous tip to
engadget and it makes very little sense
Amazon's tablet is so cheap because it's
subsidized Microsoft doesn't have that
luxury it isn't trying to get you to buy
more books or cat toys it wants you to
buy the surface tablet and Windows 8
apps cost money but it won't make enough
dough for Microsoft to take hundreds of
dollars in a loss on every tablet
remember the surface is way more
feature-rich than the kindle fire it's
in the same league as the ipad and it'll
have a price to reflect that that's why
i don't buy this but i will buy the
surface if it costs 199
see what I did there I see what you did
there see I'm going to bet on unicorns
and rainbows and say that Microsoft will
be smart and will undercut Apple on
price it's really the only way it can
hope to succeed right let us know what
you guys think by voting in the poll
right now we're going to go ask the
people of San Francisco what they think
do you think there's a chance that
they'll charge only 199 for their tablet
oh if they want to be like super
competitive and just running you know
let's Telus it off the Goethe I can see
that one honey nah yeah I think so why
not lower than the ipad know there's a
lot of devices being sold at a loss 599
we can change yeah I probably somewhere
more than four or five hundred dollar
range well there's going to be two
surface tablets as we all know are some
of us the is going to be the one that
competes with the iPad which i think is
the lower model there's also the one
that competes with the upper end
computer if i had to guess it's at the
lower one will be around i'd say
probably a price point competitive with
an ipad maybe seven or eight hundred
dollars be my guests and for the higher
one i could see maybe a little above a
thousand but not too much so the new
rumors that are swirling is that it's
gonna cost 199 do you think that's a no
that's interesting i haven't heard about
that i would say it's possible
especially given microsoft's recent
decision to price windows 8 at forty
dollars so they're going to shake some
stuff up i guess so it seems like the
people on the street are super
interested in the microsoft surface
tablet but they have absolutely no idea
what it's gonna cost so let's go
upstairs and see what the cnet Council
of experts has to say the cnet Council
is composed of five editors who cast
their votes anonymously their opinions
are not an endorsement by Cena or CBS
interactive obviously because these are
rumors folks and the cnet verdict is no
just like I said for editors 21 said
that they don't think that the surface
tablet will be priced at 199 I think all
of you are wrong I think all of us are
just realistic but our comment of the
week this week comes from a swan who
writes about the ipad mini interesting
that nobody is talking about how popular
this will be with kids the little hands
are used to the iphone and ipod touch
and ipad and ipad mini would be icing on
the cake for five and seven year olds
spoiled spoiled five and seven-year
holtz very lucky and quiet children
whose parents don't have to do with them
that's our show everybody please share
your rumors that rumor has it at cnet
com or call us at 1 800 750 cnet and
tweet to us tune in next week for more
tech and thanks to this week's sponsor
