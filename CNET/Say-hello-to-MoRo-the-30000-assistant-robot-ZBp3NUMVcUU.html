this is a home assistant robot that can
lift objects go get things for you from
the fridge or even the grocery store it
has an intel realsense camera up top and
it also has object detection as well so
it can navigate around obstacles in the
home or anywhere else you decide to send
it there is a speaker and a microphone
inside so you can actually tell it to do
things like Maura go to the shops and
grab me something and theoretically it
will be able to do this now the model we
saw right now is a prototype still
however the company still thinks it's
going to be around in the first half of
2017 the prototype was pretty limited
all it could do was wait hello travel
around a little bit and of course pick
up a couple of obstacles but those arms
are really long and they can carry up to
1.5 kilograms of weight so it could be
pretty useful in home situations
now the morrow is not cheap it's
probably not going to be in hands that
you or I are accustomed to it costs
thirty thousand US Dollars and the
company as I said is hoping to have it
out in the first half of 2017 starting
off in China and then working towards
the global release</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
