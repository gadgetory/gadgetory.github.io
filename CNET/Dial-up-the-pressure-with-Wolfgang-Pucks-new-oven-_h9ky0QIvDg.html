taking a look at the Wolfgang Puck
pressure oven this is a two hundred and
forty nine dollar countertop appliance
that combines the capabilities of a
pressure cooker with the convenience and
versatility of a countertop toaster oven
so this is a pretty powerful machine a
lot of energy goes into making your food
and you use this thing it's going to use
the pressure that escapes your food as
you heat it and trap it inside the way a
pressure cooker does to speed up cooking
time and infuse flavor and moisture into
your meal
I spoke with chef puck over Skype
earlier this week to talk about is oven
here's some of what he had to say I saw
it like three four years ago I said
wouldn't it be great if somebody could
help me develop an open more for the
restaurant first where you could roast
for example a chicken everybody in the
restaurant says I want a great roasted
chicken and people talk about it like
it's the second coming then they said
you know what this is perfect for your
home use let me show you how this thing
works you're gonna press this button
down here to open the door just sort of
like a microwave you put your food in
set the temperature in the time and cook
normally if you want but if you want a
pressure cook your food you'll also need
to set this vent to the sealed position
and then seal the oven with this lever
here when you're finished pressure
cooking and you want to take your food
out you'll need to vent the Machine
first you'll do that by switching the
gasket over to vent mode letting all
that heat that's built up escape and
then you'll unseal it open it take it
out it'll be fine but if you don't do
that you risk scalding yourself so there
is a little bit of extra care involved
with using this machine and this oven
claims that it can cook a 14 pound
turkey in under an hour in the pressure
cooking mode we can't wait to try that
out in our Test Kitchen and when we
publish the full review in the coming
weeks we'll be sure to let you know how
it does four see that I'm right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
