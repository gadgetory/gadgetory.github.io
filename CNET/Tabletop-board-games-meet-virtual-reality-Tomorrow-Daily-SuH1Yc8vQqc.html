Ashley's Kevin and I'm Jeff Kannada and
it's time for headlines hey you know
about playing video games in virtual
reality everybody's doing it but what
about playing board games in virtual
reality you might already be familiar
with the game lost cities by Reiner
kinesia but this is a whole new way to
play developer the campfire Union is
working on a virtual reality version of
the two-player card game virtual
versions of you and your opponent sit
down at a table to compete with the
environment shifting as you traverse the
globe during the game tabletop gaming is
in a Renaissance period and VR would be
a great way to play with someone far
away I think this is awesome I mean I
the thing I love about board games is
fiddling with the pieces you know so
that doesn't make it exactly the same
but maybe some honest VR haptic feedback
gloves there you go feel like you fiddle
with it you can move your piece game
piece I'd be pretty awesome if I could
be a settler of Catan in Catan
that would be pretty fun virtual Catan
that would be pretty fun alright so our
second story today is from the brilliant
minds the ridiculously brilliant minds
at MIT who have now brought us what I'd
like to think of as duct tape on crack
censor tape is the name of this project
and it is actually a long strip of
repeating circuits that can be cut up
and stuck to objects the circuits know
when the tape bends or when light
crosses its surface and each node
networks with the node next to it
meaning they can all gather data from
one another and create real-time models
of the tapes current shape bonus it is
mass-producible since the prototype came
off of a Chinese assembly line the
Creator believes that the cost of
something like sensor tape would be in
the range of about 100 to $200 a meter
that's not cheap but when you think
about the potential applications it's
kind of amazing stuff and the fact that
it can be mass-produced is pretty
impressive yeah I just want a tape
that's smart enough to know where the
end is on the roll because I can never
find it maybe you have a little LED
light up me like right here amazing what
do you want to talk about this week
what's what's the what's the story that
we should put on the big show on
