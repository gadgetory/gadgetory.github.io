s 3 and the Galaxy s4 so it was no
surprise when this Jap the galaxy s5
mini came along it's very easy to spot
the family resemblance between the s5
mini and the full-size model as the mini
has the same dimpled rubberized back
metallic edging and the camera on the
back with heart rate sensor below it
it's waterproof too which helps keep it
safe from spilled drinks with a 4.5 inch
screen is quite a lot smaller than the
standard s5 which makes it very
comfortable to use in one hand the
display has a 720p resolution which is
crisp bright and bold enough to do
YouTube clips and Netflix shows justice
it runs android 4.4 point2 KitKat over
which samsung has put its TouchWiz
interface I'm not that keen on TouchWiz
as it's so full of tweakable settings
but it can be very complicated to use
particularly if you're not very familiar
with Android if powered by a 1.4
gigahertz quad-core processor which is
powerful enough to tackle most things
you're likely to want to do the back of
the phone is where you'll find the
camera which is an 8 megapixel affair
rather than the 16 megapixels you'll get
on the s5 it takes some good shots
although features like always on HDR and
4k video shooting are absent from the
mini as it did with the s4 mini and s3
mini before it samsung has taken its
flagship phone watered down all of its
specs but kept the name of the top model
those of you looking for elite specs in
a more comfortable form will be
disappointed as a mid-range phone is not
bad however if you simply want the
samsung name on a phone that's easy to
use in one hand you are well catered for
with the s5 mini just don't expect the
same all-round performance as with
full-sized model I'm Andrew coil for
cnet and this is a samsung galaxy s5
mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
