the internet become the Library of
Alexandria version 2 can we make all the
books music video web pages software
ever made by people available to
everybody that wants have access to it
technologically we can do this we
started out by collecting websites
because we thought that was very
ephemeral media that was disappearing
from the world but then we soon moved on
to other kinds of published works we're
trying to collect that and bring it into
one place one library that serves the
entire world it actually turns out to be
quite doable a book is about a megabyte
and the largest library in the world is
the library of congress with 26 28
million books that makes 28 terabytes 28
terabytes isn't that much and you can
apply that over and over again youtube
or something like that or flickr if you
go for all of it is too big for us so we
just try to find the parts that are
referred to by others and we archive
those so where we are as a former church
and the reason why we bought this
building was it cuz it matched our logo
and so we thought we'd flatten the floor
make it into a library but what a
library looks like is blue and clears we
left the pews so I'm sitting on a pew
right now and um we use it for working
for having performances we even have a
little statues of all of the people that
have worked at the internet archive for
three years or more in this space to
make it a sort of a community place for
open Internet conversation to happen
when we started to collect the web most
people cut low area they're crazy or
kind of dumb for even trying I mean why
bother the average life of a web page is
a hundred days before it's either
changed or deleted so if we didn't
collect it most of the web would be gone
now I think we have an idea in our heads
that once it's been put out there is
always going to be there it will never
disappear that is absolutely not true
I'd say we're information activists we
are people that believe in the power of
openness the key thing about the
internet and the world wide web is that
it's us it's all just us we've built a
trusting celebration that is the world
wide web over the last 20 years let's
keep it going</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
