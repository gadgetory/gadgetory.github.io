favorite time of year because it gives
me a great excuse to try out some
hi-tech Halloween props today I'm gonna
show you how to set up an interactive
talking skull this one comes from fright
props it runs about $350 which sounds
pricey but you're getting a real prop
great piece of gear here and when we
crack it open later on you're gonna see
that there's some really interesting
technology going on inside but first
let's take an inventory of all the
things we're going to need to have to
make this work
I've got the skull here which comes with
a power adapter and an audio splitter
you'll need a Phillips head screwdriver
you'll need some powered speakers though
you could go with something as small as
one of these little portable speakers
you'll need a microphone it could be a
cheap karaoke mic or something a little
nicer and you'll need a little mixer or
a preamp that can work as a hub between
the microphone the skull and the
speaker's a small two channel mixer or
four channel mixer is more than enough
to get the job done you also need a few
audio cables one for the mic one going
to the skull and one going from the
skull to the speaker all right now it's
time to crack open the skull on the back
here you're gonna see two screws we're
gonna take those out and then we're
gonna slide it apart here's what's going
on inside are you gonna see that there's
a little motor here for controlling the
eyes and the front another motor down
here for controlling the jaw and then
you've got this guy this little box here
is called the Pico talk it takes any
audio signal you plug into it and it
uses the volume of that sound to
determine when to open and shut the jaw
it also controls how the eyes dart back
and forth let's get everything connected
together we're gonna run the power cable
through the base of the skull plate here
through the hole and then through the
little hole here off to the side and
then plug it in to where it says power
now we're gonna take the audio cable the
little splitter cable that comes with it
we're gonna run that through the hole
here and we're gonna plug that in to
where it says audio now we've got both
of those cables running through the hole
here this other hole here in the middle
this is meant for mounting on a pole so
we're not going to run cables through
that and then we're going to put the
back of the skull back
and screw it back together now if we
plug this into power
we should hopefully see a little twitch
it's alive next we're gonna feed some
audio into this thing and get the job
working I've got my mixer here I've got
a microphone plugged into a channel here
on the mixer and the main volumes turned
all the way up and while I'm talking
here I can see that the volume meter is
responding now to get audio from the
mixer to the skull I'm gonna run a cable
from the output of the mixer into any
one of the two inputs here from the
splitter cable okay it's starting to
work now but the jaw isn't opening quite
as much as it could be so the simple fix
is to crank the volume here on the mixer
until you get a more natural jaw
movement like that now if you really
want to geek out you can open this thing
back up and mess the Pico talk
controller inside you can adjust the
audio sensitivity you can adjust how
quickly the eyes start back and forth
you can adjust the range of the jaw
itself all of that is possible but I'm
gonna skip that for the sake of time
here and jump ahead to the next step
which is hooking up the skull to some
speakers any cheap pair of speakers will
do but I'm gonna go with a little small
rechargeable speaker that I can fit
inside the skull so there's a little
cable here wired to the bottom of the
speaker so all I need to do is plug this
into the other output on the splitter
and turn up the volume on the speaker
and we're good to go all right now turn
the volume back up on the mixer here I
can hear myself coming from the skull he
looks like he's doing a reasonable job
mimicking me now I've got my own little
undead buddy I can hang out with all
Halloween alright so where do you go
from here you could attach a whole
skeleton to the rest of this thing
another way to take this further would
be to take out your old guitar pedals
assuming you have some and you can use
some crazy effects on the voice this
one's a reverb pedal plug it in and then
you can get some extra spooky echo
Halloween sound hahaha
you could also take yourself out of the
equation entirely and how the skull
react to recorded audio over on scene
out how to I have a video tutorial on
how to turn your computer keyboard into
an interactive sound board I also have
an advanced one on programming your own
Halloween sound and light show using a
prop controller called a key banger
combining all of those techniques along
with this interactive skull will make
for a super nerd tastic Halloween and
I'm all about that so you see this icon
and all about wishing Miss Piggy
Halloween
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
