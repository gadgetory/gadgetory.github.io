yeah I'm the CEO of the ocean cleaner
it's the ocean cleanups mission to
develop advanced technologies to read
the world's oceans of plastic we want to
reduce the concentration of floating
plastic in the oceans with ninety
percent by 2040 system one is a floating
tube a floatation device with a skirts
attached beneath it the skirt is
underwater for about three meters that
system will move around the ocean in a
c-shape or au shape catching up on the
plastic collecting it inside of it we
care so much about the marine life and
how much harm the plastic is doing to it
so in designing the system we've taken
great care not to have any adverse
effects effect on the wildlife that's
out there our system is not propelled at
all apart from the natural forces of the
ocean it is proposed by the forces of
nature it is designed to be a passive
cleaning-up system
my name is lo Halyburton
I'm the lead oceanographer for the ocean
cleanup and basically we study plastic
pollution in the ocean so means
understanding the sources the transport
and the fate of plastic in the ocean
think we're saying that macro plastic
pollution and particular is increasing
substantially over the last few years
and I think it's very important to
understand that we need to stop putting
plastic in the ocean so plastic are
being released in the ocean and they
basically move with currents with wind
and wave and accumulates in the
subtropical waters in the North Pacific
particularly in what we call the
subtropical gyre and those are areas
where rescue the currents are converging
and marine debris accumulates it does it
does migrates but it stays relatively in
the same area but it moves there is five
accumulation zone the same same type so
one in each oceanic person we believe
the one in the North Pacific is the
largest
I think they can start by reducing the
use of plastic parts few single-use
plastic I think is is one one big topic
and and also I think that cleanup
matters you know anytime you go to the
beach to reverse forest in natural
environments if you find trash it's
always good to just pick it up and put
in the bin right
our system one is a better type version
it's the minimum viable product so and
it actually works so it is the intensive
start cleaning up but we want to learn
from it for this first year of operation
and collects a lot of valuable
information in order to be able to clean
up 50% in five years we need multiple
clean up systems so we are now launching
our first system the system one which
will prove the concepts and will give us
enough information so that we can
implement it in a redesign in the next
generation of clean up system which
should be even bigger and better and
more productive
we intend to scale up and we need a
fleet of about 60 of those types of
systems we're in a bit of a hurry
because we do see the risk of the
plastic that's currently out there
breaking down into smaller pieces which
will cause even more harm so we really
want to get as much out now that it's
still big as soon as we can so we do
have some ambitions ambitious plans to
scale up fast we believe that we will
have the fleet of 60 systems in
operation by 2021
so for the next few months are going to
be super tense this is this is an
exciting moment but of course the moment
were looking most forward to is to bring
this first plastic back to shore it's
you know because that means that it's
proven technology and that's what we
hope to achieve with this first system
so the idea is that we take the plastic
back to land and we work together with
our recycling partners and the idea is
that we can process that plastic and
turn it into very nice desirable
products that are durable designed to
not end up back into the oceans and by
selling those we actually help to to
help fund the cleanup and fund the
operation of the cleanup system so next
few months I'll be really obsessively
looking at the data that's coming in
from the vessel from the data streams
from the cleanup system which will
hopefully then allow us to catch the
first plastic and bring it to land</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
