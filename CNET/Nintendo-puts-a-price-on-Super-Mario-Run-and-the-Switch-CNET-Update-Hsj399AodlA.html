landing on iPhones and iPads in a month
from now on December 15th but it won't
be completely free
Super Mario run will be a free download
to try out but it'll cost $10 to open up
access to the full game the game is a
bit different than other Mario games
because Mario keeps running
automatically and you have to tap to
keep him jumping around to collect coins
and avoid obstacles that makes it easy
to play with one hand there are also
three modes in world Tork the goal is to
get through the level to rescue the
princess from evil Bowser you know the
usual stuff
toad rally opens up when you've cleared
some levels in the world tour here you
compete with others around the world to
collect the most coins and there's
Kingdom Builder where you take all the
coins you've earned in the toad rally
and spend them on buildings and
decorations to make your own lands no
word on when it'll be coming to Android
but it will eventually meanwhile
Nintendo is also keeping fans curious
about the price of its new game system
the Nintendo switch coming out in March
of next year over the weekend the
Canadian Toys R Us website listed the
Nintendo switch as costing about 330
Canadian dollars which comes out to
about 250 bucks in the US the site
removed the listing oopsies if that
price is right that means it'll cost
less than the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox
one and that's also about what the
Nintendo 3ds handheld cost at launch the
switch is portable but it can also be
docked at home to play games on your
large screen TV I'm Bridget Carey stay
