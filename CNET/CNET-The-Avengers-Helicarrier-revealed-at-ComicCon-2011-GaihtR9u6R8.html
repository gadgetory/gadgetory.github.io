and we're here on the Helicarrier kind
of like the home base for the Avengers
if you don't know already in joining me
is Arun he's the director of
communications for Marvel and just tell
us some of the elements that these are
parts that are actually gonna be in the
movie yeah let me give you every bit of
background if you've seen the movies you
know Sam Jackson's been this recurring
character called Nick Fury he runs a
super spy group called shield and
they're based on a really awesome like
flying fortress called the Helicarrier
and this is really where the Avengers
are going to work in the new movie
Avengers coming out a next May we
actually flew in real pieces from the
bridge of the Helicarrier we also have
pieces of the set worst other shield
agents have worked you'll see the
screens are they look interact if you
can't really do much of them but they're
fun we have people dressed up as shield
agents here this weekend so with one
thing we do at Marvel that no one else
really does is we bring pieces and set
the fans can work with no one else
doesn't what we love doing it these are
kind of these panels here i'm sure that
sam jackson and the other shield agents
and the Avengers were working on them
doing some stuff here is an accurate way
of bringing up Intel assessing the
situation you know the movie will
actually see images on these yeah
exactly takes a special the great
special effects this is Sam Jackson get
assess situation he's got to protect the
world we gotta protect right here yeah
right here you know Canada right up here
we got Asia right over here take care of
Australia right over here yeah the whole
world they got to take care of
everything and so this is his way he's
got four screens which i think is a
dream for any gig I'll touch screen
interface like minority report style all
totally works it never crashes cell yeah
this is this is how he assesses
situation and commands the commands
everything I'm feeling like a real
Avenger here tell me what I'm looking at
you are looking at exactly the shield
agents will be looking at a situation of
what's going on there you can see how
you can see the Helicarrier thing right
now see what's going on around the world
you can assess everything going on you
can even type on the keyboard this is
how they they make everything work again
get a geeks dream you got more than one
screen here operating I guess off some
kind of stark OS I would guess I have no
idea but this is a you can see has ton
of information there they're working
with that gives you an idea of how cool
everything is going to look in Avengers
like this is this doesn't look like
something out of some old school to you
know Independence Day movie this is this
is all really cutting-edge kind of
another thing featured here at marvel's
booth is this is Captain America's
Avengers costume for the movie that's
coming out this is an updated look
you'll see you no longer has the
suspenders that you see in the current
movie and you'll see as iconic scar
right on the chest this gloves are here
his pants issues as well but this is the
costume that you'll see in the new movie
for the Avengers look guys I'm a SHIELD
agent we have the official shield logo
baking a bright right behind me and this
is the biggest the baddest stage at
comic-con for the Avengers I can't wait
for the movie for sina com i'm brian
song here at comic-con 2011 Avengers
