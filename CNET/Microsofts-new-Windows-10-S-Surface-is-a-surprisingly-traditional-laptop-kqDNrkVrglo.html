than a tablet with a clip-on cover or
screen that plugs into a keyboard dock
it's something completely unexpected a
good old-fashioned clamshell laptop it's
also the flagship for new version of
Microsoft's operating system called
Windows can s the students or anyone who
wants something a bit simpler or more
secure this is basically Windows 10 but
can only install pre-checked software
from the Microsoft App Store so it's
harder to brick your system want
something more open with a few button
clicks it can upgrade to traditional
Windows 10 Pro which basically just
brings back the ability to download and
install your own software on most
Windows 10s laptops that'll be a $50
upgrade in this case it's free until the
end of 2017 which is good because for
something pitched as a student laptop
it's on the expensive side starting at
$9.99 you do get a very thin light
premium filling laptop which weighs less
than three pounds and comes in four
colors each with a durable matching
fabric cover over the keyboard tray
battery life is said to be more than 14
hours and Microsoft says by students
they actually mean college students as
in this is a laptop you could buy for a
freshman orientation and use until you
graduate of course since it's a surface
all the cool extra tools like the
surface pen and the surface dial still
work with it
but it's designed to run a strong
keyboard and touchpad experience above
all else that's important because while
surface got its start with 201 hybrids
and people always love talking about
tablets and 360 degree rotating hinges
sometimes you just want a really nice
laptop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
