again I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update the aim away message is
making a comeback Facebook is testing
away status messages just like the ones
that were part of our online lives in
the 90s and early 2000s on AOL instant
messenger but Facebook isn't calling it
an away message it's called a sidebar
status in the mobile app you can swipe
left to see a list of the friends you
interact with most and that's where the
Status Messages will live now just last
week facebook unveiled messenger calm as
a standalone website for the private
shot so if messenger calm becomes a
desktop application it's just another
step closer to becoming more like aim
The Verge reports this is only being
tested now in Taiwan and Australia but
you better brush up on your away message
skills just in case it expands I mean
picking the right quote or song lyric
that may or may not be about a certain
someone was an art form to perfect at
least this time your way message won't
disappear if your mom picks up the home
phone and kicks you off yeah I wonder
how many people watching this right now
even know what I'm talking about I feel
so old LOL jk in other news jawbone has
new fitness bands to track your activity
but before we get into the features just
know that the names of these products
are a bit hard to follow in 2013 jawbone
release the up24 band it then created
the up three and that's arriving next
week and the company just announced that
up to but this summer we're going to
have the up for yeah let's hope jawbone
can count your steps better than i can
count gadgets now all the new trackers
have no display you'll need to read your
status on your iphone or android phone
app these are not totally waterproof you
can wear them in the shower just don't
go swimming the up 3 is 180 dollars it
adds heart rate tracking with metal
sensors on the inside but it doesn't
measure your heart rate during exercise
it's just resting heart rate it also can
sense the electrical conductance of the
skin which can be used to track stress
levels but who knows how accurate that
will be on your wrist temperature and
humidity affect those measurements the
up
to looks the same but trims eighty
dollars off the price since it has no
heart rate tracker both the up two and
three are only in the US for now this
summer jawbone is coming out with the up
for it's just like the three but it has
an NFC sensor so you can use it to
wirelessly pay at terminals similar to
Apple pay but it's only for American
Express cards that model is two hundred
dollars jawbone and Apple pay or not the
only companies working on ways to pay
with a flick of your wrist MasterCard is
currently testing payment bands in
Canada and similar payment wristbands
are being used by a bank and Spain that
