2011 who do we have in the house 57 make
some noise baby all right so 50 I heard
this is your first CS is that correct
yeah I'm excited about being here you
now came to unveil the sleep by 50 cent
brand of headphones a wireless hybrid
headphone and you know it's been over a
year and a half I've been working on
this actual project I met Jason and Mark
raikou and Mark worked in a hearing aid
field for 35 years so he understands how
that human is register sound and had the
kind of woman in acoustic engineers
asleep oh do that I wanted to be
associated with now probably like the
first thing that someone says it's like
Oh 50 sleek audio dr. Dre and beats
that's like you know everyone's gonna
think about that backwards it's by dre
beats by dre league by 50 sorry haha so
keep it right even right you know I knew
that those comparisons would happen
right away so you know having you know a
wireless hybrid headphone that doesn't
actually exist within the Beast line was
you know my first thought and then Dre
is uh I mean I love him yeah you know
he's like he's someone who was work with
me throughout my entire career my entire
successful career cuz there were a few
years when I was doing it nobody was
paying attention but I'm not angry I'm
not in haha you know as you know dre and
jimmy iovine both for people that you
know I credit to my success in music you
know portions of it of course I had to
write it and perform it you know but you
know I I think that this room for 50
cent and dr. Dre the way there's Gaga
beats and diddy beats and Bieber beats
and everybody else is out there
listen you could say things about
artists because you just state in your
opinion on some levels but you don't
dare say anything about Bieber you
understand his fans will not understand
your apology and they have such passion
that they will you know they'll that
burning desire will have them at dinner
yeah inside you're gonna get some now
you partnered you know you've done a lot
of businesses obviously everyone knows
about vitamin water all right I don't
know if you guys have heard of the
magics take condoms yeah well you know
you know most condom companies make more
money selling party balloons meaning
maybe you should wrap it up more often
but you know I think I you know I
explored that you know the idea of doing
that and being part of a bigger more
successful safe sex campaign I think
wrap it up has been heard so often
there's no longer effective so what
would be like the new slogan you think
then oh man you know just associating it
to music that has sexual content in it
might make the person that's enjoying
themselves more conscious of it ok ok so
now also this is your first yes you know
you get have walked the floor see much
were you just been bounced around doing
it or know what I did get a chance to
see some things not not everything but
you know when I was coming through i did
see things i had this massage chair and
she's my girlfriend the massage chairs
my gum she's a perfect girlfriend she
never complains she never says i'm tired
i was like can we just just come back
tomorrow you know so i have a lot of fun
with it and i just saw like in the
middle of all of the commotion like 15
people sleep and these little massage
Kiss I said I mean maybe I'd get one at
all yeah well we walk four miles right
you've seen how big these halls are
everybody here I'm sure your legs are
tired just staying up over there right
so they're like no so those massage
chairs are good now also are you what do
you feel about this whole 3d thing right
the whole technology do you like it
you do not like it what do you what your
thoughts are I think it's exciting you
know and I've invested in a company
called game of graphics that they didn't
actually do well game of graphics it
went away and then I've also invested in
gonna optical this is here nces now and
they create a lenses do to protect your
eyes from looking at digital screens too
long and also I lenses did a protect
your eyes from watching 3d televisions
and 3d a lot of the video games are
designed with with those features in it
that would actually damage your eyes
over time so I want to strain your eyes
are damaged eyesight you know what that
to be the price of you enjoying yourself
for a short period of time yeah now
there's a lot of people here we come to
vegas for CES we come to vegas for other
things but what is it like 150 for the
avn awards oh yeah well haha i know i
know what you did so what is it like
when you what is it like when you come
out to vegas i mean we did we don't live
in your world but what do you do when
you're in vegas and you can tell us as
much as you want o.o smitha it's been
excited you know I I stayed a really
nice hotels I picked the sweets that I
wouldn't usually stay in and make myself
comfortable and uh you now go out I've
been gambling you know are you up or
down I'm up I actually have the money
right here we go you got more than fifty
cents in your pocket right oh I'm doing
good I don't know about you well I'm
going good he's like he's like make it
rain over in the corner so you collected
all there alright so back to your
headphones I mean what do you like about
the most I mean I see a lot of the
carbon fiber design pretty sleek a
little flashy too yeah that was actually
my input and you know with Jason
no providing opportunities and options
for me to decide what I wanted to do
with it I decided to use the carbon
fiber and even down to the logo to s and
it you know I designed it myself and you
know what when we also you coming in I
mean you have quite quite the large
entourage yeah yeah pretty large I mean
it's really to protect the general
public from the general public you know
because if people get excited they run
if they slip and fall they sue me I
don't understand why this happens like
we need laws to prevent people from
suing people because the legal fees
start to add up and you know I sit those
depositions for no reasons they said I
did it I didn't do it now music wise
