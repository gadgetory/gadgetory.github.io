there are too many cat videos well it's
more than that
we have too many baby photos too many
tweets Google Docs videos gifts networks
journals logs reports trackers we as
humans are producing a crazy amount of
data at this pace we are generating more
data than we have the capacity to store
on hard drives and that's why right now
for much of our digital archives we are
still relying on magnetic tape yes the
same kind of tech we used for VHS and
cassettes tape takes up space and it can
start to go bad after 10 years and needs
to be replaced
anyone got a pencil but science found a
new way to store our information on
synthetic made in a lab DNA the same DNA
that makes up the building blocks of
life and it can last hundreds of
thousands of years not to mention it
takes up a whole lot less space I am
Bridget Carey let's break it down
go to illustrate this concept I shall
use a jelly bean this jelly bean weighs
about three grams but say you have three
grams worth of DNA scientists can pack
600 million gigabytes of data in
something that weighs as much as this
jelly bean that means you could just
store all the rolls data in a swimming
pool of jelly beans and if you think
that's pretty sweet
it gets better there's a company that
already figured out how to turn this
into a business
it is using DNA to store Bitcoin
passwords what is in this vial exactly
it is a twelve word passphrase that
would give access to a cryptocurrency
wallet so inside a little drop of liquid
is a cryptocurrency wallet keep correct
I spoke to Vishal boo-yan he's the
co-founder and CEO of a startup called
Carver the way he sees it the safest
place to store the key that unlocks your
digital money is inside a drop of DNA is
this what did this vial the same thing
that is in our DNA it's synthetic DNA so
it's not from a human or anything but it
is identical oh sure you could be a
boring person and write down your a
Bitcoin information on a piece of paper
or save it on a computer file but think
of how fast technology changes what if
you store important information on a
thumb drive but 20 years from now no one
is using thumb drives
I found this floppy disk in my parents
house it was mine when I was a kid but
what if I saved something important on
it will I ever find a way to see what's
in this historic treasured memory or
maybe it's just some old middle school
homework I really don't know technology
changes but DNA will always be around
it's durable and can last thousands of
years in a cold dry place I feel like I
can damage this is it fragile like like
today yeah like like like how well can
DNA beast
like you can like a like bad you can
shake it around like it's good
DNA is the only thing that won't ever
become obsolete sequencing technology is
getting faster and cheaper just every
couple of years and so and it's always
relevant as long as we're alive
DNA will always be a relevant medium but
uh about that whole cost thing making
synthetic DNA for data is not cheap
Carver customers pay $1,000 to get this
done and that's just for really little
bit of data to me I think to pay the
thousand dollars to do this is
absolutely worth it as insurance policy
on my current holdings and where I think
they could be in the future
Nate is one of Carver's customers I met
him in his apartment on the first day he
got his DNA data in the mail which he
keeps in the freezer for him the DNA is
a backup to his backup in case something
happens to the computer he stored it on
and if that day comes he'll need to send
it to a lab to read the DNA sequence
it's the final insurance policy in the
last line of defense in case the other
solutions fail am I am i holding your
retirement plan maybe I should give this
back to you I hope you are that that's
that's the goal that one day this will
be their retirement Carver says it has
28 clients so far and in time you may
see competitors pop up with different
storage ideas while this may sound very
new and very bizarre I think this is
going to be and especially over the next
five years ten years this is going to be
a lot more commonplace than people think
so how does data a bunch of ones and
zeroes get turned into DNA the concept
is pretty simple let's start with the
DNA rungs of a strand are made of four
nucleotide bases abbreviated to be a TC
and gene so you can simply translate the
binary into the language of the four DNA
letters a could equal 0 0 T 0 1 C is 1 0
and G is 1 1 so your string of zeros and
ones is now DNA code and the lab prints
out the chemicals to stitch it all
together as synth
da I spoke with one of the scientists
that mastered this method Deena
Zielinski it's just like any other data
we can read copy and write DNA now so
it's not as it's not as crazy as it
sounds zalinsky co-authored a paper on
how to do it and in the research
successfully store different files into
DNA including one of the first films
ever made an 1896 french short
black-and-white film of the arrival of a
train it was only 50 seconds long
we also encoded an old operating system
and an Amazon gift card which has been
spent I feel like I always have to say
that some people don't get too excited
in total her team put two megabytes of
data on DNA and the process cost seven
grand so DNA storage is too expensive
now to be practical putting the family
photo album on DNA will have to wait and
another downside it takes time to access
your files you may have to wait a day or
two for a lab to read it and convert it
all back to data but even so the
potential is pretty cool also there's
one question in all of this that was on
my mind if data can be turned into DNA
can we store data in ourselves inside
the DNA that lives inside of us that's
probably the most common question
actually I mean the answer is yes we
could do it but it's there's still a lot
about our own DNA that we don't know and
it's a lot safer to just store it in a
tube in a refrigerator or a freezer
somewhere so right now we're only at the
Bitcoin in your freezer stage of this
technology but hey thumb drives as
actual thumbs not recommended but still
in the realm of possibility
way to go science
thanks for watching list know in the
comments what would be the first thing
you'd back up into DNA subscribe like
and ding the bell to keep up with my
latest breakdowns and let me know what
other topics you'd like me to explore in
a future video and if they involve jelly
beans go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
