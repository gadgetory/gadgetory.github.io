asks people to come up with a caption
for one cartoon a week it's a popular
contest but with about five thousand
submissions a week the magazine wanted
to find a faster way to sift through all
those jokes it turned to computer
scientists at the University of
Wisconsin who created a way for people
to vote on submissions we met with
cartoon editor Bob mankoff who showed us
the new feature from the New Yorkers
point of view from our point of view is
more engagement on the site and I think
it's fun for people to do what will
happen is that once it's live on the
site thousands of people will be doing
this simultaneously the algorithm behind
all this is working feverishly to look
at the rank how people are judging this
and eventually it's trying to bubble up
essentially to look at which ones are
ranked higher rather than lower for as
more people come to judge it and the
idea is so that you can as quickly as
possible find the rankings okay so it
says please rank the entries to this
caption contest image then click done
button you can rank as many or as few as
you like but five is too few and 5,000
is wait so here's the Peter vay drawing
and they're all they're all carrying
this big briefcase and as if he he
wanted to die the way he lives so it's a
funeral you still seeing not bad for the
record I hate our new business cards so
that tempt you certainly have to think
about that now all these people are on
the one business card it might be a
little bit too long to work as a joke
that think it's funny you should have to
think it out on the other end is clever
I'm all for flexible working but this
job here and obviously that's a bad
capture any caption that ends with but
this is ridiculous so that's unfunny
it's a lengthy brief compared to the
other ones with thumbs on
okay now you understand the thousands of
these the best way to look at this
master this is 5,000 or let's say it's
50,000 it's through crowdsourcing but
with people its people are best</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
