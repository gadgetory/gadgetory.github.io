not quite feeling bikini-ready so why
not do what the cool kids do and get
yourself one of those fancy wearable
fitness trackers just not the FuelBand
since Nikes not making that anymore
also the Fitbit force might give you a
rash tech let's just spell it out for
you I'm Donald Bell and this top 5 I'll
be counting down the best wearable
fitness trackers selected by CNET senior
editor Scott Stein starting off at
number 5 the misfit shine $100 buys you
the most modern and mysterious looking
fitness tracker out there and wear it on
your wrist you can wear it on your shirt
you can wear it in a crown you made out
of tin foil so that you can communicate
with cats yeah it looks kind of crazy
but maybe that's better than advertising
yourself as Johnny fitness it's a shame
that it's iOS only but it gets the job
done just try not to lose it because as
you can imagine trying to describe this
thing the lost-and-found could be tricky
number 4 has some love for Android the
basis band $200 buys you a wristband
that isn't prettiest thing out there but
it does have a display and some cool
tricks it measures your sleep patterns
and heart rate in addition to steps and
activities it syncs over Bluetooth and
keeps it charged for around 4 days and
the app does a great job of keeping you
motivated with fitness goals and rewards
it's too bulky for my tastes but if
you're looking for a watch like design
this may be your preferred way to go I
number 3 the Fitbit flex one of the most
recognizable names on this list but also
one of the oldest products the Flex
managed to dodge the issue they had with
the Fitbit force and in spite of his
time on the market it still remains a
solid option at $99 comfortable fit
water resistant design and it can
wirelessly sync with both iPhone and
some Android phones as well as Mac and
PC I actually like this option best if
you're going for something understated
my only hesitation is that you just know
Fitbit is rushing to bring something new
to the market after the Fitbit force
recall at number 2 the jawbone up24 like
the misfit the design will get you
noticed and $130 for a fitness tracker
that actually looks fashionable doesn't
sound like a bad deal no screen here or
heartrate monitor
you get a pedometer calories burned and
sleep tracking best of all it can go a
whole week without a charge great app
for both iOS and Android now before we
get to number one I should mention a
couple reasons you may want to hold off
on fitness trackers Apple and Google for
the third year going everyone is
expecting the Apple is gonna show off
their I watch any day now
in fact the death of the Nike FuelBand
is suspected to be linked to the
resurrection of the Nike FuelBand as a
feature of the iWatch also Google's
Android wear project will start to bear
fruit this year and we've already seen a
preview of some of the classy-looking
smartwatches companies are making that
said if you think either company's gonna
put out a wearable under $200 you're
delirious and so that brings us to the
number one wearable fitness tracker
recommended by C net Scott Stein the
ything 's pulse o to the latest update
to one of our favorite fitness trackers
of 2013 comes with an improved wristband
and the ability to check your blood
oxygen levels in addition to heartrate
and steps taken $119 asking price works
with both iOS and Android and belongs to
an ecosystem of other why these products
including a scale and a Sleep System you
get two weeks of battery life and a real
display if this won't whip you into
shape
it's time to pay for a personal trainer
so there you go
five fitness trackers that may give you
the edge when you need to get in better
shape but for all the latest fitness
tracker reviews head over to cnet.com
