we're going to take a look at the sony
bdp s 590 this is a mid-priced 3d
blu-ray player it's right in the middle
of Sony's line and it's currently
selling for a hundred and forty dollars
now most blu-ray players these days look
pretty boring but Sony actually made the
s5 90 look pretty nice the finish on the
top has a cool textured look to it and
the way that it tapers down towards the
bottom is a nice touch there are a few
front panel buttons and a USB port but
that's pretty much it around back you'll
see the standard HDMI optical audio
output and ethernet jacks plus there's
built-in Wi-Fi on this you also notice
that Sony includes a few extra ports
compared to competitors including a
coaxial audio output in another USB port
both the front and the back USB port can
play back a variety of digital media
formats and while most blu-ray players
aren't great local media streamers the
Sony actually did pretty well with the
divx and the MKV files that I threw at
it the user interface uses Sony's
cross-media bar menu system that's also
used on the ps3 now while that works
pretty good on the PlayStation it
doesn't work quite as well with the
blu-ray player especially when you're
scrolling through endless amounts of
video services Sony's list of streaming
media apps is impressive including
netflix hulu plus Amazon Instant Pandora
and voodoo and we're happy to see that
Sony has finally updated its Netflix app
to have the latest interface although
the interfaces for Amazon Instant in
hulu plus still lag behind competitors
if you're getting a blu-ray player
specifically to use Amazon or Hulu Plus
I'd probably suggest another player sony
also has another interface for browsing
its apps called the sony entertainment
network and this layout is actually
nicer with an easy tile-based layout but
since it requires an extra step to go
into that menu I can't imagine a lot of
people are going to use it luckily if
you just want to get to netflix there's
a dedicated button right on the remote
so you can skip all the menus completely
image quality was excellent on blu-ray
movies dvds and netflix but that's to be
expected since all blu-ray players
basically have the same image quality of
these days on the other hand the sony is
relatively slow loading discs in some
cases taking almost
twice as long as other players so if you
watch a lot of blu-ray movies you'll
have to be patient overall the sony bdp
s 590 is a really nice-looking blu-ray
player with a pretty strong set of
features but because of the slow load
times and the user interface quirks I
think the editors choice winning
panasonic DMP BDT 220 is a better choice
for most buyers i'm matthew miskovic and
this is the sony bdp s 59</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
