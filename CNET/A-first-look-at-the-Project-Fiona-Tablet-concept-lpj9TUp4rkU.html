of booth you having a first look at
something at CES that is pretty
interesting a lot of times when i go to
CES we see products that are brand new
sometimes we see concepts and here is a
pretty neat concept it's by the company
razor it's called Project Fiona it's a
PC gaming tablet concept so here forget
the Android with your apps and the
iDevice apps these are PC games that run
on here and as you can see it's a tablet
that has two game control handles on it
and the innards of this guy is pretty
powerful it's an intel core i7 processor
the most powerful processor ever put in
a tablet and it takes it also up a step
with the audio there is Dolby Home
Theater audio in this thing this tablet
runs on a windows interface you can be
able to play most PC games for windows
on this tablet this is also tablet that
would give you a lot of feedback so if
your shoot a machine gun it's going to
give you a feedback with the way it
feels and the sound is pretty is this
really for serious gamers you know there
are always land parties when people take
their PC to a friend's house how easy is
this to be portable with your PC gaming
that's the idea that razors trying to
sell I'm trying to see engage equals
interest in a device like this raises a
company that typically makes gaming
devices like mice and keyboard and other
peripherals but here they have a concept
other hoping takes off it's priced to be
around a thousand dollars so stay tuned
from the company is seeing where this
heads from CNN's booth at CES 2012 I'm
Bridget Carey with your first look at
razors projects Fiona a PC gaming tablet
concept
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
