Isis's new technology what we've got
here is the PadFone mini it's a
miniaturized version of its smartphone
that fits into a tablet let's talk about
the phone first it's got a 4-inch 480 by
800 pixel resolution that's not a
particularly high resolution but it
looks alright the screen seems quite
bright everything seems very colourful
so I'm not too worried around the back
there's an 8 megapixel camera which has
quite a cool selfie feature when you're
pointing the phone at yourself and some
friends it will take the photo
automatically once it detects some faces
when things really get interesting is
when you slide the phone into its tablet
dock this is a 7 inch screen it's got a
1280 by 800 pixel resolution so
everything is just a lot bigger than it
is on the phone something quite cool
about this is that it's got its own
battery so you can charge it up
separately and when you plug the
smartphone in that will get charged up
by the tablet Asus has loaded this
technology with its own Google now
equivalent software it's called what's
next and it pulls data from your
calendar it's got the weather things
like that and it puts it all in one easy
to digest screen for you
a final note on the design because I
quite like the chunky feel of the tablet
and the phone it comes in a range of
colors as well and who doesn't like
bright colors pricing for this is still
up in the air but looking at the specs
I'm hopeful that it will be quite cheap
we should see it sometime in the first
half of this year let me know what you
think then check out CES cnet.com for
more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
