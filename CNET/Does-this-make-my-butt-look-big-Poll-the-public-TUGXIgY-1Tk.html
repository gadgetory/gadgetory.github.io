Jay marker BB and this is the show where
we tap the finest pieces of app on
planet earth today we're checking out
thumb which basically lets you pull the
public about anything you want use it
correctly and it can be a nice little
tool for some casual research here's how
it works there are two ways to use thumb
you can ask for opinions or you can give
your opinion if you want to ask for
opinions first type in your question the
yes or no variety works best then attach
a photo you can use a photo from your
gallery take a new photo or grab one
from the web all from within thumbs
interface after that select a category
you know to give your question some
context then hit get opinions it'll take
a minute for people to start chiming in
so you can go ahead and vote on other
people's questions while you wait you
can vote with a thumbs up a thumbs down
or you can keep it neutral if you like
you can also add comments which users
always appreciate and to make it easy
each time you vote the app will
automatically move you on to the next
question at this point my only issue
with thumb is that some of the users
tend to ask questions that aren't
exactly optimized for the platform if
you know what I'm saying take this one
doesn't exactly lend itself to the
thumbs up thumbs down format right so
just be sure to pose your questions
correctly and thumb will be a really
useful tool for everybody now to go back
and see what the public thinks of my
question looks like sixty-seven percent
of the thumb population does not think
the 49ers will go to the Super Bowl and
if you want you can also see the results
of your previous questions as you can
see here 71 percent of thumbs users were
totally wrong about the shirt I was
wearing yesterday and that's it folks
thumb is free and available on both the
android market and itunes app store i
highly suggest you download it and give
my red lumberjack shirt some love
otherwise if you've got another app that
you want me to tap holler at me on the
twitter thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
