most arresting phones you can buy but
looks are just the beginning I'm
jessica's all court for cnet and this is
the samsung galaxy s6 edge instead of
straight lines like the galaxy s6 these
edges slope down to form a ridge along
the back it looks really cool and
believe it or not it still feels secure
and balanced I never felt like I was
going to drop it the round of glass also
creates a kind of bubbled book that
gives the stuff on your screen a little
bit more life but the s6 edge isn't only
about design it also has an edge display
that slides out on the left or right
side to give you extra features and
tools it's here that you see
notifications for missed calls and
messages it also get alerts from your
favorite apps the edge display can also
put five of your friends into a sort of
color-coded speed dial that you'll use
as a shortcut to reach out to them or to
respond to a missed message or call
here's something new if your phone is
upside down say at the dinner table or
at work and a call comes in from one of
your five primo contacts the phones edge
display lights up to catch your eye if
you can't talk pressing the sensor on
the back can send a canned message that
you'll call them back after hours the
edges night mode facilitate some
shut-eye by dimming down the whole
screen except for the edge display which
shows you the date and time will keep in
your room dark enough to sleep you can
get that same info anytime by swiping
along the edge display even though it
shares pretty much every hardware spec
with the galaxy s6 the edge here is the
cooler more interesting phone it's also
more expensive and harder to get so is
it worth the extra dough I say yes
absolutely if you love the design and
you've got money to burn because you're
not going to find another phone quite
like this however while the edge display
alone is handy I'm not quite convinced
that it adds enough to warrant the
additional costs I think most people
will do just fine with the s6 I'm
doesn't get all court for cnet read up
on all the pros and cons in my review at
