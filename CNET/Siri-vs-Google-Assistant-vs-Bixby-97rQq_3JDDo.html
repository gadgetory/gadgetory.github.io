a really really bad rap battle save me
from the Clippy the peek peek and pop
and you don't stop search for pictures
search for pie I searched I searched at
least I tried we're comparing three Siri
on iOS 11 Google assistant and Bixby
voice they can all do basic things like
check the weather and set reminders
Bixby voice on the galaxy s 8 and s 8 +
lets you do things with your voice that
you'd normally do with taps and text on
screen series the old guard but has a
new voice and Google assistants in the
middle across Android and iOS so let's
see what they can do know that we're
running this Siri on iOS 11s Vader sorry
things might be a little bit buggy and
subject to change
trust the easy stuff what's the weather
in San Francisco it's currently clear in
64 degrees in San Francisco in 63 with
lots of sunshine today said an alum for
6:00 a.m. all right for 6:00 a.m. okay
alarm set for 6 o'clock a.m. take a
selfie
ten on Bluetooth okay I turned on
bluetooth done bluetooth is on turn on
the flashlight set system volume 250 you
don't seem to be playing anything right
now
okay I set it to 50 okay change my
wallpaper to the most recent photo okay
we can set our wallpaper here Bixby gets
it right these pictures should match
Google searches the web and Cirie gets
halfway there mixie lets you open an app
and perform an action in one go like
open Instagram and post a recent photo
okay let's write a caption for this post
Google assistant is searching the web
serie wants to do more I wish I could
but Instagram hasn't set it up with me
yet this might change when iOS 11 rolls
out full third party app support
now both the assistant and Siri can
still open apps and all three can do
this even if you have to say it in a
slightly different way send a whatsapp
message to Charlene read my last message
alright here's the message from John
what should I get for lunch today as
long as you're using the default
messaging app vixy's got it
I found your most recent message from
Lexie sabbaths
comma hey would you like to reply so to
Siri you have one last text message it's
from Lexie Sabine do you want to hear it
Google assistant shows you the message
then asks if you want it read out loud
it says sorry I can't talk right now
one of Google assistant strengths is a
continued conversation show me Jennifer
Aniston movies Jennifer Aniston's movies
include Horrible Bosses we're the
Millers and 40 others household is Jean
she's five feet five inches tall Siri
and Bixby can't have this conversation
how tall is she
Lexie
but BICS begets context in some apps say
you're watching YouTube and you want to
use your voice to find more content fix
forget this but you have to hold down
the button rather than say hi big speech
show me my subscriptions sure thing here
it is how do you say with the bathroom
in Spanish in Spanish where's the
bathroom is what is where's the bathroom
in Spanish can you if you say translate
to Spanish big speed vision can
translate whatever the camera say is
kind of useful but not what I want
okay scanning now all three have remind
us down pat remind me to water the
plants when I get home got it I think
when you arrive at home and they'll
prompt you to enter your home address if
you haven't already there's no address
for home let's add one to create the
reminder so they all have strengths in
different areas Bixby voice is really
good at complex tasks Google assistant
is fast and great at conversations and
Siri is good at hands-free things like
reading messages or translation but
we'll revisit this when iOS 11 is
officially released
hey what about me why am I so lonely</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
