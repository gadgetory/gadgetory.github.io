company and a fitness company coming
together to create a SmartWatch New
Balance provided the running expertise
and Intel detective power it they say
it's a watch designed by runners for
runners complete with Strava integration
the popular tracking and social network
app used by runners and cyclists this
means it definitely checks all the boxes
in terms of running features heart rate
monitor built in GPS waterproofing up to
50 meters and up to four gigs of onboard
music storage to pair with your
Bluetooth headset most importantly it
gives you complete independence from the
phone when you're out pounding the
pavement or treadmill what it claims to
do particularly well is heartrate though
it uses a similar optical sensor as its
competitors it's specifically designed
to prevent light from interfering with
the reading to provide a more accurate
result
it gives a continuous read throughout
your run and then the Strava app does a
great job at breaking down the
information for you by average max and
splits another useful feature its
physical buttons which allow you to
quickly start or stop a run or access
your music without fumbling with a
screen with sweaty fingers sadly no
barometer to measure elevation but
Strava uses a database to calculate
elevation when you're on a run battery
is key when it comes to long-distance
running and the run IQ seems to be up to
the challenge
it's supposed to last 24 hours of
moderate use or 5 hours during activity
this means continuous heartrate and GPS
always-on that's enough to run a
marathon if you're fast not the best in
the market but not the worst so let's
get to the non running features while
elegance may not be a priority for
runners it's definitely a plus and I
found the run IQ to be attractive if
you're a man on a woman's wrist it still
looks a bit bulky even in rose gold it's
surprisingly customizable for a running
watch with 3 stainless steel bezel
options in rose gold gunmetal gray and
black and interchangeable silicon straps
and let's not forget that there's a
pretty powerful Android wear watch under
all these bells and whistles with a
dual-core processor that can handle
phone calls notifications app use and
navigation it works best with an Android
device but also pairs with an iPhone the
run IQ is already available to order
from the New Balance website for about
$300 which is on par with similar
watches from Garmin and polar
