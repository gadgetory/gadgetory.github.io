coverage of CES 2019 I'm Vanessa and
Arianna and I'm Alexis Avedis
and this is breaking point are a live
drop test where we determine who has the
toughest iPhone case and Lexie we have
quite the crowd out here what a crowd
ladies and gentlemen the peak of CES
thank you for joining us today you're
rock stars we have ten contestants
willing to take their cases to extreme
Heights
please welcome gierlach by spigen case
ology pure gia griffin o WC sketch and
catalyst and last year's winners looking
to reclaim their crown Zizo eye blazing
and pelican these are a courageous group
of people here and so here's how it's
gonna work we asked each company to
bring their toughest case and a brand
new iPhone 10 are that they're gonna be
testing inside of the taste in case so
we're gonna drop them to the from 6 10
15 and finally 20 feet to see which ones
survive then if we need a tiebreaker oh
this is fun we get to take it to the
next level without cannonball right
there right there I'm really hoping that
we're gonna get this far because this is
gonna be an amazing show if we can get
to this oh yeah so now before we start
here's what you get how you get
disqualified cracks on the glass of any
kind no matter what the size now this
includes the camera lens or any issues
with the touchscreen so basically if the
phone doesn't work you're out exactly
right you can see on the screen we have
all of the disqualification court
criteria right there and we're gonna
start by dropping them at 6 feet and
screen protectors are only allowed if
they are sold with the case so are you
ready to see us drop some bones
yeah honestly one of my favorite things
at CES and it's not because I love
dropping things but this is just one of
the most exciting shows at least we're
kind of biased but at the CNET stage so
I think we can do better guys come on
Vanessa you are gonna be a drop test
Queen today the queen of breaking things
I think we tied for the crown but I
think you probably win in terms of all
the funds that you've ever broken on
breaking point I put it out on my resume
great at breaking stuff hey Vanessa it's
time for you to get on that lid where I
say goodbye Vanessa is gonna head on
this scissor lift right up there you're
a round of applause as she gets up to
the scissor lift all right six feet so
we're only starting at six eight and the
reason why we are starting at 6 feet
Vanessa maybe you'd like to fill us in
on why we are at starting at 6
I bring a lot of phones have seen it but
mainly just to kind of test them so we
did a test of the iPhone 10 are on
concrete at our CNET offices without a
case and it actually survived at least
the first drop from 5 feet so we figure
if you have a case on it and it survives
without a case at 5 feet we might as
well start at 6 feet so they're all
starting today at that height just
because it had already survived without
a case so exactly do we have first Lexie
essentially you're dropping it from my
head height okay I would like to step up
to the stage our very first stint zzzz
or slight of applause guys come on boys
now you have you with one of the winners
from last year and now you have to tell
us in 60 seconds
what makes your case so tough and what
makes it so great factor it comes with a
built-in kickstand comes with a holster
clip and a lanyard all for $17.99 it is
12 feet military great job test is so
there's a lot of bang for your buck and
it was last year's winner so we're
pretty excited to be here again and
looking forward to the job test
excellent and you did it in you know 34
seconds well done
fantastic he didn't even 'extra 30 extra
that he said that had that off have that
off well done all right sir let's drop
Vanessa here's how he's gonna go down
first off I want to make it clear I'm
not a machine there is no way to make
each drop exactly the same so this is
not really a scientific test we're just
having some fun here and testing in
real-world scenarios and a lot of these
cases are not actually rated to drop
these heights so they're just we're just
having fun with it so with that in mind
we're gonna start with C so at 6 feet
screen side down because let's be honest
that's what you care about the most and
I'm gonna try to drop it
exactly screen side down right here in 6
feet so help me count down we're gonna
do three two one drop three two one drop
alright in three two one drop

known for its upgrades and high speed
stores especially for the Mac universe
and more and more for PC and Docs

we didn't like the cases out there we
decided to do our own case and that's
the newer Tech's which is for kinetic
energy absorption it's a very slim case
it has great grips is ergonomic it goes
in your pocket it's one of those things
that you know you've got it you don't it

phone and case well hello Lexi thank you
so much for inviting us over here and
today we're actually testing our echo
case and the echo case is one of the
first fully transparent 15 foot drop
tests and cases out there on the market
and it's due to the shockwave patented
technology that we built into it which
is just interlocking materials that fuse
together and absorb that shock and we
did launch of course gunmetal most
recently so that's on our website as
well for 39.99 excellent ok 415 feet
this should be a no problem yeah no
problem at 6 feet okay all right let's
do it

last one at six feet number 10 we have
catalyst please come up to the stage and
tell us all about your frame we've gone
through this pretty fast at 6 feet I
like it I know I can expedite these
cases they're definitely
please tell us all about your case all
right well hey my name is Josh I'm the
co-founder of catalyst and I'm really
really proud to announce our impact
protection cases for the iPhone 10 10 s
and the 10 s max and this is the XR
historically we're known for making
really high-performance waterproof cases
so when we developer waterproof cases
actually we we always have to have some
kind of protection on our devices so all
throughout the years I've been testing
many many other devices with with all
kinds of impact protection cases and I
have a list that I think are the most
perfect features for an impact
protection case and for me it's got
really great buttons on the side that we
call our direct connect buttons they
connect directly to your device so it
really doesn't feel like there's a case
on it at all and our rotation will
switch for the mute toggle is just
awesome you have to you have to try that
yourself
yeah and it's it's we think it's the
right balance of a slim case with high
impact protection this is 10 feet mil
standard tested and that's for corner
drops but the cool thing about this case
is well as a company I founded the
company with business partner oh oh we
have out of time I'm sorry the buzzer
the buzzer has started yes there is a
wristband ok thank you so much I don't
mean to be the bad guy but we are under
time constraints so we're gonna start
dropping 6 feet oh yeah I mean drop it
with the line you know are we gonna be
consistent and drop them all the same
way all right all right we have our last
contestant if this one's not at 6 all of
them survived the 6 foot drop so let's

just be careful all right we got to do
it we're just a foot away so we're just
gonna do a little bit of adjustment stay
there braking boy gets it gets
interesting yeah you know what Cena is
gonna be making the headlines of CES for
breaking the ceiling I can't believe
it's going that high last year we were
at a different venue yes and the ceiling
was not undulated and curved like this
it was flat so we have to continue the
curves as well all right are we quite a
beauty 20 that's as high as we can go
Oh literally this is as high as I can go
that's right of Anu don't wanna break
you I'm trying to break the glowy 20
feet Vanessa this is a metaphor for
women in tech are you guys 20 fatefully
flip the sign ah let's flip the sign
let's make this the sweaty feet
officially ha applause everybody
this is fantastic with a straight 220
okay please hold on with me because it's
gonna take some maneuvering to get Wells
to land flat I think I think we can give
you an exception for okay let's hold up
you'll give me a pass this is the first
one we dropped little hold up we're at
20 feet confirming that we were 24 at 20
feet we are at nineteen ninety feet
because you can't get any higher than
that okay that's as high okay sir 19
fate let's call it 20 just because we're
all friends here and that's as high as
we can go alright alright let's are
gonna ask CES to have a higher roof I
know right next year we will hire a room
next year we'll order a higher roof this
is the most uncomfortable I've been at a
CES show I gotta say alright stop enough
but you can do this I have faith in you
oh my gosh I am getting I'm usually not
scared of heights but when I'm dangling
out out here if anybody would be afraid
of Heidi trifle seizo is the first one
to go up at 19/20 feet yes
so I'm gonna try to not have this land
on anybody but just need them
maybe maybe clear Dustin stand back if
this is all right safety first safety
first just because it's kind of a tight
squeeze
alright alright Zizo at two nineteen
twenty feet in three two one drop
Oh give it an applause for that landing
come on up there on the lifts okay look
at this okay the screen with the screen
protector on because it was with the
case is fine the camera opening okay the
back it's just some dust
it looks fine Vanessa you seeing this I
don't know if you even paid yeah I can
see that monitor is off now so I can't
see it so I'm gonna have to rely on you
like I yeah well there's no signal
entire our audience can't watch anymore
so we're having a few technical
difficulties over here so bear with us
but by trust Lexi Russell x90 gets past
its past it's not there's no damage 2001
a first winner her 20 feet first
alright Narus Dossett feet next up i
place in okay we have i place in at 20

why we doing an extra test this year's

oh wow slam let's see how this one goes
with the lanyard all right ahead list
looks okay looks okay Wow can you see
how you probably still can't see this
Vanessa I said yeah I can see it and I
think this one's fine I get kind of
disappointed in myself that I reached
the roof and I've not yet all right
bones we have all of them have passed
with 20 feet Vanessa come on down router
blah everybody I've the 20 feet I'm not
sure I'm gonna survive a genuinely was
not expecting let every leg go down to
pass at 20 feet but Vanessa's gonna come
on down and we have really short amount
of time to do our next crazy crazy test
we didn't just to be clear we did not
anticipate this going if we didn't I
anticipate 10 of the cases making it to
20 feet but they all have which is a
testament to how strong these cases are
as you can see let's talk a little bit
about is a crazy pipe contraption that
we're going to use right first in our in
our breaking point series yes so last
year all we could do is go to 20 feet
and we had a tight three-way time here
to keep dropping them to try and get
something to break so we could get a
winner we have 10 that have survived at
20 feet what we have to do to break the
tie is use this tube here okay that is
crazy so we have we have a very special
witness around the thumb and that's up
I'm making all the way up there I was
well done okay sorry
why don't you tell us a little bit about
what we're gonna do next with our I'm
stainless steel I saw there's literally
nowhere else to go so we did some rough
calculations here and this is roughly a
two pound ball bearing metal ball
burying that is supposed to be stronger
than dropping it or the force of it is
more than dropping it from the 20 feet
and we drop it from full feet four feet
right look where we're starting this is
more extreme so what we gonna do if
everyone's comfortable yeah everybody in
to our extra special fourth side raise
your hand if you're okay with this if
you're okay with going into the final
round the bonus round to get a winner
all right okay how many do we have in Oh
everyone is everyone in oh my goodness
well done round of away thank you so
much everybody is in okay so this time I
think we should have Lexie have some fun
on the lift so what do you think yeah
I'm gonna do this except I don't need to
get on the lift all right I don't need
to get on the lift because you didn't
mean I like your mic Alexi yes please
all right wait let's count down do you
want to get a Caesar
Oh Casey says going for that with the
four foot ball bearing to Annette's
route you to our pounds of metal falling
on the back of the case in three two one
drop
oh you guys can't see from there oh my
goodness I'll crack - I cracked the
child how's everybody okay all right
Bryan
do the honors because you're so good at
taking them out of the cases okay ah
yeah this is fun are we can look at the
back because that's Wow it's fine no
it's fine what about the front the front
let's see so it's got some it's got a
bit of dust but that's because it was
screen side down this one does have a
screen protector I think it's fine I
think it's fine it's fine
fine fine all right hey-oh next one you
guys making our jobs so
during this one high places break okay
next one is I place and I'm gonna put it
into position and put it down there so
two and a half pounds of ball bearing
right now and three two one drop oh my
gosh oh we have the case is damaged oh
the phone's damaged let me just go in
and retrieve this book can we get a shot
of the tile right now because I feel
really bad for the time in hire the
denial is due this time last year this
is what the screens looked like because
nothing is breaking that's a testament
to the cases that it's also a testament
to the phone how's it looking Lexi
looking fine the screen was fine I just
open the camera oh wait so there's a
little bit of pixel damage on the screen
no I think that's because that's the
image that we set no you think that it
does that to me there's a little bit of
pixel damage okay screen right that's
just right pin let's we'll check it out
open yeah yeah right you're right
there's a bit but you know what this is
not the I mean this is where the ball
hit so as you can see there is some
pixel damage on the screen what do you
guys think grounds for disqualification
or not I mean the phone
nothing cracked on the phone so I think
are we going to make the cool we got to
make the collar like that we got to be
brutal because honestly they're so good
so it's still perfectly fine it's just a
little mock on the screen little bit
does it but it's a 520 feet that's
amazing so we're gonna have to just for
today but you got a sweet thing story
we're gonna have cake qualify next one
it didn't make it didn't quite make it
they shoot with the screen okay next one
in place Pelican 3 cheering one drop the
tile is the tile Ishida's Mitterrand
Whaley smash look at this okay
Wow there's say okay so I did notice on
the case itself the case front is
smashed the cover on the case is totally
smashed okay we also have to know that
your own that it is being drops well and
also I think that the the worst the tile
gets the worst the Oh
I'm very devastated to report that there
is a crack on the screen however it's
more devastatingly sonography to flee I
know this is up please know that because
the case is already done let's get a
close-up of the tile that's already
damaged which is going to impact it
unfortunately we can't replace the tile
just see it going okay keep going
this is brutal I'm sorry okay who's next
who's next we have it was here yeah
Nokia look your luck right now okay this
is I feel bad because then it's on the
damage time three two one drop
I think we're gonna see some breaking
from this point I'm really bad I don't
know if anybody's gonna survive at this
point just because the tiles broken and
it's kind of hurting the screens okay oh
it's arrived it's cleared off on my it
was just tile on it and you see that it
survived it's arrived it's actually
 ear lock survived oh my goodness
okay next one I'm on to case ology with
the ball drop okay drop the ball Lexi
but don't drop the ball all right don't
drop it - drop it I got it two one drop
oh this tile is getting the tile eating
the tile is I don't I can't Ram I like I
can't bear to watch and I hold it
looking okay this is a screen protected
don't we get there is a screen protector
alright so the difficulty is the big
reduce co2 with this is how am I gonna
be able to peel it off I trust you oh
well screen protector sorry that was
just an illusion but you know what acts
around next surrounding I can't have the
screen protector so it's going without
the screen protector for our next round
so case ology survived let's continue
with purity Alekseev ball drop your gear
in three two one drop
oh that doesn't look good that does not
look good at all doesn't look good it
doesn't look good big reveal oh yeah
this is a very poetic I'm sorry it looks
like a firework just Larry but this is
so not real not yes let's be honest this
is not real like warning disclaimer
warning warning warning why not try this
at home don't try this at home and the
tile is in like total pieces underneath
it's Smith three two one drop
Oh who is this
this one was Griffin this one - it's not
looking good for a Griffin I can tell
you now mm-hmm show the camera oh it's
actually is it okay wait it's okay it
was just some dust it was different
survived Griffin moves on fine
Wow okay all right it'll be next
is this our ewc yes blue case is the
blue case all right three two one drop
I'm gonna get used to that sound how's
it looking at least we've started to
whittle this down again cleaning it off
on the pan my parents the scientific way
of course it survived Oh WC survived it
survived let's keep going alright this
is speed round sketches next sketch
three two one drop that I I think I'm
insane anymore because every time I say
look bad it's bad it's not so let's see
it no no that's bad
no that that's really that's what that's
really bad like the worst we've seen
that one sorry again this is not real
world no they know it's not real world
it survived a 20 feet way beyond what
it's rated for well done I'm sorry it is
disqualified oh okay man this is just
well I mean pain let's yeah so - one
drop
the tile is just coming a pot underneath
who loses best-case scenario who lose
his breaking point the tile the tile
broke the tile tile broke before the
phone sets
catalyst survived catalyst catalyst
survived survived Wow we have more than
we expected going to the next round so
Lexi what do you think should we just
take it not to the top what do you guys
think how much time do we have left we
don't have any time okay let's see how
taken George Lyon go just go just take
it to the top how many phones do we have
left that have made it through we have
six phones we have six phones all right
going need round you the final round all
right how high is that that ball bearing
on the top how high so we goes for eight
twelve sixteen sixteen eckstein feet all
right did feet drop of this two and a
half pound so at all involved if we
gotta have the phones on the ground so
already the only thing is that we and I
interval they might all die and then we
won't be have a winner so what do we do
they're all winners you're all winners
you know what you're right
they're all winners
okay so we are ready up so you can Airy
top of our cannon ball let you you only
want to do this I mean yes yes we want
to do this I'm gonna have to crouch down
cuz I mean so I'm definitely I'll be
fine that's good Magnus last words you
got some space okay this these are okay
we're skin this I will show you sure we
want to do this yes please stand back
did you tell her you tell her all right
do we want to do this okay then we're
not guys I'm really nervous being up

heavy bullet could kill someone it

don't know I don't know how breakers
manic that was a nice sound effect okay

catch

screen protector so go it off peel it
off let's peel it off no no no no all
right sound effect da da da no no way no
way no way okay you know what okay so
there it does have this thing does have
the same impact empath so in your hair
we have to be fair we have to be fair I
blazing also had it but we're gonna keep
it because if this is the worst or sorry
the least damaged phone then we can
still crown at the winner so I'm gonna
keep it over here I'm gonna keep it C so
one here in the meantime all right next
one okay let's keep going like the next

cutting my fingers to stall be Getti
careful this is good but let's honestly
I'm a round of applause because that is
fantastic
let's see its cases actually you know
what the screen still works yeah you
wouldn't want to touch it but it still
works gierlach a round of applause but
though it is a very good fun good effort
over here let's keep going
who's next case ology is neck now
without the screen protectors alrighty
alright row three three two one drop
oh that just sounds bad
yeah there's no way around it oh my god
this is dented oh my goodness it's
dented on the back and it comes out you
got it you guys gotta check this out
it's like wow I'm shooting up from the
top there is glass on the bar s on the
front it looks like it got shot

I gotta keep going all right so my god
next stop is this is Griffin Griffin all
right three two one drop
whoa they're just getting better and
better I mean actually guys this is
actually quite fun I know enjoy it like
yeah I feel bad doing it guilty pleasure
guilty pleasure I love our little rig
over there if you guys can see it's a
trashcan oh oh and we have another cool
and look at these these are getting
amazing because now they're molding to
the shape of the tile and they have they
look like they've all been shot with a
cannonball these are right piece of art
later two more let's keep going and the
screen right or don't see means they're
not working aw see we ready three two
one we ready yes okay three two one drop
I mean it's it's kind of at a
disadvantage at this point cuz the tile
is so messed aisle is messed up by oh I
mean the back is still good so this is a
testament to the testament to care
because they eat but I've tried they
definitely destroyed definitely
destroyed so all right we're gonna we're
just gonna pile it up and lost is cattle
lucky last catalyst
all right maybe if we can clear the
rubble a little bit it is a mess down
there Lexie it's a mess a mess down
there
seriously okay all right all right last
one catalyst three two one drop whoa
extra broken now
I yeah we're all gonna go down we're all
gonna be punished by the tech gods later
this isn't a not good either I mean it's
it's kind of artistic on the back to be
honest but it's not not it doesn't look
good so that means here are our pile of
broken phones and I mean none of them
none of them really survived just
because if we talk about criteria this
one did not however because Zizo is the
best-looking at this point thank you I
think we're gonna crown Z so the winner
Alexi I mean the the results speak for
themselves right now yeah to be fair
let's just be clear that Z so was the
first so they had the advantage of not
having to fall on the broken tile like
the rest of them but for the purposes of
this show and we do have a lovely more
to give so we're gonna name Z so the
winner of this competition again but you
know what you're all winners because you
all survived 20 feet exactly even though
they're definitely not rated for 20 feet
you all survive 20 feet so please round
of applause for these cases who were
bold enough great cuz we reached out to
a lot of place makers we reached out to
a lot of case makers and they didn't all
take us up on the challenge so round of
applause for these courageous folks over
here it's such being such a fantastic
competition and congratulations again to
everybody thank you so much for watching
