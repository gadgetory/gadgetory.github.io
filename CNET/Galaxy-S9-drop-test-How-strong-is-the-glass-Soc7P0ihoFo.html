know what that means we are going to
drop it now we ran a similar test last
year with the s8 and well this is how it
ended up and since the s9 has the same
Gorilla Glass 5 both on the front and on
the back of the phone I'm not expecting
it to do any better in fact it might
actually do worse because it is slightly
thicker and slightly heavier but that's
what we're gonna find out we're starting
this off at hip height which is about
three feet onto the sidewalk face up
here we go so it landed face up just as
I dropped it so I don't know what the
damage is like but let's take a look I'm
a little bit afraid to turn it over I'll
show you guys first oh man okay so I
want you to take a look over here on
this side which is probably where to hit
first
it's got significant damage some
spiderwebs and cracks going down to the
bottom of the phone but over here on the
top there is a slight scuff on the frame
where it probably hit next and then just
the tiny bit of a scuff over here on the
other corner but as I said before this
side was the one that sustained most of
the damage so if you just bought your
brand new Galaxy S 9 this is pretty
devastating however in our last drop
test of the s8 the screen managed to
remain intact so we're going to test it
out it's dropping its screen side down
to see if this side is any tougher than
the back now bear in mind it's already
been compromised by the first drop here
we go
that did not sound good but let's take a
look I can already see that the back the
cracks on the back actually expanded and
that's what the front looks like I'm
gonna take a look whoa
nothing on the front Wow
so take a look here it definitely landed
screen side down it didn't even sound
great at the time but it looks like it
survived the hip height drop test
without even a scratch now it's
interesting because the back however
continued to break so one of the
fractures got longer it went through the
entire middle of the phone and over here
through the side but what you really
care about is still safe so exactly what
happened with the Galaxy s8 that the
screen survived in the back did not so
even though the glass or samsung says
that the glass is the same it seems like
somehow the screen is sturdier so our
galaxy s 9 did break on the first wall
however the front never did almost
exactly what happened with last year's
s8 now does this mean that Samsung is
somehow reinforcing their screens now I
don't know I can't answer that take this
test with a grain of salt because it is
by no means scientific but I do know if
the sidewalk is very deadly and these
phones are fragile so please put a case
on your brand new Galaxy S 9 and make
sure to watch the rest of our draw tests
