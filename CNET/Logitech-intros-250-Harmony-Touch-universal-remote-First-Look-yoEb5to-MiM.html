for cnet.com and I'm going to give you a
quick video tour of the new Logitech
Harmony touch universal remote this is
the company's latest high-end model and
it sports a 2.4 inch color touch screen
and noticeably fewer buttons than other
harmony remotes the $250 clicker
features the same web-based programming
and activity based controls that have
made harmony remotes so popular but the
focus here is clearly on the touch
screen which takes up about a third of
the length of the remote the designers
have made some interesting choices as
far as the look and feel goes what is a
nice texturize back it's not like the
backs that have that glossy finish that
attract finger prints the mote sits
comfortably in your hand I really liked
how it felt that said heavily use
playback buttons like play pause
fast-forward etc have been moved from
their centralized mission to the very
top of the remote about that touch
screen
it's got QVGA resolution and looks
reasonably sharp though it doesn't have
nearly the resolution of some of today's
smartphones and tablet screens the
touchscreen can be used to select
activities and devices plus access
functions that don't have a dedicated
button on the remote what's also cool is
that you can program the screen to
respond to customized gestures such as
simply swiping up and down to control
volume clicking the favorite star on the
rope brings up your list of favorite
channels up to 50 can be programmed in
and you can add edit and reorder your
favorites right on the remote the
ability to make tweaks to the Harmony
touch is set up without using computer
is a feature exclusive to this remote
well that may seem like a minor feature
making minor changes on current harmony
remotes is a tedious process especially
with the sluggish my harmony site
dedicated harmony fans will also
appreciate that you're my harmony
account can now support multi remotes as
well as import settings from an existing
Harmony remote the Harmony touch also
features a built-in rechargeable battery
that's supposed to give you about a
week's worth of power with light to
moderate use with some previous Harmony
models you had to lay the remote down on
his cradle to charge it with this one
you prop it up vertically in its cradle
which they
nice change hi in harmony fans will also
note that the touch lacks RF capability
which means you can't control devices
that live inside a cabinet or a closet
well it should work with eye repeater
accessories it doesn't work with
existing RF accessories that Logitech
sells so far logitech hasn't said
anything about doing a step-up RF of the
touch but it may be worth waiting for
such a model if your setup warrants it
I'm David Carnot and that's a first look
at the Logitech Harmony touch remote
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
