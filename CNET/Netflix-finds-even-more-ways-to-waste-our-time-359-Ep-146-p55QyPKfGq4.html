and time for episode 146 of the 359
podcast my name is Brian and I'm hanging
out here with Ben and Alfred how's
everybody doing today it is a great
November 30th yes as as most November
30th SAR today we've got we're talking
about Netflix you're going to be able to
watch stuff offline now you binge even
when you're not connected to the
Internet we've got Facebook's arcade and
a pill that farmville oh god it's I
really like better games in farm bill
yet which is hard to do you're
considering how great farmville is
absolutely um and then on top of that a
pill that you can take that's it's a
digital pill it's a patent for one that
can make your flights easier but
probably much creepier too yeah yep so
we'll talk about all that stuff and yeah
we'll get to the show and send in your
questions and comments we'll get to them
at the end of the show and Alfred will
be hosting today so be nice the host of
the least doesn't rhyme but alright
let's do it okay and we will start the
recording of the podcast in three two
welcome to the 359 where we talk about
the top tech news of the day and all the
other crap we feel like throwing in Nam
Alfred hang I'm Ben Fox Rubin we're
leading today with Netflix this
announcement this morning that you'll be
able to finally download your shows and
stream offline but there's a catch while
the majority of Netflix is original
series are available for you to download
on your devices not every show in the
catalog is downloadable Zootopia is
though you know this is something that
subscribers have been pushing for for a
while so you know they can watch netflix
on long commutes when they don't have
any data so are you going to be using
using this on your next train ride home
Ben yeah probably i mean we definitely
on longer you know like rides out to
boston to go visit my in-laws we use the
amazon offline streaming or offline
downloads a lot so you know that's
that's how we use that and we'll
probably cycle and Netflix as well it's
just it makes sense into me it's kind of
surprising that it took this long for
them to do it yeah
it's really helpful with the service
that you actually pay for and then you
know why can't I get this one I don't
have data when I'm spending all this
money yeah on it and I've definitely
like watch shows or like you know
basically loaded up an episode and
paused it on my phone like waiting for
me to go underground and when it does
like it's already loaded oh that's a
total pain I did in a very very like
roundabout way so this kind of makes it
like way easier yeah the only
complication for me is and this is also
true for Amazon offline viewing is that
some things you are able to download
other things you aren't that's mostly
because of licensing issues so as you
mentioned Zootopia you're not going to
be able to do that I know you will be
able to watch the tour sure yes it is
worn i read that you're not able to do i
thought i would like downloading we'll
have to find out yes it does utopia is
on it all right great my line a great
movie I've watched it 30 kill time
speaking of killing time Facebook is
making it even easier to get distracted
at work as it introduces instant games
on your newsfeed and messenger app they
had many games before I messenger like
basketball and soccer where you kind of
just swipe the ball but now it's ringing
full-length title so you can play pacman
or Galaga space invaders on Facebook you
know how is anyone gonna get any work
done now I don't know it'll probably get
me to like at least try out facebook
Messenger a little bit more often I
don't typically use messenger you know
all that much like whatsapp is in my
regular stream of usage like I talked to
a lot of my friends on whatsapp a
messenger really isn't there yet is this
going to be something that gets me to
start opening it up a little bit more
often hey we'll see um I it just adds a
competitive element to it for me on
messenger because in my group chats it
will tell you like when your friends
play something in the chat and then I'll
put their high score up so that it's so
that's pretty cool then for me it's like
I want to like get the high score in
this group chat among like this group of
friends and things like that yeah the
other thing that I liked was that they
were obviously mindful of the fact that
notifications especially from farmville
were a big pain when they really went
crazy in two games the last time around
so they're not going to be doing that as
much which which i think is really smart
obviously I'm going to invite you to
play pac-man now so I can get more
cherries so these
no so British Airways also filed a
patent for a smart pill that you can
take and it monitors your body so it's
kind of creepy like flight attendants
will know if you need a blanket yeah if
you need if you're too cold like they
know your temperature now they can bring
you a blanket is they filed a patent for
it so it's not real yet but yeah but
still okay and the other idea the this
is the other use case potentially is
like they know you're asleep because of
the digital pill you swallowed so I
wouldn't take a pill just for that
though just as like you can also walk up
head and see that I'm serious about this
like I don't mean I mean there's cases
where I'm like pretending to be asleep
so I don't have to interact with you but
i donno that allow they're gonna like
feed you a meal because they know you're
not really asleep that'd be really
really strange but yeah i don't think
i'd take the pill for I don't know if
you would but if it's not for medical
purposes why on earth are you doing it I
mean I don't need to make it easier lank
it no forget it terrible idea if you
want to read more about these stories
check us out on cnet I'm Alfred Aang I'm
Ben Fox Rubin thanks for listening look
at that gorgeous graphic so everybody's
really excited about Netflix nobody
really cares about anything else yeah
yeah take this long to happen I mean I'm
not I don't want to express any hey I
love me my Netflix but Cutler how did
this take so long so apparently they had
some sort of philosophical argument
which which ended up being wrong that
eventually Wi-Fi and your data
connection would be good enough that you
wouldn't actually lose a connection
anywhere and you'd be able to watch
Netflix no matter what anywhere you are
it was a very holidays we know is
totally false it was a very optimistic
view of the future how things are gonna
develop right and on top of that this is
going back to Jones story Jones salzman
wrote the piece today along with rich
trenholm and she said that all netflix
has also been pushing into more
countries and so India for instance they
have much spotty or Wi-Fi much spot of
your connections so it also makes a lot
more sense in that market to provide
offline viewing so that you could
actually use netflix in more places i'm
kind of surprised that i didn't launch
some lame marketing thing with the title
like netflix everywhere titan like new
top rated a baby it's coming
where was like netflix on airplane mode
stuck 20 minutes in the subway mode kind
of thing so I was like you can watch it
from anywhere yeah i've never i've i've
done it with like Netflix but I've never
been able to you know actually I mean
like the way that I've done it has like
the jank way that I do it where it's
just like oh let me load this up before
I go underground and then do it yeah but
the thing is like I feel like it's
happened like way too late in the in the
sense where it's Amazon did it that day
or two ago but I've also been j√∂rg I've
like binge devery thing that I need to
binge on like that's what you're saying
is now Netflix is officially obsolete
you've out in it I like if they had
Seinfeld I would watch like I would
download those episodes and watch them
on the train by like otherwise there's
always more to watch come on in this
also to me this makes sense from from a
strategic perspective that they pushed
into a lot of their own license shows a
long time ago so and those are the shows
that you're going to be able to like
download so they don't have those
licensing issues like they do with other
studios so they have full control over
things like house of cards or they
mostly have full control over house of
cards stranger things a lot of the
documentaries that they've been pushing
into so I think that was smart that they
now have their own library that they can
decide would it do with being able to
download and watch it on your commute
definitely helps me when people are
saying oh yeah what do you mean you
didn't watch all of stranger things yet
it's only like in the first day making
fun of me what's the matter with you I'm
always making fun of you but it's just
one of those things words like look I
have like places to go I'm like you know
things to do oh sure but now I can watch
it on my way to places to go and things
to do so you know I'm probably gonna
finish all these shows now look you pay
the monthly subscription this is a way
of actually making it more valuable for
people so why not yeah and and hey
people are excited about it today as
well they should be probably should have
happened a little while ago but i don't
think that flicks lost subscribers and
if anything people are just like happier
with the service which is what netflix
one it definitely feels more like a
about time like a date absolutely here's
an interesting point that Ben brings up
in the chat on Netflix was trying to
work with cell providers previously the
true do free streaming without using
data anybody know where those talks LED
or if they
broken down I don't know they pretty
much led nowhere there was a whole like
big issue about like net neutrality with
Netflix where they thought they were
kind of like the vanguard behind all
this where it's like work because I had
all these issues with like streaming and
how much data that like Netflix takes up
t-mobile had their whole like stream on
kind of stream on and planning on yeah
bye oh shoot here comes a lawsuit but
other than that it hasn't really gone
anywhere where it's you know all these
companies that say oh there's unlimited
data but it's not exactly unlimited and
then again Netflix takes up so much data
that that did start to become a problem
yeah so luckily this solution this
skirts the issue a little bit which is
good you know you just download the
stuff that you want to watch and
hopefully they'll continue adding stuff
and that's what they said even if it's
like too much data you can always like
downloaded like at home on Wi-Fi and
then well yeah I mean that's what I
would assume people would want to do as
opposed to like really you know hanging
up their data plan so totally so here's
the question what is the first thing
you're going to need to offline binge go
probably narcos just cuz i can i I
haven't watched any of it because I
didn't have time for it but now that
like I'm on these train rides my only
issue is I don't think my train rides
are long enough for me to watch narcos
ok I might be like I might start taking
like the local train instead of the
Express train now here's a real first
world problems yeah yeah I totally I
mean most of what we used amazon for is
for kids shows so we'll download those
like i said on the podcast will download
those well you know throw them at my
year old yeah exactly so like we're
probably gonna find like different kids
chose to use so that's that's the
easiest and most obvious house of cards
no no we know what your embarrassingly
behind on watching not not not the
strategic Netflix yeah what happen you
wash it Marco Polo for I don't think
I've watched narcos either absolutely
watching I stopped watching orange is
the new black while ago nothing nothing
embarrassing that I haven't totally
missed out on like when house of cards
came out there's like it's like a thing
though like Netflix shaming oh how you
don't watch that that's a first world
problem if anything if I think stranger
things were in the habit
why haven't you watched that yet with
stranger things happening there was a
single person on the scene that staff
who did not give me hell for that
because it did not watch it for like a
couple of weeks until after it came out
it's okay it's really good I love the
80s vibe I'm sure people will now watch
it even more I member scott stein like
cornered me and he goes of all people in
this world Brian Van Gelder should be
the one watching stranger things Josie
grew in the ocean I don't destroy yeah
maybe I'll try to watch like more
jessica jaymes I remember you were
Jessica Jones thank you um that's
another show that I don't know no I'm
not gonna shame you for that but i will
say i think that's my absolute most
favorite you are we'll talk that one up
yeah and i watched the first couple
episodes i was totally there with you
and then it kind of droned on a little
bit so I it's not the most high impact
that's for sure but by the time you get
through it has one of the loudest
messages cool all right I'll try to get
back it just screams it at you so on
that note I have yet to finish Luke Cage
ok myself for because I was really
enjoying it and I just got distracted so
now you have a new opportunity yeah it's
let's all all right i'll finish jessica
jones you finish Luke Cage and that will
be our future I'll get on i'll get on
iron fist when it comes out and then we
can be the very good so what's that the
defenders yeah we can meet the defenders
sure when does this go into effect what
what the binging not the am did the
offline when we see what was going on
today is it today yeah yeah it's right
now ish all right yeah let's wrap up the
show okay we've got stuff to download
that sounds good all right you want to
do this or I'll do I'll do it alright
