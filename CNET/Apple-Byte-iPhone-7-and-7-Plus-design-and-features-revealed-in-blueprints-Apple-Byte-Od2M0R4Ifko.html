to the apple pie for all the good bad
inside the world of Apple and all you
eagle eyes yes i'm wearing my Apple
watch right now because you know I lost
my other one for now okay if you like
iphone news then you're going to love
this sweet show after purported new
blueprints of the iphone 7 and 7 plus
have been released by steve hem staffer
who runs the reputable on leaks twitter
account the drawings are sourced from
Apple casing subcontractor capture
technology and they appear to confirm
new information about the upcoming
iPhones the most obvious thing there's
no headphone jack but the biggest reveal
if these schematics are accurate is that
there will also be no iphone 7 pro it
appears the smart connector and the dual
camera lens will be exclusive to the 5.5
inch 7 plus while the iphone 7 will
supposedly retain a single lens camera
both the seven and seven plus we'll
still have slightly protruding lenses
based on these renders but there will be
no metal ring around them now these
images were reportedly taken from
apple's january testing phase so things
could change but this is some of the
best until we've seen up to this point
and if this is all true apple's doing
two different phones at two different
sizes with two different feature sets
this is not the Apple you used to know
all right a new report from KGI supports
this evidence and now claims that Apple
is indeed only producing two iphone 7
models it says the seven plus will have
a dual lens camera and three gigs of RAM
this is again after they've been saying
we'll see three phones the whole time
also 2016 hasn't really been the best
year for iPhones but could 2017 you know
turn things around it's the 10th
anniversary of the original iphone an
apple can't just release some iphone 7s
they need to go big according to apple
blogger john gruber he says he's heard
rumors from inside Apple that there will
be an all new form factor for the 10th
anniversary iPhone in his podcast the
talk show he says I've heard this
independently and it is completely
getting rid of the chin and forehead of
the phone the entire face will be the
display and the touch ID sensor will be
somehow embedded in the display the
front-facing camera will somehow be
embedded
in the display the speaker everything
all the sensors will somehow be behind
the display that sounds pretty badass
now some of these things line up since
we know Samsung will provide OLED
displays for Apple in 2017 and that will
allow for an edge to edge screen design
Apple even filed a patent application
last year that would incorporate a
fingerprint sensor into the actual
display removing a physical home button
entirely you've also heard Apple could
potentially just skip the s name as a
whole and jump to the iphone 8 or go
with an entirely new name so yeah it
makes the idea of an upcoming iphone 7
even less exciting especially if the 7
plus is only getting the good stuff
which in reality are just incremental
improvements at best you know you can
already smell the bad apples when this
phone releases all right last week Tim
Cook said the iphone 7 would have things
that we can't live without and in
response to the absurdity of this I had
to acknowledge our Apple biters comment
of the week xtremegamer said on YouTube
I can't wait to see how the iphone 7
will give us food water and oxygen then
Steven ello jumped in with no shelter
I'm waiting for the iPhone 80 aren't we
all now alright Syria on iOS has been
able to get better over time I trust it
more than I used to but it's still not
the best now the creators of Syria have
shown off their next evolution of the
tech and it's called viv the self coding
voice assistant what makes it special is
that it can handle obvious simple answer
queries but it takes it to a whole
nother level by answering a stacked
request and using third-party partners
to get all that information to you in a
single answer check the segment out from
its debut at disrupt in new york this
past week will it be warmer than 70
degrees near the Golden Gate Bridge
after 5pm the day after tomorrow
okay yeah like I said this is a whole
nother level co-founders dad kit Lawson
Adam chair said when apple acquired Siri
they had a different direction for how
they wanted to use it but viv is where
they always wanted to go Facebook and
Google have already made offers to
purchase viv but the founders aren't
selling just yet this is just some of
the amazing stuff that's happening in
tech right now when I see this it also
seems like another place where Apple is
missed out you know this ain't a bad
apple this is just the sad apple now I
also need to eat my words after I made a
snarky joke that the Tim Cook
charitybuzz auction for lunch had
dropped each year just like apples
recent earnings which got some of the
apple loyalists all upset you know of
course you did the fact is the auction
ended at over five hundred thousand
dollars to some really really rich guys
so congrats to him and yes I was wrong
tongue on this one and finally I have to
show some love to one of my favorite
game franchises from Mortal Kombat X's
mobile game one year anniversary on iOS
they're bringing new rewards a new blood
rubies currency a new challenge
characters like skins for come gin Kotal
Kahn and Liu Kang so if you're a fan of
these games we're rewarding five you
with a killer MKX mobile giveaway pack
get it killer it includes new
multiplayer characters all blood gear
200 Souls like actual real Souls from
dead people and 100,000 coins that's
coins with the K send me an email or
tweet me by using any mortal kombat
characters name and combining it with a
movie title for example the Scorpion
King I know that's too easy how about
the good reptile or my favorite Kotal
Kahn air I'll pick the ones I like and
announce the winners next show alright
that's going to do it for this way you
can email me at the Apple by to cnet com
