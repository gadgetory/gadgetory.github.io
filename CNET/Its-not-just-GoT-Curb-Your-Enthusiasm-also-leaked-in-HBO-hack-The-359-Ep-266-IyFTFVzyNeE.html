episode 266 of the 359 podcast my name
is BVG and I want to open with a joke
today after a weekend of pretty heavy
headlines all right Roger Alfred yes
what do you get when you push together
all of the tables at a continental
breakfast and Pangea breakfast you can
take that joke back to your mom
wonderful good morning guys what are we
talking about the jig so as you
mentioned we'll be talking about charge
still for a bit so the the effect its
had on tech companies so the fine line
they've gotta walk now yeah but we'll be
meeting off with more experience our
security reporter Alfred here will be
able to give us all the details and
we'll be talking about a little bit on
Android wear smartwatches yes
smartwatches are still a thing
apparently Google something don't you
why aren't you wearing hers I was that I
love to rush in for that yeah I had it
on all weekend goes to show you nobody
cares about smartwatches literally like
wearing them at least right all right as
usual if you have any questions about
these topics please in the comment
section right now get to them and we
will try to answer them in three minutes
in 59 seconds from 3 to welcome to the
359 I'm Roger Chang I'm Alfred hang it
happened again hackers released unaired
episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm as well
as insecure as the standoff with HBO
continues Alfred you've got the latest
what's uh what's going on
so these hackers have been asking for 6
million dollars from HBO and they've
been leaking slowly leaking more things
over the last few weeks it started with
a script for Game of Thrones episode 4
then it was unaired episodes of ballers
the show of Dwayne the rock Johnson and
then just this Sunday they leaked
episodes of Curb Your Enthusiasm which
are also on there they're you know when
does that show she used to go out in
October oh wow pretty soon yeah I went
to the radar because I knew they were
making a new season realize
commensals yeah and they're claiming
that they have 1.5 terabytes of data on
this HBO has not paid they offered a
$250,000 bug bounty yep
on July 27th and an email correspondence
that these hackers also leaked and the
and HBO basically is saying that like
you know we never intended on paying
that that was kind of more of like a
stalling tactic kind of thing so that's
that's where we're at now a HBO is still
refusing to pay this ransom yes okay all
right so next up Android wear is making
another big push for smartwatches and
it's doing it now the partners like
Samsung or LG but with names more
familiar with fashionistas like Michael
Kors Movado and tag is this this change
your mind about smartwatches is your
watch guy right I'm somewhat of a watch
guy of like maybe like eight watches in
a drawer at home it's like said they're
watching me but they're not like they're
not like Rolexes they're like Casio
watches I and like they're like 30 but
what are you rocking to right now this
is a Casio yes this is a Tesio compass
watch and are kashia's cool again
because I think I remember like when
Cash's turn lane when I was a kid yeah
but I don't know I guess they're cool
again but no I I don't think it changes
my mind on smartwatches I feel like if
there was a SmartWatch that looks really
cool like I'd want it but if you have a
bunch of watches Brian's pulled up a
photo of a couple of watches I mean they
look I mean I talked to these fashion
companies for a while you know they
really said they put a lot of care to
like the aesthetics of it it looks like
a Michael Kors watch yeah those two I
really like the way all of those look my
my problem is is that like if I have a
bunch of watches already I'm not going
to buy like if I buy a SmartWatch I'm
only going to buy one yeah you know like
why would I need like ten different
smartwatches kind of thing like if you
have one and then if I get that one
SmartWatch it makes all my other watches
like completely obsolete that's what's
it's going to do yeah and I don't know I
I mean if I buy one then yeah I'm
probably just going to ditch all these
other watches but the thing is you know
I do think it's a good play what they're
doing by appealing I like the fashion
side of it yeah because people aren't
going to wear these just because it's
like oh I can get my text messages on it
like yeah yeah yeah totally
oh so lastly if you've been paying
attention to the views over the weekend
you know
phil has been a hotbed of controversy
over the white supremacist rally now
tech companies are kind of getting
dragged in this mess and it kind of
shows the kind of fine line they have to
walk right like Airbnb has they banned
racist users from using their service
for this protest now and now GoDaddy has
basically revoked their domain to stop
being the domain provider for the daily
story la storia yeah which is the
regarded for weather guard is that
racist site yet it's a the internet like
it's a big forum for a lot of these
racist organizations and I do think it's
very interesting well you know
technology is made everything so much
more convenient for everybody you know
if I want to go visit a place I could go
on Airbnb I don't have to go to a hotel
but it's also kind of done the same when
we're saying everybody this includes
racists yeah so it you know now these
tech companies basically they have to
kind of fight back against this where
you know they're basically saying we
don't support these groups we draft them
using our services or anything like that
but it kind of drags into this whole
discussion of okay well there be and
being like GoDaddy or doing this you
know what other tech companies out there
are going to be able to on the flip side
this Twitter a Twitter account called
yes you're racist emerged over the
weekend basically naming and shaming
people who joined the weekend rally so
that's sort of you brothers disappointed
it puts Twitter in a weird busy
interesting to see what Twitter does
because you're it's against their Terms
and Conditions to dock people right by
you know posting their names and you
know addresses and things like that but
I mean the account is basically saying
you know we need to draw these people
into the light and show you know that
this isn't publicly acceptable to be
able to write go out and you know spew
hatred or anything like that so it will
be interesting to see what Twitter yeah
definitely no simple answers here it's
very complicated topic for those stories
and more check us out at sea net Roger
Cheng I'm out burning thanks listening
so we're going to jump right back into
the HBO controversy controversy sure
biggest controversy of quote we're
talking about listen what's already been
said is what needs to be said I don't
know if we need to harp on it too hard
yes it's an issue to be discussed and if
it comes up in the chat we'll gladly
address it but for right now we don't
need to press it any further everybody
already knows what the hell's going on
let's try to bring a little bit of
levity back to the week so we can all
have a bit of a cleanser if I may I'll
be interested in the HBO hack to see if
this curb lead does anything because
when the game of thrones leak happened
that ended up being their most watched
episode ever right they didn't did they
leak the actual so I thought it was an
outline see it was a script it was a
script right but like you know is it the
same right oh yeah people aren't going
to actively go unless you're a super fan
who has no morals I guess what I'm
wondering is you know what what will it
take to get HBO to even consider paying
for any of this you know that's a good
question I mean curbed isn't really that
I mean it's a large property for them
but a beloved show but it's not Game of
Thrones level for that yeah I don't know
that's fair enough
they'll be interesting to see what gets
them to pay up I mean even even for like
Netflix orange is the new black is like
a huge show for that at least didn't pay
either and it also didn't hurt them at
all because they just got so many people
use Netflix already and it's like why
would I download this I can also
potentially give my well I'm like think
about the loyalty factor the people that
really love these shows they don't want
to do something to hurt them yeah I mean
it's like my mantra about online content
is always like give me an excuse to pay
for it you know it don't make me go
looking for it on let's play
questionable alternatives I'll subscribe
the Netflix Hulu Amazon on and on and on
and on if I can find what I want on
there but then you start withholding it
then you're the bad guy but that's not
the situation with any of these
companies I feel go is a tremendous
service and you can go on there and find
so many great things including the
concurrence so the people that are like
oh the episode leaked like now oh wait
I'm not gonna I think what's the point
of seeing it anyways if no one else at
that water cooler is going to be able to
join you in that conversation as you
could have extra time to think about
what you say the topic and yeah don't be
a Butthead no no no I will say though
this weekend I had this dilemma I was
watching
watch the decide if I show called
nothing it's not new the expanse day
tornadoes no no not oh I hate it I the
expanse that's been around a couple
years hasn't it the second season yes
second season I was first episode of and
I never kind of it's all about it's
actually really yeah it's a fantastic
show but I know it's up there with them
Babylon 5 what am I trying to say here
Battlestar Galactica yeah yeah yeah yeah
yeah Babylon 5 it's pretty I like that
one five no it's just like it was but
yeah they're not it's not common same
blade but I noticed that I finished the
first season which is available in
Amazon I tried to go I have a sci-fi
account and everything and so I logged
in and they only aired like the last
three episodes of second season which
didn't make any sense to me because it
was sort of like that's when I was like
starting to contemplate like should I
start looking for alternative sources
with like here's a here's a provider who
I'm a paying subscriber to you know
sci-fi the cable package that allows me
to have this access but I don't have
those episodes yeah and that's what I'm
like that's when it gets kind of gray
because like I really want to watch the
episodes I'm a paying subscriber I
should people have access to some of
these shows but I know still not perfect
to be a cord cutter gas now so Roger you
have to go in a couple minutes so we
better get to some chat questions yeah
or so stemming off of this conversation
the - asks why can't studios keep their
network secure Oh Alfred a do sci-fi
gobbler has all the answers to this
alright so basically when you like look
at a studio it's not HBO or Netflix I
guess or Sony get that gets hacked it's
usually like a third party organization
that's kind of what happened with
Netflix it was a sound engineering
studio that's widely used by a lot of
Hollywood studios like that that got
breached like HBO we still don't know
how HBO got breached but the idea is
that there's so many like different
pieces to this puzzle that like all they
need is just one to fall right and you
give a good example like if you just sit
around and you watch the credits list of
a movie or TV show and it goes on and on
every single name on that list is a
potential single name thicker than that
that like they can use to like basically
break in and once they have that access
if it's person high level enough then
they're most likely able to get
you know pretty much everything right so
if you're like a Sony or an HBO you've
got all the money to spend and security
that's great but that doesn't mean the
same thing you can't protect like
everybody right all those third-party
vendors who and there are tons who work
to produce little elements of that show
or that movie just like fix up the sound
or the color I even like to do that like
holds like the light up or anything like
that it can rip grass and the best boy
or something I'm certain naming things
yeah yeah but like every that's the
problem security on this and then the
second angle is basically you know
because these are massive studios that
make a ton of money there they're like
targeted like very frequently now
because of how easy it is and how much
money that they can make off of this
somebody that I spoke to in my story
about the you know the security of
Hollywood it was basically talking about
how it's happened so frequently now that
a lot of Hollywood studios actually have
been secretly paying off these these
hackers just to make sure that like it
doesn't get public and they get their
shows back yeah for a lot of yeah is
high value for them so I love this
comment from jeffer in the Chad this is
like kind of off that ideas HBO's going
to start hiring people to stand by the
water coolers asking people have you
seen the leak I would actually like to
see that this is a really great
hidden-camera show and so yes as you say
that's a good print into a show that was
that was what it was like for security
for a lot of Hollywood studios before
like before you know they themselves
started getting hacked they would had
their whole thing about online security
their biggest threat on the internet was
you know pirated episodes yeah yeah and
that and that's what they had their
resources go after you know but now
they're like how do we protect ourselves
and those that were connected to yeah we
got more than a few people in the chat
including the - who have Casio watches
themselves hey represent Casio represent
can they get a shout-out Alfred I'm a
cast man haha does that really that's
the thing I don't know if that works
yeah unrelated note from the Android
where Josh boyo says I feel the Smart
Watch is in the same place as the
smartphone before the iPhone so it's
been like what are we waiting for one
major catalyst I really make it
worthwhile that's the thing I don't know
if it is until we can
my Apple watch is higher Andrews
communicator watched and I'm not it I
talk to this well wait so the you
actually turn into like a mecca's or
something yes I did a call from Brian
Brian Cranston Zordon I record something
a bunch of people talk like talking
about it wasn't like the Samsung watch
where they were like absolutely you can
like talk to people on it now but yeah
you look so stupid dude like where's
well so that's up how's it go I will say
there's one there's one way that I've
used that like holding a kid while
talking to my wife on the watch super
clutch the only thing about that is like
one smart watches get on like
everybody's wrist I'm very worried about
phantom notifications you know how like
sometimes you're really you're really
start shaking that like in the middle of
the night and then like you think that
your wrist is vibrating oh no it's just
phantom vibration I get that I still get
done but not on your wrist no I'm like
my hip where again yeah exactly now I'm
saying like once like smartwatches
become like ubiquitous it'll just you
know I feel like that'll be a thing that
happened do you get it cuz I know you
wear SmartWatch a lot I don't get it
okay yeah at least you will and my wrist
does buzz a lot throughout the day yeah
I can talk on what to watch okay
just to clear yeah and I have the watch
on me now no phantom buzzing yeah I
still just don't I don't like to wear
things on my wrist at all so just the
the concept that we invented a device to
keep on our person at all times to
access the information from anywhere in
the world that's so handy and
multi-purpose and then we invented a
device we don't have to look at that
device yeah it is yeah I don't know
that's just it's not my speed prava
solution looking for a problem alright
so Roger you actually have to run to a
meeting right I do and one quick shout
out to beefy techies asking what kind of
microphones were using we're using
classic electro-voice
re 20s yeah man it's let me get out
feeling it totally you guys had your
Game of Thrones I have microphones well
it's not even any microphones cable so
scheme a phone no wait no that's a
different that's a whole nother thing
