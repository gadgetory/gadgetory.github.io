welcome to the apple pie for all the
good stuff the bad stuff and everything
in between inside the world of Apple and
we gave you a breather from it last week
but there's a new flurry of iphone 5
news starting with the report from all
things d that claims Apple's iPhone
media event for the iPhone 5 is
scheduled for October fourth but it
could also change at any time will be
Tim Cook's first cookie note and who
doesn't like cookies they report the
plan is to make the new phone available
a few weeks after that and that might be
true if you listen to Al Gore now the
former vice president currently sits on
apple's board and must have been unable
to hold back at a conference in South
Africa when he said that apple will be
releasing the new iPhones next month see
that's plural which then set off a
debate whether or not he was talking
about one specific model or two separate
models like the rumored 4s and 5
released together now the man created
the internet and maybe I wouldn't put it
past him but maybe he created the iphone
5 too but we know one carrier that will
not be getting the iphone 5 and that's
t-mobile after an internal news-post
seamlessly and teemo's chief marketing
officer outright said in the document we
are not going to get the iphone 5 this
year that pretty much squashes it but it
doesn't rule out the possibility for
them to get it in the future but its
status with the ATT acquisition also
makes for an unclear future now this may
not be as juicy as an iphone 5 but
according to boy genius report iphone 4s
cases are already arriving at AT&amp;amp;T
stores from OtterBox inspect for legit
third party partners now you can see a
larger opening for the camera but that
doesn't mean it will have a larger
camera sensor what the best news about
this they're coming soon now there
hasn't been much chatter on the ipod
touch front but macrumors reports the
next revision will be very minor with
the main change being a color option for
white now i really don't care but it
will include the oleophobic coating that
lasts for about a day and a revised
ambient light sensor but it's expect to
be nearly
tentacle to the current generation all
right let's take a quick break in if you
hate fingerprints Donald bill will show
you how to make a free ipad stylus touch
screens offer an awesome and simple way
to navigate and interact their tablet or
smartphone except when they don't when
it comes to detailed control something
like drawing or writing it can be really
useful to have a pen but not just any
pen will work since it's not a matter of
pressure but an issue of electric
conduction you can buy compatible stylus
for as little as five dollars but what
if you need something right now well in
this scene at how to I'm going to show
you how to make a touchscreen pen that's
essentially free assuming that your boss
will look the other way if you raid the
supply closet so here's what you'll need
you'll need a pen a paper clip and a
sponge now make sure that the pen is one
of those that you can pull apart you
also need 3 tools pliers scissors and a
drill first step pull the pen apart and
remove the ink cartridge keep it around
though you'll need it later next slice a
little rectangular wedge off of the
sponge you're going to be squeezing a
chunk of this through the barrel of the
pen so make sure it's small enough to
get in but thick enough to stay put any
sponge should do as long as it has a
little moisture in it and you can always
test it out by using it directly on your
screen next step drill a hole into the
pen barrel the hole needs to be big
enough for the paperclip to get through
now shove the sponge through the barrel
so that pokes out of the tip then put
the pen back together and finally
flatten out that paper clip and poke one
end of it into the hole that you made
just so that is jabbing the sponge and
then wrap the rest around the barrel so
long as your hand is in contact with the
metal it'll carry an electric charge
through the sponge and to the screen now
won't work of the sponge is completely
dried out though but a few drops of
water should get you back in business so
there you go a DIY capacitive stylus you
can use with any tablet or smartphone
it's not pretty but the price is right
it's easy to customize and you can make
one just a few minutes your cnet com and
although I love arts and crafts time
it's my favorite part of the day seconds
a nap time now we always like to take a
peek into the crystal ball of the bay
gay
and a new patent filing shows how Apple
plans to have iPhones and other Apple
devices communicate with things like a
downtown parking meter garage or home
door or even a cash register it plans to
adopt other wireless standards allow iOS
devices to effortlessly sync with future
smart devices and appliances by forming
connections with a specific parking
meter or register in a store so that
might be one of the many reasons to hold
onto your iDevice or maybe you really do
just like shiny toys according to UBS
Investment Research eighty-nine percent
of iphone users a plan to stay with
Apple for their next handset well that's
a huge number and the next closest
manufacturer was HTC with a thirty-nine
percent retention rate and a big sad
face for rim which dropped from
sixty-two percent to just thirty three
percent over the last 18 months alright
guys the quick bytes we beat up on the
final release of final cut pro x an
apple has responded by releasing an
update that supports XML formatted
projects and other missing features
while multicam editing and broadcast
video output support is still coming
next year and they're also throwing in a
30-day free trial so no guys give it a
try also do you guys know that Apple
finally launched the 3g version of the
ipad 2 in china well neither did we and
neither did people in China Apple plan
for the look at those lines of invisible
people I've never seen so many the
employees outnumber the scalpers and
security guards too and you know the
devices have been out on the grey market
for a while so that was probably
deterrent and the biggest turnoff the 16
gig version sold for the equivalent of
721 West dollars ouch now the Wisconsin
library has launched a program that
allows customers to borrow iPads instead
of books the iPads are loaded with over
1,000 a book classics audio books and
apps you can either use them in the
library or take them home for a weekend
I feel sorry for the person that has to
clean them an apple is also starting a
new program of their own that lends an
iPad to retail employees for a week
according to cnet the program is only
available at the San Francisco store and
might roll out to others but let's just
see how long it takes for us to find one
of these in a bar I'll give it a week
all right let's announce the winners
from our speck products macbook air case
give away the correct answers
to the different foods the Iron Chef
macbook air slice up at the end of the
show our mushrooms lettuce shrimp and an
apple allow do you miss the mushroom
about it was like a potato or a cookie
so you guys need to pay attention but
congrats goes out to Andrew gushin
Mickey she Veronica and ricas shy hermit
Thomas corsini Letitia Collins Chris
Kirby and Ron oj gosh so congrats all
you and that's going to do for this we
show send us your emails to the Apple by
to cnet com will catch you guys next
time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
