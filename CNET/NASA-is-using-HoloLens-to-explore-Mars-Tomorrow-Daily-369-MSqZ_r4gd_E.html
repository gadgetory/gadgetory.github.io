welcome to tomorrow daily the besties
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva jeff cannata will be out
for the next three days he is on
assignment so for now let's hit those
headlines NASA JPL scientists are
walking on the surface of Mars with the
help of hololens on site is a mixed
reality software tool that was made via
a collaboration between NASA JPL and
Microsoft it allows researchers to put
on a hollow lens headset and to
investigate the red planet's surface
images received from the Curiosity rover
are run through on-site to create a 3d
scene for scientists to observe as if
they were actually millions of miles
away from Earth JPL says its goal is to
deploy this tech to Mission Operations
this summer to control Rovers on Mars
using on-site by july of this year and
use the information gathered to help
plan future Mars missions which is
pretty amazing so nice work guys if your
real life Nathan Drake but you love
yourself some hot pockets and top ramen
have I got a deal for you this is the
adventurer a small handheld microwave
that can fit inside your backpack it's
battery-powered and can heat either food
or drink just not at the same time a
company wavy says the adventure is great
for locales where lighting a fire is
illegal and can be used in a variety of
situations ranging from military to
personal nature expeditions recharging
can be done quickly and it provides
around 30 minutes of cook time it heats
food using RF tech instead of vacuum
tubes that you would find in a regular
conventional microwave and it will be
available sometime next year for the low
low price of one hundred and ninety-nine
dollars which you know if you go camping
a lot seems like it might actually not
be a bad deal since Jeff is not here I
get to choose what story we talked about
on thursday so i'm going to say Mars
because who doesn't love one hololens
mixed reality is the best and two who
doesn't love space so I think we got to
go with on-site if you guys want to get
in on the conversation hit us up on
twitter with the hashtag hey TD and tell
us where you
would like to go with a hollow lens if
you could get information from anywhere
in the universe and down link it to your
hollow lens make a 3d map and walk
around somewhere where would you want to
go tell us all about it if you guys have
any questions about it stuff like that
ask us hey TD and if you like your stuff
will use it on Thursdays show that being
said let's check out our fantastic phone
