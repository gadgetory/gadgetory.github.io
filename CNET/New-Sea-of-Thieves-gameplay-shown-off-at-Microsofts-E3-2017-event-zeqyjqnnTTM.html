sea of thieves just you the wide open
world at our bottle it's not just you
she's here too oh and this guy's here
but the point is this is a shared world
right for exploring and reading with
your fine pirate crew
look at them scurrying around making
themselves useful that's what we like to
see
the world of sea of thieves seeds with
possibilities with adventures skulking
above and below the waves all you have
to do is jump in and up Yoshi goes
few things tend to pirate like the siren
song of a lootable shipwreck careful
though there could be anything down
there literally there could be anything
we haven't finished designing it yet
joking that was a joke ah sunken
treasure it's like a pirate performance
points
every players decisions and discoveries
will be different but however you plan
on seeking your fortune it pays to be
prepared for gigantic lumps of iron
these are surprisingly portable amazing
workmanship anyway
bear get them back on board while the
coast is clear there's really no sense
in pushing your luck down here in the
spirit of that legendary pirate captain
pathetic Dee
thankfully for every tense standoff
there's a moment of celebration who are
shared wonder but for now
store your hard-earned loot and enjoy
the voyage
on Devil's read beneath the sands the
gold lies hidden from thieving hands no
well that's typical look here we are at
Devil's Ridge nice transition by the way
all pirate life is here on the sea of
things and you can let yours however you
want so rally your crew
swear your arms and say seal for riches
an EM famiy become a pirate of legend
just try not to be this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
