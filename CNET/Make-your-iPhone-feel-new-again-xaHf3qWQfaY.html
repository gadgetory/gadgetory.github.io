giving your phone a deep cleaning can
make it feel new all over again here are
some simple ways to revive a tired
device to make your phone easier to
navigate and free up some storage space
the best thing you can do is delete apps
you don't use start by unbundling apps
you buried in various folders you can
shortcut this process by going to
Settings General reset then reset home
screen layout now that all your apps are
in plain sight identify the ones you
don't really use and delete them as a
bonus you probably just reduce the
number of annoying notifications you
receive now that you removed all the
non-essential apps it's time to
reorganize them the best way to do this
is to create folders where you can
organize apps of the same type for
instance you might have a folder for
fitness smart home photography or games
I also like to have an apple folder for
all those apps that Apple doesn't let us
delete the more free storage you have
the less you'll have to worry about
running out of space for apps photos or
new podcast episodes take some time to
audit your storage by going over to
settings then general usage and manage
storage
in my case I have a good amount of
storage used for podcast episodes I've
already listened to to delete those just
swipe and hit delete
if photos are the culprit and you're
willing to remove them from your phone
connect it to a computer and back it up
before clearing the space even after
deleting a bunch of apps you might still
be receiving notifications you don't
want to make your phone feel a little
less bloated head to settings then
notifications here you can adjust your
preferences that you only get the alerts
you actually need you can turn off
notifications completely with this
option or just minimize them by taking
them out of the notification center or
you can hide them from the lockscreen if
you did all of these things and your
phone is still feeling laggy consider
resetting it to factory settings after
backing up your device go over to
settings then general then reset and
erase all content and settings for more
