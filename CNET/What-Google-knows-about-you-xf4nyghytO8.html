pretty obvious considering just how
often you use its products
it's your email your compass your video
library and your source for knowing just
about anything ever it's not a secret
that Google collects data in fact the
company lets you see exactly what data
it's been collecting you just have to
know how to get there from your gmail
account click on your picture and head
over to my account then look for
personal info and privacy let's start
with ad settings click on manage
settings and here's where Google uses
browser cookies and other usage data to
assume what your interests are what your
gender is and your age range mine was
pretty spot-on but if you want you can
help Google give you more accurate ads
by adjusting these assumptions or you
can stick it to Google and turn this off
entirely just know that it doesn't turn
off the ads that's just the beginning
back under personal info Google keeps
track of plenty more there's your search
history where all of life's curiosities
are logged in one place and you can also
look back at where you've been they've
now turned this tracking tool into a
feature they're calling timeline it
shows you where you've been when you
went and if you have Google photos what
pictures you took while you were there
oh but there is more you can also see
what YouTube videos you've watched and a
history of your voice commands and
searches so you see Google knows a lot
the data is used to give you ads but
it's also used to personalize other
Google services like Google now
you can disable any of these data
tracking tools using the switches but
know that you'll have a less
personalized Google experience and
you'll definitely still see ads</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
