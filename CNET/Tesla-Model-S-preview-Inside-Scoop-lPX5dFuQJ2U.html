Charlie Cooper from cnet news com and
i'm here with cnet car tex resident
expert Wayne Cunningham when you're
going down to Tesla Motors tomorrow
Friday big announcement what can we
expect well they're going to start
deliveries of their Model S sedan now
this is the first real car they're
actually manufacturing so tesla electric
car manufacturers started by elon musk
they were selling roadsters the small
little electric cars but those are more
of a proof of concept so this car is
actually going to be the one that
they've actually built manufactured from
the ground up and the first deliveries
are starting Friday now I've actually
been able to draw the roadster which was
hell on fire but this new version of the
Tesla technology how does that compare
with the Roadster well the drivetrain is
fairly similar I mean they use the
Roadster to develop the drive train for
the Model S but the car is completely
different the nozzle oh the Model S is a
big luxury sedan and that shows in the
price because the top ones the ones
they're actually delivering that
tomorrow are going for around 90
thousand dollars 95 thousand dollars but
the price is actually go down and
they'll have some cheaper ones that
they'll be selling by the end of the
year although I think right now all the
ones that their plan on manufacturing
are spoken for ok and the low-end model
if we can talk about low end for a Tesla
is around fifty thousand dollars yeah
$50,000 and they're doing a really
interesting thing with pricing they're
actually pricing them based on range so
the size of the battery pack actually
determines the price of the car you
should pretty much got the same features
no matter what trim level you go for but
when you get the the cheapest one it'll
have a range of maybe 150 150 miles or
so when you get up to the top level the
one that costs the most then you get a
range of well the epa range is 265 miles
although Tesla says you can probably get
about 300 okay last question can we
expect anything in the way of rebates
because even a fifty thousand dollars
that's still a bit of a of a bite in
your wallet oh yeah well the better the
federal government offers a tax credit
of seventy five hundred dollars based on
the fact that
the size of the battery and everything
and all the Tesla Model S's will qualify
for that that tax credit and just kind
of depends on your own tax situation if
that will apply and a lot of state
governments actually offer different
kinds of incentives thanks win for cnet
I'm Charlie Cooper thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
