Google issues for everything Google you
could think of the big news this week
leaked renders of the reported samsung
galaxy s 9 are out thanks to on leaks
now the design is still just as sleek as
the s8 in fact it doesn't look too much
different but on the front side it
appears the top and bottom bezels have
been slimmed down a bit but on the rear
side we're seeing the biggest change
with a single lens camera and a rear
fingerprint sensor below the camera
instead of on the side of it now renders
were also released for the rumored s9
plus model that's expected to bring a
dual lens camera on the rear and the
fingerprint sensor below it as well
while keeping the similar design now on
leaks was pretty much on the money with
their early s8 renders last year again
this isn't an official confirmation from
Samsung themselves but we could likely
see these designs for the next Galaxy s
9 and s 9 plus phones now according to
Korean news outlet the bell the s 9 is
expected to be announced earlier this
year at Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona in late February the report
also says it could be released on either
February the 25th a day before the show
officially kicks off or at their own
keynote on the 27th we're expecting a
new snapdragon 845 processor and rumors
are pointing to an improved iris scanner
but no new drastically redesigned
fingerprint scanner for now now see that
fingerprint scanner might be saved for
the note 9 after synaptics announced
their in display fingerprint sensor is
already in mass production for a top 5
om in 2018
it's lovingly called the clear ID FS 9
500 because that's easy to say but if
you're trying to figure out who it could
be their press release specifically
calls out the demand for bezel free OLED
infinity displays which is the exact
type of naming samsung uses for the s 8
and Note 8 line so could we see this
coming to Samsung in 2018 on the note 9
we'll have to wait and see alright we
told you how pretty much impossible it's
going to be to get a hold of the 1 + 5 t
last Jedi Edition phone by the way
wasn't the movie crazy when
and I can't believe they mean yeah she
ate that now the movie was loved by
critics but audiences aren't so high on
it I liked it but no movie is perfect
except for Air Bud yeah that movie was
actually perfect now you still can't get
the phone but in the box there are hints
to construct a hologram prism with a
special message that's cool now but if
you want all of the exclusive wallpapers
you can grab them from this link right
here
thanks to nine to five google forgetting
all of them for us all right in a few
software notes the Google assistant now
let you control if it gives you
directions specifically for cars public
transit or walking you can go to the
assistance Explorer section then
settings personal info go to preferences
and getting around and it's a subtle but
useful tweak also the latest version of
the G board six point eight app is
rolling out with built-in handwriting
support without the need to download a
separate handwriting app to add
handwriting in the app you'll need a
head to the languages in your settings
and add the handwriting variant to it so
pretty easy also Google's jacquard
jacket gets two new abilities this is
their smart jacket collaboration with
Levi's and you'll now have the ability
to activate the light on the jacquard
tag it's called illuminate and there's
also a new Find My Phone feature that
will ring your phone when you make the
correct gesture of course it will need
to be connected to the jacket over
Bluetooth now the Android update is out
now and the iOS version is coming soon
and we need to pour one out for project
tango Google is shutting down
tango AR after a three-year run in favor
of AR core that doesn't require any
specific hardware other than an Android
phone that you're using today now it
makes total sense an AR core was a quick
reaction to Apple making a our kit
public and come on it was the right
thing to do so we've even seen AR cores
first public product with the recent
Star Wars AR stickers for the pixel and
pixel two that look really good
so goodbye project tango you will live
on forever
alright that's gonna do it for this week
will be gone on a long hiatus after CES
in January and will return after that so
if you need a friend during that time
you can email me at Google issues at
cnet.com or tweet me at brian tom the H
much for watching we'll catch you all
next year for some more of that Google
issues</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
