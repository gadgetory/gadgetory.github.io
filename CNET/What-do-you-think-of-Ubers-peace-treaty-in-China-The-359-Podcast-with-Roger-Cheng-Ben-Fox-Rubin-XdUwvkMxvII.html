place as this like really slow burn just

really close eighty seven episodes in
all right exactly so anyway thank you
for putting up with me youtube for
giving a shout out to my wife and I was
always please send your questions Brian
will will call the best questions at the
end of our taping we'll do our best
answer them whether it's about it just
sounds my phone whether it's about uber
whether it's about Tesla SolarCity or
Pokemon we want to know where you are
what level you are what Jim you've
joined yes yeah and the comments are
great for sure but it's a little bit
more interactive when we get questions
so questions are also a little bit more
helpful at least to start off so um all
right if you guys want to comment its
schedule gets Rolen will Thea the
podcast down all right audios to speed
and we are a go in three two welcome to
the 359 what we talked about the top
tech news of the day look at the crap we
want to throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben
Fox Rubin so it's murder Monday uber
kicked off things by merging its Chinese
business to local rival dd2 Shing uber
will own a twenty percent stake in this
combined copy worth 35 billion dollars
shoo yeah my god ride-hailing is like on
fire oh yeah who cared about taxis
before so no one cared about DD until
Apple made a huge investment in it hmm
right that's it now uber has been trying
for a long time to get into the Chinese
market break into that that Haley market
has really worked so you know people
thought they were crazy for trying this
in the first place like a lot of major
American corporations have tried like
tech companies have tried to break into
China and this is I think another
example of the fact that it's just very
very hard to break into China if you're
not a chinese tech companies absolutely
like google google tried for years had
to pull out because cyber attacks yeah
right which is pretty pretty nasty well
like they basically you know i think
what was it the chinese government
essentially went after them and tried to
purge you know Tiananmen Square pictures
and that's what's that says yeah yeah
and eBay is the other example where they
actually had a head start against Ali
Baba and eventually got usurped and I I
don't even know what their footprint is
in China so not too surprising that uber
also well they're going to be partnering
now too so they have a hand in it but
yeah Oh
either way so next up on merger Monday
Tesla and solar city reached a 2.6
billion dollar deal that will see the
electric automaker and solar panel
manufacturer merge do you think this
deal makes sense i mean Elon Musk has a
big stake in both companies yeah he
calls it a no-brainer but I don't know a
lot of people are kind of scratching
their heads there and this mean we're
gonna get solar powered cars faster or
what wouldn't that be cool it would be
great but I just don't know if it's
practical right III don't know I feel
like Elon Musk is like I don't know 30
years ahead of us and true maybe maybe
he knows what he's doing and maybe he
doesn't I think this is also supposed to
be like a battery play yes I mean the
idea is this combined company will
create fully integrated residential
commercial and grid scale products
that's a no that means and also what
about the do with cars say it again
fully integrated fully integrated
residential commercial and grid scale
products that improve the way the energy
is generated stored and consumed I'm
actually more confused the second time
you said that's some serious hardcore
corporates p you know if you're as smart
as you long must I guess you understand
it no one else does that's a problem
okay if you say so all right and then
last on this wonderful monday Pokemon go
okie Monaco yeah there was a there was
an update on Friday and if you're a
Pokemon go play the update was was a bit
annoying because it actually it removed
features and cracked down on third-party
apps that helped you find pokemons in
the game why is that why would they care
if it's getting people to play the game
what's the difference I don't know I
think it's sort of a control thing right
you want they want they want me by using
just the Pokemon Go app to play the
other feature that they removed was the
the footsteps which I never liked yeah
actually it was ok with removing that
cuz I one footstep to footsteps three I
didn't know what that actually meant how
far away three was versus ones i never
went searching for a book okay that's
not true i had but i never found them
which pokemon is you go searching for it
was like early on i like tried to find a
zoo bad or something and never really
really out so things are everywhere yeah
yeah no I'm talking about like the first
day or two so no but it wasn't a very
useful function so I wasn't too against
getting rid of it yeah so regardless
it's still fan
on people still playing I don't know I'm
at level 12 were you at level 9 loser
haha alright why know more about these
stories check us out on seen it I'm
Roger cam then Fox Rubin thanks for
listening and that's a cut on the
recording and we are still here taking
QA from YouTube it's funny the the
footsteps thing kicked off a lot of
people but remember for a while there
was broken yeah so I think I just
eliminated it as a bug and maybe it'll
be back later that's clearly the game is
still in like so buggy it is still buggy
it's amazing that they've actually been
able to like maintain their phenomenon
miss considering how buggy the game is
yeah I do want to see what the shelf
life is like help you how how quickly
our people to get tired this game I
actually thought when you wrote that
story I think it was like two weeks ago
or something I'd be like this thing
could crash and burn right I was like
that's you're just writing that to like
you know troll people or whatever no man
yeah it's you were onto something it is
a warning to that company like their
other other one hit wonders of emerged
who flamed out really quickly in the
mobile app world so I don't know that
we've seen a mobile game like this in a
long time true true this kind of the
height success for sure although you
could argue that the original Angry
Birds was kind of like that cuz everyone
hmm well I didn't bring people together
it did not but if anything had ruined
some friendships probably but if
anything like when you got an iphone is
the first thing you downloaded was angry
birds I totally did that yes absolutely
so yeah I there's a friend of mine who
lives in the Bronx he's got a girlfriend
who lives in Manhattan and this is this
is the representation of true love i've
seen is the power of pokemon go she
called him late at night he would like
she was home he was home and she said
there's an arrow dactyl in my living
room would you like me to login to your
account he gave her his credential she
logged out of her pokemon go logged into
his and caught the aerodactyl for him oh
my gosh that's a keeper love yeah that's
such a sweet story it's so nice I hope
they say wait boyfriend girlfriend right
yeah yeah yeah we'll remember to say
that
like their wedding toast or something
yeah pterodactyl there it's all right
what I knew how are we on questions not
too much today pretty light day I mean
I'm not honestly I'm not all that clear
about the Howie burr and Ed are going to
function together I never I don't know
much about Chinese Commerce yeah what
exactly was DD so DD is basically the
uber of China yeah it was the right it
was a number one player they're uber had
been trying to crack that market and
it's tough right so rather than go up
against ed they decided join forces well
yes and no DD is that is they're gonna
have significant oh yeah what under
Lewbert goober will have twenty percent
stake in the company so it does receive
a share of the profits right and they I
guess they get some say but really not
nearly as much DD is this point each or
even investment in that business right
yeah yeah yeah and I think DD is
actually also going to put a billion
dollars into Hoover global so ok DD is
also going to get a little bit of
whatever ubers growth is but it still
continues to be really surprising to me
how much money is sloshing around in
ride-hailing you know like Brett I just
keep wondering if this market is going
to fall apart at some point because it's
all on these these independent drivers
that you know decide they want to show
up for work on any given day insurance
and all these valuations are all start
up valuations is it crazy valuations
like uber is valuation at this point a
62 billion dollars yes so it's I just
wonder if this is become like way too
frothy and I don't know like if all of a
sudden this much money started going
into like picking up the garbage like
would we all be talking about that too
like that's like how sexy taxis are in
my book so well right maybe maybe not
garbage delivery but still it seems kind
of cannibalistic almost I mean we're in
New York do you think that there's going
to be something to be said of a model
like this happening between you know we
have uber and lyft with ever join forces
or is that too much monopoly right there
oh I can't stoop I can see were lifted
the other day
each other they really do know they do
but like especially in New York they've
got all these yellow cabs all right if
they did join forces they would
obviously have a little bit more
strength in the market yeah i don't know
i mean who berdych I feel like uber does
just fine in New York though like I
still have yet to users even with all
the yellow cabs people use uber all the
time yeah I haven't even downloaded the
app maybe I realize I'm point oh I don't
know tech reporter yeah um I mean I look
I I I have download the app but I've
only used spam I use it a lot in SF
actually okay where its taxes are look
harder to come by yeah I just wondered
transportation options yes exactly maybe
I'll take it's a JFK at some point I
don't know we'll see how many ubers are
sloshing around in White Plains I feel
like there are probably as many uber
cars as there are pokemon in my suburban
neighborhood and that means very few
wasn't there something about one of the
uber drivers I think I saw this
somewhere who was doing a capo c'mon
tour and he would pick you up and drive
you around to go catch oh I like that
idea that would get me to use that smart
that's smart I don't know where that was
I remember glazing that over and
skimming some headline somewhere but
that's how I luxury right though yeah I
like that that is the ultimate like
first world nice i'll try to get out of
like watching my kids by doing that I'd
be like honey I gotta go on well you
can't get out of it now cuz she's gonna
hear this oh right oh god it's a safe
podcast which I congratulated her this
is probably the one congratulate her for
it sticking with me but she actually
