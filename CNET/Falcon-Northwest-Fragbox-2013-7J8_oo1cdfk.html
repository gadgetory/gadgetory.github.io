a look at a falcon northwest frag box
this is a system we've seen before in
previous iterations this is what I call
a new 2013 version of it and what's new
about it is it's one of the first
systems that we got to see with Intel's
new fourth generation Core iSeries
processors otherwise known by the
codename Haswell and along with that we
actually also got one of Nvidia's brand
new g4 780 graphics cards so we got all
the new parts in a box that's a slightly
updated version of the same kind of
small form-factor gaming frag box that
Falcon Northwest and other companies
have been selling for years the design
of this particular version was slightly
updated but it's still something you
don't even really see that often now
there everybody has laptops or
all-in-ones even for gaming but it is
fun to occasionally go back and get one
of these big custom-made gaming boxes
now one of the main advantages of having
these new Haswell chips is really long
battery life in laptops and tablets and
other portable devices you don't get
that here and frankly because this is a
traditional gaming desktop
Falkon really kind of ignores a lot of
the things that are sort of trendy in in
computers this year like touch screens
and a thunderbolt and of course that
longer battery life that you do get with
the Haswell so it's much more of a
traditional experience here our
particular build with the fourth
generation Core i7 quad core processor
the NVIDIA GeForce 780 graphics card and
get this to 960 gigs solid-state hard
drives all adds up to be very expensive
I think about $3,400 obviously those
solid-state hard drives really add a lot
to the cost there you can actually start
the frag box at about 1600 but for that
very base configuration you're really
better off you spending your money
somewhere else and just getting you know
a Core i5 and a geforce 650 you can
pretty much get that anywhere if you're
going to invest in a Frank but you
really want to go for those high-end
upgrades because you get not only really
high-end parts you also get that expert
and construction and the burnin and the
testing and the overclocking and I think
even more importantly in a gaming system
that ability to get these guys on the
phone for tech support should you need
that so it's gonna be a big investment
but if you really want you know a super
high-end gaming system and you don't
really care about portability to my
channel it's got a handle on it but it's
still not particularly portable even
though they call it a small form-factor
the Falcon Northwest franc box is
probably one of the coolest ways to get
all the way to gaming parts in one box
that at least is not the size of a
refrigerator I'm Dan Ackerman and that
is the Falcon Northwest frag box</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
