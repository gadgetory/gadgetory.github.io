soundbar at CES 2017
I was excited here was an app Masson bar
for under a thousand bucks that offered
a ton of features including a wireless
sub and almost every multi room music
system you could imagine it seemed too
good to be true
and it was the reality is this sound bar
is indeed feature packed but that's
where things come to an abrupt stop the
onkyo simply doesn't have the
performance to back up the money you pay
for it but those features though I was
impressed to see not only chromecast
built in but also DTS play-fi and Apple
airplay on cows fire Connect is also
coming unfortunately most of these
features aren't working yet but you can
stream to the speaker from your phone
using the onkyo app this separate
receiver is pretty cool though and it
enables you to connect four HDMI devices
with support for 4k video the speaker
also comes with Dolby Atmos and DTS X
support for overhead effects movie sound
okay but it's only a front surround bar
and it's not as impressive as products
from Sony or Samsung music though it
sounds dreadful
it sounds like a tabletop radio the
sound is distant and uninvolved
for this money I'd want a lot more
instead of this speaker maybe buy
yourself a 500 buck on key receiver and
surround speakers and the performance
you'll get will be lightyears ahead
