great day for Twitter the site has been
up and down all through the morning and
into the afternoon I am joined by Donna
Tam who's been covering this story for
Cena Donna give us a little bit of the
play-by-play so the site went down this
morning around nine and it looked like
it was down for about an hour twitter at
issued a statement saying that they were
working on fixing it and then it was
fixed and then it went back down again
and then issue another statement saying
okay our engineers are working on it and
that they would keep updating people
throughout the day and then what ended
up happening was after was up and down a
couple more times Twitter said that it
was a cascaded bug you know what is a
cascaded bug it sounds to me like it's a
problem that they had that they tried to
fix and it created other bugs yeah
that's my understanding is that it kind
of was a failure within their own system
that kind of carried out through the
rest of it was the Twittersphere came
back there were some people who were
saying or at least some perhaps some
entity saying that twitter had been
hacked but twitter itself doesn't seem
to to go with that correct yeah they are
saying it's a bug there was a one group
that's claiming responsibility saying
that they're continuing to hack Twitter
right now but but we have no
verification no confirmation and what's
the overall impact certainly a lot of
the Twitter users the addicts were quite
upset and and vocal about it went on to
other sites like Facebook and Google+ to
talk about it but is there an impact of
businesses who depend on on Twitter for
some of what they do you got imagine
that there is because they depend on
that a lot to send their messages out to
their consumers and stuff like that and
also a lot of them do is run a lot of
their customer service through that I
mean I imagine that they were also
freaking out because they had a lot of
people to answer to through that medium
now twitter is not the only big company
that has fails and in fact i think on
May 31st Facebook had some downtime so
is this just something normal that users
should expect that that these sites are
not going to be invulnerable to two
failures or crashes I think it's got to
be the reality I mean technology isn't
fail
so Donna thanks for talking to us thanks
for having me forcing it i'm dan farber
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
