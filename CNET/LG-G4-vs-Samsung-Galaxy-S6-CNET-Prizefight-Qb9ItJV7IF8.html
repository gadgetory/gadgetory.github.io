and it's another battle for the best
smartphone on planet Earth
get ready for a Throwdown showdown
between the LG g4 and the samsung galaxy
s6
our judges for this fight are associate
editor Laila and really big Tom now
we'll take both judges scores and
average them out to the nearest tenth
each round the final prize fight score
will be an average of all rounds using
the same system let's get it on
round 1 is designed looking at it
head-on
the LG g4 looks a lot like the LG g3 the
screen is the same size at 5.5 inches
with a 538 pixels per inch density but
the g4 s body is actually bigger and
heavier now the different backings and
the leather styling is a nice touch but
it just can't compare to the Galaxy s6
is first-ever all metal and glass body
that is truly the best Samsung design
we've ever seen it's 5.1 inch screen is
smaller but it makes up for it with a
higher 577 pixels per inch and it's a
lot more comfortable to hold the galaxy
s6 takes this round with the 4.5 and the
LG g4 gets a 4 next round is navigation
user interface samsung has made a big
jump in toning down their TouchWiz
interface from past phones and it works
with a cleaner and flatter UI experience
LG's new UX 4.0 interface is even more
minimalistic and its really the closest
thing you're going to get to a pure
Android experience that also takes
plenty of cues from lollypops material
design both phones bring multitasking
with apps and both can use gesture
controls like swiping with your palm for
a screen capture on the s6 or closing
your fist to set off the camera timer on
the g4 even if it's not the prettiest I
still love the physical power button on
the rear side of the g4 instead of
reaching around awkwardly on the side
the LG g4 strikes back with a 4.5 and
the s6 gets a 4 so after two rounds were
tied round three is features the LG g4
stays true to itself by still keeping
its expandable memory and a user
replaceable battery two key things
samsung dropped with its new design
now both phones still bring Android
staples like Google now and the best
voice-recognition on a phone plus
customization galore but it's the gas
es6 that throws everything at you the s6
brings an improved fingerprint scanner
to unlock your phone and use their
upcoming digital payment system Samsung
pay it still brings a built-in heart
rate sensor and both phones can do
wireless charging but you'll need to
have a specific back cover to use it on
the LG g4 Samsung swings hard and takes
this round with a 4.5 and LG gets a 4
round 4 is Cameras Cameras count when it
comes to phones in the s6 and the LG g4
bringing a 16 megapixel rear camera with
optical image stabilization and 4k video
capture LG's 8 megapixel front camera
beats out the S 6 is 5 megapixel 1 in
image quality and features like this
beauty glamour filter that I always use
now Samsung has shooting modes galore
but it's the g4 s impressive f-18
aperture and manual mode that can
control everything from ISO to shutter
speed and even give you the option to
shoot in RAW that has really upped the
game for smartphone cameras overall the
LG g4 took photos that were slightly
sharper but the s6 brings that extra
boost of saturation that makes their
photos pop both cameras are great Lin
prefers the s6 but I prefer the options
on the g4 and if you're picking a phone
just based on its camera alone the g4
would be that phone today LG takes this
one with the 4.75 and the s6 gets a 4.5
so after averaging 4 rounds the galaxy
s6 has the slightest of leads
the final round that decides it all is
performance both of these phones are
snapping performers that were fluent and
didn't have any major issues but the
difference maker here is battery life
based on our C net battery video drain
test the s6 clocked in at a respectable
twelve point four hours while the LG g4
clocked in at a more modest ten point
four hours the galaxy s6 outperformed
the LG g4 in the 3dmark ice storm
unlimited test for graphics performance
and also came out on top in the
Geekbench 3 benchmarks for single core
and multi-core performance it's pretty
clear that the essex takes this round
with the 4.5 and the g4 gets a 4 so
let's average out all 5 rounds and this
was a back-and-forth battle but in the
end the galaxy s6 reigns supreme
woody 4.4 to 4.3 and is your prize fight
winners now you can't go wrong with
either phone here and the Gow cs6
retains its title as king of the price
fight ring i'm brian tom

all next time for another prize</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
