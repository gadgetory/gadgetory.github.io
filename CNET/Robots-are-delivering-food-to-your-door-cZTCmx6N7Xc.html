has six wheels and is bringing a fresh
burrito to your door a food delivery
robot of course inside this starship bot
is a meal ordered through door - it's
coming soon to a sidewalk near you as
long as that sidewalks in Redwood City
California when you place an order the
robot springs to life and navigates to
the restaurant an employee puts the food
inside and closes the hatch sending it
on its way at the other end you get a
text message with a link saying your
orders being delivered and when the
robot arrives you unlock the hatch with
a button on screen each starship bot has
nine cameras and ultrasonic sensors four
obstacle detection they can travel as
fast as ten miles an hour but are
limited to four miles an hour for now
there's even a special mode that lets
the robot cross the road safely human
handlers will keep an eye on the bots
during deliveries in this pilot phase
but the idea is they'll be almost fully
autonomous in the future
I followed the body round on a delivery
run and passes by I thought it was
pretty cute but what if someone tries to
steal your meal
the robots only wave 40 pounds so if
you're really hungry or strong you could
try and swipe it from the curb you know
what we've built in our kind of a you
know variety of anti-theft Prevention's
for example we have cameras we have GPS
tracking we have two-way audio alarms so
if there's any tampering with the robot
theft attempts the robot will
immediately notify a human operator who
can take control the robots speak to the
vandal or request police assistance Doh
- says it's using robots on shorter
routes that their delivery humans called
dashes tend to avoid - our robot food
delivery overlords I salute you and I'll
have a pizza Thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
