is Steven beech and producer of the
Apple byte extra crunchy podcast with
your host mr. Brian Tong what's up
everybody welcome to the show guess what
it is it is episode 105 doing it right
here with beech and tong apple byte
extra crunchy doing it extra Munchie
this is the show all of its our
complimentary piece to our weekly video
podcast show that's like just about five
six minutes five six seven depending but
this show is all about you guys and gals
it's the latest news news stories drop
between the time we post that showing
this one also we want you all to be a
part of the show we got tons of great
calls one that makes me actually very me
and beats very happy today the number is
[Laughter]
does not let you watch it in iTunes
which is kind of annoying because most
of my stuff is in iTunes so what
happened is these uh five movie studios
we have let me see here Disney Pixar
Marvel Studios that's kind of under one
in Lukis films Disney Studios 20th
Century Fox Film Universal Pictures and
Warner Brothers all agreed that wherever
as long as you redeem or buy these
movies on a digital service you'll be
able to see it anywhere everywhere so
what does that mean if you have a Vudu
with like maybe eight or ten movies that
aren't on your iTunes you sign up for
movies anywhere you link your different
accounts and all of those movies end up
migrating on to this movies anywhere app
but even better because they all talk to
each other I don't even have to use the
movies anywhere app it's just a service
you sign up for and link your accounts I
can just jump right into iTunes or into
my Apple TV or my phone or my tablet and
all the movies from all those services
now show up in one place like boom it's
awesome like honest this is what we have
been wanting for for a long time I know
some of you don't really care about
digital downloads but if you're someone
who's on the go you want it all in one
place the two studios major studios that
are not a part of this right now our
Paramount Pictures and Lionsgate so get
off you make you know they're gonna get
on board also if you have purchased
movies from a game console meaning if
you've purchased them from Microsoft's
Microsoft Store or from the PlayStation
Store those movies are not compatible
where it crosses over with the service
yet they're looking to get new partners
but this is to me this is a big deal and
then Beach to your point you get five
free movies when you sign up two of the
services it is iTunes Amazon Google Play
and Vudu I'm pretty sure almost everyone
has two of those for that they can sign
up for sure so I had a little trouble
signing up to iTunes and like kept
giving me an error but eventually it
worked but this is now killer because
Amazon the Amazon video app doesn't have
chromecast ability right so like most of
the movies that I own are on Amazon so
now then i ported them over to the moon
anywhere now it has chromecast so that's
gonna be like my go to like if I want to
find any of my movies that's gonna be my
go to just chromecast it to the
television real quick that is that is a
big deal right there for me it's a huge
deal it and it's this is not just an
Apple thing it works on iOS it works on
Android it works on Apple TV Roku Kindle
Fire Amazon fire TV and chromecast so
weather and again you can use the movies
anywhere up if you like voodoo you can
use voodoo if you like the watch TV or
iTunes ecosystem you can use that it's
really cool and so um the other thing
that I want to bring up is the five
movies that are part of this they're
good so they're good movies except for
one and I'm gonna I'm gonna let you I
want to know which one which I want to
know which one you think is the bus okay
so here's the thing if you first sign up
with one account on the movies anywhere
service meaning if it's an iTunes Vudu
google play amazon you will get ice age
and ghostbusters the new Ghostbusters
for free if you add an additional
account whether it's an iTunes Vudu
Google or Amazon you'll get three more
movies the lego movie Jason Bourne and
big hero 6 all right so I want to know
from you Beach which you think is the
worst of those five movies definitely
Jason I've never seen a Jason Bourne
movie I don't even care to see it so
that oh my god okay a works hasp
I mean and this is not this is just cuz
the movie is not that great
it's the Ghostbusters remake yeah yeah
it's good I watched it I enjoyed it it
was it wasn't that bad for me but well
yeah I mean for me I've never seen one I
don't even know whether or not of my
like okay oh my god oh my god okay you
haven't seen like Bourne Identity Bourne
anything no I just matte balm and
beating people up I can't like go my
head around it okay okay okay it's
because you've seen movies that no no
all I'm saying right now when you and
your wifey have time you got to watch
this is the latest Bourne movie which I
actually haven't seen I've seen Lawrence
the horrible ones this this one is
pretty I'm just saying
you gotta see this see the very I would
say very my complete force wanted
shopper cuz that's the one that kind of
set everything in motion right and it's
like the most popular one I feel so I
might get people in a pair P people in
the first school I get beaches wrong t
throne there's the wrong I just wanted
to know what he thought yeah I just want
to know if he thought well I have it now
I have enough for free man stoked yeah
so anyways check it out guys and gals
movies anywhere it is Apple related but
this is something that's gonna help
everyone out we just wanted to make sure
you guys knew about it and it's really
the hottest story coming out this week
and again like I can get all my movies
directly my iTunes I didn't I couldn't
do that before I had to jump around
different apps of so annoying
so what's the see what's stopping all
these movie studios from just like
streaming their newly released movies in
the near future you know what I'm saying
like movie comes out it's a big
blockbuster maybe a week later it goes
for for sale or for rent on this app
like that's totally possible you know it
is possible Beach and I think it would
be awesome if they did that but what the
movie and movie industry has done is
they've created these different optimal
windows of when you can get access to
these movies at different times right so
first window of access is going to the
movie theaters right yeah then the next
access is typically like pay-per-view
services right or now these days it's
like digital downloads iTunes and why
not there's there's that window but
they're not gonna they're going to wait
to give you like if you're talking about
of are you saying like free streaming on
Netflix no no I'm just saying like this
app can easily become like a place where
they're gonna release like a new big
feature oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
yeah yeah that would be great it's like
they're just giving us a taste right now
like get into it be living this world
for a little bit and then BOOM oh new
Star Wars movie available on what is it
called movies anywhere yeah our boy man
afro or man of rau
Chanel's who said too bad it doesn't
work tomorrow some elf I call him the
same thing it's like you have three
names to me bro he just said like too
bad it doesn't work for TV shows it does
not work for TV shows I
the hard part about all these things is
to make these things work studios and
content creators and production
companies have to be on board to
basically they all have to get a slice
of the pie in order for this to work so
it's very difficult to get this
negotiated but this is now looks like
this is gonna be the service that
everyone goes to when you have so much
support like this really cool so anyways
check it out movies anywhere it's
totally free to do we hope you enjoy it
I mean I think its killer and I'm gonna
move on to the next story before people
say is it is this the opal biter too
crunchy or this movies anywhere
crunching alright move on we get that
crap all the time let's jump into some
iPhone stuff kind of it's such a juicy
tantalizing headline but it didn't even
faze me but yeah people are talking
about it LG
according to reports this is a story
from the investor LG is teaming up with
Apple for an LG Display for a foldable
iPhone mmm
double iPhone that's that I mean that's
a click bake title right there I didn't
even choose to use it on the latest
Apple bite episode because honestly this
story came out after I made the show but
baby it's it's it's nice and click baby
so here's the story
Apple has reportedly started working on
a foldable iPhone with LG Display and
not Samsung display who is at the moment
their sole supplier for the iPhone 10
and part of it is they believe it might
be possibly the concerns over tech leaks
to its archrival Samsung Electronics we
we obviously know there's a lot of buzz
around that true depth camera in the
iPhone 10 and we'll talk about that a
little later but what is happening
according to this story LG Display has
created a task force to develop a
foldable OLED screen for the new iPhone
model with obviously parts from LG
Innotech its sister firm that it helps
to produce these displays the other kind
of interesting there's a couple
interesting bullet points that come out
of here the report says this foldable
panel production could start as soon as
2020 so this is not for phone that's
coming out in a year or maybe even two
years it's it's really gonna be a phone
that's probably in three years we
already know Samsung has been looking
two foldable displays tech for a while
we've seen this at CES in demos I think
as far back as 2015 so this is like not
anything really new but it's like I said
it's it's fun and it will be an option
down the road I like the idea of a
foldable phone down the road I don't
really care about it right now though do
you I mean yeah sure like you know we
have these big phones in our pockets and
sometimes it get uncomfortable and they
get kind of weird so if we can like fold
them get them out of the way
make them smaller I don't know that
might be cool there's that video from
Elle I think it was LG right of the girl
who puts it on her wrist real quick
though people can't really see do is
good just the way she talks you know
okay if you want to play it I will let
play it's it's real fast like I watch
this guy's all right all right all right
I'm good I'm really good I hope people
are still listening after that yeah
display amazing this so this actual
foldable headphone is again could start
in 2020 we know that Samsung basically
has a near monopoly in mobile OLED
screens Apple has been trying to
strengthen its relationship with others
potentially develop their own but what
LG has said is that right now it started
its first OLED production plant for
phones they they've call it the e5 plant
but the first batch production for LG
OLED displays will start sometime as
early as 2019 so there's they're still
oh sorry about this they're starting
production right now but in 2019 is when
a new plant named ISA 'kx for LG will
also help to beef up their OLED
production so Samsung without a doubt is
the sole supplier we I think we talked
about in a previous show Samsung doesn't
care because they're making like twice
as much money off of iPhone sale
Yeah right remember they call to get
$100 for every iPhone or something one
hundred ten hundred ten dollars or so
for every iPhone sold that's money money
and bank I think I can't remember the
top of my head but they had a nickname
for Apple like it was abbreviate as ello
like loving opponent or something like
that something like so so weird anyways
um that is the rumor story of Apple
teaming up with LG for a foldable phone
if you want to talk about iPhone 10
supplies because we know that everyone
is kind of wondering what it what is
gonna happen with that a new estimate
according to Jeff Pugh hat an analyst
with type a type a based you want to
investment consulting has cut his
forecasts for the number of iPhone
devices that will be produced this year
down from forty million units to thirty
six million units according to you the
report see first of all it was like
estimate at 50 then it dropped to 45
then it's 40 now it's 36 and that's
gonna make it a whole lot harder I know
I keep on saying this you guys didn't
know what it feels like to miss out on
Jordans or a classic innocent SNES
you're gonna hate it you can hate it
right you you got mad about it thank you
I went to Best Buy like 6:00 in the
morning with a foldable chair and like
snacks and I and I did not get an S&amp;amp;S
yes wait wait wait wait was the first
one the NES I like how you said snacks
snacks they had like a banana and grapes
and like some food I thought I was gonna
be in line for a while oh man so here's
part of the report again we've heard
about it taking time to build this true
depth sensor multiple reports have
claimed it's taken more time to assemble
the system's aspects one of them is
called the codename the Romeo module and
the other one is codename the Juliet
module so the Romeo module is that dot
projector that shines on your face and
creates more than like 30,000 visible
dots where the Juliet module includes
the infrared camera that analyzes the
pattern as its projected on your face as
well as right seen infrared to build
that kind of depth of your face together
they are what powers this true depth
sensor a lot of technology
there and that's what's making it
difficult like the production to get
this final piece with those combined and
those other elements is what's delaying
this and you know there was another
report I didn't include it but just a
side note of like Ming Chico was talking
about oh the depth sensor Android
manufactures are trying to they they're
now saying forget this whole under the
fingerprint screen touch touch ID type
fingerprint recognition they're all
looking into face ID type setups 3d maps
3d sensors and he said that the request
for them on the Android sounder are now
threefold so clearly this is this is not
an easy thing to produce and it's gonna
take time for them to perfect it and
make it easy to do but it's gonna affect
all of us who want to get the 10 oh yeah
the guy called us asking this question
he's the first first guy that I heard
actually say 10 iPhone 10 you know
without saying it yeah well you know he
we did have a caller that we want to
address he asked we didn't throw in the
show cuz we're gonna pretty much like
you said answered here he was asking if
it's deliberate like his Apple treating
a fake storage a fake shortage but to me
the answer is absolutely no Apple wants
to create build as many of these units
as possible now they don't want people
to wait they want to get them in their
hands because also sometimes people that
are like debating what phone again if
one's not readily available they're
gonna end up going to somewhere else now
some people will hold out but is that
the question was like when will it most
likely be available to like the general
consumer to just walk into a store my
hunch for this specific model I'm gonna
put that at nine months I think it's
gonna take nine months until you can
just walk into a store casually and get
an iPhone 10 I don't think it's gonna be
six months because okay fine in between
six and nine let's say in between six
and nine that's crazy because then the
next iPhone will be out three months
later after you cut your iPhone 10 you
know that's a good point that's pretty
insane
they might even push they might even
push it out longer for the next iPhone
if it takes a lot longer for this one to
be made right much like you know if it
doesn't if there's not enough units out
and people aren't satisfied and they're
still making them there's no reason for
them to make an
all new air pods because finally let's
see it was September October November
man it's actually I feel like it's been
seven or eight months until they caught
up with earpods demand that's crazy
right and then now they're you've seen
this new wireless case down the road so
there's no reason for them to fast-track
it also look the iPhone 10 if you look
at the hardware inside of it it's a
beast so they can they could even bring
new cool what they really need to do on
in my mind bring new cool software
features aa
google right bring some new software
features that are really meaningful and
that could also prolong this kind of
delay of the iPhone 10 if they want to
stretch it out a little more because
there's a whole the power inside of it
is insane yeah they've been smart it
it's it's ridiculous so you know maybe
maybe we can see a little software love
like unlike iOS 11 son
I think he's driving me crazy driving me
crazy alright let's keep on rollin
through here we want to talk about a
quote that Tim Cook dropped that got a
lot of press he had an interview with
the independent and it was really
ranging a wide-ranging interview that
talked about a lot of augmented reality
and their plans for the future he was
actually asked in the report
specifically about taking advantage of
augmented reality using smart glasses so
this is what Tim Cook said in response
here is his quote today I can tell you
the technology itself doesn't exist to
do that in a quality way the display
technology required as well as putting
enough stuff around your face there's
huge challenges with that the field of
view the quality of the display itself
it's not there yet hmm
so this is what yeah right you're not
whom so see this is the thing this is a
difference between Tim and Steve Steve
Jobs never even talked like this he
would even like hint that they were like
testing aspects of the technology
because they're working out like
obviously yeah apples working on smart
glasses like Tim Cook is basically like
killed any mystery by specifically
saying yeah we've looked at it the
technology's not there like you know
they're actually working as Steve Jobs
would have been if someone said
are you guys working on smart glasses
he's like I can't really say whether we
are not like that's what you would do
right yeah totally Tim Cook total boner
killer like total boner killer for smart
glasses
someone has to piss him off you know
someone has to like come out with
something than like make him mad these
would be like okay we're doing smart
glasses he was like he was like this
with the Apple watch he kind of
basically said they were really working
on an Apple watch and want again the
health and fitness like way before the
Apple watch came out I was like dude you
don't have to do that that's like it's
just kind of like it keep by the time we
know everything about it which we end up
knowing everything about it we're
already like yeah we knew this like six
seven months ago
you know what I mean keep it a mystery
yeah just keep it a mystery as long as
you can there's nothing wrong with that
it's like it's kind of fun to do that
don't you think it's more fun to eff
with people instead of like oh yeah it
we're working on it but we don't we
don't think it's there yet like don't do
that
yeah because then everyone starts
speculating and then you get all these
like articles or people speculating and
then everyone's guessing and then it
just becomes like this big noisy mess
you know
yeah so we know there have been working
on prototypes other companies have been
as well so there you go with Tim Cook
just really feeling like spilling
unnecessary beans about the Apple
potential smart glasses or the
eyeglasses let's call the eyeglasses
please know they're gonna be called
Apple glasses Apple glass something like
that yeah also in relation to a our kit
we know apples really rolled this out
and push it out a report out from sensor
tower that was detailed in TechCrunch
talks about how in the AR kit space
there have been three million Plus app
downloads over half of those are games
so games account for over half of the
three million AR kit app downloads that
we've seen so far they also make up 62%
of the revenue I don't think this is a
surprise because we know that augmented
reality really got into boost with
Pokemon go right that's how everyone
like kind of wrap their head around it
yeah yeah I'm so all about the IKEA app
I think that app is dope right but yeah
it's really fun and I will use that when
I become grown and I have a house would
have to grow up right that's that's
basically that's basically it but you
have the top paid AR kit app right now
is called and this is the amazing one
tap measure it is that kind of a our
tape measure app that factors in
distance and can basically give you a
real-time measurement of walls and you
know spaces I it's pretty awesome so but
there's a lot of games I'm gonna try
this game called the machines it seems
to be the number one grossing game and
the second top paid app so I'm gonna try
that where is that game let me see we're
gonna find that I don't know I mean I'm
just saying it out loud okay yeah yeah
they're scroll down if you scroll down
on that article there's a list that says
top air kit only absent worldwide oh
here it is okay gotcha
AR dragon we got for free okay
zombie zombie gunship a revenant that's
a way to it's a weird name yeah that's
horrible
whoa they are sports basketball that
might be cool IKEA place that's not a oh
well okay it's not looking at games
really dude AR Sports basketballs just
give me like paper toss do you remember
that game paper talked back at the day
no dude it was like you were throwing up
crumpled ball of paper into trash can
like there was like win like a fan
blowing you have to like change the arc
and all that crap it was was kind of fun
honest I do wanna play drive ahead mini
golf I want to try that yeah so it
obviously isn't it I don't know I'm just
you're just running through things
you're all making up you're all making
up games right now completely destroying
like this these millions of dollars of
marketing that these companies like oh
yeah Ronnie just run through things yeah
okay cool whatever like you go on a jog
and you hold the phone in front of you
while you're running and see stuff
coming at you while you're running it's
fun all right keep it we're gonna keep
it rolling with iPad pro news we talked
about the true depth sensor our friend
Ming Chu quo at kjx securities has said
and is reporting that it is most likely
he's actually saying it's going to the
2018 iPad pro models will come equipped
with apples true depth camera and
support face ID
he believes that Apple will add true
depth to the iPad pro specifically right
there kind of high-end iOS tablet design
really their flagship tablet but he
wants a consisting to do this to create
a consistency between the iPhone 10 and
the iPad pro which I agree which my
rebuttal is where was that with 3d touch
with the iPhone and the freaking iPads
because it wasn't there I guess they're
starting to figure out they're starting
to figure that out maybe we should put
on all our devices when we release
something new like this like people get
used to it and then just can't do
without it and it's consistent but
that's a great idea I think it's a great
idea wonderful so anyways the report is
that expect 2018 iPad pro models to
feature the true depth camera we kind of
jumped ahead and talked about how
Apple's face ID is turning Android
makers away from this whole idea of the
under display fingerprint recognition
I'll just kind of talk about a few other
details that I didn't earlier again this
is Ming Chi quo he's kind of
pontificating I guess you could say but
he but according to his actual report
requests by Android smartphone vendors
into 3d sensing technologies have at
least tripled since Apple unveiled his
true depth camera and face ID technology
he also believes that in the next year
that will see shipments of actual 3d
sensor equipped Android devices phones
tablets to exceed the hole under display
fingerprint recognition by a factor of
two or three more high this is
interesting because right Samsung had
trouble mastering the under the
fingerprint display sensor Apple had
reportedly was working on it there are
actually now a couple conflicting
reports that say Apple had actually
moved past the fingerprint display
sensor and just was like we're gonna do
face ID
it wasn't even necessarily part of the
plan I like the idea about having both
quite honestly but the report says that
two reports say no they were never even
looking at it was face ID all the way
okay we we don't really know the true
story because apples not going to tell
us but it's interesting because under
the screen fingerprint recognition
has been all the buzz for a long time
Qualcomm released a product they said I
think sometime by mid year of 2018 we'll
be ready that they can start shipping
those to vendors and well we'll see
which one wins out in the end will Apple
end up with corporate both or just stick
with face ID and we know it's still
gonna be a tad bit solar but you know I
don't know which one do you prefer beats
like if you had a choice well I just I
haven't had to play with the face ID a
whole lot but it really sounds like a
touch ID like fingerprint ID is gonna be
a thing in the past like before it was
even really here you know what I mean
like especially under the screen ID it
feels like it's not gonna be around so I
prefer fingerprint just because that's
what I'm used to but yeah when I get the
face ID and my mind could change I don't
know so I agree I am it is weird having
a phone that recognizes you you know
like you're our phones are like little
robots now and now they know who I am
and they're like no my face so that is
kind of creepy you know I don't know
there's so many layers to it it's hard
to it's hard to wrap my head around it
right now
yeah all right yeah it's it's gonna it's
like any tech we'll just see how it all
plays out we're gonna jump and kind of
try and hit these things fast they're
they can't they might be a little boring
to guys and gals but it's actually
really important there's a bunch of
software updates that have been dropping
some of them are betas some of them are
actual software updates Apple released
iOS 11 point 0.38 right third mini
update for iOS 11 and they still haven't
addressed the frickin battery issues yet
anyways iOS 11 point 0.32 offer a fix
where some iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus
a--'s had an audio and haptic feedback
errors where it just didn't play a sound
or give you a haptic feedback with
whether it's apps or notifications also
the other tweak was if you replaced your
6s screen with a non genuine Apple part
basically if you went to the corner
store and just like you know replace my
screen for 30 bucks instead of a hundred
it there was an issue where it wasn't is
was
unresponsive I guess Apple has addressed
that so that's those are those are the
only fixes in 11 point 0.38 is or more
crashing or battery issues no just want
to let you know okay
the whole third party screen thing
though that's that's a pretty good Apple
for Apple to do that I agree I totally
agree that you know what beat them you
can give them a good Apple good Apple
Apple thank you I don't have a sound
effect for this I know we need to get
that we made it come on we need it we
need will work on bulwark stuff yeah all
right
iOS 11.1 we saw the first beta be
released I think about a week ago the
second beta is now out we kind of talked
about it last week but this brings emoji
right do I make his things from like a
wizard to like a mad emoji face with
like cuss words over his mouth with like
that and for like the and dollar
exclamation mark like there's like a
emoji face with like a quiet there's
like the Chinese takeout box there's dim
sum there's like a mermaid fairy there's
all these crazy things anyways digging
the mermaid in iOS 11.1 beta 2 you have
access to these the trick is that other
users will not be able to see this
unless they have iOS 11.1 beta 2 so it's
it's for your own basically viewing
pleasure and then for you to brag
you got them to think that you're cool
but then when your friends don't have
beta 2 it's really completely worthless
the other thing though that it brings
back in the beta 2 for iOS 11 point one
is the 3d touch app switcher that's
where you press on 3d touch on the edge
of your screen and then it reveals all
your applications that are open you
could swipe through them and close
certain ones if you felt like it that
has now been brought back to iOS 11
after the keynote um a little while ago
Craig federighi said they removed it for
a technical reason and it would come
back in a future iOS 11 update at least
in the beta 2 it is out right now
I
Apple has not said when iOS 11 will be
made publicly available like as the
final version of iOS 11.1 but obviously
it's coming pretty soon but new emojis
and the 3d touch app switcher function
will come and we're also waiting for
them to incorporate like the Apple pay
to pay pyramid system and messages so
there's a lot of things that are gonna
be coming in iOS 11.1 we slept the wait
for it I think but I know that you you
won't experience any of them because you
are not rocking 10 stay stay dude stay
with 10 god please all right watch OS
4.1 beta - this is another small tweak
but it added a couple really cool things
I'm not gonna lie I love my Apple watch
LTE because it really does fit into that
niche of my life where I go work out and
I just bring my watch around and I've
gone out a couple times with just my
watch and it's I don't know it kind of
feels nice it's a little liberating
honestly keeps you away from looking at
your phone all the time that's good so
Iowa watch OS 4.1 beta it adds a couple
things one of them is that they added a
new radio app and it before it was only
streaming over Wi-Fi this new radio app
specific to the Apple watch will now be
able to stream over LTE so again taking
advantage of the LTE feature not only
can you listen to like beats 1 radio
ESPN Radio will be part of this radio
app so you can listen to ESPN Radio
on-the-go like through your watch that's
freaking awesome the other aspect is
that is now also a toggle for Wi-Fi a
lot of people that have the Apple watch
like why can't I turn off specifically
Wi-Fi off Iran specifically or if an LTE
user if you want to force it to use the
phone data signal um and not deal with
any of those issues that is on there as
well and then it also tells you which
Wi-Fi network your Apple watch is
connected to so you kind of know I think
this these are all really good things
I'm all about it I'm shocked that those
things weren't there before I've never
had an Apple watch I'm hearing what
you're saying I'm like what you couldn't
like figure out what Wi-Fi network Iran
and Oprah yeah bro I'm throwing a good
Apple man and you're just boo Apple on
me man
good Apple right now good Apple for
making those changes it's about time
even a real with beech keeping it real
with beech all right another cool thing
we talked about the watch Apple pay I've
used it a bunch it's kind of nice and
just like not have your wallet on you
and it's like okay anyways apple pays
cardless withdrawal is now available at
Wells Fargo's Wells Fargo's Wells Fargo
ATMs
so there's right now Wells Fargo has
about 13,000 ATMs around the u.s. 5000
of them have been updated to work with
Apple pay Samsung pay and Android pay to
withdraw cash if you need it you don't
need oh you don't need a freaking card
you just need your phone or your Apple
watch or your Android pay Samsung watch
all that stuff that's all you need it's
really cool so it's cool 5,000 ATMs
right now the remaining 8000 they said
will be I think flipped on by I think
they said 2019 so that's very cool and
then one other software thing iTunes
twelve point six point three if you have
not heard of this and you're wondering
what the heck is this I'll tell you why
this is important when Apple updated a
twelve point seven a lot of you
remembered it gave you a thing that said
oh we're trying to streamline down to
more media we don't you will no longer
have access to the App Store you have to
do it through your phone and you will no
longer have access to ringtone
management through the app well there's
a lot of businesses that were like dude
we need to manually load our apps so
apple secretly created not secretly but
kind of undercover released twelve point
six point three which still keeps the
App Store which still keeps your
ringtones and in addition to that you do
it does not force you constantly to
update to twelve point seven which
remove that so should have made a link
so that you could show it on here but I
can tell you by memory I created a link
that we put in in our video show it's
just tinyurl.com iTunes twelve six three
if you type that in your Elcom and what
was it flash ash I well six three if you
type that in it will take you two
to the support page from Apple that
allows you to download iTunes 1216 and
give you back this functionality sweet
I'm honestly I think that's a sweet deal
Apple hasn't said how long they're gonna
support this but it still supports iOS
11 it supports iPhone 10 iPhone 8 and 8
plus so that's so it supports all the
new tech that is coming
it supports current phones and new
phones there's links to download the new
version or the under cover version of
iTunes right there that's another good
Apple we're having a few good apples
today Thank You Apple well Pete thank
you we want one want me to give you a
good Apple for like our fans that listen

on a home pot if you tell me what that
is then I'll just
randomly suck the winners I get the
right answer nice good Apple I'm looking
up thanks man
all right let's do phone calls thank you
guys all for calling we had a lot of
great calls this week hang on my
computer just open something I didn't
want it to open okay here we go
we held a picture naughty picture and SF
pictures no just kidding
the first question was from gentleman in
New Zealand and he has a question about
music Apple in music hello Steven hello
Brian I'm so sorry for leaving another
message I just realized how this works
finally so my name is home I'm from New
Zealand and my question is around the
importance or emphasis that Apple lays
on music today I mean as you know the
platform basically grew out of music I
mean not out of it but you know it was
majorly music and how people consume
music and I just feel that somehow Apple
is today neglecting that side
unfortunately and still one of those all
these who uses CDs to import music onto
his iTunes and I have a huge problem
with iTunes in the cloud
sometimes it matches the songs and
transfers or upload songs to other iOS
devices that aren't the same songs and
these issues have been discussed in
Apple communities and they're still not
rectified and so I'm just wondering do
you feel the tackle is slowly neglecting
music or is going in the back backflip
music the absolutely actually the store
icon has changed from a music note to a
star so that actually is that like a
signifying thing so thank you so much I
really appreciate your time Cheers great
I think there's a lot of aspects of that
that are really interesting right yeah
definitely I mean they like the iPod
came out and that like changed music
iTunes came out that changed music but
then I think the iPhone came out and
that changed everything and then they're
like wait we need to shift all our focus
from iPods and music and iTunes to this
iPhone thing that we just invented you
know what I mean and then that kind of
everything else kind of took a backseat
that's that's my two cents whoa what do
you think Brian yeah you know to say
that they're neglecting music isn't
necessarily true because they're putting
in a lot of effort behind their Apple
music subscription service
sure it's not nearly as popular as
something like Spotify but I think they
finally hit somewhere around 30 million
paid subscribers where Spotify is that
something like 60 million if I don't
quote me on that but I know they're
about half is what Spotify has at the
moment roughly around their music is
part of them but there's such a there's
there's so much more than a music
company these days I don't think they
necessarily have to show love to music I
don't think they're you know ignoring it
but the market has changed where people
are on multifunctional devices that are
really more like mini computers and kind
of a single a single use single feature
type device like a music player we've
obviously seen how they killed the Nano
and other older iPods themselves there
it's just there's just not really a
market when every other device that we
have plays music so I don't I don't
think it's them losing anything like
direction or DNA or not showing as much
focus it's just that so many other
things and again we've complained about
how Apple has our hands in so many
things now a lot of different things
suffer because that that is the nature
of just blowing up and becoming this big
music has suffered a little from that
but I don't think they're ignoring it
yeah and you know it's interesting when
we saw the Google pixel thing like they
had a little big focus on music like
that always on Shazam and being able to
like find a picture of an artist and
then find all their albums and all their
social networks you know Apple needs to
do stuff like that like there's little
things Apple can do to improve Apple
music like it's just even hard to find
you know what I mean like if you go into
the the music app and iTunes it's just
kind of like buried in a weird place
everything looks the same I don't know
there's little things that they could do
to fix it you know I mean if you even
look at Apple music right now they're
trying to make it more than a music
place they're trying to create shows and
programming for you to go watch that are
unrelated to music but on Apple music
right so they're trying to more than
anything they have now realized
many years later that content is king
Netflix showed them that in my voice
just cracked Netflix showed them that
other services show them that they're
trying to be that the thing that stuck
out with me and I think I tweeted it
recently I finally took time because I
had time to watch the Defiant ones on
HBO have you seen this series each one
of the best things I've seen in long
right v-- needs to Jimmy Iovine you say
holler at us cuz we can help him with
this Apple music thing so check this out
like that that should have been on Apple
music yes yes Jimmy
dr. Dre bought for two billion dollars
to be a part of Apple music that that is
the type of content you want to see to
drive people there and I guess what it
wasn't there like when I was watching
this I'm like holy crap is so amazing
and the first thing I said to myself is
why isn't this on Apple music I was
wondering the same thing
did they go to HBO because there's
swearing and possible like violence and
stuff like was Apple afraid of that you
know like wait a minute that yeah I mean
that was that was like the perfect show
I got music and here's what I think I
think that they know because it's not in
the place they want it to be it's the
whole chicken what what came first
chicken Drake Apple music isn't in the
place where people weren't gonna watch
that on Apple music right like they know
like more people gonna watch this on HBO
than Apple music but guess what you need
to have something like that to drive
people to Apple music so it's very
indicative of the fact that they didn't
have the belief that something that
amazing could drive people towards Apple
music that is the type of stuff they
need and maybe they learn from that
maybe they'll profile other artists or
producers in that way to tell their
story in a raw nature like that feels
you know very personal and unedited as
as organic as possibly can without
feeling like you know could sugar-coated
TV sterile like we don't want that right
that was I've only seen the first two
episodes and I haven't even gotten to
the source Awards
oh my god that's my bad mood that's
that's the third one I gotta get to that
one I haven't even got to that one yet
and people are like yo just wait just
wait the source Awards one is awesome
man you're gonna love it dude but you
know like there was some good news from
Apple this week that we didn't really
cover in the show but they got Steven
Spielberg to be a a producer director
for Apple for their Apple TV some you
know some original programming that's a
big one that's it and then they also are
rebooting incredible what does it call
like incredible stories or something
like that
yeah I forget I forget exactly what it's
called but when I heard that I was like
that's a good move by Apple get Steven
Spielberg in there to produce a show
that's a big move but don't put an Apple
music you know I'm saying put it just on
there Apple TV somewhere right but make
don't put this crap on Apple music it's
so dumb yeah it doesn't make any sense
at all and it confuses people they're
like what's Apple music oh there's TV
shows I don't get it you bro they're
like watch they're watched what is it is
it cold what is their app called watch
TV or watch I can't remember their watch
yeah it is to watch I think it's for
like my Apple watch I thought at first
when I first thought like Apple watch
app on my phone like I don't have an
Apple watch well you have a movies app
you have a TV shows app and you have a
watch app and then you have Apple music
what are you doing and then my Apple
music app has you know Apple music and
then just my ID my regular music you
know that I own but I think that should
be separated too you know what I'm
saying I don't know just just cut if you
really want to do this whole on-demand
like true unique content Apple like make
it its own thing don't don't slam it in
Apple music it doesn't it didn't it
didn't work with carpet carpet actually
carpool karaoke make sense what planet
of the apps yeah that you're not gonna
drive people that way that show should
Defiant ones should have been on frickin
Apple music man they dropped the ball
big time on that doing seriously
alright alright we got a few more calls
let's check them out you'll be an hour
plus podcast because we just talked
about the tenant so good
hey how's it going as a Cecil from
Houston Texas I see that you are you
know talking about the fingerprint being
brought back to the screen along with
facial recognition why would a Polly
facial recognition on the on the tin and
then the next year bring back you know
the fingerprint why would Apple be back
stepping like that you know the future
should hold something more than even
facial recognition so I just just have a
question while with Apple backpedal like
that when they're trying to move forward
to the future with facial recognition
yeah we talked about that a little
earlier too yeah I think I think you
make a great point and it just comes
down to if they can speed up face ID to
make it nearly as quick or that we don't
feel any delay then and that's really
sounds like the direction they're going
then we'll we won't see a fingerprint
sensor under the glass I think I just
we're so used to the idea of a
fingerprint sensor on the glass and
again it's a learned behavior we saw
that 3d touch was a behavior that
because it wasn't consistent across all
their products not everyone uses it a
lot of people don't even know it's there
quite honestly and so this is something
you're gonna be using daily you're just
gonna have to get used to the idea of
the whole face ID and I think as it or
if it becomes second nature and then
people kind of forget that the touch ID
thing ever existed that's the goal that
they're trying to move towards so I
think you're absolutely right there's
and why would they move backwards and
some of those reports saying that Apple
never plan to do it under the glass
fingerprint sensor would reinforce that
thinking so this is the my favorite call
this week here we go
hey beaten tongue it's mark from
Portland I'm so sorry to hear you're
still having battery problems with iOS
11 but I wanted to suggest the Apple
smart battery case for standard 4.7 inch
phones I'm currently using it for my
success I've had it since March and this
case is really dope it's the only case
that uses iOS software so that
understands it's still running on
battery power so that makes it more
battery efficient than other cases it
doesn't do things like backup in the
background or or do things that the
phone would normally only do on power
and I'm still on 1033 but I always end
the day with at least 80% charge on my
phone usually a hundred percent unless
I'm using maps all day I will say people
did to even say hey yo you gotta check
out maps in Iowa's eleven it's pretty
dope man like don't don't sleep on maps
anymore I'm like alright check that I
thought was cool is nice it's not like
I'm gonna I still don't trust it like I
trust Google Maps but I thought it was
nice I will give it its credit okay cool
so I it was the wrong call there's
another call that's better wait wait
what was he was he was talking about the
Apple battery case which you have been
famously okay okay okay that is let me
just tell you right now leave it on that
picture right there yeah put on the
black one okay where have you seen that
design somewhere else
in a recent Apple product when you look
at that Apple smart battery case
sideways what does that look like wait
is there sideways shine there is yeah I
don't know it's like the freakin notch
on the iPhone 10 find both by Johnny
I've turn some of your like what is the
tongue talking about right now go look
it up iPhone smart battery case turn it
turn that sumbitch sideways as the rock
would say oh my god believe that I'm
like my voice is I get all crazy okay
got an Apple watch question here hey
guys this is sunny from Louisiana I was
watching the show
I know this Beach made the comment about
not wanting to update his plan for the
watch theory three and my question
actually has to do with the original
watch I update it to afford to watch OS
four and I noticed that it got a little
glitchy especially when it came to bring
it up notifications for like Twitter and
snapchat snapchat it wouldn't bring up
the logos have you all noticed that and
is 4.1 fixing that issue on the original
watch thanks guys appreciate it it's
gonna agree so I have a response where I
think might be the issue for example
some apps have changed how they work
with the Apple watch and the iPhone and
Twitter has basically completely removed
their their app no longer really talks
to the Apple watch anymore so that might
be the issue that you're experiencing
Twitter used to like you know you'll
you'll get notifications from your
phone's your watch but oh shoot sorry I
pulled my headphones but uh the actual
Twitter to Apple watch app that is
dependent on a connection between the
phone and the watch no longer functions
so I'm wondering if that's the I wonder
if that's what you're dealing with if
not then I really don't know why it's
doing that but that might be part of it
yeah okay we got another this is my
favorite call actually I was mistaken
before but this is the one right here a
beach in town this is Chris from
California I just want to know if there
are any cases for the new iPhones that
possibly wirelessly charge the phone and
can also themselves be wirelessly
charged or hook into the Lightning por
you know to charge as a battery pack but
can actually be charged wirelessly
themselves thanks love the show guys
i'll when we first said i call we're
like wait this homeboy wants the future
he wants like the wireless charging case
of the wireless charging phone
like use wireless wireless charging when
I first heard that I was like wait like
the phone is kind of the wireless
charging case for the battery itself so
I don't just sound of you just he just
wants more wireless charging man but at
the moment you know there are at the
moment we have not seen any products
that wirelessly charge the wirelessly
charging iPhone not yet I could be wrong
but at the moment we haven't seen any it
would be kind of cool though you have a
case that wirelessly charges phone but
then he just wirelessly card charge the
case okay next time we got one more we
got two more calls real quick ones um hi
this Patrice calling from Los Angeles I
was just wondering do you think that
Apple is actually going to make the ear
pods useful because ear buds that Google
is coming out with all ridiculous in a
good way in those are ones that I would
actually spend 300 um not 300 but 150
dollars on right now it's just the Apple
ones just really look like the brush
heads for my sonic hairbrush we we agree
with that assertion
we have always agreed with that
assertion here at the Apple bite
someone's asking if we're taking
questions on Twitter yeah send me a
question and hopefully uh I can see it
before the show ends just do it at Brian
Tong I have we got a show loves to the
ladies that ask us questions because we
like to represent like the audience here
you know what I'm talking about
all right so uh the air pods look I
think they're still very good because
they're convenient they just need to add
more functionality it doesn't look like
we'll see anything like that anytime
soon they're gonna release a new
wireless battery case version I think
that's gonna then push out any new major
changes in the air pods unless it's done
through software another six to nine
more months before we see another one so
I do think the Google the Google
headphones the Google um forgot what
they call them did they just call the
pixel earbuds that's what they called
I think they look more normal they don't
look as awkward and the translation
feature on them is ridiculous so from a
standpoint of travel or business and
it's only gonna get better remember this
is the first generation we've seen
anything like this to use your phone
soon it's gonna be built-in directly
into the headphones which is kind of
crazy to me when you think about that
down the road like you won't even need a
phone to drive this stuff it'll all be
on a little chip that's in some earbuds
that's way down the road but uh yeah I
think if you want more functionality I
think also the two other things that are
important see how they feel in your ears
and see if you like the sound quality
because you probably won't be using the
translation all the time but if that's
your priority then get the pixel earbuds
but I think they're I do think the Apple
air pods are good they're just not great
yes they're really really really good
I've said this over and over and over
there's not great the the air you know
like the regular Apple earbuds they feel
great in your ear for me that's my
opinion but like I have some other
wireless headphones that feel terrible
in my ears they're so uncomfortable so
that is very important to make sure that
they are comfortable before you buy them
you know cuz you don't want to like have
sore ears that sucks
that is awesome all right oh we have one
more called you want to hear the last
one to do this that is is uh it's kind
of like just that nicey-nice email oh
yeah yeah for sure okay here we go
hey this is shovel compare the sales
Pennsylvania
just want to say I love that about
country with Beats and Tom he has give

dude we trust it we went over an hour
bro
oh my gosh are we allowed to do that I
think we
broken the internet people want us to do
that I think that's a more important
question yeah yeah I think that's that's
more important all right I did
unfortunately let me see here real quick
I told the young lady said I could ask a
question over twitter twitter if we
could answer it and i did not get that
question I'm so sorry but hey there you
go one last quick thing sorry beach
quick bullet point that someone has
confirmed at least according to rag zu
1083 is that movies from the movie
anywhere service that show up in your
iTunes library will up convert to 4k if
there is a 4k option if that is true
that's freaking badass
that is awesome Wow so like that's what
I wanted to test Wonder Woman
does it give me the 4k option because I
don't have a 4k TV and I don't have an
apple 4k yet because I don't know Apple
TV 4k cuz I don't have a 4k TV yet but
when I get there which I'm hoping to by
the end of the year then then but
someone like that let us know that
that's a pretty dope man if that's true
