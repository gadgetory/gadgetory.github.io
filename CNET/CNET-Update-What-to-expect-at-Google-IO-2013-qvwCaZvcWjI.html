google I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet up this week we will be
hearing about lots of new projects from
google as the annual google i/o
developers conference kicks off
wednesday in san francisco this is the
conference for Google talks about new
products and software it'll be hard to
top last year's glass stunt show where
glass was worn by skydivers and bikers
to make a grand entrance to the
conference google also unveiled Android
jelly bean last year and the Nexus 7
tablet but there was also a flop
remember the Nexus Q media streaming
sphere it was a dud for being expensive
and it could only stream Google content
so Google brought it back to the drawing
board but what's the store for this year
expect to hear about Google's new portal
for gaming on Android and Google Plus it
would be somewhat similar to Apple's
game center it would keep track of
leaderboards sync between devices and
also allow for online multiplayer gaming
Google now will likely get an update the
service debuted last year and it's like
an advanced personal assistant in your
phone it gives alerts based on your
calendar location and interest Google
now is a major part of glass so you know
Google is going to keep growing this
product it just recently became
available on the iPhone as part of the
Google Search app over the past few
weeks we've heard Google's working on
merging all voice and messaging related
products into one product it's possible
it'll be called hangouts so watch for
that Google Maps could get indoor
tracking there's a scheduled session on
the topic and Google Wallet is expected
to get an upgrade with some incentives
to get more people to use it it's
unclear if we'll see Android 5.0 the
version known as key lime pie details
suggests will just get small updates to
jelly bean with Android version 4.3 as
far as hardware goes it wouldn't
surprise us to see the popular Nexus 7
tablet get an upgrade and we're hearing
rumors that Google could update the
Nexus 4 smartphone with more storage and
faster 4G speeds many folks are also
hoping Google will reveal the rumored
Motorola X phone and what about google
glass the developer version of glass is
a
ready out in the wild but maybe we'll
get a peek at the design and updates for
the consumer version of glass which may
come out next year or we could see
products related to glass it's been said
Google's working on a SmartWatch that
has the same functionality as glass and
the blog android authority says Google
might be ready to show it off although
it also might be a little too early for
that be sure to join CNET's live blog
when google takes the stage wednesday at
830am Pacific 1130 Eastern and you can
find more details at cnet com / update
