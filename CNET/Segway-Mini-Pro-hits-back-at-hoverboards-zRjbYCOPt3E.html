have been banned from places like
airports airplanes and even here at CES
2016 this is the original Segway but
they are back with a product called the
Mini Pro there is this module that you
hold between your knees like so and you
move your legs left and right in order
to turn unlike all the other so-called
hoverboards and self balancing boards on
the market that don't come with
instructions the Segway mini pro
actually comes with instructions through
the app and a tutorial that won't let
you ride fast until you pass the test
and as always safety first helmet and
safety gear is advised and the feel is
actually a lot more soft and more secure
than these so called public woods I've
written a lot of them so I can tell you
for real that this is real talk this is
a much smoother much easier to ride
there's pneumatic tires which provide a
lot more cushioning and a lot more
comfort and also about the mini prairie
this is all able to be controlled
through your smartphone apps sorry if
you want to autonomously brings a Segway
towards you or steer it around you can
do so within the app it's not going to
go as fast as it does when you're riding
it top speed is 11 miles an hour you can
also limit the top speed through the app
itself so for example if you have a
child riding you can make sure that the
top speed is much less than the 11 miles
an hour
also within the app you can change the
lighting color and also see metrics of
your ride while you're riding such as
direction and also the speed you're
going at plus there is this nifty handle
that lifts up so you can walk it
wherever you need to go if you can't
ride it the range of the mini pro is 60
miles and it weighs 28
it's going to be available from February
for 1299 dollars or 999 dollars three
