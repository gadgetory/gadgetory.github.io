phone it's hard to believe but five
years ago no one knew what to make of
Steve Jobs his announcement calling it
iPhone and Apple put this out there big
device of the time what's the ipod and
that was viewed as this complete
category killer so the idea that Apple
could come in and do that with a phone
was pretty much unheard of and the
expectations were super high software
that's at least five years ahead of
what's on any other phone and even
though I phones were about 200 to 300
dollars more expensive than other
smartphones at the time more than six
million units were sold iPhones first
birthday the following year Apple
released the 3g version this one boasted
faster speeds and connection to the App
Store causing crowds to line up and wait
for its release I'm online for the third
one three more versions have since
debuted in the last three years the 3gs
in 2009 the four and twenty ten in the
4s in 2011 the iphone has become apple's
identity it makes it more than half its
profits every quarter now to date apolis
sold more than 250 million iphones
worldwide obviously people love those
basically a computer in my pocket I
wouldn't like life without a name
analysts say the next-generation iphone
expected sometime this fall will have to
up the ante to compete with other
smartphones on the market a bigger
screen better camera smaller doc just
some of the features that are churning
through the iphone rumor mill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
