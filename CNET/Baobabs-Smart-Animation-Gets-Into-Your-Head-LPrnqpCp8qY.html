rainbow crow is created experience
almost like walking into a storybook so
walk over there to that little lit area
on the ground and you'll see the little
dandy lines
shoot up that's me in a cluttered
conference room in Silicon Valley
watching a virtual reality movie but
inside my headset I feel like I'm in an
animated fairy tale
in this experience
rainbow crow from bail Bob Studios I do
more than just watch take this snow
scene are you ready I'm ready okay here
you go
now shake them yeah there you go with my
arms creating snow I feel like I'm
really there I'm almost disappointed
when I reach out my hands and I don't
feel a snowflake melt on my palm what's
going on here we spent a lot of time
working on the tech to make the edges of
everything in rainbow crow feel really
soft so that you would want to touch
them like you want to hug the characters
you want to roll around in the grass and
feel even more part of the story you
know the thing about VR is that you can
describe it all day but you don't really
know what it's like until you put a
headset on it's so much of it as how
that reptile brain buys into the reality
of bail Bob is the foremost animation
studio in VR and it's trailblazing VR
specific practice is sucking into its
stories bail Bob's characters are smart
they subtly mirror your body language
for example it's a trick kebaya Bob
borrowed from social science as a
shortcut to gaining your empathy even if
the connection you make is with a
cartoon bunny in their first feature
invasion the characters look directly at
you and you can't help but respond
wherever you are that character will
look at you and find you and if you're
moving that character will track you
with their eyes when the little bunny
hops up and looks at the viewer in the
eye people were doing stuff they never
do in a movie theater you know they're
like talking to the bunny and they're
waving and they're reaching out trying
to touch it they're they're mimicking
their body language
in fact research is mounting that VR
actually impacts the human brain
differently than passive experiences
like watching TV or movies after bait
Bob nudges you to move and interact you
won't simply remember something you saw
you've generated a memory of something
did when we are actively involved in the
navigation process we have better memory
for the experience that we had we have
better memory for the environment that
we encountered whereas if we're just
watching a video people have a harder
time remembering what they experienced
Hollywood is taking notice invasion just
six minutes long and a top VR download
is now on track to be the basis for a
fully animated movie invasion was the
first time that characters and stories
were taken from VR and translated into a
Hollywood film for the creative minds at
bay about the rules of good storytelling
are still essential we will find that
new way of storytelling we will find
those things that are so special and
unique to they are that we haven't even
discovered yet in other words baobab is
inventing the art of smart VR
storytelling and that means it will be
hacking its cute little bunnies more
deeply into your brain
