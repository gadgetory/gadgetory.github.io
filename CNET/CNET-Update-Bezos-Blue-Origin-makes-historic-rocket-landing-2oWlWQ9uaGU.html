the age of the reusable space rocket I'm
Bridget Carey this is your CNET update
for the first time a rocket designed for
human passengers has launched into space
and landed back on earth gently in one
piece the historic landing was completed
by private spaceflight company Blue
Origin it's funded and led by Amazon
founder Jeff Bezos this is a game
changer in making spaceflight more
affordable because Rockets only get used
once and then they're discarded the
rocket named new Shepard launched from
West Texas on Monday at 11:21 a.m.
Central time it traveled at three point
seventy two times the speed of sound
with the crew capsule separating at the
edge of the atmosphere Blue Origin
created this animation to show the
eventual goal of having tourists float
weightless for a few minutes to see the
planet below but of course there were no
humans aboard this test flight the
capsule then dropped back down to earth
with parachutes breaking the fall that
whole trip for the capsule it was just
11 minutes from takeoff to landing now
as for the rocket as it descended it
reignited at about 5,000 feet to slow
down and began to stabilize about 50
feet from the ground landing at just
under five miles an hour now this isn't
the first attempt Blue Origin did have a
test flight in April that failed to land
Bezos said in an interview with CBS that
the test will continue for the next
couple of years and he does not know how
much they're going to charge for a ride
on the rocket but maybe they'll have a
price a year from now
Elon Musk and his company SpaceX are
also working to build the reusable
rocket but so far it has not been able
to land successfully on a platform at
sea although it's important to note that
SpaceX is trying something much more
difficult with its Falcon 9 booster it
flies cargo shipments into space and
back which requires much more energy and
thrust Blue Origin suborbital flight is
not as complicated
now while Bezos celebrates the rocket
landing questions are swirling over
Amazon's password security Amazon has
forced reset the passwords to an unknown
number of
counts it indicates that passwords may
have been compromised
this was discovered by our sister site
ZDNet some readers reported getting
emails from Amazon about their account
passwords being reset and this is not a
fake phishing message the notice was
also found when they went on amazon.com
Amazon is warning that passwords could
have been exposed to an outside group
but it has no reason to believe that
anyone actually has stolen the passwords
so Amazon is doing this out of caution
Amazon has not answered any questions or
made a public comment about it as of
this report that's it for this tech news
update and there's more at cnet.com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
