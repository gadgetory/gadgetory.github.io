shapes sizes and colors but they all
share one thing in common they're small
and some are really small hi I'm David
Carr for cnet.com and here are a few
things to consider before buying one of
these speakers start by thinking about
how portable you want the speaker to be
versus how good you want it to sound
people email me saying hey David I'm
looking for the smallest loudest playing
speaker that has a lot of bass the only
problem is such a speaker doesn't exist
small speakers just can't output a ton
of bass and most distorted higher
volumes so if you go really small expect
to sacrifice sound quality though a lot
of these little speakers play louder
than you'd expect the idea is to get one
that can play pretty loud but doesn't
distort or at least doesn't distort
badly and has fairly natural sound if
you plan on using the speaker outdoors a
lot it's a good idea to get one that's
water resistant or even waterproof they
tend to meet more durable it's also nice
if the speaker has an integrated
accessory like a clip carabiner or a
loop that lets you hang the speaker or
attach it to your backpack or belt when
you're not using it if you don't mind a
more generic looking design Amazon's got
plenty of budget options from no-name
companies some are perfectly good for
the price but others sound comparatively
mediocre and also may not hold up well
over time battery life is important in a
tiny speaker you want to get at least
six and ideally eight hours of playback
time anything that's rated at fifteen
hours or better is very good standard
range for Bluetooth is 33 feet or 10
meters but some speakers offer extended
range of up to 30 meters or 100 feet
which can come in handy particularly
outdoors many of the latest wireless
speakers are equipped with Bluetooth
versions 4.1 or 4.2 bluetooth 3.0
speakers work fine but each successive
version of bluetooth brings small
upgrades bluetooth 5.0 which is supposed
to offer improved range in bandwidth is
not far often we should see speakers
that use it in early 2017 certain
speakers allow you to wirelessly link
two speakers together to make a stereo
pair or daisy chain several speakers
together to cover a larger area with
sound and I personally like a speaker
that has a firmware upgrade option which
allows the manufacturer to add features
and sometimes improve the sound some
Bluetooth speakers have a speakerphone
function which simply means a micro
phone is built into the speaker so you
can take calls through the speaker it's
a nice bonus feature but not necessarily
a must-have I personally wouldn't pay
more than about $40 for a really tiny
Bluetooth speaker and I think there's
plenty of good stuff in the 50 to $100
range particularly those products get
discounted after being on the market for
a while premium models cost around two
hundred dollars which is a lot to pay
for a little speaker but if the design
sound and performance are clearly a
step-up it can be worth the investment
and that's the mini bluetooth speaker
