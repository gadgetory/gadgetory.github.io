sea beasts a tablet find out in our
coverage for mobile world congress in
barcelona get a look at the long-rumored
playstation phone and a whole lot more
Plus get charged up for toyota's plug-in
Prius and a big TV from Vizio with just
a few small problems like its picture
it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom line
let's get started with the good the 2011
Mobile World Congress kicked off this
week in Barcelona and as usual our team
of mobile editors received a cushy trip
to Spain on the company's dime and I did
not anyway in between plates of paella
and flamenco dancing lessons our team
did manage to get a little work done
take a look at this selection of new
phones headed your way and I seriously
hope you didn't just buy a new verizon
iphone hi I'm Kendra min senior editor
at cnet com I'm here Mobile World
Congress 2011 in Barcelona want to show
you to sony ericsson xperia play now we
know miss devices coming for a long time
to bend a lot of rumors about it there
been a lot of leaks and of course there
was that superbowl commercial with the
android with the grafted on thumbs I
know that freaked a lot of people out
but you understand what the why the
thumbs are needed for this device but
first we'll look at it from a phone
point of view good cos does look like a
normal smartphone it is running
Gingerbread see of a bunch of you have
the multiple home screens of course here
on the side we have a 3.5 millimeter
headset jack over here we have a micro
USB port there's a volume rocker right
here and then you see these two shoulder
buttons I bet you know what those are
for once you slide up the phone there
you have those PlayStation controls now
it's going to look a lot like a normal
PlayStation controller so you have the
directional arrows right here and in the
middle you have to touch pads now
instead of joysticks you couldn't really
fit a joystick on a phone like this so
these touch pads they will have an
online store for downloading games so
they have lots of titles they will add
titles as they go along I was really
impressed by the graphic sony ericsson
does a good job with those displays dos
feel pretty comfortable especially when
a cradle my thumb's around the back the
phone does slide up and down easy also
it's pretty thin i think for its for
what it offers for packing in that game
controller does have a five megapixel
camera has a lot of normal Android
features so here it is finally the sony
ericsson xperia play
hey everyone I'm Banita senior editor at
cnet com and we're here at Mobile World
Congress 2011 in Barcelona Spain with
the first look of the samsung galaxy s2
this is the next generation galaxy
smartphone and some of the design
features that are new has a four point
two seven inch super amoled plus screen
that gorgeous as usual and it's really
super thin as you can see here it is
running Android 2.3 along with TouchWiz
four-point-oh so if Samsung's user
interface is on here some of the new
features of that are these four hubs
appear that includes the gaming hub
music readers hub and the social hub
with these three new hubs here you
should be able to get new gaming content
as well as music and books they have
redone some of the widgets so it has a
Flickr interface here some of the new
specs it is running and videos integrity
chipset so it is a dual core processor
phone it's also got an eight megapixel
camera here on back along with a flash
as well as a 2 megapixel camera on front
for video calls so that's very nice as
far as availability they're just making
a global announcement today no word yet
on us availability or pricing but I
suspect that it probably will make its
way to the US carriers sometime this
year I'm Bonnie Tom this has been your
first look at the samsung galaxy s2
hi I'm Kendra and senior editor at cnet
com i'm here at Mobile World Congress
2011 in barcelona spain and i want to
show you LG's new optimus 3d here it is
finally it is built on the previous
optimus 2x at optimus black that we saw
at CES but it does have a very nice
design as thin thin is very solid has a
good feeling in the hand is a 4.3 inch
display so it's really bright and
colorful there are multiple screens of
course so you can cycle through and get
widgets the music player you can add
which it's short folders shortcuts
everything that you'd expect now the
phone right now this particular phone is
on for EO but when the phone really
comes out at will run on gingerbread so
that's important to note so gingerbreads
really making some traction here which
is nice down below you have four touch
control set aside the micro USB port and
the HDMI port and on the back you'll see
it has two cameras now why two cameras
that's for shooting 3d video this phone
will actually show 3d video you don't
need glasses for that kind of see the
icons fly toward you so for 3d effect
you know it's probably not like watching
a full 3d movie of course but it is a
bit of a different effect and actually
something you can see I was little
skeptical about 3d on the phone about
how's that going to work but this
actually does it in some ways in the
interior menus you do have a simple
icon-based design if you go to the
messaging
you can't see that there's a virtual
keyboard so you don't have a physical
keyboard with this phone so here we're
going to see some 3d video like I said
it might not work it might not show up
well on this camera but you can't see
that you're getting a little bit of an
effect so I think it works pretty well
actually all in all it does look pretty
cool like I said a three-cheese video I
was pretty skeptical about but it seems
like it works well i'm kent german for
mobile world congress and this is the LG
optimus 3d that's a pretty big pile of
buyers regret no of course there's a lot
more going on at the Mobile World
Congress then phones as scores of new
tablets flood the market place Bonnie
cha had her hands full with these new
models hey everyone I'm Bonnie toss
senior editor at cnet com and we're here
in Barcelona Spain for mobile or
Congress and we've got a special first
book here of the samsung galaxy tab this
is their second tablet and it's going to
exist along with the 7-inch galaxy tab
but as you can see this one has a 10.1
inch display here really gorgeous it's
one of the thinnest and lightest 10-inch
tablets available it's 11 millimeters
thin and weighs about 21 ounces so very
nice here on the back they've also added
a texture here so it's not as slick as
the first galaxy tab which is nice also
got these little indentations so it fits
nicely with the hand feature wise it's
running Android Honeycomb and it's a
google experience device so that means
no custom UI no touch was on here which
i'm sure some of you will be very happy
to hear got a 2 megapixel camera on the
front for video calls as well as an 8
megapixel camera on back and it does
1080p HD video recording it also has a
dual core processor it's using Nvidia's
Tegra 2 chipset so you should see faster
performance as well as browsing on
and other benefits it is an hspa+ device
they're only announcing the global
announcement here at Mobile World
Congress we do know Vodafone will be one
of the carriers to offer it no word yet
on us availability or carrier support
but hopefully that'll be something that
will be added into the future because it
looks like a very cool device i'm bonnie
chen this has been your first look at
the samsung galaxy tab hey everyone I'm
Banita senior editor at cnet com here in
mobile world congress in barcelona spain
and we've got your first look at the
tmobile d slate which is actually
announced at CES 2011 but we didn't get
a chance to look at but now we do and it
is a gorgeous piece of hardware it's got
a 9 inch screen the resolution is 1280
by 768 really gorgeous and very
responsive here as you can see it's
pretty thin what's special about this
device is it has a 3d camcorder so you
can shoot 3d videos and then watch them
on the Jeep late but it will require 3d
glasses this is a honeycomb tablet so
it's running Android OS 3.0 it will be a
4g device and t-mobile will preload this
tablet with some other extras to kind of
differentiate it from the other tablets
out there another feature that that
display has is a camera on front so you
can make video calls and it also has
movable here so as you can see you can
actually turn the pages like an actual
look this is just one of the many
tablets coming out this year but one of
one
I'm actually very impressed by
especially with the hardware in the 3d
camcorder no availability date yet but
it will be with t-mobile and again it'll
be a 4g device only have one model 32
gigabytes just to make it simple for
everyone but hopefully we'll get that
you for viewing it soon and get a full
review up for you I'm Banita and this
has been your first look at the tmobile
geez lis hey everyone I'm Bonnie cha
senior editor at cnet com and we're here
at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona
Spain where HTC Justin veiled their
first tablet the HTC Flyer we've got
Nathan here from HTC who's going to give
us a quick rundown of the features so
this is flyer on the front of here you
can see we've got a front-facing 1.3
megapixel camera I flip it around we've
also see we've got 5 megapixel camera on
the back and I aluminium unibody design
3.5 mil Jack for your headphones and
then just at the bottom here we've got
our connector for hdmi and charging all
in one so keep the body nice and slim
here i'm going to show you updated sense
user experience it's just very quickly i
can shave but tip the screen even though
widgets animating 3d they really come
out of the screen and it really comes to
life using our notes application so when
I'm creating a new note you can see that
I can actually associate the note to a
particular calendar appointment and then
anything that I record or take down will
be associated with that kind of invite
so i can record and then i can write on
the screen and you can see down here
that i have this little peanut and its
in green that means i can interface with
that and here i can change the color i
can change the style of the pen and i
can change the size
I can draw on the screen here using a
fountain pen style it's up on the screen
and I can type some text you can also
capture an image then this is where the
buttons on the pen coming to place are
using our squad technology i can press
and hold this top button here and i can
start to raise what I've written the
bottom one here at press and hold and I
can actually select text within the note
itself once I'm happy to stop recording
and then this will automatically upload
to the web so I can refer to it a later
date they can even go into my calendar
find that it will be attached to the
calendar event itself so when can we
expect the HTC Flyer to hit the streets
the fly is going to be hitting the
markets in q2 this year will that
include the US I can tell you right now
alright well it looks like a very cool
tablet we're excited to look at it again
that's the HTC Flyer Thank You Nathan
and I'm Banita and this has been your
first look at the HTC Flyer thanks
Nathan I mean Bonnie I suppose with all
the work she's been doing this week it
is fair to let someone else take over
for a while now while the attendees in
Barcelona got to see some actual new
products this week here at home some
people were preoccupied by speculation
about new ipad models and this week's
apple byte brian Tong takes a look at
what we could be seeing not only the
ipad 2 but in the ipad 3 plus a little
something for his lucky Valentine's
what's up I'm Brian song and welcome to
the apple pie for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple I guess you
could call this our Valentine's Day
edition because love is in the air or
not now let's get to the show we've
talked about the ipad 2 being spotted in
the wild last week and the Wall Street
Journal is reporting a lot of what we
covered they say the new iPad is in
production with a thinner and lighter
design at least one camera that's front
facing the resolution will be the same
1024 x 768 with more memory and a more
powerful graphics processor but guess
what that might not be the only ipad
release this year seek a birdie in a
rumor that's picking up more and more
steam the daring fireball blog says that
HP's recently announced touch pad set to
come out this summer which looks great
might I add might bump up against the
release of wait for it the ipad 3 then
TechCrunch said their sources claim
there will be a fall surprise and it's
related to the ipad 3 now I've checked
with my own specific Apple component
suppliers who said based on their
knowledge hitting that time frame would
be very very tight and they don't see it
happening but ipad 3 talk before the
ipad 2 has even been released yeah it's
getting that bad now this might bring a
smile to Apple TV owners and GAD reports
at the latest iOS 4.3 beta hints at the
apple TV supporting online gaming
there's references to a TV games and a
TV Thunder that show a connection of
controller and some sort of game
standings we all have been waiting for
apps on the platform and this could
indicate something is happening in the
near future all right let's take a break
with our iPhone app of the week
this week's appt is the Google Translate
app for the iphone it's free and it
accepts voice inputs for 15 languages
why don't you play with my pet dragon
and then translate your word or phrase
into one of more than 50 languages you
can also listen to your translations
spoken out loud in one of 23 languages
but I'm more concerned if it translates
the universal language of love hey Jamie
check this out anata Garcia rare oop
what is she no bara teen wow those
Japanese I'm Chinese and I speak English
no no it's all good baby you know I just
thought you want a little asian pursue
you sit oh yeah steer work thing it's
all good see you guys works like a charm
now we've got a bonus app of the week
for you and it's called the sex personal
trainer appt it measures your length
strength and intensity I did a demo of
my own so let's just roll the tape Oh
wanna roll the tape what do you mean not
you're supposed to roll the tape do your
job dude I do no no no roll roll the
tape roll the tape ring a seconds long
yeah no we don't we don't want to show
that okay and finally you guys show us a
lot of love so we've got to give it
right back big props to our apple byte
buddies Edward Caleb Stephen and Derek
from the association of computing
machinery at UC Riverside and Kelsey if
you're still watching Caleb still loves
you in that melts my heart like sweet
marshmallows alright that's going to do
it for this week's show send us your
emails to the apple byte at cnet com i'm
brian Tong thanks for watching we'll see
you guys next week for another bite of
the Apple
all he's not just a tech expert he's a
matchmaker too so cute while we wait to
hear how things work out between Kelsey
and Caleb let's take a quick break but
we'll be right back with more tech
review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good there's kind
of nothing good about taxis than I guess
unless it's you being totally organized
and managing your finances on the go
like a tax ninja enter mints calm for
mobile
welcome to tap that app I'm jasmine
France and this is a show where we cover
the hottest apps in the mobile space I
know financial software isn't exactly
the most titillating subject but with
the tax season fast approaching this
week's show is the perfect opportunity
to get you all thinking about money so
we're going to take a closer look at my
favorite app for handling all sorts of
financial needs it's called mint and
it's available for both the iphone and
android devices like many of my favorite
apps mint also offers an online
component which you can access at mint
com that means you could take advantage
of this service from any mobile device
with web capability and multi-platform
compatibility is always a big plus in my
book especially when it comes to
financial software let's talk about what
the mint app can do for you of course
the basic premise is that it lets you
access your financial info on the go and
I mean all of it so that means if you
have a checking account of make of
America savings at ING and auto loan at
your local credit union and a 401 K with
smith barney you can get an at-a-glance
overview of each and every one just by
firing up mint and logging in further
mint presents your overall cash flow in
one nicely laid out screen by compiling
your income debt and investments on the
back end so you can easily view your
financial health that will also break
down exactly what types of expenses
you're incurring and then let you
monitor and set budgets for each type oh
and for those of you who prefer apps
with some visual flair you'll be happy
to note that everything in mint is
color-coded which aside from being nice
to look at also makes it easy to quickly
grasp items like your budget and the
type of transaction on the screen in
front of you finally it's worth
mentioning that mint recently teamed up
with TurboTax to simplify deduction
recording and maximize your refund and
while attempting to file taxes entirely
from a mobile device is far too tedious
to consider we certainly appreciate
meant for helping us get our finances
organized ahead of time that's it for
this week's show if you have any
suggestions then to tap that app at cnet
com I'm jasmine France and we'll see you
next week
right I'm just saying how bad can
budgeting be if it's color-coded okay
it's about that time let's see what we
have going on this week in the bad
besides the lack of material available
in 3d these days one of the big reasons
people are shying away from 3d TVs is
those clunky heavy expensive glasses and
yes Vizio tackles that problem with this
new 65 inch LED TV but how do they
explain some of the other problems with
this set hi there I'm David Katz meijer
from cnet I'm sitting next two videos
65-inch xvt 3d 650 sv this monster is
the first 3d TV to ship the United
States to feature passive 3d TV
technology we'll get to that in a little
bit but first I want to note that this
is the only model of its kind right now
Vizio only makes this as a 65 inch size
a little bit later in the year there's
going to be a lot of other smaller
videos that use passive 3d but for now
this guy is it so as I mentioned it has
passive 3d it actually comes with four
pairs of these passive 3d glasses it's
between passive and active 3d is that
the glasses are a lot cheaper and they
don't have any sort of electronics
inside them so these passive glasses
look a lot just like standard sunglasses
and of course they fit over a standard
pair of glasses so the same kind you can
find in most theaters that use 3d TV
technology in the US the active glasses
on the other hand are a lot more
expensive and you got to buy of course a
pair for each family member so it can
add up the design of the Vizio is
relatively generic it's got this glossy
black around the edge you look at it
from the side you can tell us an
led-based LCD TV it's only about 2.2
inches thin which makes it pretty light
a good thing on a TV this big vizio apps
platform on this TV offers Netflix
Amazon video on demand and voodoo the
latter actually has 3d TV streaming so
you can actually rent some 3d videos of
course the selection right now is pretty
slim there's also a good selection of
audio streaming apps including Rhapsody
radio time and Pandora so all told the
streaming app selection with stevie is
very good there's also a few non
screaming apps including Facebook and a
new app from fan
that allows you to go on and I choose
movie screening times in your area so we
kind of like that little addition one of
the nice things about vizio zaps
platforms it's well integrated it even
includes a TV settings app that has all
the options for adjusting this set not
as many options is found on a many other
high-end TVs and the 3d options are
particularly slim but at least it's all
nicely integrated in the main menu
around back because of the slim TV the
input Bay looks kind of squashed it does
have five HDMI however in addition to a
pc input and a component video input the
analog selection is pretty sparse but at
least there's plenty of digital inputs
another standout feature on the Vizio is
its well-equipped remote control you can
slide it open to reveal a full qwerty
keyboard that allows you to interact
with apps like Facebook and Twitter a
lot easier than using a virtual keyboard
on your TV screen mode is a little bit
chunkier however and a little bit less
responsive than most smartphone
keyboards so keep that in mind we also
like the derailleur has bluetooth
capabilities so you can operate it
without having line of sight to the
television picture quality video is
actually a little bit disappointing in
2d mode we noticed it had relatively
light black levels the picture
uniformity wasn't that great we blame
that on the edge LED backlighting TV
also has an artifact that looks a little
bit like smearing when there's fast
motion for example in faces they can
tend to blur a little bit more than a
lot of the other LCD TVs we've seen and
that's actually little surprising given
us one hundred twenty Hertz model this
big TV also has a relatively glossy
screen so it does catch a lot of ambient
light in bright rooms on the flip side
we did appreciate that the Vizio had
actually accurate color but that really
doesn't offset all the other picture
quality issues we saw in 2d one of the
downsides of the Vizio is 3d performance
is that it has half the resolution of
active 3d that means that when you're
looking at 3d on this set it does appear
a little bit softer than we're used to
on active 3d models there's also a few
more artifacts for example there's some
jagged edges on diagonal lines that
showed up on the passive TV and not on
the active models on the flip side the
Vizio was a little bit brighter overall
than the active TVs of course if you
have a relatively controlled viewing
environment that's not a big deal that
if you're viewing in a bright room the
active brighter 3d image might be a nice
thing in terms of comfort we did
appreciate the videos lighter glasses
but we didn't really see any difference
in terms of headaches or that sort of
thing induced by the act of TV versus
the passive and generally feel like
headaches and those sorts of viewer
comfort
more results of the content not the
implementation of 3d but we'll keep
looking and of course passive does offer
a nice alternative to active if you're
really not a fan of those expensive
glasses and still want 3d that's a quick
look at the Vizio xvt 3d 650 sv and i'm
david katz mark will boys still make
passes at girls with passive glasses
trust me it doesn't matter how good the
3d looks or how light the glasses are if
the 2d picture looks cruddy back to the
drawing board vizio alright let's go
ahead and check out this week's bottom
line now as if the Prius didn't already
own the market among the super green
crowd they're now doing an electric
version but not the scary kind that runs
out of juice the very reassuring kind
that also uses gas here's coolly to
break it all down look the Prius still
dominates the hybrid business trouncing
the insight in the fusion which are the
nearest things to a serious runner-up
but in the battle for forward mind share
the Prius has slipped let's see if the
upcoming prius plug-in can recapture the
old cachet and check the tech
giving the Prius PR hell these days are
the Nissan Leaf electric the Chevy Volt
range extender and a smattering of other
hybrids like the excellent sonata and
fusion hybrid toyota in its infinite
conservativism chooses to answer
revolution with evolution a prius you
plug in to go a little farther on
electric power and inside a prius
plug-in you're going to feel pretty
familiar driven a prius this is not
dramatically be done inside this is
based on a third gen prius you push the
button here to wake things up and with
that in mind you're going to get this
big eyebrow dashboard that wakes up
let's take a tour from left to right
first of all see that light on the left
that means I'm in EV mode just to the
right of that is my gas gauge then
you've got your speedometer you've got
an instantaneous MPG gauge your gear
indicator next to that will get to the
gear indicator in a minute and then
comes the good stuff the main display
for the hybrid drive system for hybrid
synergy drive you've got several modes
this is the one that i think is the most
useful the hybrid system indicator
overall that battery indicator shows
i've got almost a full battery then I've
got this sort of bar that goes left to
right the EV icon you see right now says
I'm running an EV mode when you see the
small little ramp on the left lit up
that's when I'm regenerating power into
the battery when you see the little bar
on the far right lit up that's when I'm
tapping power strongly out of the
electric motor and anything in the
middle is a blend of electric and gas
here's your shifter pulling it over here
and back get you into drive pull it over
here and back after that gets you into
be v is a high regeneration drive it has
a lot more drag or D cell where it's
really engaging the electric motor in
generator mode more often now of course
you've got to energy doors on this car
here's the one with electricity goes the
one down yonders for gasoline when you
open that up you get the standard sae
power port that's that multi-pin guy
right in there in there goes what is now
becoming a very common and off scene
charging handle on electric or
million vehicles that goes there the
other end of this cable has part of the
charging apparatus on it this brick
right here which you would probably
typically hang on a wall if you had one
sitting at home nothing much happens
here this light lights up then it
moderates with the cars internal
charging rig the pulsing of electricity
to charge the batteries let's go look at
those now back here here is where the
batteries live the additional batteries
in this guy are the story this whole
panel here conceals a large number of
them either lithium-ion by the way which
your current Prius doesn't have it's
still running nickel metal hydride
technology lithium-ion is the new stuff
better energy density a lighter i
believe and can be shaped and packaged
better what's in this car actually are
three batteries too that will do
electric only drive two really big ones
and a third one it's only used to be
hybridized with the gas engines and they
compartmentalized this to manage and
keep charge available for different
modes at all times
I don't think it's Toyota's plan but the
more I drove this car the more I thought
it should clear the decks and replace
the hybrid prius not be a somewhat
different flavor of it you see this and
the standard hybrid prius look real
different on paper but in everyday use
they felt that they might start to split
hairs okay pricing and availability
little early this guy is not going to
hit showrooms until q2 of 2012 little
more than a year from our shoot today
and even then only in the green 14 the
states where you'd expect hybrids to
sell a year later you get the 50 state
roll out of this vehicle pricing also a
guess three to five thousand dollars
more is kind of the speculation over the
price of a standard prius hybrid today
but that could change a lot with
lithium-ion battery development that
will happen in the next year now if you
see one of these today it's because it's
part of a fleet of just 150 that are
currently in testing here in the US
going forward a the biggest challenge of
this vehicle is the segmentation of the
electric car market there's an awful lot
for consumers to digest here and fitting
this particular one into that array i
think is a bit of a chore toyota and
other automakers have their work cut out
for them the bottom line this week that
car is kind of confusing I mean I'm sure
once you're driving it it'll all just
seem normal but like be mode really is
this what the future looks like the car
doesn't even fly and that's it for this
week everyone but don't fret we'll be
back next week with a brand new cnet
tech review and until then there are
tons of great videos available every day
at cnet TV com see you next time and
