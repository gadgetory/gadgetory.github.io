I'm cnet's karo tsuboi joined by chief
political correspondent Declan
McCullough thanks for joining us Declan
and today we're discussing the whole
idea that the Department of Justice and
other government agencies some may and
some may not need warrants to access
some of our personal information online
emails Facebook posts photos tell us a
little bit more about this right we're
talking about stored data a lot of cloud
data and it's kind of weird that you now
have the IRS saying last month yeah
we're going to require warrants for
email and now they're actually more
privacy protective than the FBI and the
DOJ the Justice Department that is who
say well warrants kind of optional
depending on the circumstances why are
there such inconsistencies between these
government agencies and who does that
fall onto to make consistent the Obama
administration right i mean the book has
to stop somewhere would stop at the
White House and so far they've been just
kind of hands off this issue this is not
something that they're really focused on
and so at the individual agency set
their own policies which is just weird I
mean the end of all the stops in
Congress and it's it within Congress's
power to set rules for not just the FBI
and DOJ and IRS but also for state and
local law enforcement and their bills
pending in Congress some have already
been approved by committees but they
haven't actually made that way to a
floor vote yet and the bills would say
that right now if the police want to
search your file cabinet at home at home
they have to get a search warrant she
has been the case for hundreds of years
going back to english common law and
everyone understands that too look you
know you want what my document you need
a warrant boy right and there's a lots
of good reasons for this and in fact is
the police probably at some level like
this because they can demonstrate that
they're actually following the rules and
increases trust in them but what they
the problem is that thanks to this law
that was enacted in 1986 factoring the
days of black-and-white macintosh
computers and dial-up modems the search
warrant is not required for all emails
stored in the cloud so Congress cannot
can change this law the courts are doing
their own thing in parallel but until
they until the Supreme Court or Congress
fixes things that we're left with this
sort of legal morass uncertainty and
different agencies doing there
thing that's amazing that a la that's
almost 30 years old is kind of dictating
modern technology these days but so it
is what do you think the implications
are of the inconsistencies here on tech
companies you know like Google out there
like Apple Facebook the big guys right
and almost all of those large companies
it's an apple and Twitter and Google and
so on and even a TNT have signed on to a
coalition that that's asking Congress
has changed a lot and it's it's good in
a way because they're protecting privacy
but it's also self-serving and they want
to say to Americans there that is their
customers you can move to the cloud you
it's just as safe as if the files were
stored on your laptop at home and so
there's and until that happens that the
companies are worried and until the law
has changed one way or another through
the courts were through Congress people
going to be not quite as interested in
taking advantage of some of these cloud
cloud services email documents photos a
whole lot of stuff final question I
guess back to the consumer if you have
anything to hide what should you do to
protect yourself right now the answer is
encrypted using use strong encryption
and store it locally don't put it in the
cloud at least if if it's stored locally
if someone breaks down your door with a
search warrant that you'll know about it
thank you so much chief political
correspondent Declan McCullough i'm cara
de su boy thanks for watching the inside
