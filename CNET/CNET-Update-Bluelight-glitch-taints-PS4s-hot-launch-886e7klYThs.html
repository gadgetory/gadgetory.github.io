blue line of death I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your scene that update more than
a million PlayStation 4 consoles were
sold in the first 24 hours they went on
sale in North America but the successful
launch of the new system was not a
flawless victory many owners have
complained on sony support forums about
malfunctioning ps4s that flash a blue
light and crash or failed to boot up
some users have posted videos of the
problem on YouTube calling it a blue
pulsing light of death some are
reporting a red light and that indicates
the system is overheating which could be
because the fan isn't turning on sony
says it expected some glitches at launch
and the number of defective systems is
less than point four percent of all
shipped PS force which comes to about
4,000 systems it will go on sale in
Europe and Latin America next week on
November 29th now this is a big year for
video game consoles and not just Sony
and Microsoft there are several systems
out for plain android games on your home
TV one of which is the Ouya there's a
new limited edition version of the Ouya
