Google I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update everyone can now try
out google's new redesigned Maps
interface on their web browser Google
first talked about the changes two
months ago but it's only now that
everyone can try out the new features by
going to maps.google.com / preview
google added more detail on the map when
you're doing a search for a place
including reviews and more street detail
and the more you use it the map gets
smart enough to make recommendations for
you it also has more ways to compare
public transit options and more images
of the area to scan including a new
earth view that lets you see cities
rendered in 3d and the Google Maps app
for iOS devices also got an update
google maps to point o has features to
support the larger iPad screen and it
has new navigational features like
traffic updates and indoor navigation
it's similar to the new android version
that came out a week ago there's also
the explorer function that lets you
discover neat things nearby which is the
same thing that you could do on
foursquare we are approaching a busy
season for new smartphones verizon is
teasing an event next week on tuesday
where the company will show off new
phones and that likely means new droid
models like the droid ultra line it's
the successor to the droid razr lineup
from last year and maybe we'll hear
something on the Moto X which is
expected to be Google's top phone this
year and it looks like Nokia is coming
out with another windows phone called
the Lumia 625 and it'll have a 4.7 inch
screen that's the largest screen yet for
a Lumia smartphone but it'll be a
low-end model according to a report from
the verge no word on when or if this
will come to the US but it shows your
nokia is pushing out windows phones at
several price points the top-of-the-line
nokia lumia 1020 that's going to hit 18
teen next week on friday sporting a 41
megapixel camera but with that mega
camera comes a mega price $300 with a
two-year contract the popular instant
messaging app called whatsapp is
changing its pricing for iOS users the
app used to
cost a dollar but now it's free with a
catch only the first year is free after
that users pay a dollar every year this
was actually the way it worked on
Android but now Apple users are on the
same payment system the app gives the
ipod touch the power of text messages
since it works over Wi-Fi it also lets
you set up group chat messages and send
unique things like voice messages and
your location among the usual stuff like
videos and photos that's your tech news
update you can find more details at cnet
