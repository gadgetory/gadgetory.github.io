Apple's entered the SmartWatch game this
is the Apple watch and I'm trying out an
early demo version on my wrist now there
are two different sizes and multiple
styles I'm around even getting it to the
features yet this is just how it looks
this is a 38 millimeter watch face
there's also a 42 millimeter this is a
smaller one so looks pretty good on me
but I actually like the larger size even
better but the point is that these are
work on men and women and they're
available in three different metal
designs you can get aluminum stainless
steel or 18 karat gold with a varying
range of prices all we know now is that
it's going to start at 349 it's
available early 2015 this is gonna pair
with iPhones iPhone 5 and later and it's
gonna stay connected with your phone and
enable you to track your fitness to do
activity and heart rate with for
sapphire lenses on the back that are
supposed to be much more accurate and
tracking your heart rate and also keep
track of things like the amount of
minutes you stand the amount of calories
you burn and also your fitness level
throughout the day Plus this works with
Apple pay so you're gonna be able to use
this for Apple's new contact free
Wireless payment system fill the wave
this and take wherever you go and there
are six different types of bands ranging
from leather to steel to rubber
some of them have standard watch clasps
some of them have wraparound magnets
that secure your wrist really
effortlessly and this will enable you to
also draw a little fun emojis to your
friends to using a direct touch system
now how do you interact with the Apple
watch you can touch and swipe the screen
but there's also a digital crown here
that uses IR and other sensors in here
to enable you to scroll to zoom in and
out or click like a home button and if
you click here the button right below it
goes to all of your friends and contacts
be able to instantly reach out to them
and again send them little fun jewels
too it has a slightly familiar smart
design but a whole different set of
features and a lot of high-end style
I'm Scott Stein here in Cupertino trying
on the Apple watch for myself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
