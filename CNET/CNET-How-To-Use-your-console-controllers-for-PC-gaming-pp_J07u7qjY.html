with a keyboard and mouse you can truly
shine in some MMORPGs first-person
shooters and realtime strategy games but
some games can be even better if you use
a controller I'm dan Graziano and in
today's how-to I'm going to show you how
to use the controller that comes with
either your Xbox 360 Xbox one or
PlayStation 4 on your computer the
easiest controllers are used with your
PC are the ones that come with Xbox 360
and the Xbox one it shouldn't be a shock
that Microsoft made it simple for gamers
to simply plug in and play but before
you can do that you need to download
drivers from Microsoft's website once it
has been installed just connect the
controller and start gaming for the Xbox
one you will need a micro USB cord
unfortunately the controller can't be
used wirelessly it's a little more
difficult to use the PlayStation
controllers with your PC in fact I don't
even recommend using the ps3 controller
while there is a way to connect it it's
a huge hassle and the software you use
is kind of sketchy so I say you stay
away so we're going to focus on the
controller that comes with the ps4 the
first thing you must do is download and
install the Xbox 360 drivers for
Microsoft then using a program called DS
for tool you're going to trick your PC
into thinking that ps4 controller is
actually an Xbox one once the program
has been downloaded unzip it and open
the folder titled virtual bus driver
inside of the folder double-click on the
SCP driver application and install it if
it was installed properly under the
install summary it will list bus device
and bus driver make sure steam or any
running games are closed and connect the
ps4 controller to your PC using a micro
USB cord then open the SCP server
application locate in the main ds4 tool
folder the program should automatically
detect your controller and say it's
ready for use if your computer has
bluetooth or you purchased an adapter
you can also use the ps4 controller
wirelessly press the share and play
Station button on the controller until
the LED light begins flashing to enter
pairing mode open the control panel on
your computer and under hardware and
sound click on add a device and select
the controller after it has been paired
simply open the SCP server application
and it should automatically detect your
controller you can customize the light
bar color adjust the controller's Rumble
create custom controls and even enable
the touchpad which can be used to move
the cursor around all of this can be
done in the options menu for more
detailed instructions and links the
software you need to get the job done
