taking a look at the Phillips 60 watt
equivalent LED this is the light that
retails for about $15 at Home Depot or
maybe a little less on Amazon and it
puts out 830 lumens worth of light using
11 watts that gives it an efficiency
rating of just about 75 lumens per watt
which is great but not quite as good as
the cree 60 watt replacement which puts
out closer to 85 one thing that this
bulb is especially good at compared to
other LEDs is its compatibility with
in-wall dimmer switches if you use those
switches to dial the brightness of your
lights up and down you will like what
you get with this bulb it dims very
smoothly and it doesn't buzz or flicker
you won't find those kind of annoyances
with this bulb and you will with others
so if you have those switches I think
this is when you're definitely going to
want to put at the top of your list one
point of differentiation that we found
between the Phillips and Cree LEDs was
color temperature both the rated at 2700
K but the Philips bulb comes in a little
bit low closer to 2600 and this gives it
more of an orange equality to the light
if you look at this page here and you
split it up into third between
incandescent 2700 K light the Cree bulb
and the Philips bulb you can see that
the Philips bulb has more of a yellow
tint to it
now this might all seem awfully specific
but that's kind of the point if you want
to separate a Philips bulb from a Cree
bulb or the GE led from the Philips slim
style you sort of need to split hairs
you need to look at very specific
particular point to figure out what sets
each bulb apart now the Philips bulb
stands out in my mind for a slight
uptick and brightness and better
compatibility with dimmers so if you've
got dimmers or you're very concerned
about the brightness of your lights I
think this is the bulb that you want to
get but it's not the cheapest bulb and
it doesn't have the best warranty it's
not the most efficient either so if
those are important I probably go with
the Cree 60 watt replacement for CNET
I'm right crist
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
