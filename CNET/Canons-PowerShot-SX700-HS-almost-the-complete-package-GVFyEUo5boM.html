long zoom lens and you know you don't
want to sacrifice portability to get it
the good news is you have several
options such as the Canon Powershot SX
700 HS I'm Josh Goldwyn Lucy net and
with the sx-70 HS you get a 30x zoom
lens a 3-inch high-res LCD and a 16
megapixel BSI CMOS sensor in a body that
can easily be tossed in a bag or a large
pocket shooting modes cover everything
from full auto to full manual and there
are effects and filters and scene modes
too to help with low-light shots and
action shots among other things the only
things really missing are panorama and
HDR modes you do get canons hybrid auto
that shoots a few seconds of video
before each shot and then stitches them
together so you have a movie at the end
of a day of shooting and you also get
its creative shot mode that snaps photos
and then generates different versions of
them by cropping and adding effects
shooting performance is very good and
it's one of the only models in its class
that has continuous shooting with
autofocus battery life has improved some
but more importantly it doesn't seem to
have the same battery issues as last
year's SX 280 HS you'll probably still
want to have an extra pack or two handy
especially if you're shooting a lot of
video or using the built-in Wi-Fi it
also produces some really good photos
and video though low-light shots are
noticeably soft actually its photos in
general benefit from some post shoot
sharpening and a little bump in contrast
you can read the full review on cnn.com
but as long as you're not pixel peeping
and HDR and easy panorama shots aren't
must-haves the Canon Powershot SX 700 HS
should be on your shortlist I'm Josh
