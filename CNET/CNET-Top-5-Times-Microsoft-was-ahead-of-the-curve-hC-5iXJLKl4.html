actor Microsoft build developer
conferences in the history books a
Microsoft showed up all kinds of things
including the hololens a computer that
you wear in your head that shows
augmented reality now over the years the
company has gotten a lot of flack by
people saying that Microsoft is behind
the times and is always trying to catch
up however today we're gonna take a look
at the top five times Microsoft was
ahead of the curve at number 5 is Rover
and Bob and cliffy now before you start
throwing garbage at the screen because I
mentioned cliffy let's talk about it way
back when Microsoft introduced Microsoft
Bob a new operating system designed to
make computing easier it also introduced
a virtual assistant in Bob it was Rover
a little dog the same kind of assistant
appeared in Microsoft Office with
clipping yes it was universally hated
but arguably these pesky little guys are
the ancestors of Siri Google now and
Cortana number four is the ultra-mobile
PC or um PC it was introduced by
Microsoft and Intel back in 2006 at the
time the idea was to build a computer
small enough they could carry it around
everywhere the only problem with these
things was battery life not so great
touch screens and they really weren't
ultra mobile oh and they were expensive
so I guess the UMPC had a lot of
problems fast-forward to today where
people are regularly using
pocket-friendly computers to do a number
of tasks that used to require a real
computer we just calm cell phones now
Microsoft hasn't given up hope though at
build Microsoft showed you could dock a
phone running Windows 10 and have a
desktop like experience number three one
of my favorites spot watches they were
introduced way back in 2004 now in case
you don't remember these you'd buy a
special watch from a company like fossil
or swatch they could just play data like
news weather and stocks Microsoft used
FM radio to send data wirelessly to your
wrist you have to pay a yearly fee of up
to 60 bucks or so they were even plans
to use spot which stood for smart
personal object technology it appliances
like coffee makers the spot service was
shut down in 2012 I guess if we want
risk notifications now we'll have to
look an Android wear pebble Apple oh and
the Microsoft pin at number two is the
Xbox and online gaming when Microsoft
decided to build its own game console
the company put an Ethernet port on the
back according to an in-depth feature to
polygon the inclusion
the port was very controversial because
dial-up was still around this is around
the year 1999 so broadband wasn't as
prevalent as it is now however we know
how this whole thing panned out online
console gaming on the Xbox wouldn't work
as well without a broadband connection
the other half of the equation is Xbox
Live a wafer game was to play against
other Xbox Live members without the Xbox
we probably wouldn't have such connected
consoles and at number one is the tablet
way back in 2001 Microsoft introduced
the tablet PC it was a full-fledged
computer that had a number of form
factors including the slate each of the
tablets had a touchscreen although you'd
usually have to interact with it using
an included stylus it ran a specialized
version of Windows called Windows XP
tablet PC Edition some of the machines
were a little bulky and the pen
interface didn't exactly work well
compared to using a mouse
tablet PCs weren't really successful
that is until 2010 with eating adduction
the Apple iPad which led to a whole new
slew of Android and Windows tablets over
time timing is everything in life
Microsoft has executed some really wild
ideas over the years virtual personal
assistants smartwatches tablets
Microsoft tried it she has to bit too
early if you think I was too hard on
Microsoft or too lenient let me know I'm
that I as on Twitter for more top fives
