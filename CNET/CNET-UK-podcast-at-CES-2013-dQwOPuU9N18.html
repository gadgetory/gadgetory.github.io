editors seen at UK welcome you to the
cnet UK podcast number 321 live from the
cnet stage at CES in Las Vegas coming up
we're going to take a look at the
coolest kit we've seen at the show and
some of the rubbish bits as well but
before we start reminded if you're
listening to the audio version of this
podcast make sure you go to the cnet and
look for the video vote of it because
it's pretty cool moving this week is
podcast regular luke westaway hello and
plus a very very special guest he's at
economists for Reader's Digest and
presenter of the amazing answer me this
podcast welcome mr. Ollie man hello wow
what a yeah I've got four times the
pixels of an ordinary podcast that's
going to be here thank you very much
thank you for inviting me no problem has
a show bin for everyone so far it's been
alright it's been okay okay yeah well i
think it is sort of it's gotta feeling
out nothing's blown my mind but
nothing's really upset me okay me
nothing turn my feelings yeah aventine
any technology that's physically harmed
me although I did I did see this laser
burning thing that was etching something
in wood and I got a little wood a Qing
from it and that was really cool because
it was an extremely precise laser
etching that was being done and it
looked phenomenal but because it was
burned wood it did smell quite bad and I
put it in my pocket and then my pocket
smell bad and I put in my hotel room
when I came back my hotel room smell
it's a good story I hope you got more
like that and let's crack on with the
thieves the show right we always start
with themes the show beams of the show
yeah surely that was the topic number so
I guess the first thing is it's always
it's always that TVs isn't it so what's
the big TV thing this year yeah there
are two big TV things so the first is
OLED LED which is a display technology
as you may or may not know that is
currently most popular in smartphones
silos or smartphones use this it looks
absolutely gorgeous and when you blow
this display take up to property d size
it looks mind-blowing Lee gorgeous so
you get this this amazing contrast ratio
you just get these really really deep
bright colors and it just looks
fantastic so that's that's when you see
this an oled TV I've seen
basically everyone's got one but Sony's
is the most impressive because it adds
in how do you factor that in because
they all look the same to me to the
naked eye they are all amazing but I
cannot differentiate between the samsung
one the sony one the Panasonic one the
LG one well this is stingray what you do
is you look at it and at the bottom
there's normally a little word says
panasonic or sony or or whatever and
that's pretty much it well I I also
worry sometimes whether if I was looking
at a normal LCD screen as well if they
were showing the same images of a leaf
so as a leaf isn't it a leave for water
for a copyright free leaf I'm not sure
with the contrast whacked up high that
I'd always be able to tell the
difference like you never really know
until you watch a film on it do those
are you trying to shatter the the myth
that there is much difference between
most TVs I mean we might have to stop
this podcast but there is the wrister
between oled TV and the LED tvs that
we've seen right because ariad looks a
lot better than normal TV plus there are
two 4k OLED TVs you wanna explain a bit
what 4k is and what those products are
so 4k is another very exciting display
technology because it just has a
phenomenal number of pixels got about
four times as much as 1080p full HD so
when you're looking at it it's like the
first time you load to HD but a little
bit more it's just a bit more HD ultra
HD is what they're calling it here yes 0
for k is one thing that you see the
cinemas and there's also Ultra HD now
there is actually a reason for that I
know you know you're worried about this
the reason is that the 4k you get in
cinema is actually a sum like seven
percent wider than the 4k get on a TV
because the aspect ratio is a bit
different so we get the bars the bomb at
the top so hence the name Ultra HD so
big anyway sorry I interrupted that's
fine um yeah but Sony's Sony's done
something very cool it's made a 4k OLED
TV that's something I i I've seen him
and it really really I saw it and was
just kind of bored by it it was like a
chancing upon the first time for our we
moved I was new a new corporate slogan
yeah yeah almost it is one thing I did
notice is that even from the back of the
press conference and Sony where I was it
did look very crystal clear in a way
that actually at HD or LCD TV wouldn't
in the same way you can get very very
close up can't you and you don't notice
the pixels I mean that is noticeable
straight away that even right
from the other end of the hall it still
looked like a really crystal sharp
display yeah exactly it looks beautiful
there's another use of out that you've
seen as well only the multi vtv from
Samsung oh yeah I do kind of think this
is sort of end of days this stuff really
and I'm a bit of an evangelist for the
second screen you know the second screen
tweet whilst you're watching TV all that
stuff but when you actually literally
putting a second screen in the big
screen so that you and your partner can
be watching different things or playing
different games at the same time I just
think there's something a little bit
depressing about that idea for a family
to be honest so it's one TV with and you
get what two glasses or something and
house and you don't get crosstalk that's
a new little word that I learned from
the Samsung press conference no
crosstalk I thought you know how to
measure for crosstalk this is alyssa's a
little pro tip you put the glasses on
and you go like that oh really just
slightly out of Center and if you get
out there and the people separate that's
crosstalk isn't they they go do wrong oh
no I'm the only one still doing it I
also love the inherent sexism as well of
all of those presentations where they're
like you want to watch one thing but say
my wife wants to watch something else it
is that ok you'll make you a lot of
assumptions there firstly everyone here
at the press conference is male secondly
they're all straight thirdly they've all
got a wife and forth me that the wife
would have completely different taste of
them because they're a woman so come on
takes for everyone people yeah you gotta
remember that press conferences existing
this week fantasy land where people like
watching leaves least our it leaves a
little clouds over the mountains like
watching leaves my most special for that
okay phone what else has there been all
NFC that's something I'm quite excited
about maybe it's just me but it is
exciting so on the Sony stand they've
got some really interesting uses for NFC
and it's a it's the technology's been on
phones for ages and has been loaded NFC
phones and it's supposed to I thought
was just for paying for things and
that's kind of taking a while to work
out but actually what it does is it
helps one thing talk to another thing
that what otherwise it wouldn't talk to
each other so they had a TV and a phone
and if they both got something called
mirror cast on it stay with me you pick
up your phone and you tap it on the
remote and then what's on the phone is
projected onto the TV and you can swivel
around and do that that's the NFC kind
of establish
the pair between those two things and
then Bluetooth takes over and so does
the file transfer also they've got a
little file transfer system like a box
and you put your phone on top of it uses
NFC to pee and then the box sucks off
any pictures or you know video whatever
you've got on your phone and backs it up
onto its own hard disk but the thing you
probably use it for is play music so you
play musically phone you tap the phone
onto boom box and a boom box and it was
like this big it was insane and music
comes out of there you don't need to
like you know we bluetooth even we have
to like press pair and then you've got
other cones and it gets rid of all that
so thumbs up NFC I think if NFC becomes
really popular in the future do you
think there's a chance that we'll lose
the dexterity to handle cables and
sockets and we'll just childishly push
one piece of technology into another I
think there's every chance I'm mashing
my computer into a television like kids
who don't know how to read books cuz
they've grown up with tablet computers
so they do that on pages I'll be that
but just yeah speak to me slaps slaps
forehead i should say for the audio
people but there's only one that they
are all there one touch stuff yeah am i
right or wrong in saying that that only
works with sony products ah you may or
may not be no one really knows including
Sony it should to be honest work with
most it should work ice cream that's
cool isn't it no one really knows
because obviously there's an almost
infinite number of products so until you
test them all who knows really the the
TV thing only works if the both things
got miracast which is a sony technology
that they are licensing it but they're
kinda just music stuff that should just
that should work maybe what it'll take
for NFC to take off is for it to be in
in everything really it should be in in
taxis in chairs airports restaurants
every room of your house every surface
the sofa the cat everything should have
an NFC chip in it NFC cat yeah because
because otherwise it's just not going to
be more convenient than reaching for the
remote or something yes yes you are
right well done and I think that often
when you're walking around CES and you
see these manufacturers who have
developed technologies that really only
work if everything in your house is made
by that one developer it can be very
frustrating and the most ridiculous
example I saw of this was on the toshiba
stand where they were talking about
every member of the family can
different account on the television so
they can recommend programs that you
might want to watch because that's
easier than choosing your own program I
think what kind of mad parallel
universes this where everyone has a
toshiba TV and they genuinely think it's
easier to recommend to their dad what to
watch using the social interface on
their TV then it just for example
accessing Twitter and so I do just maybe
a phone call yes no need to talk to me
son use your toshiba tablet to swipe it
or the Radio Times dare I say a TV Guide
for Americans sorry yeah okay what the I
guess one of the big areas for us is
always phones so has its been a phony
show or a show phony no no they've been
motor show no yeah there's been a sony
phone there's been a phony sony phone
nice don't know yeah probably yes so
there's been basically one or two phones
of notes but they're more notable by
their absence so Samsung's got no new
phones really sorry I don't think it
anything in fact yeah and so lots of
manufactures are basically said oh yeah
we are still making phones but we're not
going to show them off here so not
foresee yes they get away for mobile
world congress which is a mobile phone
centric trade show in in February what
have we see what have we seen we've seen
the Sony Xperia Z that's probably one of
those show highlights so this is a
Sony's stayed away from the making
screens enormous fat which samsung is
embraced wholeheartedly with things like
the galaxy note and note 2 but it's
decided at last that it's of phones
aren't doing very well so maybe it
should try something that is working for
other companies so the Sony Xperia said
is it's a 5 inch quad core 13 megapixel
camera smartphone it's basically every
every Bell and whistle yay the thing is
like a 5-inch phone is not really very
exciting quad cores not very exciting
because these things happened before I
mean it might be perfectly good but it's
not really pushing anything forward the
13-megapixel camera though Sony makes
nice it's nice cameras there is one
other feature it has right which is its
water proof that is actually quite
useful and properly waterproof if the
demonstrations are to be believed
there's a thing which actually ducks it
into water on their staff
i'm pretty sure i was reading a press
release that said like feel free to use
your phone in in air quotes water or
something or which I think suggested
that possibly ID like water one of the
use case scenarios that Sony mentioned
at their press conference was and I
quote blogging in the bathtub please
what kind of blogger you writing if
you're doing a food blog was your in the
bathtub you've got it wrong I can do my
job in the bath as well and good I
thought I was in you know in I thought
it was all gravy doing my job in my
pants from bed I didn't read now you can
consider I could be in the bath as well
accidentally access the 13-megapixel
camera that's the first thing issue yeah
there's another massive phone as well
that I mean massive in terms of its
screen size the high i assent mate what
make you got 6.1 inches jelly bean and
you called core is naked you're gonna
need a new one yeah this is an enormous
phone obviously 6.1 inches is way too
big or maybe not if you really like it
phone as well no I are I saw the first
galaxy note which was five something
point seven or so I can remember and i
thought was ridiculous product ever I
still think it's most ridiculous product
ever but they're selling right so what
do I know so with that in mind maybe
this is the best thing ever but it's a
six interesting it's like you have to
stretch your hand to get it around it
well it is but then it's very easy to
say that when we've all got two netbooks
and two laptops and two tablets but
actually if you're just choosing one
device and you're upgrading from maybe
even a dumb phone to your first
smartphone and you just want one that
does stuff but you know everyone else
might be using a tablet for he's a bit
more gadgets entry I can kind of see
that you want one with a bigger screen
actually okay only man voice of the
people I like that I like that yes mate
yeah okay so maybe the hours of power as
well they claim 48 hours yes no chance
yeah that just doesn't that doesn't I'm
not your house are being turned off by
me exactly yeah yeah alright as long as
you like yeah it literally can be a
brick result like okay right there's the
main themes the show what other cool
stuff have we seen I've seen the
year we should probably talk about the
Nvidia shield issue the shield an odd
gaming concepts remember last year razor
kind of stole the show with its bizarre
tablet with handles on the side that's
here again actually make this time the
handles are detachable it's actually
anyway it's very complicated and it's
like fifteen hundred dollars or
something we'll talk about of dollars
anyway it's too complicated but the
Nvidia shield it's a it's a small gaming
handheld it looks a bit like the
nintendo dscc it's got this this 5-inch
I think screen on the top it plays
android games that's fine but it can
also do which is really interesting is
stream PC games so the idea is you're
playing games on the pc and you're like
this screen is too big and this is too
comfortable i would like to go in the
other room and play on my nvidia shield
well possibly I don't want to sound too
cynical though it could be useful maybe
if say for example someone maybe your
wife wants to watch something on
television so you have to stop playing
your game so you can you can transfer
the game on to a different screen it's
it's an interesting idea it's an
interesting idea okay what have you seen
ollie can I talk about view 6 please do
I'm big fan of musics I've been
following them for years they've got
quite a big presence in the UK and if
you're interested in the sort of
wearable technology space they're kind
of a leader really and but they don't
have the budget of epson or Sony who
have been getting a lot of press
coverage for their kind of wearable
cinema screens and all the rest of it
which are worse like definitely our
worst I've tried them all the eps and
ones are really heavy on your nose thus
only one I think you have to plug into
the wall which defeats the whole purpose
of being on a plane with it and musics
all along have been doing interesting
wearable technology derived for a
military stuff and this thing that they
brought out for CES the m100 they have
an announcement is actually going to be
available and I wonder if indeed it ever
will whether they just want to steal a
march on google glasses and you do feel
a bit like the Terminator wearing it you
just want to walk around saying I'm
looking for Sarah Connor but basically
it's a little monocle that sits there it
is but yeah it's pretty yeah and you're
welcome and you say I say I've got an
SMS something very surprising will it
pop off your face but the idea is you
sort of you can look up words and it
will send you through bluetooth text
messages or whatever from your phone
pairs with your phone using bluetooth
and I was skeptical about the whole
concept of they say you can drive with
it and as you're driving glance upwards
and get a message i'm like that sounds
like a recipe for a car accident yeah
but I tried it and I can sort of imagine
that it's no more distracting than
actually if you were looking at a sign
going purse hey there's one right here
genuinely did not blame them can we
borrow that age can we see know what you
should have this just chuck it up here
we're getting on with the Bluetooth
monocle so yo can I hold it I don't know
what that's actually paired with now but
can you see anything through it's a
video on it so now say I'm looking for
Sarah corner some people sell coffee
that was good it's like he's really here
that I did it and it's really
interesting to see where they're going
with next with this because
realistically I don't think people are
going to be buying these but I do think
that's very scary but I do think it
looks like I in fact I think what
they're going towards this sort of
Google Glasses type idea we've got a
camera may be embedded in the specs that
basically like Ray Bans with with I
guess a phone on board and not a
bluetooth paired device it's quite
exciting stuff ok found this is going to
be on the next big it's gonna be on a
panel that's coming up anyway so what
else do we see I'm sorry well yeah
something that I've seen I really like
is it's called a happy fork now this
thing is are you going like most about
you I like they're fearful it's all
about the happy for me back we've just
passed that back down this is a fork
that's got that communicates with your
smartphone and if you eat too quickly it
buzzes the idea being that it helps you
lose weight how do we yeah this fork
would set it and it will send all that
data to a smartphone and you get a
little graph and you can see how like
quickly leaden and does what stuff for
sure No and is it a bit too heavy yes
and am i a child no I don't want to be
told when ten seconds has gone by I'm an
independent person living in a free
country with my hands I don't have
before no I like what it is that you
know have a nice i like where it's going
i like the idea of connected devices
that used to be not smart but i just
think a fork that tells me when to eat
can cutlery off
should give you fun stuff to do and not
tell you what to stop doing special
acting isn't of Wales to be seen then I
can I just know on the happy fork I do
you think for kids it would be good I
think the kids learning how not to eat
too quickly then it's a game isn't
because you don't want it to buzz ok I
just wanted to get it is all about the
happy for concert yeah yeah um I've seen
a blue tie ok if you don't like the
happy fork maybe you're like the parrot
bluetooth thingy prong thing I come on
it's cool now but it's called like plant
detective iconic it's like it's a little
fork and you put it in the soil of your
plant and uses bluetooth to communicate
with an iPad or some such yeah you tell
the ipad what your plan is and it shows
you when the happy perhap fault what hat
for i've been told in my ear like my
Sarah Connor and it says you gotta walk
you gotta water in two days you move it
to better light that sort of thing it's
pretty cool I like it it should give it
a voice if you give the plant a voice
it's like I'm thirsty what would your
plans say it would most to say I'm
thirsty I'm dying yeah I'm dead I died
many years ago please throw me away I
think it's a first-generation idea it's
good I wouldn't buy one now but when you
get to the stage where that kind of
technologies built into a plant pot that
you buy at home base then I can imagine
that working you know if it's actually
free or it cost one pound more to get
your bluetooth-enabled plant that tells
you when to water it then you can
imagine it working on you and I guess
that sort of thing has to come out so
they can filter the technology down but
the idea of buying something that costs
anything upwards of three quid to put in
your blonde pot and tell you when to
water it just comes out very good wow
we're coming to the end unfortunately so
let's just let's just round up by saying
what our favorite products of the show
all about you Luke I'm gonna go with
Sony's 4k OLED it blew my mind blue
minor to I have to say what about you
Olly this is something that we haven't
talked about was just very briefly
emulsion as a new company of
smartwatches and I'm well into the Dick
Tracy idea that one day we're going to
properly do this and it's never quite
happened i know there's pebble and stuff
and it hasn't got a digital display it's
got an analog one so it looks like a fun
analog watch bright straps but you can
sync it with your phone and see messages
and stuff it's great it's all about the
happy for
for me I'm sorry no one is going to give
in to me I want the happy thought all
right well on that bombshell thanks so
much for joining us next up at the top
of the hour at some very very cool and
cutting-edge tech brian cooley war hoax
our next interfaces you pounds so make
sure you don't miss it that's it for
almost thanks for thanks to everyone for
coming down here and that's it for this
year see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
