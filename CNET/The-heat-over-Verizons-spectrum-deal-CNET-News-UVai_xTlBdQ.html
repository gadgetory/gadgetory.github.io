inside scoop and I'm chatting with
Maggie Riordan she is senior writer and
author of the ask Maggie column and
you're busy explaining the drama that's
going on right now with spectrum in the
FCC basically verizon wants to make a
deal with cable companies to do a little
bit of exchanging of spectrum and people
are kind of getting worried about
whether the FCC will approve this or not
so why are people getting so worked up
about this business deal well Verizon
basically has a lot of spectrum already
and the big concern is you know are they
going to get too much it's kind of like
a big University or company going into a
neighborhood and and they already own a
lot of the real estate there and they're
going to buy up a whole bunch more and
the fears that they'll push out some of
the little guys and put in a foot locker
you know in a store or something so so
that's the the fear and Verizon could
very well do that but what Verizon and
the cable company say is like look this
is a private deal between two companies
or between two entities here but people
on the other side say wait a minute
spectrum is a public good we all own
this the public owns this and the FCC
which is the agency that's there to
determine who gets to use this public
good they need to decide whether it's in
the interest of the public to do this so
so that's why people are getting so
upset about it so what are the little
guys saying about this I mean when you
interview them what are their big
concerns well this is a real
david-and-goliath kind of challenge for
them you know there's a lot of lobbying
going on in Washington DC but you've got
verizon which is is definitely bigger
has a lot more money to spend you know
I'd put AT&amp;amp;T in that same camp too and
then you've got all these these little
guys who just don't have the oomph they
don't have the cash they don't have the
lobbying gravitas right so they're all
coming together you've even got t-mobile
and Sprint that are joining their rural
carrier Association to try to lobby
against the bigger players wait well you
know sprint and t-mobile I thought
they're kind of big but even there
joining up to
sure that 18 teen verizon don't girl
you've got AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon which
control over seventy percent of the
market so t-mobile and Sprint aren't
that big well why should I really be
concerned why should I cry if the little
guy doesn't get all the spectrum that
Verizon does it just I mean aren't I
still benefiting from verizon being
stronger and also having more choice
with sprint and t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T well
today we have competition but the fear
is what happens when we allow these
companies to buy each other up or by
each other spectrum and we get more and
more consolidation and we see the bigger
players forcing out these little guys so
you really don't you don't want to get
to a point where you don't have
competition look at cable in a lot of
places it's expensive because people
don't have competition but when you've
got a company like verizon who comes in
and they offer fios or something like
that then you start to see prices come
down well it's interesting to see what
decision they make Thank You Maggie
thanks for watching Christina I'm
