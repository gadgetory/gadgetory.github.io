MacBook Pro Line is the inventive touch
bar control strip that lives above the
keyboard but not every new MacBook Pro
has this feature and in fact you've got
to show on at least $1,800 together
touch bar much more practical and with
less sticker shock is the new mainstream
13-inch MacBook Pro this new laptop is
all the same design a component upgrades
as the other new pros but keeps the
old-school function key row with the
MacBook Air still stuck with a low res
screen and older parts this might be the
new default MacBook for most people it's
just a shame it cost more although it
does start out with a bigger better 256
gigabyte hard drive it still got the
newer slimmer body it's got the revamped
touchpad and keyboard and it's all USB
see all the time ok the headphone jack
is still there too for now at least that
means nearly every part of the macbook
pro has been remade for what is
essentially the 10th anniversary edition
of this iconic laptop the force touch
trackpad has been blown up to twice its
previous size and now dominates the
wrist rest even more than before and
with forced touch the pan doesn't
actually click down which saves you
space and allows for thinner lighter
designs this guy is thinner and it has a
smaller footprint than both the previous
13-inch Pro and even the MacBook Air the
keyboard is a major departure for the
MacBook Pro it looks and feels a lot
like the very flat very shallow keyboard
in the 12-inch MacBook getting rid of
the big chunky keys found on the pro in
the air it's gonna be a big learning
curve for some and some people are just
never gonna love it but one thing I do
love is the option to get these new
MacBooks in classic silver or now Space
Gray which has a very cool very modern
bold look
