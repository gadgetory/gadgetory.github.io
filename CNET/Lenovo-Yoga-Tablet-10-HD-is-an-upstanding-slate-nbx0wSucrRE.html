the crowd well you can try literally
making it stand up I'm the Westway Percy
net and this is the Lenovo yoga tablet
10 hd+ alright so let's start by talking
about this tablet killer characteristic
and that's this metal kickstand on the
back know what this means is that you
can use the tablet in a couple of
different configurations you can have it
in normal style holding it a little bit
like a book might be good for ebook
reading you can also flip the kickstand
out and rest it up this way for watching
some videos perhaps or you can turn
around the other way which makes for a
comfortable angle for typing so the
screen measures 10.1 inches on the
diagonal it's got a really high
resolution as well specifically this is
1920 x 1080 pixels it looks very sharp
and sweeping around some home screens
and stuff everything feels very smooth
and responsive to I have to say I'm also
quite impressed by how thin and light
this tablet is it's really really skinny
and I think if you touch it in your bag
you wouldn't really notice if you were
carrying it around with you all day on
the front there's a 1.6 megapixel camera
whereas around the back you get an 8
megapixel affair it's got quite a lot of
power under the hood with a quad-core
1.6 gigahertz processor it comes in this
tasteful champagne gold or a silver
option but those colors will be
available in different parts of the
world this version isn't currently
running the latest version of Android is
running 4.3 jelly bean rather than 4.4
KitKat however lenovo tells me that it
will be getting an update to the latest
edition in early summer which is also
when it goes on sale one bit of good
news is the price it's not that
expensive it's going to cost three
hundred and forty nine dollars however
that's about fifty dollars more than the
previous version costs will have to wait
for the full review to find out whether
the extra cost is really justified what
do you think of the design what do you
think of this metal kickstand please let
me know i'm luke westaway to cnet's with
