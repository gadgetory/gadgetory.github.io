their home is kind of overkill or they
don't have the space if that's you IMAX
hopes you'll seek out one of its VR
experience centers we designed specially
made pods and we use the same
architectural firm that designed for
Apple and for Tesla and it creates kind
of a sleek social experience in there we
checked out the first location for
IMAX's VR experiment in Beverly Hills
California it's almost like a small
movie theater you come in you check out
the show times buy a ticket for the
title you want to experience and then
head to your private pod where a staffer
helps you get set up tickets range from
7 to $10 per experience which each lasts
about 10 minutes every pod has custom
equipment depending on which VR game you
pick knockout league featured a haptic
feedback vest the John wick pod had a
special machine gun and headset from
Star breeze and Rabbids VR ride had a D
box chair that twisted rumbled and
tilted along with the roller-coaster
ride this is the first IMAX VR Center
and five others will follow suit
sometime this year all of the other five
in addition to this location are going
to be inside multiplexes where our large
network of 1,200 screens all around the
world enables us to roll out a pretty
big network worldwide the idea is to get
you coming back to try popular VR games
and experiences and the fact some of
them are tied to famous movie franchises
like John wick means it makes sense for
IMAX to have them inside movie theaters
you watch Keanu Reeves kill a bunch of
bad guys on the silver screen and then
you leave the theater and see you can
get in on the action too mostly this
looks like an added value for movie
goers who are 100% sold on VR just yet
or don't want the hassle of setting up a
dedicated space in their homes
we knew whatever we built had to be very
social whether it's a multiplayer game
or communicating with your friends on
social media what you're doing there had
to be a real social vibe to it so it's
different than what you can get at home
it's interesting I max thinks VR should
be a shared experience with your friends
and family much like going to the movies
even though one person is wearing the
headset it is still kind of fun to
record them say stumbling around like an
idiot while trying to punch in game
opponents like I did and then post that
to social media we think it's almost
replicates what we've done in cinema a
little bit because what we're doing is
taking this new platform that's
incredibly immersive
and delivering entertainment to people
in a way that we've always done which is
as a destination based location for more
