outside the Federal Communications
Commission in Washington DC where I just
sat down for a chat with Chairman Ajit
PI he's proposing rollback of Obama era
net neutrality regulation these rules
pass back in 2015
make sure your broadband provider can't
block or slow down your access to the
net so I've been covering the net
neutrality issue for at least a dozen
years why do we have to go through this
again
well I think all of us favor a free and
open Internet and the only question for
the FCC at this point is what's the best
legal framework for securing some of
those core values that have given us the
digital economy that's the envy of the
world and that's the part of the
conversation that we'll be kicking off
on May 18th okay so I know a big piece
of this is this so-called title to
regulation that's the utility style
legal framework that the last
administration built their net
neutrality rules around but I also
noticed in the proposal that there
you're asking the question should the
bright-line rules that no blocking the
the no throttling should those even be
rules I mean what do you think should
should there be rules for to protect net
neutrality and keep the internet open or
should we just let the broadband
providers police themselves
well I considerably said that I favor a
free and open Internet and the
clinton-era light-touch approach is the
one that I think has produced
unparalleled benefits for consumers and
so from an administrative perspective
when we kick off a conversation we want
it to be a robust conversation to tee up
all of the different possibilities and
let the American people give us their
input as to what they think the best
framework should be so do you think
broadband providers are really capable
of of not discriminating against
somebody like a Netflix or not even yet
developed Netflix well this is precisely
why some people say title two is
necessary some people say no regulation
is necessary I've consistently but said
that look the clinton-era light-touch
approach is the right one let the
marketplace develop and if we see an
example of any competitive conduct then
you can take targeted action to
address that problem but that's part of
the approach that we hope to embrace on
a bipartisan basis going forward just as
it was a braced in 1996 by President
Clinton in a Republican Congress so this
issue has become so partisan right we've
got Republicans and Democrats really
entrenched on either side why is that
I'm not sure some people speculate that
because our politics generally are much
more polarized now that is infected
communications policy I'm not sure what
the answer is but I'm committed to
making sure that I do everything I can
to lead the agency on a bipartisan basis
and when it comes to broadband
deployment for instance we've had
several votes under my chairmanship that
have been unanimous in nature getting
more broadband to unserved America and
removing some of the regulations that
stand in the way of carriers being able
to deliver digital opportunity to
citizens who are on the wrong side of
the digital divide and those are the
nuts and bolts that's the nuts and bolts
of work that the FCC traditionally is
done and I'm proud to say we've done it
with Republicans United with Democrats
but it does seem that that there are
still a lot of issues that our
Republican Democrats and nobody seems to
be budging I mean are these based on
sort of traditional core Republican type
values versus core democratic values or
where is the divide here I'm not sure
where it is it's a I mean partly it
might be just because of our politics
generally as I said but I continually
believe that when it comes to broadband
there is no Republican affiliation or
Democratic affiliation to a particular
idea I met with the senator recently and
outside his door it had a poster of JFK
where it said let us not search for the
Republican answer let us not search for
the Democratic answer let us search for
the right answer and naive though it
might be I continue to believe that at
the end of the day Americans want better
faster cheaper Internet and the ideas
from the FCC that get us there
don't knowa partisan affiliation and so
that's like spirit with which I'm going
to continue to embrace this job so
should Congress step in and do something
I mean this issue has flip-flopped
a couple of times and and that is you
know creating uncertainty in the market
I would imagine so yeah I mean I think
ultimately that's the best long-term
solution a part of the problem we've
seen over the last seven
years is that the agency increasingly is
trying to shoehorn the marketplace of
2017 or 2015 or 2010 into this round
hole of 1934 legal frameworks or 1986
and ultimately I think it would be great
for elected officials on a bipartisan
basis to just tell us what you want the
roads the rules of the digital road to
be that those are the decisions I think
that ultimately stand the test of time
and gain public support and I'm
convinced that people acting in good
faith when they sit at the table could
be able to reach that kind of consensus
Republicans have introduced something
but Democrats are a little hesitant
they're saying you know this isn't the
time do you think we're going to get
bipartisan consensus
I hope so that's a decision that they
will have to make based on their own
political calculus but if I can be of
assistance in helping to forge that
consensus I stand willing and able to do
so because as I said ultimately the
internet is so important that it's
important I think for our elected
officials to codify some of these key
principles that we can move on to the
debates about how do we get more access
out there to unserved Americans I mean
those are the issues that I think the
FCC is squarely empowered to tackle and
I'm committed to tackling them if we can
okay well thank you so much for letting
us come in here and do this interview we
really appreciate the conversations
maggie has been great okay this is just
the beginning of the net neutrality
rewrite on May 18th PI's proposal will
be open for the public to comment he's
promised to have a new set of rules
finished by the end of the year but all
this could change if Congress decides to
push through its own set of rules I'm
