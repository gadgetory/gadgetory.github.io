here it is the diesel hatin country kind
of barely getting traction in its diesel
form why because we're kind of stupid
around here this is one of the best
executed diesel cars in the world let's
try the 2014 jetta sportwagen TDI with
the sunroof that's a model by the way
and check the tech
that seems to me almost everybody I run
into doesn't own a Jetta scoffs it a
Jetta they think it's kind of plain Jane
vanilla a pitiful little suburban wagon
I love these cards I find them to be
reserved austere a beautiful steady hand
on their design and I love station
wagons this is a sixth generation Jetta
which means that they kind of cheaped
out since the fifth generation they took
a complex rear suspension and made it a
cheaper beam construction the fancy one
stays in Europe they deleted leather
interior that's fine by me
and supposedly cheaped out the materials
around the dashboard and such as well
now inside they may have cheaper than
this interior but it still works for me
I think the materials are still quite
good the layout like the outside of the
car is austere it's good design it
doesn't appeal to everybody a lot of
folks look at it and say oh it looks
plain others look at it and say no it's
tasteful it's your call now an LCD head
unit is standard on this car navigation
within it is optional and ugly is
included at no extra cost this is my
least favorite head unit of any of the
cars that I like out there in the world
I find it ugly it's kind of not very
intuitive as well they've done a little
bit to kind of move things around to
make them a little more logical but they
don't take good advantage of the real
estate and I find that though the
response is good they've just got a lame
sort of a flat looking interface this
should just be a basic head unit without
LCD unless you have now all the sources
though are good to go from aux am/fm HD
radio satellite with a complimentary
three months now what's missing is USB
instead you have MMI there multimedia
interface or MDI they call it on
Volkswagens that means you can put
different pigtails on here which I think
could include a USB female but the
biggest problem is this it lives on this
short stiff cord inside this tight
little bit achill and for a modern iOS
device you got to use an adapter because
last time I checked they haven't done
the small connector that Apple uses now
the Lightning connector for this pigtail
which now means nothing fits in the
console your iOS device will always have
to live outside like that now luckily we
have the main transmission the base rig
which is a six-speed Mae
you will top two gears by the way or
overdrive part of how they get more mpg
out of this guy and with a diesel with
all that torque that's fine you can
actually go with two OverDrive's and do
everything else and your other taller
remaining four gears the other optional
gearbox on this is very interesting your
automatic is a direct shift gearbox a
dual clutch DSG there is no traditional
automatic in the lineup that's kind of
ambitious now I love the sunroof in this
car it's a trim level on the Jetta
SportWagen this is jetta sportwagen TDI
with sunroof this control here gives you
both the glass and the screen you rotate
to preset positions here all the way
open and you get this enormous hole in
the roof it's just this incredible
dramatic opening but I love the screen
here as well because it rolls completely
out of the way without a mid bar so you
get this whole open expanse and with the
top open like so and then you close this
screen up you have this very nice kind
of screened-in room if you will but I
don't think any other car I know of
offers ok TDI it means several things
it's a diesel with turbo charging and
direct injection direct injection via a
common rail technology which you can see
right here this was very revolutionary
in the diesel engine world for passenger
cars what happens is it's a very precise
engine as a result of all these
technologies and you get 140 horsepower
who cares
236 foot-pounds of torque that's the
nice number but it's been tuned
relatively toward efficiency so 0 to 60
is it kind of ok 10 seconds for this
3,300 pound car
the MPG resulting from that is 30 city
42 highway pretty good stuff unless you
get the automatic now you drop down to
29 city 39 highway still good but not
gonna blow anybody away the problem is
the automatics and this market need to
blow people away having to commit to a
manual to get full mpg out of this guy
is a bit problematic this engine of
course is a rock star for VW final in
the golf you find it in the B
you'll find the Audi a3 it's all over
the place for them so it's a well proven
voter don't have any ideas that it's
somehow New Age tech might not have a
future let's go right okay under way the
first thing I noticed is the torque is
really good low to mid range like 1200
to 3500 rpm is your sweet spot notice
you don't need to go much beyond that
and you really can't above 4000 there's
no point even though turbos do spread
the power around a little better it is a
definite different engine note you will
notice that yes it's not like a gas
engine and it doesn't reward those high
rpm run ups that a gas engine typically
does I've got this sneaking suspicion
that they've tuned out some of the
low-end torque in this current
powertrain for economy because it
doesn't quite have that giddy oomph that
I'm used to in the TDI power trains I've
driven in the last couple of years I'm
not quite sure why here with my finger
on it but there's something going on
where they've detuned some of the
low-end lobe for efficiency is my hunch
that said there's plenty to go around
nice taut suspension that's a VW thing
they can't help themselves there luckily
good visibility out the back and you can
see what I love about this roof that's a
beautiful piece of glass up there
especially in a car in a pretty modest
price point it's a luxury feel very nice
overall I don't know why I don't own one
of these I love wagons I love diesels I
just hate to buy new cars and new car
prices
okay let's price our little oil-burning
friend 28 for for a TDI Sportwagon with
the sunroom remember that's a model not
an option the nav model above this is
$800 more don't bother that head unit
scrap the DSG automatic model is $1100
more don't bother it scrubs off mpg
that's kind of why you buy this guy so
28 4 here it is now I really like this
car but I'm partial in some odd ways
that make me kind of a calming in
America I like diesels
I like station wagons and I also like
torque over horsepower a lot of folks
share that with me an issue to watch is
what the Chevy Cruze diesel will do to
this guy's market share we reviewed that
one recently and it offers up to 7 mpg
better on the highway plus an automatic
but no wagon</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
