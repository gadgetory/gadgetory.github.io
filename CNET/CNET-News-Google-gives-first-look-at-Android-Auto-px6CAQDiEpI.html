Android auto we've redesigned the
Android platform for automotive making
it easier and safer to use the connected
apps and services drivers want in the
car we looked at what people do with
their phones in the car today and these
things stood out to us navigation
communication music and other forms of
streaming media Android auto puts these
front and center so you don't have to go
hunting through a grid of icons to find
the apps that are most important to you
when you're in the car Android auto is
contextually aware to give you the right
information right when you need it and
most importantly Android auto is
completely voice enabled so that you can
keep your hands on the wheel and your
eyes on the road so to start Andy
connexes Android phone to the car and
the phone casts the Android auto
experience to the cars screen Andy can
now put his phone down and use the
familiar car controls steering wheel
buttons console dials and touch screens
to control Android auto it looks and
feels like it's part of the car but all
of the apps we see here are running on
andy's phone which means that the
experience gets better when Andy updates
his apps or gets a newer faster phone
this also means that andy has a
personalized experience that he can
bring with him into any compatible car
the first thing Andy sees is the
overview screen which shows personal and
contextually relevant destinations
reminders contacts and music from google
now and other arms one tap and he's
navigating or listening to his favorite
road trip mix and II want to play some
music
what
let's look for a second at play music it
has been adapted to have simple
glanceable controls for the car Andy has
access to all of his curated playlists
radio stations albums and artists and to
all the key features in google play
music he can also use voice or the
steering wheel controls to control the
music in the car keeping his hands on
the wheel fantastic of course Android
auto needs great maps and navigation so
let's show you google maps we all love
Google Maps because it's fast accurate
updated and it seems to know where
everything is in Android auto drivers
have access to all their favorite maps
features great local search personalized
suggestions live traffic and of course
turn-by-turn navigation and google maps
for android auto is even more powerful
because it is completely voice enabled
Andy wanting to take us for a drive how
late is the deyoung museum open today
the young museum is open from 930am to 5
15 p.m. on wednesday oh good i can go
there navigate there
navigating to the young museum head
toward fourth street northeast on
ministry in 600 feet use any lane to
turn right onto 4th Street so Andy was
able to start navigation without ever
entering an address or taking his hands
off the steering wheel during navigation
instructions are spoken as you heard and
displayed on the screen and a material
car that floats above the map right so
that's music and navigation what's next
let's show you voice enabled messaging
hmm new message from Hiroshi lock heimer
here it is Andy are we there yet
as you can see incoming messages show up
as heads up notifications so Andy can
still see the upcoming turn in maps when
he's ready he can just use the steering
wheel voice button to reply reply what's
the message I have no wheels here's your
message to hiroshi lock heimer i have no
wheels do you want to send it sure
sending message so we're really excited
about Android auto and we think we've
found that better way but I know what
you're all thinking when does the rubber
actually meet the road well we're happy
to say that you won't have to wait long
the Android auto SDK will be published
soon and the Android auto experience
will be available to users with the
public el release later this year and
the excitement in the auto industry has
really been growing today we're happy to
announce that over 40 new partners have
joined the open automotive alliance
and over 25 car brands have signed up to
ship Android auto in the near future
what's more the first cars with Android
auto will be rolling off dealer lots
before the end of this year so that's
just a peek at Android auto</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
