outside to do some sketching with the
brand-new surface pro from Microsoft oh
wait that's actually the old surface pro
4 from 2015 this is the new surface pro
no number just surface pro and yes it
looks almost exactly identical to the
pro 4 look closely you'll see a few
subtle differences it's a hair lighter
these vents are gone because the new
surface Pro's fanless and the keyboard
cover is now available covered in this
fabric stuff same as on the new surface
laptop and before you ask yes you still
have to buy the coverage separately and
the fabric covered version is even more
expensive you want the new surface pen
well that now costs extra - one of the
reasons this new surface Pro looks so
similar to the older model is because
it's still the gold standard of Windows
Hybrid it's got a great high-resolution
screen a stylus that can compete with
Apple's iPad pro pencil a kickstand that
dips down even deeper and assuming you
shelled out for it a clip-on keyboard
cover that's still the best I've ever
used
even though the design is a couple of
years old inside we've got new Intel
processors which gives you better
performance and in our test better
battery life which is frankly the most
important thing in a tote around tablet
like this this is one of the few Windows
tablets that can really stand in for a
laptop with one exception it still
doesn't actually fit great on your you
know lap although Microsoft now makes an
actual surface laptop if you want to go
that way
