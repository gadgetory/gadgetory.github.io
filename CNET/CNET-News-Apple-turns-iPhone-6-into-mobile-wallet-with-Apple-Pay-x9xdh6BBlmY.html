process and we call it Apple pay
and I'd like to show you just how fast
and just how easy it is okay your total
is 20 370 that's that
maybe would you like to see it one more
time just in case you may have blinked
and missed it here it is that is Apple
pay and to tell you more about it I'd
like to invite Eddy Cue to the stage
Eddy thanks Sam it's great to be here
this morning now Apple pay is built into
every iPhone 6 and 6-plus
and we've got a groundbreaking NFC radio
antenna built across the top now NFC is
the standard for all contactless
payments now you also have the
convenience and security of touch ID and
we've got a new chip called the secure
element and it's built into every iPhone
6 and it stores all of your payment
information encrypted and securely you
can also see all of your credit cards on
passbook now Apple pay is easy it's
secure and it's private let's get
started with how easy it is now we have
hundreds of millions of credit cards and
debit cards from customers in their
iTunes store accounts when they get a
new iPhone 6 they can just say use the
card on file but it's also easy to add a
new card you use your iPhone iSight
camera we take a picture of the card
gather all the information go to your
bank and verify that that's your card
and we add it right to passbook and now
with just a touch you've paid it's that
fast it's that easy and we've also
integrated security throughout both the
hardware and software in a way that only
Apple can and each time you pay we use a
one-time payment number along with a
dynamic security code so you no longer
have the static code in the back of your
plastic card and if your iPhone is lost
or stolen you can use Find My iPhone and
suspend all of the payments from that
device Apple pay it comes with every
iPhone 6 and 6-plus
we're launching in the US starting next
month it'll be available as a free up
date to iOS 8 and we're working hard to
bring Apple pay to even more countries
and that's Apple pay thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
