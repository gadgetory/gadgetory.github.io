programs that allow customers to
rollover unused data from one month to
the next this is great news but not
everyone is eligible to take advantage
of this
t-mobile's data stash program is only
available to simple choice customers
with a plan of three gigabytes or more
of 4g LTE data AT&amp;amp;T z' rollover program
looks more appealing initially because
there's no minimum amount of data
required you simply need an AT&amp;amp;T Mobile
share value plan which range from as
little as 300 megabytes a month all the
way to a hundred gigs now Before we jump
right in it's always smart to read the
fine print t-mobile data stash program
isn't available for the $50 month one
gigabyte simple choice plan or the
carrier's cheaper simple starter plans
data stash customers will also get 10
gigabytes of free data however rollover
won't actually begin until the entire 10
gigabytes is used up and while there is
no limit to how much data you can
collect the data will expire after one
year as for AT&amp;amp;T data is only good for a
single billing cycle meaning leftover
data from January can be used in
February but not March you would also
expect the data that is being rolled
over would be consumed first before any
new data but that's not the case as
noted on 18 T's website rollover data is
always consumed last after your other
data allowances so let's break it down
for both carriers if you have five gigs
of data each month and use only two in
January both t-mobile and AT&amp;amp;T customers
would add the remaining three gigs they
didn't use in January to their normal
five gig plan giving them a total of
eight gigs of data use in February not
too bad right well this is where the
plans differ as an AT&amp;amp;T subscriber if
you were to use only four gigs in
February of the 8th you stored up only
one gig would roll over to March which
when you add that to your normal five
gig plan will give you a total of six
gigabytes of data for the month because
the three gigs of data you carried over
from January wasn't used in February it
simply disappears from your account
leaving you with that one extra gig of
data for March as a t-mobile subscriber
if you were to use only four gigs in
February of the eight
having your data stash you would be left
with four gigs of data all of which
would roll over to March giving you a
total of nine gigs of data both of these
rollover plans are good for consumers
but I personally favor t-mobile because
they are giving you that extra 10
gigabytes of data for free your data
stash also won't expire for an entire
year
whereas on AT&amp;amp;T your extra data is only
carried over for the next month I also
like that t-mobile doesn't charge
overages and instead will reduce your
data speeds if you exceed your usage
unlike AT&amp;amp;T either way it's a win-win
and a big step forward for the wireless
