and we're here to face off another
contender for king of the smartphone
ring
it's the heavyweight prizefight you've
been waiting for
between the Motorola Droid and Apple's
iPhone 3GS Motorola and Verizon have
been blitzing Apple and AT&amp;amp;T and there's
no love lost between these phones so
we're bringing in the heavy hitters to
judge this fight senior editor Kent
German senior editor Vani cha and myself
we'll do the honors
now we'll take all three judges scores
and average them out to the nearest
tenth each round the final prize five
score will be an average of all rounds
using the same decimal system who's
bringing home the bacon first round in
Section eight Motorola's droid
touchscreen is the highest resin
I'm seen and all of us agree it's a
thing of beauty it's a thin form factor
considering it has a keyboard but a
drawback is its blocky design and that
fat lip on the bottom not a fan the
iPhone 3GS still holds its place as the
sleekest and cleanest device on the
planet with its rounded corners is this
thing even debatable the iPhone sexy is
timeless with the perfect five and the
droid gets a 4.3 next round is
navigation the Droid is bringing a
responsive touchscreen a navigation pad
and a physical keypad now even if the
keys are described as flat and slippery
by Kent Bonnie says you'll get used to
them the Android OS 2.0 has a minimal
learning curve and it's a lot more
customizable plus I love the
notifications pull down no one can deny
the iPhone is still the easiest and most
elegant OS to use navigation is smooth
as butter pinchy may be subtle but it's
a feature you'll miss on the Droid and
there's no other phone that my
three-year-old niece and I can both use
the iPhone gets the edge here with
another perfect 5 but the joint isn't
too far off with a 4.7 so after
averaging two rounds the iPhone rocks a
perfect score and the Droid trails by
half the point next round the secret
both bones are packed with core features
like 3G Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth so what
really stands out the Droid brings it's
faster flavor of 3G EVDO Rev a it's a
multitasker and there's more
customizations with the Android OS
native exchange support with a unified
mailbox for multiple accounts
turn-by-turn directions in Google Maps
with a voice search that left me
impressed
Academy of Sciences plus a user
replaceable battery and their tethering
feature will be available before the
iPhones now that's a whole bunch but the
iPhone is no chump either the App Store
is lightyears ahead of the Droid and it
enhances the iPhone exponentially
exchange support is here cut copy and
paste is better implemented and
turn-by-turn Google Maps are said to be
coming soon but having the ability to
roam the world on GSM networks is a huge
benefit this one was close but the Droid
just edges out the iPhone with a perfect
score in round 3 and the iPhone gets a
4.7 next round is web browsing to
multimedia the droids browser is very
good with its thumbnail bookmarks but
overall it's still a step below sorry
it has a better 5 megapixel camera with
flash the Amazon Marketplace is solid
and its media player is pretty basic but
capable now syncing your media to the
device is a clunky drag-and-drop
experience plus standard mpeg-4 files
that played flawlessly on the iPhone
chugs and had audio sync issues on the
Droid Safari is still the best mobile
browser that separates it from any
smartphone ESPN and CNN mobile sites
display streaming media on the iPhone
but they did it on the Droid multimedia
on the iPhone is unmatched with the top
notch video player and video quality
that still makes to say wow even though
you're locked into iTunes the syncing
process is seamless with a huge library
of content to access now the judges all
agree in this round the iPhone lands
another five and the Droid gets a
respectable four so after four rounds
the iPhone leaves by four tenths of a
point but this my friends is far from
over
the final round that decides at all it's
all quality and performance the droid is
on Verizon and it's called quality
delivers with a clear signal on both
sides of the call speakerphone sounded
great - and it's 3G is faster and more
reliable even outside of San Francisco
and it delivers longer battery life for
calls the iPhones call quality on AT&amp;amp;T
isn't horrible but it's not great either
there's more background noise and we all
know about those drop calls its 3G has
improved in some areas but Verizon still
performs better battery life has
improved from previous phones but the
big killer for me I dialed the iPhone
from my droid side-by-side and the
iPhone didn't even ring yeah the droid
lands the biggest blow this prize fight
in the final round with a perfect 5 and
the iPhone gets a three point three so
let's average out all five rounds and in
a battle where the iPhone was sitting
pretty the Droid fought back in a final
round
that would make Rocky Balboa proud
leaving us tied at four point six points
a piece now that is what I call a fight
so you know we can't walk away like this
and we're gonna have to go to a
tiebreaker and that's the number of
rounds won so check out the breakdown
people but after a truly epic battle the
iPhone wins the tiebreaker
three rounds to two and is your prize
buy it winner these are two really
impressive phones and there's no losers
here but this prize fight really shows
us that the Droid excels as a phone and
the iPhone 3GS stands out as a
multimedia phone which phone ends up in
your pocket is up to you
i'm brian tom thanks for watching and
we'll catch you guys next time on
another epic prizefight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
