documents or items like your passport or
spare keys you can actually have Google
home remember where you put them and
then when you need to find them again
just ask Google here's how it works
for now this feature is actually
specific to Google home and not
available on other Google assistant
compatible devices and it works best
with remembering something about
specific items such as where you put
them or what they are some examples of
what you could say are ok Google
remember that I put my passport in the
bottom drawer of my cabinet or ok Google
remember that Alex has my wallet
ok I'll remember that you said remember
that alex has my wallet you can even use
it to remember a quick password that you
made and say something like ok Google
remember my password is money
ok I'll remember that you said remember
that my password is money
after you've told Google home to
remember a few things you can recall
that information a couple of different
ways you can say something like ok
Google where is my passport or ok Google
what did I tell you about my wallet
here's what you've told me January 25th
2017 remember that I put my passport in
the bottom drawer of my filing cabinet
sometimes the exact phrasing can be a
little tricky especially if you don't
remember what you called something or
what you've told Google to remember you
might have to play around what the
wording or phrasing but if you want to
hear all of the things you've told
Google home to remember you're gonna say
ok Google what did I tell you to
remember and it will list all of the
things that you've ever told it to
remember here's what you asked me to
remember recently January 25th 2017
remember that my password is money
January 25th 2017 remember that I called
mom today January 25th 2017 remember
that my spare key to the truck is
hitting outside of course storing
sensitive information like this on a
device like Google home which doesn't
have very many if any security features
it is a bit of a risk and if you want to
remove something you've told Google home
to remember it's pretty simple just say
ok Google forget what I told you about
my passport ok I won't mention it again
if you don't sadly you'll have to do
this for each individual item you've
told Google to remember as there's no
clear all function and you actually
can't manage this in the Google home app
as of right now for more on Google home
