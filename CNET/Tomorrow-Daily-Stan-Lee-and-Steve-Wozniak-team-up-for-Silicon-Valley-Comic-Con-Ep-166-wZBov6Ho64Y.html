robot that can make you a latte and a
brand new comic convention that may be
better than every other comic convention
it's tomorrow daily greetings citizen to
the internet and welcome to tomorrow
daily the best geek talk show in the
known universe I'm Ashley sceva joining
me as always kale anonymous how you
doing today Ashley I'm good I'm really
good like I like your hair today thank
you that's really nice thank God so I
can't wait to tell you about this
convention I know you love convention I
got back from wine I love a good con so
let's hit those stories you didn't mean
an actual con right I hate cons what
like criminals I like a good long con
like with your friends or you're playing
a joke on him over a long period that's
good good of a long con but tell me
about this image so this convention
seemingly came out of nowhere this is
called Silicon Valley comic-con now why
is it called Silicon Valley comic-con
you may ask well that's because state
none other than steve wozniak is
involved in creating this comic con he
actually he teamed up with a little old
man you may know my grandpa wouldn't
that be great Stanley David Stanley and
he's creating a brand new comic book
convention now why would we report on
that well that's because because Steve
is involved he wants to make it not only
comic convention but also a tech
convention I love so it's the best of
both nerdy worlds would you maybe say
you didn't see this coming that's that's
real that's a real low blow that's a
real low blow um but anyway so it's so
yeah so this is this sounds really
really knows awesome i want to go yeah
this sounds fantastic obviously there's
not a whole lot that is announced about
it yet they want celebrities to show up
they want big studios and big you know
comic book company yeah i mean
comic-con's getting is getting huge yeah
tech companies cool South by Southwest
Interactive you were just there I was
just and that's kind of a big kind of me
and tech convention but this is like
even more in I mean it's in Sullivan
Valley so yeah it's real close I mean
look California I think we have enough
conventions but this one I'm having a
tech and aunt comic book conventions
pretty cool so if you want to go to it
you want to go to Silicon Valley
comic-con it is going to be a next year
so don't you have picked you an see it's
March 19th through 20th uh and it's 2016
March 19th 20th 2016 so we can look
forward to that yes we can look forward
to that uh some of us also I'm want to
go i heard you or did you already bought
tickets not already registered as a
media person i'm like i have to i must
go okay because obviously we we like to
put all those things together to we like
to put together geek pop culture and
technology and emerging technology and
movies and music and games and I someone
dressed as I'll try that and then actual
Ultron yeah they're in the same place
would be the best thing ever no to your
point I mean where do comic conventions
go now it seems like we've seen
everything so this is kind of like a
nice addition to that and you always
talk about how you know really
technology is bleeding into everything
we do so now it's you know it's it's a
huge part of film and TV and everything
else that we enjoy yeah people they're
creating a are are basically making it
look like Iron Man so I mean everything
yeah and you we always report on stories
where you get the idea you get yeah it's
this show speaking of God it's this it's
our convention exactly this is basically
if we could put together convention this
is what we would do so now we're gonna
put it to you the viewer yeah uh TD
hashtag TD cons as our hashtag of the
day Tina come teeny cons and we want to
know that if you if you can make a
convention of anything in the world
anything that you really like or you
think deserves a convention that maybe
doesn't have one what would it be and
where would you have it kale Khan which
is everything I know I would really like
a fallout con oh oh my god and then you
have to pay for all your souvenirs and
bottle caps and then at the concession
stand they have rad Roach meet neither
those sounds terrible it sounds and
everyone smells gross and they end ND
and the Lancer
work on that's a regular cons nice yeah
fair enough but uh yeah I think that'd
be fun but I think they have those in
the desert already they're just kind of
like post-apocalyptic con so I'm shocked
as to why they don't have a Nintendo con
where's Nick just yours they have great
ideas Nintendo good Minecon myopic on
why why not intend oak on that would be
different I would go mine up mario
karting yeah yeah Oh Carson you could
have like Metroid stuff I mean you could
have so many things Legend of Zelda I
mean God they have so many great eye
peas why not have a conference I think
you're you're really onto something
there cuz then you can have like super
smash brothers brawl competitions
perfect I'm better for site TTT con yeah
TD cons okay TD con DD cons yeah I'm
with an s okay I want to tell you about
these mini organs um you're gonna have
to you know to feel your way through
this one so I didn't know if you knew
this but did you know we can 3d print
miniature versions of organs I didn't
know that 3d print them so those are 3d
printed organs see the ones that are
twitching oh yeah those are hearts fill
their hearts little hearts and the dark
spot is a liver this is kind of crazy so
what you are seeing in this video is was
developed by team at the Wake Forest
Institute for regenerative medicine like
I said these are little hearts that you
can see beating they are actually
beating in a video on their liver
attached to it um so here's how they did
it they reprogrammed human skin cells
into heart cells what yeah okay so
reprogram program things you can and
then a 3d printer took those reform
cells and formed them into the exact
shape and size that Wake Forest
University all right and why okay so the
reason these things are development is
because there is a goal in the
scientific community amongst people who
work on this stuff to put an entire
mimicked human body onto a chip onto a
single chip whoa what yeah like what
like a microchip yeah they wanna get
potato chip not a potato okay microchip
pay for you to eat dipping they want to
make a small human body on a chip yeah
on a kid and the reasons are great it's
go insane it's a totally insane goal but
i love it because the thing is is it is
very much this sort of product of we
want to kind of get away from animal
test
and the testing bad but you can't also
really tests on humans because that also
bad so because reasons because reaction
reasons people could die people get
really sick if they get a medication
that their body reacts you so what they
want to do is in the future someday
maybe not next year maybe not in five
years but someday in the future you're
going to be able to have a tiny 3d
printed human body version of yourself
that mimics your human body and how all
of your organs react because they want
to still build out more little tiny
miniature organs that all link up
together and once they do that they can
test drugs chemicals different like
treatments they can test all that stuff
on a verte on a really tiny version of
your human body individually to see a if
it works and be if you know if there are
any adverse reactions and the other part
of it is is it they'll be able to test
if things are really harmful to human
body that are new okay so that's the
goal that is the most grandiose like it
was like science science fiction s
detect that we've talked about on the
show is just recreating human body it
totally totally makes sense it also
sounds like at some point when we add
the brain organ to the whole thing it's
gonna start becoming an issue I'll be
sentient we got it well it will start
it'll start becoming a sci-fi or quite
near thing yes and should we not be
testing on it why did you create a
little little Ashley don't don't test on
little Ashley but that's incredible I
that's that's such a great idea there's
something opens up so many possibilities
but it also is a little bit less of like
a clone thing cuz it's not a full person
it's just 3d printed sort of reprogram
cells so hopefully this will kind of
bridge the gap which is pretty
interesting um that's crazy yeah super
weird so yesterday you mentioned you
wanted a robot in your car to make you
coffee remember where that yeah yeah I
thought was that was my high concept
idea for what I wanted in a car was
something to serve me that well I hope
yes you don't have to bring it up I hope
you weren't hoping to patent that
because there is a robot actually making
a coffee autonomously which is pretty
cool this we discussed pr2 before this
is robot over at Cornell University but
now so they've been working on teaching
at verbal commands and now with a whole
huge like crowd-sourced wealth of
information they have taught this robot
or the
bot has taught itself how to use an
espresso machine it's never used before
to make a cup of coffee okay can make a
latte for you right and this is kind of
a big deal so we've seen stuff like this
before like the Test Kitchen that we saw
last week but this is totally autonomous
which makes it really interesting
because this autonomy is based on object
recognition skills so it lets the robot
figure out what steps it needs to
perform based on information that it had
previously so for example okay if we use
it in a human sense a good example is
you know what a toaster is kale you've
seen a toaster many different kinds of
toasters generally speaking they have a
little thing where you push down and
that pushes the bread into the toaster
oh yeah and then there's a dial that
light or dark that's the thing that
feels like this yes okay okay so if you
saw a bunch of toasters and had used
toasters if you got a new toaster in
front of you that you'd never use before
you still be able to figure it out yes
okay same mechanism same type of thing
here but because robots run on logic
they had to use this huge wealth of
information that people crowd sourced
and you can actually help crowd source
for this robot which is really cool you
can go over to Robo barista you the
latest Google Robo barista and Cornell
you'll find the website they catalogued
all kinds of objects for PR 2 so PR 2 is
able to go to this brand new espresso
machine it had never used before and
extrapolate data from that crowd sourced
wealth of information and say okay like
I've seen in many different kinds of
coffee makers or espresso machines this
is what I need to use first I need to
get hot water from here I need to do
this I need to do this and was able to
do make a cup of coffee a lot a
completely outside Oh versatile learning
I like that pretty interesting so they
they're really excited about it it's
part it's kind of a part of a bigger
project that Cornell is doing with like
robot a robot brain like a database
almost or a data bank but yeah they're
they're always looking for more people
to crowd source information from so feel
free to head over to robo barista and
check it out how did they crowdsource it
again was it videos I was a bunch of
stuff so you're like information
pictures it words like there's a whole
just huge well of information that they
were pulled from that people just gave
which is pretty awesome rode on so
that's what they're doing over at
Cornell which is pretty cool very cool
all right
we're going to take a quick break those
are our headlines will be right back it
is a wednesday we have an awesome mod
squad that is a little bit star
wars-themed pretty exciting i'm sure you
may or may not have seen this making the
rounds of the internet and we also have
your user feedback in our phone tog
refer the day so don't click away it's
tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show everybody we
are pretty excited about this particular
modification that we saw on the internet
it again has divorce has been making the
rounds at star wars-themed but this is
Mod Squad alright so do you know
somebody thought you actually made that
graphic that graphics yes they said they
wanted a mod squad where we explained
how you made that graphic oh yeah their
sound I made it through emailing our
graphics persons diva yeah having her
make it cuz she is the best um okay so
like we said you may have seen this on
the internet but I was really excited
because bb-8 is my new favorite Star
Wars thing ever especially droid I mean
I love me some r2d2 but I kind of love
bb-8 so traitor this guy i know i'm
totally a trader so this guy industrial
designer his name's christian poulsen
modded out a version 1 Sphero and made a
bb8 just put it together like the day
after celebration launched which is
pretty awesome yeah Star Wars fans man
there I mean this guy really sure we
made a little custom we made a little
custom PDA that's cool that's nice I
love it so he said it cost about a
hundred fifty bucks and materials
including the Sphero so the Sierra the
version 1 Sparrow is a little bit less
expensive than the I'm sure you find it
on ebay I kind of want one though I
totally want one on but I have good news
for you about that so what so he cut the
Sphero in half what but he so to make it
he cut the sphere in half he got around
all the circuitry and made sure he
didn't cut into any of that added a
magnet inside the sphere Oh to have to
be able to hold up the actual head of
the robot and then he fabricated the
head and put a magnet in there and then
that's how you're seeing it on the thing
so he posted how to overrun magazine so
if you want to go get the instructions
to make your own you can do that but I
have even better news sphero earlier
this week revealed that they were pretty
integral in helping build and design
bb-8 for the actual star wars franchise
and they said that they are going to be
selling them so if you go over to Spiros
website you can get you can put in your
email address and get on a mailing list
for buying an actual bb-8 like a
licensed fully licensed Star Wars BBA
later this year which i will be buying
for sure I need it how much I haven't
said yet they haven't said yet but yeah
it's uh even if it's let's say maybe
it's a hundred fifty bucks maybe it's a
little bit more than than a regular
Sphero if it's a hundred fifty bucks
I'll wait no I gotta have it right away
I need it and what if it makes noise see
here's the up okay that makes a little
noise people maybe eight like if it if
it makes the bb-8 noise like oh man I'm
so in yeah so in on this but he did this
guy did a really great job I'm so
impressive and the fact that i cobbled
it together in like a day I mean that's
pretty maybe I wonder if the this V Rho
1 will give us any insight into how the
actual one is run cuz like we haven't
seen how exactly they have because
there's also i was like lights in it
yeah as radical sort of being like I
mean it is a really incredible practical
effect I legitimately and the trailers
thought it was fake like I was like okay
they probably has something they see zhi
dao underneath it like they were
probably putting out wheels or something
nope yeah nope definitely not blowing my
mind yeah awesome okay cool yeah so
that's Mod Squad um and like I said
Sphero I guess is gonna be offering this
later this year pretty pretty great uh
so let's talk about what you guys had to
say about minis augmented vision
technology this is user feedback oh yeah
yeah yeah yeah okay she's like who yeah
well we forget I didn't see yesterday's
episode no you haven't seen it um so we
asked you guys yesterday to use the
hashtag TD cars to tell us what you
thought about minis augmented vision
technology which were those kind of
goggles that you could walk around and
then get in your car and have this
circle driving augmented reality super
cool driving and working on my own
reality searches Sam wrote in and said
why not integrate AR goggles to the
windshields and I thought that was a
really good question but I have an
answer go on too expensive no I mean
they want you to be able to also get out
and get walking directions of what they
are right and to be able to look at like
look at the poster and see if there's
tickets and all this stuff so I think
that they're hoping that the glad the
goggles or glasses will enable you to
use them not only in your car but also
outside of your car so I think that's
the reason why it wouldn't be integrated
into the windshield judges but there are
cars with augmented reality displays
like HUDs and stuff that they're working
on their gonna be integrated into your
windshield in the future yeah
cool ok so I'm so to answer your
question Fritz wrote in and said cars to
have a force field so it can't be hit
Plus car safety feature in demolition
man oh yeah the phone has a foam oh my
god yeah I love that was that would ruin
the car but yeah it's like it yeah
demolition man right on Simon Says died
I love it and Rick wrote in and said
it's 2015 and all I want is a flying car
maybe a DeLorean and maybe with a flux
capacitor it is the right year for that
is the right here that's true well yeah
yeah well time Oh into that I mean it
the right year for that while it was
technically infinitive or maybe maybe
2015 Doc Brown went back in time and
gave like he invented it went back in
time and told 1985 Doc Brown what the
plan with you the Terminator franchise
you're gonna retcon the actual story I'm
not right kind oh maybe that happened we
don't know just kidding ya see if I
don't we don't know the full story we
like some shady character we didn't see
that yeah uh Neal Rodin said only one
answer and then posted this picture what
is a core submarine can you can you can
you hear it oh yeah it's it's double
users oh wait here let me yell it's a
car submarine and then it I think it's a
car submarine yes yeah yeah I mean most
of the most of the earth is water so
there you go a true Gregory wrote in
said I can't tell you how many times I
was driving and wish the seat would turn
into a toilet / bday love the show
that's a crappy idea file that please
file it uh pin wrote in our friend pin
our genius i Ken he's wait a million 60
more than me you not Logan but
definitely smarter than us and Genghis
combined pin rodents and hello Ashley
and kill I want the functionality of the
mini AR goggles but without the goggles
here's how I do it build the cars
unibody with paper-thin stronger than
steel graphene carbon nanotubes take
advantage of the materials room
temperature super conductive properties
and implement the unibody as a massive
three-layer circuit board the outside
layers fabricated fabricated to be a
massive array of light field sensors
like those in Litro cameras the inside
of the car layer is a massive
light field emitters displaying what was
captured by the outer layer the layer in
between the outside and inside layers
that are the inner connection between
the sensors and the emitter the onions
real estate in the between layer is a
huge super conductive capacitor battery
for powering the vehicle it will be
possible as soon as we figure out how to
mass produce graphene and carbon
nanotube material about five years enjoy
the show pin nicely done man I mean pin
first of all you probably live in a
volcano and you're a supervillain or
you're going to change holy start your
are Tony Stark so I'm doing run here in
this Tony Stark it is just a reminder
that we are not we are dummies um so I
thought that was great and then really
briefly just right before we don't have
a graphic for it but right before I came
came up to do the show we got one that
said from Brad he said the ability for
my car to refused to allow my wife to
drive it even if she has the keys listen
Brad well you know listen some people
are terrible drivers not to say that
women are because I'm a very good driver
and my husband that's a great um but
yeah i mean i would say that there are
some times where I don't want my husband
driving my car so like would you say
there are times we were like maybe I
don't want you to drive my car I mean I
guess up I'm just pretending I wouldn't
eject I would I would cover my butt with
this one and be like what I turn off so
that if they were drunk they couldn't
drive okay get her go cough he fixed it
for days right yeah but I mean like I
guess you just enter in a pin code
you're gonna get into fights dude you
won't be in the doc you have if this
ability exist you're getting into fights
yeah that's gonna be serious you're
there so feeling I like fights but I
don't like those types of fights no he
likes fist fights um alright so that was
your user feedback and of course our
very last piece of user feedback as
