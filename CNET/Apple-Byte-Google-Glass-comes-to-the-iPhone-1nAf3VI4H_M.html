welcome to the Apple buy for everything
inside the world of Apple let's get to
the show in with 2013 winding down Apple
was pushing it until the very end but
the new Mac Pro's will finally be
available to order starting Thursday
December the 19th with the entry-level
price for this powerhouse starting at
two thousand nine hundred and ninety
nine dollars there's different
configurations starting from four cores
to six cores to eight and as high as 12
core Intel Xeon processor configurations
running at a turbo boost speeds of up to
3.9 gigahertz with dual GPUs now Apple
continues to tout its being assembled in
the US and these are amazing looking
machines with the power to Boston that
is the last product launch for Apple
rounding out 2013 now Google glass is
coming to iOS this isn't a joke it's
coming really soon the big googs
released their own my glass companion
app for the iPhone recently the app
allows you to set up glass connect to
Wi-Fi networks install apps and mirror
content from glass to the iPhones
display it was then shortly taken down
from the store after it released Google
confirmed it made a mistake and spilled
the beans a little too soon but it will
be back up shortly now the app is free
and Google glass is $1,500 so do it
alright Apple has published their best
of 2013 page on iTunes featuring top
movies music apps podcasts and more the
app of the year was duolingo that helps
you learn a new language with clever
minigames and the game of the year was
ridiculous fishing really like I thought
ninja fishing was way cooler and
ridiculous basically copied them and
others just like Apple coffee actually
it's really cool now I reached out to
Apple because they clearly made an error
with their best classic podcast winner
so check this out I submitted a change
that they're working on right now all
right let's hit the quick bites Apple
released OS 10 mavericks 10.9 point 1
which improves support for gmail in OS
10 mail fixes an issue that prevented
voiceover from speaking sentences that
had emojis in them and a few other fixes
also at Vega is an abling iBook gifting
on iOS and OS 10 in time for the
holidays previously you could only give
someone credit and not give them a
specific book like Fifty Shades of Grey
now I've never read it but I already
don't like the title because I don't
think there's that many different types
of grey it's not true
and remember the pop dongle that popcorn
little add-on we told you about last
week
well that stupid thing ended up selling
for three hundred and fifteen bucks and
beat out my bid of 300 that's ridiculous
now they put up another one on eBay
that's around $100 right now so yeah
happy bidding and with the holidays
being a time for family Apple's released
this new TV ad called
misunderstood about a teen who is always
on his phone constantly here just take a
look
but then what he's been doing the whole
time is making a video for his family
with his phone and it gets emotional
merry little Christmas let your heart be
like it is he's just like huh oh so
touching okay everybody that's gonna do
it for this week's show we're going on a
break for the holidays and then we'll be
at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las
Vegas so we'll return in mid-january
with more Apple bite because come on
we're not leaving you now during that
time I'll be doing some giveaways so you
guys can follow me on Twitter at Brian
Tong and you'll have a chance to get
some really cool stuff but um you know
that during that time oh okay thanks for
watching yo Merry Christmas in it
Happy New Year and uh we'll see you guys
next year for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
