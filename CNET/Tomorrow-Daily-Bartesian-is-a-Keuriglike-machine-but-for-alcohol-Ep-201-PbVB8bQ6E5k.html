could make you money in the future a
really awesome little tiny glider that
might make its way to Mars and a little
friend for you to help you make mixed
drinks and it's not a little person oh
that sounds delightful sir our daily
greetings citizens to the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley scale economies always kill
anonymous can you imagine a little a
lilliputian that like makes the polly
pocket about it come on Polly Pocket
there Polly Pockets art like real you
know what you mean they're not real
they're real in my heart they're really
my god Polly Pockets in your heart they
fit look at those headlines you know
I've done that conversation like I made
a big mistake i'm like yeah so this
conversations get weird I just never rub
people in real life now and let's hit
those hub lines we just I think you guys
can also start doing that if you film it
and you send it to us I'll totally put
it on the show if you're in the middle
of an awkward conversation gets weird
and you just say let's have those
headlines of run away I'll put it on the
show okay let's talk about planes on
bars this is really really cool so a
couple years ago there were some
engineering interns at NASA and they
even though they were just interns
created an idea that may actually make
it to Mars at some point in the next 10
years which is pretty rad so they have
an idea for an aircraft that would fly
over the top of the surface of the
planet and would take really high res
pictures so this is called the brand the
brand Estelle em craft hopefully Prandtl
it's really ridiculously difficult to
pronounce pra and dt l M so this is the
M version of the craft it's a prototype
based on Addie model that was an RC
glider designed by the students a few
years ago when they were interns so this
prototype is going to launch later this
year it's going to go it's going to hit
the sky from a high-altitude balloon
that'll be about 10,000 feet up which is
similar to Mars's atmosphere so that's
why they have to take it up so high a
mirror and this is some of the pictures
of that glider and at some point they
the goal is they want to figure out how
to give this this really awesome looking
blighter foldable wings so that they can
pack it up into a little tiny CubeSat
which is those little cube satellites
and then attach
to a future Mars rover and send it like
basically it would kind of hitch a ride
with a Mars rover and head over to Mars
and then and then unpack itself and
start flying around which is pretty cool
but the glider the glider design allows
it to take off and land without any it
doesn't need like a runway it doesn't
need like you can actually do a lot more
with this glider idea than you can with
a traditional sort of airplane model but
it's pretty cool and I love that interns
designed to this and NASA seems pretty
keen on it which is pretty cool they
hope that they can get this thing to
Mars by 2024 they were saying she's 20
22 24 24 but that's only that's less
than 10 years away so which is which is
still pretty great and they're building
you know I'm sure the next round of of
Rovers and other things that are gonna
be heading to Mars so that takes time
and so hopefully this will be one of the
one of the next things will kind of see
hit up hit up Mars which is pretty cool
where do the pictures go who gets the
pictures at NASA so it would be a nasa
project and then it they would send the
picture right kind of like you know
hubble you can go to NASA's website and
look at these like amazing high-res
images the Hubble telescope is taking I
I would imagine be able to do the same
thing for this but it's pretty awesome
and I really like that it came from a
bunch of interns so we're just like you
know what want to make a glider and go
to Mars yeah get it together NASA kids
are doing it for you oh cool i like that
i'd love to see some high res photos of
Mars like we all would yeah and I think
NASA really wants it for you know to
have a fully high-res mapped image of
the entire planet which obviously would
be very very helpful cool yeah so what's
this little bartender if you're like me
you like to party at home alone and you
suck at making mixture it oh me too that
makes two of us super sad but anyway so
there is an answer for those of you that
have that same exact issue this is the
bart ezinne now you've heard of the
Keurig where you just kind of pop in a
little a little tiny thing in there and
it makes your coffee for you just hit a
button and it makes your coffee I have
one we'll check this out this one's for
your alcohol and you can make mixed
drinks or make margaritas there's a yeah
there's a whole bunch of you know like
Cosmopolitan's and stuff like that
basically what you do is you pop in a
cartridge and then you add the type of
alcohol you like so it's like vodka rum
tequila gin and hit a button and boom
you get your
alcohol what's great what's great is you
can also choose the strike watch how
funny this guy is he's putting the
strength of its intent it's a really
funny it's a really funny video but this
is a Kickstarter so it's not exactly out
yet they want a hundred thousand dollars
this looks like nice things they have
just under 90 thousand dollars so you
have two weeks to back it if you do that
if you do the early bird it's too late
it's sold out so you'll have to pay
three hundred dollars for the bart easy
and it delivers in april of next year
but yeah it's pretty cool i I like it
you know I like this idea it's pretty
neat so show three hundred dollars and
you can just have your mixed drinks you
can invite your friends over and they
can probably abuse the thing yeah
probably but I like that you can change
the alcohol so there you go museum it
looks like a science project on the
sides where it has like the tequila like
it has the four different like reservoir
reservoirs for tequila and rum and vodka
gin like that's kind of crazy and I but
I I mean it makes a lot of sense like
you would say like if you're making your
Keurig and you're like man I wish I have
this for like bartend like at night when
people come over because I know it like
as a kind of sideways example like sort
of similar example might when my family
comes over for Christmas everybody wants
something different like I've got
cousins who want hot chocolate and I
want you know my grandparents want decaf
like they don't want caffeinated coffee
and my parents want like flavored coffee
and then I have chai tea and it's so
many different things it's real easy to
use a Keurig because then you just pop
in the little you know popping a little
thing you put in whatever coffee you
want or whatever and then it makes it
for you as a single thing so I have a
lot of friends were like that with
alcohol to we're like one likes martinis
the other one likes this you ever like
this so this is pretty pretty
interesting yeah I like it very cool not
terribly expensive to our tag of the day
TD make me know this do you got this
okay mikami so dead idiot make me so I'm
what household this is for you what
household appliance would you create and
what would you do what would you do or
make what would it do or make for you so
what household appliance would you
create and what would it do or make for
you I want that I want that pizza making
machine from Back to the Future 2 they
open up a little tiny packet I don't
have you guys remember they open up a
little tiny packet and they put it in
this little machine they close the thing
hit the button and then dings and they
open it up and instantly the pizzas like
the size of a full pizza that sounds
pretty good I would want a robot that
cracked and opened up my crab legs like
king crab legs just thrown wide legs you
are rich yeah you want a robot taking
you with your crab look yes you throw in
the crab legs and it breaks it perfectly
for you you don't have to get all messy
and stuff and then like all of a sudden
there's just like a little a little bowl
at the bottom and it just drops out
you're perfectly shaped crab fresh crab
and you just eat it you don't have to
deal with all the legs and crack and all
that stuff no give me a robot to do that
for me that's super first world problem
it is for it listen okay okay dehydrated
pizza like I would like dehydrated pizza
back to the future technology that's
what I'm saying well it was romantic
grab cracking robot isn't in Back to the
Future just not depicted on screen who's
to say that's true your fan fiction is
completely on point it could be accurate
listen I'm gonna call Robert Zemeckis
we're gonna get this all we're gonna
piss all hammered out and he's gonna
officially announced that there was in
fact a robot that was made just for
cracking crab legs in back to the future
we just didn't see it on screen yo you
got to stop calling Robert Zemeckis he's
got stuff to do he does seem a little
bit busy he keeps telling me like he's
washing his hair all the time and I'm
just I don't think that's true but can I
tell you about a lamp that might make
you some money yeah so you can afford
you're dehydrated pizza maker you can
invent it yes pretty good okay so I kind
of I I love this idea so much and I hope
it happens because it seems really cool
this is called the aspirational lamp and
the idea behind this lamp it's an AI
controlled lamp with its own agenda it
has an agenda you you put it on your
desk and it has a solar panel on it and
it also has a battery pack and when the
light comes on in the morning like let's
say Sun comes up it will collect energy
so not only is the lamp you know
obviously usable as lamp but over the
course of the day when you're not using
the lamp it's collecting energy and the
idea is this is just a concept thus far
but the idea is that it would store that
energy and
sell it back to the grid for a for a
small amount of money or however much
money that it could get you and then it
would automatically invest that small
amount of money in the stock market okay
wait there's more kill but wait there's
more so it would earn enough money over
time to pay for its own repairs after
parts and on top of that it would if it
breaks or you want you just decide like
I'm done with this lamp you would to chi
e mail the company and be like hey it
broke or whatever and then it would just
they would cut you a check for whatever
the balance the lamp had available to it
like whatever that was it would just cut
you a check so yeah that's the idea
behind this lamp is that someday it's
again this is a speculative scenario
apparently it's very complex to actually
sell energy back to the grid it's a
thing that's that is an existing thing
you can do but it's not really easy to
do in a way that a simple lamp could do
it but the idea is that it would yeah I
see checking stock prices and it would
be like oh I'm going to invest in this
stock or whatever like I'm gonna sell my
stocks or it would buy and sell stocks
and it would make you money so um yeah
this lamp has his own agenda so there
you go a lamp that makes money by
selling energy to the grid and then
invest that money in the stock market
for you without you having to do
anything totally speculative not coming
to market not even not even a working
prototype just an idea oh but I love it
hi was the guy that came up with it no
he drinks he had too many parties oh my
god but first of all this is a like I
love this idea i love it but I love the
idea that you go bankrupt because your
light is right no it's only what the
height makes I know I know but in my
mind it's so deep down you're big it's
just like people with gambling problems
they start going to your ATM start
pulling out your life savings fun and
then one day you show up and your turn
your life but it won't turn on it's like
I'm sorry I spent everything like
mobsters show up at your door and break
your lamps legs take your lamps legs
perfect this is super cool so how do you
get it it's it's completely speculative
concept design apparent like I said
apparently it's very difficult to
actually sell energy back to the grid at
this time so something like this AI
controlled lamp can't do
it now but again like speculative I love
that kind of stuff because it could
happen and in five years this could be a
very real reality and we could have we
could have furniture that collects
energy for us and sells it back to the
grid and then invest it for us which is
kind of insane but I but I really love
the idea it's just so crazy that it
might work it's one of those things
where I saw it and I'm like this is
absolutely bonkers but I feel like maybe
someday it could work maybe pretty good
idea i love it that's cool still I love
it all right guys we're going to take a
quick break we're going to be right back
since I was not here yesterday since we
were all not here yesterday we're going
to do new releases so that you know what
you can spend your money on and of
course we have your user feedback from
way back last week on Thursday and an
hour photogra for the day so if look
away it's tomorrow daily
look closer all right guys it is Tuesday
just kidding it's Wednesday I always
want to say it's Tuesday because that's
when we usually do this segment but I
was sick yesterday so we did not have a
show so it's Tuesday let's talk about
new releases well first up we have a
movie that I am actually not hearing
great things about but is it paul Blart
3 uh coming soon to a theater near you
but not this weekend it's Terminator
Genisys um man i gotta say like
terminator genisys i'm a little
concerned because i'm hearing
not-so-great things in fact I think our
reviewer on cnet said something along
the lines of like Terminator Genisys
doesn't know when to stop even when it's
really bad for it or something like that
is just really i'm actually going to see
this tonight are you yeah eight o'clock
what do you what do you think your it
you don't like it well I'm a huge
Terminator fan and I have that you know
yeah it's like it's like a really bad
relationship that I have and like I
can't like I can't get I can't get away
give her up like head that's that's
that's my relationship with Terminator
it's dragged me through this mud so many
times the other reviews that I've said
and this will help you gauge it is that
it goes Terminator 2 is the best
Terminator one then Terminator 3 and
then this one what about some nice
salvation and then salvation so look
this is better than salvation but it's
not the worst Terminator movie ever made
so you have that going for ya what
people are saying that it also Oh mashas
a lot of the past terminators a lot
which is cool but also they're saying
it's really cheap and and not I say it's
like they're not constructing a story
they're just like banking on answer
Belgium so but Calise come on Khaleesi I
know it's the Khaleesi ish play man I'm
bummed that this isn't getting great
reviews you see how sad of a terminator
fan I am that I'm still gonna go see it
opening I know I love impressed when
Arnold Schwarzenegger thanks you would
give you a hug if he was here I'm cuoco
wow that's bad that's really amazing
going it's going from a movie I probably
won't see this weekend to one that I'll
probably see on HBO but I don't have any
need to go to a theater and see is Magic
Mike XXL they're saying at my beat
Terminator this weekend but here's the
thing so Channing Tatum's butt's gonna
beat terminator ah well when's doesn't
it beat the Terminator so let's talk
about this really quickly because i
really liked I didn't see Magic Mike
until it was on I think like HBO I think
I just caught it on TV and I was like
actually this was like really hugely
entertaining mcconaughey was so funny in
it and like Channing Tatum is so freakin
likable so Joe Manganiello is like
talking to Paul of tompkins about this
movie and he was saying like we realized
while we were making the first one that
really that extra story with like the
girl the furniture make it didn't matter
is all about the guys like that was the
real core of the story and so they took
that those guys and they like did I
guess maybe it's like a roadtrip movie I
think so I'm really looking forward to
this just because it's for the same
reason I read playboy for the articles i
am i'm going to enjoy this fun romp of
your road trip movie with a bunch of
dudes without shirts on here's what I'm
hearing you're trying to validate the
reason you're going is there is no
validation for this I'm just gonna see
it because they're all because a I like
I like dance movies I'll it fully admit
it I like cheesy dance movies and things
like I love all that stuff like just say
that you think that the guys are hot I
actually I don't none of them are really
my type none of them really my type I
don't like that look I don't like that
big beefcake you look I like more of
like a swimmer basketball player like
lean I don't like that big dirt of like
if your if your body is the shape of a
reverse V like a V shape I don't I don't
care for that yeah get out of here get
out of here go right Oh captain america
not not so much to or two to built thor
into a little bit too big in the last
couple movies they've all gotten so much
bigger so that brings us to our TV of
the day what kind of guy is your night
Katie type tini tini tini your mic XP uh
yeah TD bros deeper what kind of bro is
your kind of bro you know what I am I
see it I haven't seen any magic Mike's I
feel like I need to see one Magic Mike
it looks and I feel like I feel like the
first one I feel like they may be ironed
out the kinks I have no desire to see
these dude don't see it but I know that
it's so tongue-in-cheek that it'll exact
one Logan are you ever gonna watch Magic
Mike XXL yes I told you I told you and
go get the infant to aim for the two you
dropped you you can doctor phone you're
so excited okay maybe I'll pick up some
moves to you might be a good thing might
be good things I'm saying pick up some
dance moves go see Magic Mike have a
little fun getting drink from your Bart
even before you go um alright last thing
we got to talk about which we have been
all been discussing including producer
look at all days Apple music / beats 1
radio went live yesterday mmmmmm that's
a new release if you're on iOS or I want
to talk about good let's discuss so
quickly though very quickly little rocky
there's some problems some glitches
things like that but overall a very good
reception people have been really
enjoying it and the one thing the quote
that I saw on Twitter that I wanted to
bring up to you and hear your opinion on
is is we always joke about Apple
inventing stuff I owe Apple acted acting
like they invented radio for this but
the reality is is that for a lot of
younger people apple just reinvented
radio like because they these are people
who have never really experienced radio
like in in this way and I thought you
and Kail especially being really with
music fans like what your opinion on
that would be uh yeah and look this is
really just my opinion but I like I told
you guys earlier I think it's that's a
stupid concept because there's been
serious radio like I mean you think
about it you going on like a grocery
store that's a like a radio type station
from like the internet it's a serious
radio station that these places play but
not a dedicated station where those kids
know the DJ's names their personalities
attached to these sort of blocks of
programming and stuff like that like
that's only because he is offering
that's only because the offerings have
been so vast okay and not honed in and
just because they're off
bring one radio station you can they can
have all the focus on this one thing
don't get me wrong I love beats 1 radio
yeah I think it's great but I'm not I'm
not like oh my god this is unbelievable
it's really good like they've nailed it
they've really made one station that
kicks a lot of butt but I'm not they
didn't invent the wheel right but again
that's really cool I've been kind of
like on the Spotify bandwagon if you've
watched other things you I've been on
the Spotify I love Spotify even though
the UI is kind of weird I think there's
a few stumbles when it comes to Apple
music one you know they've got three
months I'm not about to excuse them the
Apple three months to fix a lot of the
issue Apple they should have kind of
like came out of the gate but there's a
little bit of like extra maneuverability
it's not as streamlined and as quick as
quick as Spotify is but it's it's good
and a lot of people are the big
complaint is is I can't you can't move
your Spotify playlist you can't import
them directly in Apple music that
wouldn't make any sense well potentially
so there they were talking to Apple may
be making a tool before you used to be
able to import your Spotify place to
beats music and when the service went
live Apple music went live beats music
you couldn't do it anymore but before
you were able to do it and so now you
can't at all there's no weird kind of
unofficial work around so they're
thinking maybe maybe and I don't know i
don't think apple will do this but maybe
apple would make some kind of tool that
would like to import your spot yeah that
would destroy it i'm only a third of the
way through putting all my songs on
there check this out though Logan how
far are you on doing it I just made it
to the s's before I guess he's barely
dad and how long is that Ben this is
last night well I'd been like wow like
yeah how many hours repelled how many
hours to three hours so far too much oh
that's not that's not that bad I spent
two hours and i'm not even a third way
through yeah it's i mean i got a lot of
obscure indie crap yeah you're gonna
have to dig a little and maybe even some
of the stuff snotty not on the service
yeah there is a lot of things missing
but oh well we'll see so yeah if you're
if you've got iOS you can check it out
where we're waiting and seeing which I i
think is an appropriate response so but
that brings us to our hashtag of the day
which is TD bro what kind of guy are you
into
that you would listen to Apple music I
love that this is going to be a running
gag okay and speaking of hashtags of the
day it's time to talk about your user
feedback so we all have very short-term
memories here on tomorrow daily because
we're a daily show about a week ago we
did a story about the climate booths at
the airport so you could walk into and
feel what the heat and cold felt like
for your destination we asked everybody
what would you add to the booth to make
it better so you guys came up with some
pretty good ones Matthew wrote and said
I'd add a smog level in the climate
booth which if you were going to a place
like Southern California or Beijing you
would probably die you need a mask
sometimes the smog here innovation
required wrote in and said climate pods
to experience how future climates would
look like and feel like if global
warming or climate change continues that
I think is really fascinating read of
all one using your using your noodle
also very doom and gloom very jubilant
but you know maybe a good wake-up call
for some people because they don't
realize like it is very much like a slow
burn no pun intended you imagine going
into that at the airport and then you're
sitting on the plane like all those all
gonna end I know what am I just very
real loyalists yeah why am I here Justin
wrote in and said staple destination
food generated instantly would be a cool
idea like that destination little snack
maybe a little bite at a mousse bouche
and then Rick Rhoden said create mini
city climate boxes of famous cities of
the world walk around the Big Apple feel
its climate to be like a mini attraction
so you like go in maybe you could do
that sounds like garbage in New York too
maybe they do that with projection
technology and like smell-o-vision look
like they put like rats running around
to like in New York yeah that would be
amazing and then read rubbed it had said
you'll like this it's missing game show
mode go in and guess the randomized
climate origin and you get a free trip
that's pretty cool like that big fan of
that and then hay-soos wrote and said
the booth should include a robo
bartender to fix me the traditional
refreshing beverage of my destination
that'd be you know AB artesian you let's
party pretty good but yeah so you guys
had some really good stuff for TD
climate and now it's time for a very
last piece user feedback which as always
our photog refer of the day
friend of the show Lance wrote in to us
Lance said hi all I never see Lumia
photos insert kays witty joke here from
here in Las Vegas which hope to see you
all at Def Con uh and he said photos
inside my house and outside using a
Lumia 820 with Windows Phone 8 and
Windows 10 phone so thanks Lance and so
I sent a picture of his kit which that's
right that looks like a ad for cat food
fancy feast that is the most adult look
that is that is such a cat-like reaction
what in the world is this now he's
looking at Apple stare at that bring our
wing yeah it's really well-lit really
well-lit and the Lumia does take really
nice pictures I have to say like the
Lumia I'm surprised we don't get more
pictures in from lumiose because they
really do take fantastic photos I'll be
curious to see when when and if windows
does a Windows 10 phone like a flagship
that comes along with Windows 10 if
we're gonna see a kind of an uptick and
Windows 10 pictures I think we will but
yeah really great picture Lance high
fives to you if you want to send in any
story ideas or you want to send your
photog raphy email us tomorrow cnet com
or find us on social media probably
twitter at tomorrow daily yeah you can
follow us and hear all our dumb thoughts
on our personal Twitter accounts i'm at
kill anonymous and she's at ashleys
together that's right and if you want to
send anybody friends loved ones
frenemies enemies to the show just send
them to tomorrow daily com alright guys
that's it for the show today we'll be
back tomorrow with a brand new dog and a
weird wonderful science backs in science
