may have been exposed WikiLeaks released
what it claims are thousands of
confidential CIA documents they
allegedly show that the spy agency
worked to develop tools to hack into
devices like Apple and Android
smartphones Samsung TVs and vehicle
control systems WikiLeaks dubbed the
collection of files vault seven and
claims a former government hacker or
contractor provided the material that
covers a period from 2013 to 2016 CNN
and CBS are currently unable to
independently verify the authenticity of
the documents according to WikiLeaks the
hacking tools included malware and
viruses designed to attack Apple's iOS
Google Android and Microsoft Windows
they allegedly allowed the CIA to access
a smartphone users location and messages
as well as control of phones microphone
and camera once these phones are hacked
into via their operating system then a
hacker can look and read your messages
just like if they had unlocked your
phone with a thumbprint or a passcode
the WikiLeaks documents include
engineering notes and lines of code for
the alleged CIA hacking tools that have
code names derived from Pokemon and
Doctor Who one called weeping angel
included a so-called fake off mode so a
smart TV screen would appear to be off
but microphones in the TV or remote
would still capture audio in the room
major tech companies responded with
statements emphasizing consumer privacy
as a top priority Apple said it had
already fixed many of the issues
outlined in the documents with the
latest iOS update Samsung and Microsoft
both said they were looking into the
report if proven to be true the
documents would be another blow to US
intelligence after Edward Snowden
exposed the NSA's mass surveillance
program in 2013 those NSA programs
really targeted company servers and the
backbone of the internet to sweep up
information in a dragnet
whereas these alleged CIA hacking tools
get into specific devices phones and TVs
to get information from a specific
target it's unclear at this point which
of the alleged hacking tools
if any were deployed and where WikiLeaks
is threatening to release even more CIA
documents in San Franci
