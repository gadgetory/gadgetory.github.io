picture quality but the TCL P series
breaks the mold it performs like a champ
with deep black levels and excellent
contrast and reproduces 4k and high
dynamic range TV shows and movies as
well as more expensive competitors
although its picture is excellent its
external design is relatively ho-hum
curved silver legs give it some Flair
but the rest is standard glossy black
plastic it's not an ugly TV but it won't
blow anybody away with dashing good
looks the simplified remote will be
familiar to anyone who's used to Roku
before and include some signature extras
you can plug in headphones to listen
without disturbing anyone speaking of
the clicker to perform voice searches
the force awakens and even use the
remote finder to locate it if it gets
lost among the couch cushions and Roku
dominates the menus - with its trademark
customizable design that places
streaming options on the same page as
connected devices of course you get
thousands of apps including more 4k and
HDR apps than any smart TV platform and
since the p-series supports both dolby
vision and HDR 10 formats you can access
the widest variety of high dynamic range
streams from sources like Netflix Amazon
and Vudu in our side-by-side comparisons
the p-series picture quality equaled and
in some ways surpassed many of the LCD
TVs we tested the secret is its full
array local dimming which adds contrast
and punch to every scene and allows the
TV to achieve deep blacks that make home
theater images shine it wasn't as bright
as some high-end sets we've tested but
should be fine for just about any room
and its HDR and Dolby vision picture
we're great with its low price excellent
picture quality and superb Roku Smart TV
system the TCL P series is one of the
best TVs we tested this year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
