compared to the 10s what about its
camera what about its size
what about battery life is this the best
iPhone to get right now let's find out
there are lots of iPhones and they be
getting more expensive once Apple
released the iPhone 10 suddenly $1000
phone became a thing other companies
have followed suit there's some relief
with the iPhone 10 owner Ione's cost as
much as laptops now and that means
you're probably not gonna be buying one
as frequently or if you do you're gonna
be thinking really hard about which ones
to get that's why if the iPhone 10 are
is really nice because it cost $750 to
start that's a lot less than the
thousand dollars of the iPhone 10 in
iPhone 10s the 10r has an LCD display
instead of OLED nearly full screen
except for the true depth faced ID
sensing camera on the front same as the
other 10 models yes there's a notch
there's a bit more bezel on this phone
but at 6.1 inch LCD still looks great
it's also a bigger screen for movies and
games compared to the iPhone 10s there
are differences between the 10s OLED and
the 10 our LCD black levels aren't as
black but colors still look great and in
most everyday use cases you'll probably
never know the difference
unless you're directly comparing them
side by side
the phone's a bit thicker and it's got
aluminum sides instead of steel along
with the glass front and back but so
were the other iPhones before this big
deal the battery life is better and
that's great a few hours more says Apple
over the 10's in my use so far it seems
like it holds a charge longer during the
day the phone's got the same processor
as the iPhone 10s with a gig less RAM
but performance is just as fast
remember 3d touch or maybe you don't did
you ever use it
Apple's pressure-sensitive screen
display tech is now gone on the 10r
it's not there it's okay you won't miss
it I do like 3d touch for previewing
links and peeking at info and some apps
but it's really fine not to have it
excellent haptic vibrations still make
it feel like I'm pressing in a bit
sometimes even when I'm not and haptics
matter more than pressure so what about
the cameras I'm so good for the most
part the 10r is great and takes photos
just like the iPhone 10's the
front-facing camera is the same and does
the same portrait mode effects face ID
and an emoji that the iPhone 10 models
can apples onboard camera sensor in ISP
are the same as the iPhone 10 s so
general photos and smart HDR worked the
same helping grab extra detail get
faster focus and avoiding bright light
blowout in high contrast areas
but there's no second rear camera that's
where the 10r is really different the
rear camera just has one lens like the
Google pixel 3 the iPhone 10 art does
have portrait mode on its rear camera
but it's a very different thing than
portrait mode on an iPhone 10 or a 10 s
first of all it's all handled via
software but also even when you're
putting the portrait mode effect in it's
all based in wide angle whereas the
iPhone 10 and 10 s lean towards
telephoto that means that at the same
distance and on those phones you'd be
seeing the subject a lot closer here
you're seeing me pretty far away but it
also means you can bring the phone
closer to me so if I go like this you
can actually get close up but then of
course it's all wide-angle distorted but
sometimes you might like that effect I
do notice that when you take photos in
this phone the portrait mode here seems
to capture a little more detail in
low-light so on the iPhone 10 s max you
can see the portrait mode actually gets
a lot closer to my face at a similar
distance and the look of it is different
my face is shaped differently and
there's not as much room on the sides
here portrait photos on the iPhone 10
are that I took ended up seeming farther
away they still look sharp but not
vastly different than what normal
wide-angle photos already look like the
bokeh effect is more subtle two faces
can end up looking more detailed and
less flat than portrait photos on the
10s but also can be more distorted on
the iPhone 10's portrait mode at the
same distance zooms in a lot closer but
faces also seemed better proportioned
and more beautifully composed still for
a classic headshot the 10 s handles
things better keep in mind portrait mode
on the 10r is just designed to work with
people not animals or objects unlike the
10 s which can work with anything or the
Google pixel 3 the AI algorithm is
stubborn it doesn't work on anything
except for people or things that look
very nearly like people I tried it on
real people then pictures of people
which sometimes worked then people
models and people liked things and just
objects
pet photos do not register with portrait
move the pixel 3xl takes better dog
shots so the pixel three wins the pet
photo game hopefully Apple will update
portrait mode software in the 10r to
allow pets in the future because come on
pets the iPhone 10 R has digital zoom
you have to pinch with two fingers to
make it happen if you're trying to take
a photo with one hand that can get
pretty annoying the pixel 3 has a tap to
zoom button it would be really nice to
see that on the iPhone 10 are maybe in a
software update another nice little
thing about the 10 are colors my review
unit was white which was kind of a
bummer but you can get this in red you
can get it in coral blue yellow and even
though you may be wearing a case you
might want to show it off other than not
having that second rear camera
everything else on this iPhone is great
you're probably not going to miss any of
the stuff that the iPhone 10's brings to
the table and a $750 or better yet go to
$7.99 and get 128 gigabyte version this
is my favorite iPhone probably in years
it's the best all-around an iPhone and
it's finally one that's not $1000 so if
you've been shopping for one waiting for
one I think this is the one to get it's
not technically the top-end iPhone but I
don't even really think that matters
