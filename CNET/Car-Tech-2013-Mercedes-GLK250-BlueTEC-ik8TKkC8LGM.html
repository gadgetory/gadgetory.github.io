one of the smallest diesel engines
you'll ever encounter on top of that a
big ambitious package of tech let's see
what size it presents ass as we drive
this 2013 GLK 250 check the tech so the
first thing you're gonna notice on this
guy is that it doesn't look like any
other Mercedes you're gonna wonder who
daddy was there's no DNA resemblance to
basically anything else they make not
quite sure how that happened but you'll
either look at it and say that is a
really handsome small SUV or it looks a
lot like a 2005 forester or both now the
first thing when you get in this
Mercedes you realize what they haven't
done is down scaled the interior it's
the same look the same styling and the
same high-quality materials you'll find
in the bigger SUVs or across their line
so that's good let's start with our
basic controller Mercedes hasn't changed
that in ages you've got the command knob
with a back and a Clear button they've
always had pretty darn good map quality
and that hasn't changed
destination entry of course by voice is
very simple enter destination enter
destination right off the bat you know
this is going to annoy me
he's wait please select a line number
two number two because I have to do
every little piece of the address winter
town first one talk at a time Street
first enter town first we select a line
number hate that interstate and city and
number I hate that please select a line
number tell me oh let's go to media now
lots of sources AM and FM with HD radio
satellite radio again that's optional by
the way disc DVD is optional music
register is a 10 gig hard drive not
interested but you can get it if you
want
there's USB which comes based but then
there's also media interface which comes
optional which is another way to hook up
your iPod and the auxilary Jack the good
ole female auxilary lives in here as
well that's standard now bass audio and
this guy is six speakers and some kind
of amplification I don't think any of
them will ship with that they're mostly
going to be upgraded with Harman Kardon
Logic 7 which is 11 speakers plus a
powered sub and you've got surround
sound support because that same package
brings in the DVD Drive
now let's go to this globe icon on the
upper right that's where things get
interesting and I put interesting in
quotes you can see I'm establishing a
data connection basically you've got to
get two layers of telematics and pay for
those on an ongoing basis as well as
then paying for your app service because
they require each other that gets a
little pricey
it is horribly slow and there's a lot of
lockout where things don't work when
you're driving it's kind of a joke I
want to just say I'm going to clip my
phone on the windshield and get
something that I can actually use by
voice safely while moving the things you
can use while you're parked include
Google local search which is going to
look for local Pio is Yelp Facebook a
very abbreviated version and my
mercedes-benz financial services you can
make a payment on your car from here
which I find kind of silly
self-promotion now let's move on to
driver assistance technology standard
includes this sort of drowsy alert the
car is always measuring inputs on the
wheel the pedals and such and can detect
from there if it thinks you're falling
asleep and then it will blast a little
alert on the dash and ring a tone as
well
it's not looking at your eyelids though
unlike some Japanese cars that use that
for detection there is passive Lane
drift warning and blind spot warning you
can also step up to active on both of
those along with adaptive cruise control
that maintains speed and distance and
you have to option into a rear camera
that makes me nuts vehicles that cost
far less often do now if you think that
250 on the butt means a two and a half
liter engine that's wishful thinking
this is way smaller 2.1 litre
inline-four diesel that's the smallest
thing mercedes fields at least in the US
market that I know of now key to this
little guy working out our turbos two of
them it's a true bi turbo a small
high-pressure one up near at the top
it's actually on the exhaust manifold
and a larger lower pressure turbo
downstream the exhaust away 200
horsepower specifically that's okay
369 foot-pounds of torque there's your
key that helps to move this 4,300 pound
vehicle to 60 in just 7 seconds which is
quite respectable for its weight and its
profile while delivering 24:33 mpg which
will check out the reality of when we go
on the
in a moment by the way all these GLK
250s go out to a seven-speed true cod
automatic and all these guys are 4matic
all-wheel drive let's go for a run
one of the first things I noticed about
the GLK 250 is what I don't notice about
the GLK 250 you may have noticed that
huge gasket around the hood opening we
were over in the engine bay that I
believe has to be a an example of the
effort that they've gone to to try and
seal out or at least isolate that diesel
clatter now that little diesel is always
reminding it in some degree that it is a
very small diesel it doesn't have the
same urgency of torque that I find in
bigger turbo diesel vehicles it has
great torque but it doesn't quite get to
the area of being giddy
it's just sufficient to amp which is
absolutely fine also we have this
automatic transmission doing its thing
and the turbos having to spool up so
there's a little bit of a crack throttle
response that's missing here that I have
found in other turbo diesel cars but
it's very torquey once you get things
spooled up the handling is really nice I
wasn't expecting that there was no AMG
package other nonsense on this car it's
just a GLK 250 but here on this twisty
road the body roll is really minimal
it's really planted it's very different
than the rav4 we had a couple days ago
it was all you know swinging to and fro
like a ship now I'll also point out this
button down here a and s in a con Eco
mode and a sport mode I don't know I
haven't felt a real big difference I
think if anything it tends to change the
transmission behavior more than throttle
response real-world mpg you see we're
doing close to 30 over a lot of miles
since we've had this vehicle I would be
surprised if you got 35 average on long
freeway trips ok this price is 13 GLK
250 starts off just a hair below 40
grand 39 8 something then there's the
Premium Package for about 3400 panoramic
roof power liftgate satellite radio
Harman Kardon Logic 7 audio 800 bucks
that's a definite $2,800 for a driver
assistance package that has active blind
spot and lane departure tech and
adaptive cruise control all of those
active we're looking at a car that is
pushing 51,000
and done CNET style but not even fully
loaded and you're looking at a vehicle
that should have really good durability
