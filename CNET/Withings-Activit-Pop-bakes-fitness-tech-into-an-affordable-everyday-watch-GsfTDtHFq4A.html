fitness band
how about baking it into a watch I'm
Scott Stein and just last year the
winnings activity took the idea of a
high-end watch putting a fitness tracker
inside of it and creating a sort of a
slightly smarter watch a pretty neat
idea but it was $450 and now the
whiffing is activity pop here on my
wrist does it for $150 how's that
possible well they did a lot of changes
in material design you know there's no
sapphire crystal anymore now it's using
mineral glass and now it looks a little
more like a swatch whereas the last
version seemed kinda like a 1960s
throwback and this was designed in
Switzerland the new one it's not who
knows where it's designed but the pop
does exactly the same thing as the
activity this is also a full-featured
fitness tracker meaning that it tracks
steps sleep it does not do heartrate but
it basically does everything that the
old Fitbit and jawbone bands did on a
watch you don't have to charge it either
it has a eight month battery life with a
built in replaceable battery and it's
waterproof for swimming or showering
that type of thing now with those things
in play and the fact that it tells the
time it really just feels like an easy
lazy solution for tracking your fitness
there's really nothing to maintain here
and yet it still has bluetooth so this
can sync with your phone iPhone for now
and Android down the line to put all of
your steps and goal information right
into a very nice cleanly designed app it
also has a vibration alarm built into
this that will silently wake you up now
it would be nice if it allowed more than
one alarm right now it only does one in
addition to the minute and the our hands
the second dial tells you how far you've
come on your daily 10,000 step goal and
as far as time zones go this sets itself
automatically as soon as it syncs with
your phone the pop comes with the
silicone band it comes in three
different colors this is the blue one
there's also gray which is like a black
and there's a sand color that's like a
white and there are different bands you
can remove these in mix-and-match and
even use the activity bands too if you
find one or have one nobody is going to
know that this is smart and that's the
smartest thing about the pop it feels
like a regular watch until you tell
somebody
or maybe you tap on this and make the
hands dance around that's pretty much
the only way you can tell that this does
anything and that could be a trend that
we see throughout this year we're going
to see a lot of watch manufacturers
probably building in slightly smarter
technology into their watches and
alternative to the high powered
smartwatches that we're going to see
from Apple Google and Samsung the width
exact imitate pop is probably my
favorite fitness tracker even if it
doesn't do heartrate I'm wearing it all
the time and it's really fun I'm Scotts
Diane with the Withings activity pot
it's available now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
