have been waiting for Beats latest
full-sized wireless noise cancelling
headphone these studio three Wireless
which carries a list price of $350 this
looks exactly like the previous studio
Alice on the outside the headphone is
virtually identical although this new
model comes in new colors the big
changes are all on the inside I can't
show you that but beat says it's
completely redesigned the guts or DNA of
this headphone with not only new drivers
but new circuitry that includes Apple's
w1 chip found in other beats headphones
and Apple's air pods that w1 chip makes
connecting the headphone to Apple
devices dead simple and also helps
deliver better battery life it's now up
to 22 hours with the wireless and noise
cancelling on or double that of the
previous model turn off noise cancelling
and that number goes up to 40 hours
meanwhile beats fast fuel feature gives
you 3 hours of playback from just 10
minutes of charging aside from the
battery life the two big upgrades here
are to the noise canceling and sound
quality I briefly compared this new
model to the old model and this model
sounds cleaner with better based
definition and slightly more natural
sound the upgrade and noise cancelling
is even more pronounced Beats new
proprietary noise canceling technology
which is calling pure adaptive noise
cancelling or pure NAC
is constantly monitoring your
environment and calibrates the noise
canceling to the sound around you
whether it's plane train restaurant or
wind noise Beach says the w1 chip is
what allows the adaptive noise
cancelling to always be monitoring the
world without draining the battery
ultimately I'm a little disappointed the
headphones exterior design hasn't been
upgraded in some way however this was
and still is a comfortable durable
headphone with some stitching tweaks it
beats has made the ear pad slightly
softer which is good beats has taken a
very good Wireless noise cancelling
headphone and significantly increased
its performance I can't tell you whether
it's better than the competition from
Bose and Sony but look for our full
review on cnet.com soon I'm David Carr
noise thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
