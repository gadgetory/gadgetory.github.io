hello and welcome once again to another
fantastic i'm calling it at the
beginning fantastic episode of the 404
show on this friday august twenty-first
is friday august paper it is currently
friday you are listening to our show now
we're just joshing with you we're
recording this on wednesday cuz we got
some junk going what a calamity strikes
in the next day or so well we're gonna
sound like a bunch of putts as we are as
we had it wrong we didn't we didn't call
it but guess what that's how real life
works mr. Ross rush to know you there
Jeffrey how you doing lovely lovely yes
let me ask you something Jeff are you
aware of how much i love the band third
eye blind ah did you know didn't think
you're gonna start things off like that
but go on I'm intrigued
eighteen-year-old jeff has his ears
perked up because I feel like 18 yo Jeff
was a little harder to hard it was for
third eye blind I was I know those guys
were pussies and yet it turns out that
they are the time was banned and your
lupus tanks and whatever you ever stuff
all I never listened to Hoobastank it
was a bee who poppy anyway go what
anyway trying to make you I was at when
I was at a wedding this weekend and um
at one point the bride and groom clearly
you know how when you hire a band
they've got like their standards set and
then you could maybe have them learn a
song or two to like add that are like
your special songs one of the special
songs the bridegroom requested was semi
trom kind of life how do they know that
already that is surprising but i don't
think i've ever heard it at a wedding
have you ever heard that song a wedding
and as a matter of fact i'm sure you
haven't because this occurred to me
while I was dancing and singing aloud to
it on the dance floor moderately
intoxicated there was a small four year
old boy running around my feet yeah as
I'm singing at the top of my lungs about
crystal meth and pannies coming here he
had a very that intense dark song it is
but juxtaposed against an overwhelmingly
cheerful beat and and that isn't a shad
harmony man doo-doo-doot-doot doot-doo
it's really uplifting
and I love the song and I still love the
songs all right might not might not be
super appropriate for a wedding going
audience the kid didn't seem to mind
actually obviously a little kids knock I
didn't understand I was a team in that
song came out I didn't understand what
the hell you were up on meth yet not yet
I mean eventually but I wasn't uh I was
in fluent in New it did it the words do
God go by very quickly so it's possible
a lot of people didn't notice but yeah I
think anyone did I think only people
notice because back then that's been
like CD booklets had the lyrics and so
on read it was like oh wait a minute
this all necessary this should not be on
the radio maybe this maybe this prodrug
agenda song should not be on z100 that's
pretty funny ah i want i wanna before we
jump into the show i want to take just a
moment if we could please okay and i
wanted to be able to take a moment just
to say how much it means to us when you
the listening audience of our fine
program when yet when you make that
extra effort and you spread the love
about our fantastic show I won't have to
present agree Jeff you've made a very
good point that I second and third even
right um doing stuff like writing
reviews on iTunes huge huge subscribing
to the show on iTunes or your preferred
podcasting delivery mechanism it's
pretty major all that stuff is actually
super super helpful to us so if you dig
what we've been doing last few weeks uh
yeah and you haven't done that stuff yet
show the love tell your friends to
listen to the show it's pretty great if
I do say so myself are you are you the
type of person that and I'm not talking
to you okay talking about a person
though either listening yeah audience on
it to watch you God we're in your ears
yes are you the type of person that runs
out of things to talk about mm-hmm you
think you got a vocalization I can't I
can't help it I must respond no but
seriously a lot of people like to listen
to our show in the car if you take a
long road trip and I know that's like a
very specific situation
but that's when I listened to most of my
podcast and I make a request for
everyone listen yeah I want to hear
whenever you hear something that's funny
if you could honk the horn repeatedly
regardless of what kind of it does not
matter yeah you could be in your parking
lot it's fine I think that's the only
way to show the true love for the 404
and then you'll know when other
listeners yeah around anytime you hear
Hawking sit oh they must be a 44
listener as well you could share that
nod right cross through the windshield
you know even after the policeman pulls
you over yeah you know you'd be like why
are you hugging back there and then you
guys want something in common because
cops don't have horns they have sirens
so they show their love by it massage
alright we are not responsible for any
of these shenanigans but nevertheless do
us a favor and spread the love tell your
friends it means so much to us and we
thank each and every one of you for
tuning in every week getting involved on
the subreddit and whatnot again the
biggest thing you can do even if you
want to have the most minimal
interaction whatsoever the best thing
you can do is tell one of your friends
and/or review us on iTunes yes there you
have it alright moving into the stories
of the week if you own an iPhone I do
are you talking about you royal you
still nuts everyone now cats it's you me
and listen okay if you own an iPhone you
may be surprised to learn that the way
you interact with it could big could
hear ya could potentially change forever
with the introduction of force touch
feedback that's probably we stress the
word probably going to be included in
the iphone 6s and whatever the hell
they're going to call the new ipad
that's going to come out next month I
guess you over so we I think it's ipad
air 2 I cash out no no cuz it's bigger
than the ipad air yeah i got air is the
normal size big ipad is the mini is the
ipad air which is like to do a
traditional ipad right and then there's
the super ipad oh you're talking about a
bigger I the bigger iPad which has been
rumored I don't think it's going to be
announced yet but right that's the
there's the other rumored I had there's
a lot of rumors
rumours that Apple's not even gonna
upgrade the ipad air this year which I
don't think they need to yeah I've also
heard that they're gonna kill the mini
as a line have you heard that uh I have
not heard that I think the many does
well I love them a lot of applications
where the mini makes a lot of sense
where the regular sized iPad does not
regardless whatever these new items are
uh it sounds like force touch is going
to be involved in their functionality
that's pretty cool so you use for stock
I don't because I think right now
correct me from wrong it's on the new
macbook pro right and I think it's on
that is it on that you watch it it's on
the watch yeah and it's I think it's on
that new tiny macbook am I wrong about
that it's on the new Retina macbooks the
Pro and the 12-inch okay they have
forced touch-enabled trackpad right if
you don't know what the hell force touch
is it's a technology that combines like
a prop so a presser a pressure-sensitive
display or trackpad sure and it uses
haptic feedback underneath yeah so
there's like a essentially a vibrator
underneath the screen right that when
you click down on something or act or
something it sends a met an indication
back to you so you feel in your finger
right so there's that sort of
interactivity where you you know the
same not that dissimilar to the force
feedback you get in the game controller
yes um so you know it's it's vibration
based on visual cues and a lot of it is
the net rumble stuff depends on how hard
you're pushing something or how long
you're pushing something yes and that
essentially opens up the range of
functionality to X amount of possible
you know outcomes and you can control
things more elaborately and get involved
in like I don't know if you're using a
paint program shoreham you push down way
harder the brush size is bigger than it
would be if you tap lighter that sort of
thing yeah what would your you know it's
interesting because that was a very
skeptical now because I feel like the
force touch stuff uh the obvious part of
it is
that like haptic feedback like making
you feel the whatever the click
underneath your finger but that's true
this the touch sensitivity is another
big part of it that you really don't get
sure it's like a normal iphone screen or
whatever totally um I'm gonna be
surprised how that play I mean the
iphone could obviously do it I don't
know if do I pants vibrate uh yeah I
don't know if they do man no like what I
don't mean I knew I good I could sure
I'm gonna say they don't my ipad air 2
which i believe is the newest one yeah I
do not believe it vibrates yeah it's
weird though because you think cuz that
like when you're tapping these things
it's not clicking in like there's no
movement at all right but it it
replicates movement I like tapping that
it's like you're looking into a mirror
back at you and there's an evil version
of you in that mirror and like you reach
out yeah and yeah and then you know you
realize you're on mushrooms and you
should just go for a second that's the
exact situation that's that's exactly
what happened but this weird I mean for
me and I guess the big takeaway is like
all right well is if this is going to be
the next selling point for the new apple
stuff I don't I'm not it's cool but I
don't know that it's gonna move hardware
which is normal because it's a it's an
off year for them it's right it's not
except it's not gonna be the seven and
it going to be a success and usually
people I think people that are not like
super techy but like us consistent phone
should get the phone this year cuz this
is the year that like they solidify all
the like nitty-gritty aspects with the
current design and they might not try a
ton of new things but you're going to
get a very consistent phone where is
usually you know the year that I've
wholly new design comes out presumably
next year there's more potential for
like some issues right antennagate thing
that happened there you know the the in
between years i like to call them are
basically refinement yes where it's
usually something under the hood maybe a
look you design tweaks here and there
but mostly you're getting what the
original number upgrade was yeah with a
more bells and whistles yeah I'm not so
over-the-moon excited it's cool tech I'm
not gonna buy a new phone just because
some evil little person is in there
clicking back at me what is your crazy
bird I don't know what yeah just some
like gnome inside a little no magic no
David the gnome is in there with this
little cone hood pissed that I like
punch the Fox in the face it is yeah for
me like I won't lie i've used force
touch to me in my opinion it is the most
gimmicky of Apple like you know
innovations in a while it just it feels
very gimmicky chair I I get it there are
like other uses for it and in it is
productive in some applications but for
me it's it's a little gimmicky yeah and
hokey in a way yeah but uh but that's
what we know so far obviously you're
gonna want to file Cena for the latest
on the next iPhone uh I think right now
we're thinking like very early September
they'll probably have their miss EMS
enter thing out rest and what will have
much more when that comes I don't want
to spend that much time talking about
Apple I'd much rather talk about oh my
god is it terrible to work at amazon
it's did you read this article I didn't
okay so I'm familiar with your stories
so New York Times wrote this really good
piece essentially interviewing I think a
hundred former current and former amazon
employees and you like first off I want
to know what's the breakdown what's the
ratio my any the impression I got from
the article is that Amazon allowed a few
select so i'm gonna guess maybe five to
ten few select senior employees to talk
to the new york times obviously very
trained and prepared for the sorts of
questions sure um the upshot of it and
you should definitely read the article
it's long but some really good stuff in
there so long is that essentially amazon
is a very competitive place to work and
in a lot of ways that has manifested in
some pretty callous attitudes towards
some employees like the woman who had
a miscarriage and then was basically
chastised for not showing up to a
meeting the next day it's pretty Tara
and there's like numerous instances of
people complaining about there's
actually a story about they do these
annual talk back to Jeff Bezos things
with all the staff and frequently
employees would say you know the
work-life balance is not great here and
he'd say something on lines if well it's
not like we're work-life balance its
work-life harmony which is really kind
of BS the inside quote is that it's more
like work comes first life comes second
and finding a balance is really not a
priority it's messed up yeah it's really
pretty harsh so so the story comes out
it doesn't really shocked a lot of
people that are in the tech space that
like have certainly heard a lot of these
stories that it's a very intense
hardcore place to work as a matter of
fact former Amazon employees are trained
to be so intense like employees that
have been there for five years that when
they leave some people refer to them as
am holes because it has been conditioned
their conditions like challenge you in
meetings and all that stuff which I mean
you know the lovey-dovey like stuff is
not very helpful for like a growing
business but there is a level of
diplomacy that's sort of required in
most businesses that maybe amazon might
be ignoring Jeff Bezos for what it's
worth came out the next day with a memo
uh to all the staffers but obviously
this got out very quickly uh denying a
lot of the things that were said saying
I don't recognize the company that's
discussed in the new york times article
if i worked at that company i would quit
right which is pretty interesting but i
think the really interesting thing is i
read this article saying that the CEO is
usually the last to know right this
stuff is going on but essentially if you
make a culture that's intense and
competitive and like this it's not going
to reach the upper echelon that like oh
this you know mid-level manager had to
come in after having a miscarriage and I
feel like a lot of companies
that have this sort of culture the the
the sort of like work conditions that
they created have this built-in thing
words like all part of this master plan
is not upsetting the CEO like keeping
him happy here she happy and and leaving
it at that right which makes sense they
they even have a system in Amazon where
you can uh review your M your
compatriots or a fellow employees okay
through the phone real anonymously just
the way they can so you can basically be
a view a product yeah so you can
basically give them a star gold star you
did great i love you in this meeting
this is a great idea or you could like
say this person's coming in late this
person is bubble bum so that person's
manager will get that review know who
sent the review but um it's the
obviously the person who is being
reviewed as has no idea so you saying
amazon is treating all of its employees
like like pop meetings right exactly
even worse people are making vote groups
where they will essentially say like
it's like survivor will they'll say like
hey I'll about you you about me it's
just a ring of people how could they not
understand that that's what would evolve
it is crazy to me but of course that
seems like an obvious outcome is that
people are just gonna abuse the system
uh I have a few friends that work amazon
I've not really spoken to live a ton
since they started working there I don't
know if that's because they're very busy
or because they're not allowed to talk
to anyone right understood um they've
been replaced by drone brains perhaps so
it's horrifying though it's really scary
and I love amazon as like a product like
course i love that site it really is
amazing site but what does does our
friend Louie CK say what's that nothing
great can come without suffering mm-hmm
right and it's really is true yeah I
mean on these scran sweeping you know
ideas yeah it is kind of true like
someone somewhere think about what
Amazon does mm-hmm okay think about that
intricate network I can order something
right now and have it
in two hours yep in New York City New
York City lesson is some people get out
an hour crazy okay and what that require
and what that requires and how many
freakin human beings need to be jacked
in yet tirelessly I mean think about
even even okay put it this way like even
on a bigger level where it's an outside
of Manhattan where they're starting to
do like the one day stuff yeah where you
order something by like 2 p.m. and
you'll get it by nine and that's like in
your freaking house yeah there's like
drop cars and vans and that get
involved in that it's not just like a
guy on a bike right coming in and saying
you know so think about that like they
are achieving what feels like superhuman
sort of ideas right and what they've got
humans behind it there's even a CLE
there's this story about in Philadelphia
where during a particularly busy season
there was a warehouse that the AC I
guess shot off but they didn't have AC
or something like that and they had an
ambulances parked outside of the
warehouse and whenever anyone would drop
they would take them to the ambulance
drive away and keep working they were so
ready for people to just like pass out
from the heat there was an investigation
is AC was installed but it took that for
someone to realize hey this is worrying
so it's a very intense company and
that's the thing is like can you give up
your I got my toothbrush uh in an hour
you know well that's the thing right
it's because there is this faceless
pneus Amazon where it does feel like
it's just a bunch of ironic cuz that a
logo is a happy face right it where does
feel like it's just a bunch of like
really smart robot yeah like going in a
warehouse and picking all this stuff out
I don't know how they do it and now it
seems you know our ignorance is like
catching up with us words like all you
know what like maybe like they are
creating a really hellish work
environment for actual human beings how
many people had to die to make fun dip
that's my question enjoy that's a great
idea that multiple packets you have the
edible stick so many people had to die
for that show like what are the okay so
what's the fallout like what are the
different ways
you know we can look at this and say how
does Amazon move on from this sure like
and and everyone who's listening to this
is like well I want to lose product
I hope right like I don't want anyone to
die right but I of course don't want to
lose Prime either and then anyone that's
holding stock is like oh I don't want to
lose my stock value sure I mean this is
a major story and it's just so funny how
like you know hindsight's twenty-twenty
like of course someone has a terrible
rare they're too good to be you know all
cheerful and it's especially funny
because you consider that most of the
products that are being mailed through
Amazon are made by people that have it
way more terrible than them it's true so
you know is to laugh it off but like it
 rolls downhill man so what's like
what's the takeaway I mean I think
they're probably has to be new corporate
structure that like prevents this stuff
from happening I know comcast obviously
ran into a lot of heat Reese like about
six months ago with their calling
systems and they were getting a lot of
heat for how callers were being treated
with their customer service and the CEO
stepped in is like clear there's
something wrong here and you know I
haven't heard a ton of those comcast
stories since so it's possible that you
know they just need to strategically
take a shift and they might be more gun
shy about making people work weekends
honestly I believe look working weekends
has to happen every once in a while but
if you're working you know 80 hours a
week you're put product if ities
plummets after probably 6 45 6 50 60
yeah there's a diminishing return
definitely so I look ease off guys I can
wait an extra hour to get by you know
little buddy for yourself damn it okay
cuz that no ice my mile thing is like
all right well so then Jeff Bezos comes
out do we take anything he says to heart
like do we believe this guy I mean I
believe the line that like if he worked
at the company where they were doing
that stuff he would quit and I believe
all that stuff but I also believe that
everything that was said in the article
was true so I really think that he's
just very siloed
from the rest of the company the the the
you know we were sort of getting the
summary of this new york times article
this expose they did on the amazon
amazon Amazonian work conditions yeah
from vox and vox kind of breaks down a
lot of the examples and bezos's response
and whatnot and to me it's like all
right whenever anything happens with
amazon or like whenever they seem to hit
a hurdle I'm sort of like roadblock they
within a very short amount of time jump
over it and then jump over like 19
others in the same leap so I feel like
that and that has to be at the human
expense of someone yeah like their
innovation and I again this is all like
hindsight but their innovation just
seems to be this amazing superhuman
power house I don't know like look we
give Apple a free pass because of for
Foxconn like we just do yep so I'm not
saying they don't deserve it and I'm not
saying amazon deserves it but like where
are our priorities here it was a little
funny that like the day after this story
came out amazon announced that they were
paying Jeremy Clarkson the host of Top
Gear who punched his producer in the
face 250 million dollars to for a new
development deal yeah that was pretty
funny it's pretty funny timing god bless
supporting the workers guys yeah I don't
know I don't know I I really it's tough
to understand the fallout because of
bezos's response and like the sort of
impasse that that's created right yeah
amazon what's your deal it's a see any
way through it all right before we hit
the brake Ashley Madison back in the
news because that big old dump of
passwords and user data all 10 gigabytes
of it that was threatened to be uh
posted were sort of ransomed if you will
if you will um was actually yeah it was
dumped on a
on on an onion address accessible
through tor yep which is uh you know
basically access to the dark web the
Deep Web yeah they released this because
they basically threatened hey shut it
down or else and this is the or else you
know it is you know it's not you can't
go into google and type whatever a name
and expect to see its subscribers to
Ashley Madison come up have we mentioned
what Ashley Madison is do we want to
remind me most people know that Ashley
Madison is a website that encourages you
to find a person to have an affair yes
yeah so it provides that connection
service so obviously I with that comes
you know your address and and credit
card information stuff like that and a
lot of this stuff was leaked and so for
people that really want to search this
stuff out you can find it at top of the
list as it happens was an account name
called Jeff be hockey fan New Jersey
which I thought was really interesting I
don't know what you're talking about I
have no idea what you're talking I did
find it funny though when you think
about this site they actually were sued
Ashley Madison masood recently because
it was uncovered that the vast majority
of the female profiles on the site or
fake hmm and just as a way to encourage
guys to sign up so all of these guys
that got caught um were really probably
did not have an affair but were
certainly actively looking for what they
went far enough yeah here's one person
his his profile said I love it when I'm
called and I'm told I have 15 minutes to
get somewhere or I'll be greeted at the
door with a surprise maybe lingerie
nakedness I like to ravish and be
ravished I like lots of foreplay and
stamina fun discretion oral even
willingness to experiment smiley face
holy crap you just told a bunch of dudes
that that have no interest in you
whatsoever and no women are reading that
it's really pretty outrageous so I want
to get the numbers about the male to
female ratio and i also want to find out
why apparently
teen thousand of the users have
addresses email addresses that end in
dot m IL or dot govt yeah I thought I
saw that too and I was not super
surprised um I wasn't surprised about
good i was surprised about a mile
actually i was surprised the verse vice
versa that because if you think about it
you know you're on base you're
potentially you know you could be
stationed across the country or across
the world right I'm not allowing it or
saying it's okay but it does not really
surprised me of that there's a lot of
demand there I mean right you are you
are alone your base it's not you're not
you're sort of in isolation but also I
would say like when you just go to a
normal dating saira normal hook-up site
you know time and what do you but what
do you need to go to this specifically
the one where it's like I'm a changing
yeah I cheating right I don't you are
you unless you really want women that
are like into that and cheating aspects
strange it is it's very strange um and
also the big question is like all right
well why did they not just dump this on
the free web and instead the dark web
right web that's a good question that is
a good question what i've read is the
big part of it is basically not being
tracked it's very hard to track things
that are on the Deep Web which
essentially like a private web server
nothing super fancy or like like we're a
success it is not fixed address if you
have like a bunch of friends and a
server you have a deep wet sore like it
doesn't necessarily mean anything sure
but yeah it's very hard to track um you
know IP addresses are not like readily
available plus I think it it's a
potentially more lucrative um situation
if you are if you are though the people
behind the hack sure you could probably
sell that but they didn't they just gave
it away for free they gave it everything
away for free yeah the whole thing the
data yeah it's just a big data dump
they're not in for the money thing it's
just like crash overdrive they just want
if they may shun will be free right free
the information hack the planet
interesting well there you have it a lot
of nutty stuff going on with the
security and whatnot
uh all right we're going to take a break
when we come back it's time we discussed
the controversy hitting the internet
this week when it comes to joke stealing
and social media major topic of
discussion this week on the internet
will have our take on it when we come
back stick around you know Jeff I'm not
really the most web friendly guy in the
sense that like you know I don't know
the bells the whistles how to make that
like in construction spinning gif on the
web I don't know any of that stuff you
are essentially illiterate essentially
is what it boils I mean there's no need
to say essentially but yes you are an
illiterate HTML completely clueless
person when it comes to web design yes
are you not yes I was like you at one
point in my life as well and now all of
my HTML knowledge that I've amassed over
the first 10 years of my life online
well it doesn't do me any good anymore
because you can get a great professional
looking website using a surface like
Squarespace ah ah is we all know this
because building a website is a huge
pain in the ass it's tough and even if

it beautiful hey welcome back to the 404
show ladies and gentle men all right we
gotta talk about this is a major deal
this week online um there it has been a
tremendous backlash against Instagram
personalities web personalities like the
fat Jew yes which I just every time I
say that really yeah I had never heard
wrong I had never heard this guy into
literally this unwrapped I knew all that
okay so you were looped in yeah and
there's there's a another personality uh
f Jerry f you see that letter Mary okay
um who does a very similar thing and
what it looked like as i did a little
more research I went to his Instagram
page and it really just looked like he
was just doing screen grabs meme that's
what he does and not funny memes either
press like lame like middle of the road
in a broad comedy and I don't think
that's where like the majority of the um
you know the majority of the criticism
comes from its the really nasty stuff is
the fact that he in many various
situations had been lifting / stealing
comedians jokes not only republishing
them but doing so without any type of
credit whatsoever ah so that's a huge
issue especially because this is a guy
who has built a social media empire yeah
to the likes of which he's able to sell
sponsored to Instagram posts he was able
to parlay this entire internet fandom
and celebrity ISM into CA a
representation a deal get get a pilot in
the works with Comedy Central that's
since been cancelled because of the
fallout yeah uh it's a big deal
and I really just you know completely
throws the entire sort of like sharing
and social media sort of um etiquette
for a loop I mean it's comply what what
does it say about our world I mean you
hear a joke 20 years ago right yeah you
heard a joke you just heard that joke
here and I'm sure this isn't the same
thing but you heard that joke you be
like oh you would just tell it and
spreads throughout her mouth Jeremy
would be like hey right check this Jukka
that'd be like taking credit for the
what's when's the best time to go to the
dentist 12 30 to 30 yeah what tooth
tooth hurty tooth hurty yeah there you
go Jeff took you a few minutes so that
way why you so much more hear that you
hear that that is all the people in the
future turning this pocket but uh you
know I didn't take credit for writing
that joke also here's the thing right
like it didn't matter 20 years ago
giving credit because you are not
amassing a gigantic following which will
then used to perpetuate unless you are
obviously an on-stage comedian in you're
stealing someone's which we has always
been a problem since the donut yeah it's
much easier to get called out now though
because L everyone stuff is everywhere
yeah so that's the thing and look like
you know I'm I get it I understand doing
this like I've done similar stuff in the
past and like an Instagram thing where
was like I saw this photo I thought was
really funny I publish it on my
Instagram Jeffrey didn't know where it
came from Jeffrey I've done it what if
you die i'm sure you've done something
so whenever you can lie or as the driven
snow I'm sure you are look fine yeah
have I done something like that yeah
maybe I've done her past but I'm also
not use i'm not selling away my
Instagram account well and here's the
big thing and it's kind of a shame
granted he lost his pilot but well
that's not a shame I mean no that's
that's not the shame part the shame part
is that his social media impact will
remain unto same yeah unchanged because
essentially the vast majority of people
that follow him have no idea this
controversy has no idea he's lifting
jokes they see it on facebook ha
funny like subscribe etc so that will
maintain the question is will we start
to see new systems put in place where
people can actually submit um you know
copyright requests on things like jokes
in the same way that like people submit
to YouTube saying hey this is my content
and I think winner Twitter actually
started talking and saying that that is
something that you can now do copyright
if if let me look it up but if you see
that there's someone using your content
there are mechanisms that you can pull
to say hey this is my condom like Braves
dullness whether it's a joke whether
it's whatever but then like that's gonna
trigger a whole litany of like vetting
and like someone's got to get to the
bottom like you can say is really more
of a PR move than anything I think the
only way to really the only way is that
there isn't a way unless you have this
like you know sort of like key coded
everyone's got your an encryption sorted
I mean it's really just going to come
down to like you're gonna hit a top
you're going to hit the top level of
like how famous you can be and you're
never going to be able to go above that
because the second you reach this upper
echelon of like hey I have a TV show or
hey I have 50 million followers people
thought you know the noise is gonna get
louder and louder and you know Skeletor
saying there's there's a glass ceiling
there is a question you will hit a point
where you will be found out and and call
the Frog lean forward and essentially
that will be when you get this Hollywood
blackballing yes kind of feels like this
guys getting right now yes I I
definitely don't think he's gonna get a
show any times so do you think he'll get
dropped from CAA potentially I mean if
anything if I was his agent I wouldn't
be putting him up for a lot of stuff
that's if I was his agent i'd be like
mr. fetch you i'm gonna go ahead and say
you lay low for like six months right
and even then like they might put them
in touch with people that can like to
set up sponsored tweets and instagrams
whatever he wants to do and i'm sure
they make a lot of money doing that but
they'll never like get him on TV do you
think there's any kind of matters
anymore do you think there's any
he's also been criticized because he's
never done a lick a stand up in his life
either now that's fine you don't have to
be a stand-up veteran to be a comedian
sure but you sure should have to write
your own stuff yes you do uh and he's
been criticized for for that he doesn't
even like even the little couple
character lines hehe ads as commentary
to the stuff he's stolen he's not very
good yeah so it's like do you think
there's any wisdom or beneficial you
know by-product from this guy or is he
just an aggregating hat I think it's
beneficial that he exists and there was
such a blow back on it I think that's
good because I think there are people
that like don't really realize that a
this stuff happens and be this stuff is
wrong like it's wrong to steal jokes
it's wrong to steal other people's
content without giving them credit so
it's good that he got this big smack on
the wrist granted that doesn't take away
his six million followers on Instagram
but it does at least engender this
feeling of like don't be a dick to
people so he's got all these followers
on Instagram and they're not going to go
away anytime soon because the people who
do follow him uh they are they're not
because they are in love with the
personality I maybe there is you know he
has used his internet fame to craft and
sculpt this sort of persona yeah like I
know what this guy's all about I get it
yeah arm but I don't think any of those
people would hesitate in a second to all
of a sudden just abandon this guy if
they're getting the same kind of content
from someone else somewhere else yeah
I'm saying like the the the the service
that he provides the void that he feels
is constant um you know bombardment of
this specific kind of content no where
else can you get that sure so people are
gonna seek that out from somewhere
else yes even if it's fat Jewish if it's
skinny Christian whatever it is yeah
they're gonna get that they don't care
where they're getting yeah and they
don't most of them probably don't even
know they follow this guy they'd
probably just saw a funny photo and
right subscribe it's intense man yeah
it's it's effed up so screw that guy
don't bottom
on unsubscribe and you know the world
will be a better place I think it's
amazing that you know either way what's
going to happen is like this will go
down perhaps as like the breaking point
for like oh now you know the Internet
has become a bastion of creativity and
original copyrighted works and even a
joke that you say that becomes you and
that becomes yours and do you think
there's like a renaissance of like
ownership headed towards emo it is
easier to track down ownership like the
original person that said a given thing
mm-hmm but you know it's a question of
why are people gonna care to do that
legwork I think as the internet gets
bigger and there's more and more
celebrities on the internet it's going
to be harder for people to just track a
lot of that stuff because there's so
much noise so and the way like sites
like Facebook work like you're just
seeing an image or you're seeing a video
like you're not really thinking oh how
can I you know who originally made this
Tyrese Gibson actually made got in a lot
of hot water because his facebook page
whoever was running his Facebook page as
a way to get likes was like reposting
funny YouTube videos but using their
player in there it just to get like so
yeah so long as the system's Facebook
Twitter Instagram allow these things to
exist without repercussion these people
are going to succeed in various ways so
I think it just needs to be dealt with
at the core of it let me take it in a
little bit of a different direction do
you think and I don't know how this is
set up i bet i could find out but do you
think like something like tosh okay like
what do you make of that cuz now well
he's commenting on landing on the viven
uh you know talk soup Joel McHale
exactly yeah well now I'm there's gotta
be something in place talk soups been on
for 15 years sure uh something is okay
we're like they either license that
stuff or they're able to get away with
it because they are a parody yes no so
the way legally they get away with a
josh is the same way it's actually not
quite parody it's um editorial content
so your cats actually why they're able
to use all those clips without getting
permit
Shin is because for every single clip he
has a dumb joke attached to it he's
referencing it directly and he has a
dumb joke people are like I don't even
need the jokes I would just watch the
clips they need the jokes legally to
exist on television because otherwise
they would need to pay these places or
get the rights directly so what right
now we could play Michael Jackson's beat
it as long as we have as long as we have
an intricate conversation about what he
wants to be I wonder but and
specifically only that yes I wonder how
it breaks down when it comes to like you
know just to play devil's advocate could
the fact you say something similar
because he's doing some kind of
editorial ization in the comments after
he posed something potentially but it
doesn't you know make the you know if
the core of the content I know what
you're saying is it's a packaging thing
right and what feels gross and what feel
doesn't feel gross in the case of like
Tosh yeah I think there's a little bit
of a borderline question there because
these people aren't getting like YouTube
rights or YouTube attention in the case
of the soup I think there's a lot less
of an issue because it's free
advertising for the shows that he's
talking about right but here like the
people that he's stealing from do not
have any benefit whatsoever there's
really none so you know he's a jerk well
yeah it's it's a it's a crazy story and
it's only going to get uglier because a
lot of these guys are going to start
hitting hitting it yeah okay let's move
along just a little bit this is freaking
out of control crazy uh I guess this
just sort of resurfaced this report from
1947 yeah it got it got Declassified so
this is a report the from San Diego
California July eighth nineteen forty
seven and essentially it's an official
FBI report about UFOs I'm pretty
interesting so it's an actual dossier
it's a dossier so an FBI agent
essentially was asked to go speak to
this boy who witnessed a UFO
after there was an article written about
like his sighting his name was Billy
Turrentine a Norfolk school boy and he
was interviewed by a special agent where
Billy essentially talked about how he
was sitting here's the here's his
portrayal of it he was sitting on his
front porch of his apartment no no no no
he observed a large black object moving
rapidly through space proceeding from
the southwest the Northwest direction he
said the black object was followed by
two smaller objects which also preceded
in the very same direction and it just
goes on and on speed of an airplane uh
Billy was unable to state what the black
objects represented but admitted that
they could have been very large balloons
but there's no question like what if
they're moving at the speed of an
airplane right probably not and it's
kind of amazing because the guy who
actually filed this report writes this
letter and he says he says that the
letter will probably be ignored because
it's all about flying discs and stuff
like that but that he actually believed
what was going on the the letter is
called flying discs security matter dash
X and there's a bunch of redacted stuff
there's a lot of that stuff it's just
kind of amazing because you don't really
think of this stuff being like super
well documented obviously there's all
the conspiracy theories and stuff like
that but this is like an official
document it's on vault FBI gov / UFO um
what's crazy I think the biggest glaring
thing is like holy there's so much
redacted stuff there's a lot of black
marks in this brightness dossier I mean
I'm not a conspiracy theorist guy um you
know I just think like it's very uh
strange it you know it is you know it
plays like a really good backstory to a
sci-fi movie is what this what this
facilitates yeah there's a really good
intro to the memo it starts this
memorandum is respectfully addressed to
certain scientists of distinction and
important aeronautical and military
authorities to a number of public about
the writer has very little expectation
of that anything of import will be
accomplished by this gesture the mere
feet that the data here win was attained
by so-called supernatural means it's
probably submission to ensure its
disregard by nearly all print a person's
addressed but he says it's a very
serious situation that we have all these
flying saucers and I was really doing
with them they seem to advantage since
then now they're all phones and stuff
like that so NBD but it is kind of
amazing that there's this just official
documentation that's now out there yeah
in the government archives you know
Indiana jones-style right being pushed
down a large hallway it's cool it's it's
over 75 years ago it's it's definitely
uh I think what's happened is like stuff
like this takes on this you know urban
legend d sort of like supernatural myth
thing and we we see this and were like
oh man there's evidence it's there and
then some M night Shyamalan movie comes
out yeah this is what's going to hear
you're probably right right and that's
how it all shakes out flying discs
bigger than automobile photographs
photograph by youth who is amazed that
no one else saw it yeah it's weird I
mean Richard Nixon was that youth it's
here right it's it's crazy because you
the the testimony and there's like
people have written stuff about this
since the testimony is like a little too
genuine you know we're like yeah it's a
little really are into it right little
kid I don't know at a certain point if
you're under that swinging light in the
FBI office and it's like they crank up
the heat you know you'll probably just
feel like okay I was with you
guys yeah but no is there something that
something long just a little tiny bit
too disturbing about this whole thing
yeah before we hit the next break my
goodness gracious we're gonna talk about
this last week when Steve Guttenberg was
on the show and I'm like man in
retrospect this is totally up his alley
yeah he wouldn't like that nevertheless
Nat Geo has some weight I got to start
this first this is the segment you ready
yeah what what what weird animal facts
hey do you practice that in the mirror
face yeah really practice well you
shouldn't have I'm kidding that was
great you can download that as an mp3
for 99 cents just head on over to sina
com
perform for uh so the title is article
on natgeo is world's loudest animals
hyphen bug with singing penis that's
right little green there is a bug out
there that has a penis making a lot of
noise singing penis so you might know
that crickets and cicadas make their
little common noises by rubbing their
legs the other right like a violet with
the violin effect yeah not everybody is
so blessed with long legs or long arms
if you think of a t-rex you might have
difficulty clapping for example like
what were those arms for like what could
that guy do yeah man what like there's
nothing he could do because you feel
like if he were to bend over to use them
he would just tip over and that would be
end of it I just don't I I'm not saying
then maybe they were like on their way
to being useful like an evolution
evolution out there like this could be
hit you something like another like 50
million years and those would have been
like these giant like claws yeah well I
think that's what the new dinosaur looks
like in Jurassic Park it's just the
t-rex with big arms oh where the FTX
with big arms pretty scary and hilarious
and whores but it's just so stupid like
what else could that do besides like
knit something really close to your
chest that does seem like a very good
segment for another time like we'll have
to do some research like just what the
hell were those arms for I really I feel
like you could almost win an arm
wrestling contest with the t-rex well no
I feel like there's a lot of power
within that range those take this talent
yeah once your your hand is in that
talent I don't think it's going on Talan
yeah or is that just a guy hey it's like
a hand with long nails on is that a
Talon it's just like whenever I picture
a t-rex in my mind yeah I have this
cartoony like foam Lizzie riding a
dinosaur or a skateboard he's just like
so useless with those arms that he's
just making that like tickling your own
chest like that's really all you can do
it's just like maybe and you can't even
get to the center of your chest yeah
just like just nipple area would feels
it yeah you can't even scratch his other
claw now it's like they've never met
it's like trying to touch her own
elbow could never cross his own hands
with you know same album okay so what
about wood t-rex penis or I don't bug
penis bug penis this is a bug it is
micro neck dust golozzi that's the
scientific name yeah it sort of looks
like a bead only thing and instead of
you know making all the noise he's
roughly the size of a grain of rice okay
um and instead of making noise robbing
his leg together he's got this uh his
penis and he rubbed it against his belly
and and that's what sings that's my kind
of guy um and I guess the penis is
probably a little bit smaller than the
size of a grain of rice but it's okay
he's making it work for himself he's
firing away he's making it work with
what with what he's got yeah so good for
him that's the story of the saying penis
sound producing genitalia are relatively
rare within the animal kingdom but
animals have evolved hundreds of other
ways to boost their hoots hells and
snaps thanks Nat Geo what what what what
weird animal facts hey all right no more

than I'm normally used to hearing it but
uh yeah and I was lovely he sounds just
like me very versatile alright we've got
a couple things left to hit before we
say goodbye for the week tell me about
I'm not even gonna try and pronounce
this they would say okay let me try okay
so this is a little little context here
is a new game is a new game new game
that appeared on product on its on a few
days ago God front calm / games if you
want to check it out it's spelled en nu
I GI nua G ok not right you like no it's
Bob so are you familiar with unweave on
we hear an Ouija on weed cheese so it's
actually a game that stars and ultra
depressed Luigi and all he does is walk
around the Mushroom Kingdom smoking a
cigarette and having like depressed
thoughts about his family and friends oh
my come on we is the where'd that come
from no so and there are two buttons one
is up well you can walk left and right
but one is up to have a depressing
thought and what is down to take a drag
of your cigarette it's pretty awesome so
he just like looks up long long li Wang
Ying Lee at the flag yeah I was just
like he'll just be like damn it what uh
my goddamn brother
I just can't I can't live up to him he's
a poor bastard guys he's had a rough go
of things is he not as Donnie Wahlberg a
video que yeah and he doesn't even have
a reality show he's got some spin-offs
that he's had like his haunted mansion
uh breaking yeah people seem to like the
vacuum cleaner game yet the vacuum that
was haunting even my freaking vacuum
Clea he doesn't even like me go EG much
a mess around on 3ds where no one will
ever pay attention to you and all his
powers and like smash brothers are like
very like you know effectual second-rate
there's a lot of flailing going on poor
Lou he turns into a board for some
reason right cuz planking is still a big
thing for him you know he's on he's on
he's on the pulse Luigi and so this is
sort of like a little homage so it's a
browser game it's a browser game IAM and
likely gonna get taken down by Nintendo
I you know we'll see if they have the
time I feel like a lot of this stuff
might you know it is parody it is parody
it flies under the radar a lot of times
too I should they're not making money
off of it it's just you know a silly
flash game but it made me smile they're
not unaware they are not unaware i agree
with you finally before we say goodbye
and again we're sorry we didn't have
time for reddit last week we kind of
don't have anything to share with you
this week only because we did an early
show yeah so we find ourselves in this
great paradox not really uh I could
bring up a few things before we hit the
last thing which is more yep just a
discussion area sort of thing um I want
to thank um oh who do who wrote this oh
I want to thank boo loo Jenkins for
writing about the montages that we
talked about a week ago when we were
talking about montages in Rocky I also
want to call at tubed in UK who said
that you sounded like a little child
when you said you don't like boxing
movie set where did he say that he said
you sounded like a real dick thanks a
lot oh yeah I guess thanks a lot tubed
in UK
mercy I like that you do like that I
wanna oh and then someone else brought
this up and we definitely talked about
Itzamna doc wrote in and said just
catching up I wanna let you know that
it's the the reason why the cartoon
ghostbusters was called the real
ghostbusters because back in the day
there's another show which apparently
was involved in a lot of litigation I
knew about this other show yeah it was
called Ghostbusters right as well like
two guys who maybe resembled Egon and
and Ray maybe whoever and there's like a
weird ghost oh ya the monkey the monkey
right the Hat yeah very reminiscent of
like Donkey Kong yeah and they busted
ghosts as well and then apparently they
needed to change the name of the
real-life ghost bust of the other
Ghostbusters to the real ghostbusters I
don't know I'm not sure it was a 65
episodes of that original Gus post that
blows my mom crazy can't believe they're
that men yeah um Neil oi wrote in and
said wanted to know what the closing
song of our show is um you can't Shazam
it because that is a that is a licensed
song that we were able to get through
our CBS archive yeah thing so we can't
we can't even like give it to you
because it's this thing we don't own but
we'd license for the show so wha that's
a bummer of an answer to your seemingly
innocent question I want to thank web
Chris for posting an unbelievable video
series uh that explains the Fermi
paradox in a way I could never yeah it's
not even close not even close it's made
by someone called curtsy got Kurt Scott
I don't know i can't pronounce it
cameron seems it's German I don't I just
can't do it but this a creative person
does an unbelievable job explaining
complicated ideas like the Fermi paradox
I'll link to that I also put that on
Twitter this morning big thanks to web
Chris for linking us there uh what else
I think that's it for for the Sun
it's tough head over to reddit.com / r /
the 404 and let us know all the things
you want to know comment questions
whatever it is post it there finally to
finish the show why is it Dan can I
introduce this segment to explain me
like a five explain it like a five did
you were you the guy who like did all
those you don't know jack like bumper
yeah I did all this it's done but uh I
just feel like you know it's a regular
segment at this point we've done two of
them yeah so it's it needs a little
theme song you're not wrong why is it
dancers yes starving five six seven
eight right stead of doing one two three
four or five four three two one and find
out sure I will also say this though a
got a guy on stage a band yeah like a
like a Bruce Springsteen yeah whoa 2123
fall right dead dannon it right so why
does a dancer go in five six seven eight
so uh wait I want to guess okay guess
it's got to do something with like the
syllables these Nobles of what at the
dance of the were of the numbers it's a
because you're counting in like a time
signature okay so you're saying five six
seven eight has more syllables than one
two three four because you're a dummy
know because it's like a one and A two
and A three you know you just added a's
between the more wait hold on keep cheap
trying the nice but I guys now my
buttholes talking inside of my feet uh
let's see God did there's gotta be a
logical is there a logical explanation
is very logical it will be obvious to
you once i say um maybe because i got it
okay uh it has to do with reading lips
who's lipsy reading the the debt the UM
the quarry the choreographer the
choreographer who's not a vote
for the record I'm not cheating again so
you're saying you're reading the record
we just need to be able to read the
choreographers lips okay and by saying
five six seven eight which which through
lip-reading look different enough to
make those out okay where one two three
four look all alike okay so by them
saying that what is the choreographer
then do with that information I don't
know it sounds like a thing am I right
or wrong you're way off what else can I
try one more time one more um it's it's
because one two three four is used by
someone else in the production and they
didn't want to mess with five six seven
eight anyone I must want through the
four cuz someone else is using it that's
my answer okay that's that's your answer
did Jeff what's keep in mind that you
had somewhat of a musical background
growing up and traveled around with
musical bands so you would think you
would have some sense of musical any
though this is dancing yeah but you know
music I probably had some fly girls and
stuff like that yeah they did totally
okay so this is from explain like I'm
five which is great reddit subreddit I'd
recommend checking it out and this
question was posed and crab cake
smoothie had the great answer to this
question here it is dancers often use
eight count bars measures of music
meaning their moves are broken down into
eight counts like your time signatures
one two three four five six seven eight
they will count five six seven eight out
loud as a countdown to begin so that
everyone begins together on one you
wouldn't count one two three four
because you don't want to start on five
you understand so you're saying they do
5 6 7 8 a 1 &amp;amp; 2 &amp;amp; 3 exact or one but
they're not saying one two three or four
they've already synced it up so the five
six seven eight gets them all in sync
it's like they're synchronizing their
watches so that they all can start on
one BAM right so when the five six seven
eight denon and then an aetna chorus
line we're doing a show here on Broadway
yeah
makes a lot of sense so there you go
five six seven eight and in their hands
are like 12 to one where the time's
right that's pretty much it I like my
lip reading answer better yeah it's
terrible but we'll go if you have a
better answer I dare I dare you yeah I
dare to come up with a better answer hit
us up ladies and gentlemen the 404 at
cnet com we also have a phone number
yeah what's the deal with the phone is
it still broken no it's it works but the
problem is that uh well look the problem
is that a lot of these voicemails aren't
really what oh well maybe we should give
them direction yeah the yeah okay I have
an idea for that I do ready yeah give us
your best Michael Caine impression all
right and we'll pay it played on the air
and we'll compare it to the real Michael
Caine will be there at during that show
right a guarantee yeah a guarantee that
next week I'm sorry not next week the
week after next Michael Caine will be
there to listen to your voicemails of
impressions of Michael Caine but you're
not allowed to use that clip from the
trip where those two guys do the michael
caine and brush exactly okay there you
go you have your homework get to it a
little bit of housecleaning next week we
are off but we will be running a classic
show have you what was that like you
don't normally go this far back in time
when you run these reruns right now this
is far back and I don't want to tell
people exactly do we want to tell people
what it is I think we should probably
tell them okay so this is this is gonna
be the first time russ was on the show
yes and sewed like 89 89 somewhere
around there so we're gonna do that for
you guys this is back in two thousand
seven / 2008 that I didn't think it was
that far Jesse only hosting back then to
