a second first look or maybe even a
third first look at this point at the
Apple iPod Classic this guy is still
around Apple barely talks about this old
Grampa anymore but you can still buy in
for $249 and it gets you 160 gigabytes
of capacity which is far more than any
other iPod that Apple offers so it's a
great value when it comes down to price
per gigabyte of storage you can fit up
to 40,000 songs on here 200 hours of
video if you want to carry everything
with you this is the iPod to get it's
not the most stylish thing out there
right now but there's a lot going for it
that people don't give it credit for
first of all the click wheel design here
is probably the most ingenious interface
Apple has come up with yet no one's been
able to get anything simpler or more
intuitive than this so the nice big face
of the iPod here allows a lot of room
for the click wheel making it very easy
to control another great thing about
this whole design is that is still using
that great old 30 pin connection on the
bottom I think that's a plus because
that means every accessory you'd ever
want for this thing has already been
made and you can probably get them dirt
cheap
so you'll speaker docks accessory cables
for your car a lot of great stuff that's
already made for this design of the iPod
that you're not going to find with the
Lightning connection at least not yet so
what's the downside well as great as
this iPod is there's nothing about this
design that is attached to everything
that Apple is doing right right now that
people are excited about which is iOS
you're going to get iOS on something
like the iPod Touch the iPad iPad Mini
iPhone of course that's not tied into
the iPod Classic you're not going to get
apps on here you're not going to get the
latest and greatest games you get
support for music playback video
playback podcast photos there's a few
games on here plenty of ways to be
entertained but most of what you're
paying for here is a great time tested
design and a ton of capacity so there
you go that's the Apple iPod Classic for
