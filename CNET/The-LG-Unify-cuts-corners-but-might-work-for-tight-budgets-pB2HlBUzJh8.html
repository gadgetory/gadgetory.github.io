checking out the LG unified this is 130
dollar smartphone only available from
walmart and it's one of three phones
that you can get on virgin mobile's
custom prepaid phone plan now this isn't
the most compelling smartphone around
but it's got a really flexible
subscription plan and pretty good
battery life so it could be a good
option if you're on a tight budget this
is not an impressive device it's plastic
and cheap but not flimsy I'm not
necessarily afraid to drop it or put it
in my pocket as it feels sturdy enough
but it's thick and light and generally
lacking the haft and premium feel of
high-end devices the four-inch screen
has a measly 800 x 480 pixel resolution
and the 5 megapixel camera on the back
cranks out photos that are largely
hit-or-miss better and bright outdoor
light but generally looking a bit fuzzy
and lacking detail there's also the only
one gigabyte of storage so you'll really
want to expand from micro SD card the
phone can handle up to 32 gigs the
battery life is pretty good though the
phone set for about 12 hours of video
playback before the battery died and
it's removable need to pop off the rear
cover so you shouldn't need to worry
about tracking down an outlet too often
but the real star here is Virgin
Mobile's costume prepaid service it
makes it really easy to design a plan
that's right for you and then adjust
things on the fly until you get your
monthly usage patterns just right
everything is controlled by an app
called custom you can add or subtract
minutes and text messages and upgrade or
download your monthly data then the app
gives you a concise little estimate of
how much your bill will be at the end of
the month if you just you're planning
your bill is higher there we turn to
difference if your new plan ends up a
bit lower than your current one you'll
get the difference as a credit towards
your next bill it's all really easy and
the LG unified to prove really
attractive if you're on a tight or
flexible budget I want to wreck control
over how much your pain now I suspect
most people will just figure out their
monthly use plan and then set it and
forget it but I have a sneaking
suspicion that a quite a few people are
going to want to do say dial up their
minutes around the holidays and then
real those back in when the holidays are
over they don't really need to talk
quite so much I'm Nate Ralph be sure to
check out the full review to see how the
phone measures up thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
