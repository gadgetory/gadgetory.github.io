today with the HP Envy 23 Windows 8
all-in-one this is a mainstream
touchscreen on one from HP and it starts
at about 1100 bucks
the HP has actually submitted a very
high-end review unit it comes in to
about $2,000 for this particular
configuration this model has a core i7
CPU 16 gigs of ram a 2 terabyte hard
drive as well as an entry-level nvidia
graphics chip now unfortunately for HP
there's nothing here that really
distinguishes this system from other on
one pcs it to come out with Windows 8
thanks to the core i7 chip it's about as
fast as other pcs in that $2,000 price
range but the 16 gigs of ram doesn't
really do much for mainstream workloads
if you're a professional you might
benefit from that much memory but for
the day-to-day mainstream users that are
gonna buy a system like this you
probably better off with a higher-end
graphics card now on other systems in
that price range so we've seen 27 inch
screens very high resolution displays
features like thunderbolt Wi-Fi NFC even
gesture control now not all those are
useful but at least there's something
and you can't add those to the system
via HP's configurator instead it's just
a generic on one that we've seen dozens
of times before just happens to have a
higher-end set of core features now does
get most of the basic notes right this
is a 19 by 10 resolution touchscreen and
it's responsive enough works pretty well
you can see instead of air hockey here
you can see the touch screen isn't
perfect though and there's some drag so
it's not as good as a typical high-end
smartphone or tablet so for its other
features there's a slot-loading blu-ray
drive that's nice to have there's also
an HDMI input which is always useful
let's you turn the system into a home
entertainment hub if you connect a game
console or a cable box and on the back
of the sides you can see you have basic
set of ports there's USB 3 SD cards
various audio inputs there's also a TV
tuner which is nice to have we'd
probably rather see some higher imports
particularly in this price range for
example with 16 gigs of ram you're
certainly targeting higher-end
performance-oriented users and in that
case a thunderbolt port would probably
make some sense so in its lower end
configurations this is a fine if
unremarkable mainstream all-in-one if
this high-end price though HP doesn't
really deliver enough to set the system
apart from the other competitors in this
price range
sorry much Brown this is the HP Envy 23
