first Wi-Fi system from tp-link that is
quite typical it come in three identical
hardware unit here you take one of them
connect it to your modem and then place
the other two around some four feet away
they would link together to create a
seamless Wi-Fi network and they will
just like that my testing I could easily
get some four thousand even five
thousand square feet of reliable Wi-Fi
coverage this is the speed of some 100
megabits per second now keep in mind
that this is a dual band system we
needed to have a third band for the job
of linking the units together and that
means device is connected to the
satellite unit will have a more than 50%
slower speed and those connected
directly to the router unit that
connected a modem that's gonna stick
your loss but even then the system still
passing app to the most residential
broadband speed now you can connect the
units together using network cable and
that will eliminate signal loss and then
it will have a sustained Wi-Fi speed of
some 400 megabits per second now like
most Wi-Fi system the m5 here comes with
a mobile apps that are easy to you you
can use it to set it up and also manage
the whole network now the app has more
to offer compared with other Wi-Fi
system for example it has a web
filtering you can use it to pass
internet based on schedule or in real
time it also have QoS but the most
interesting feature is the antivirus the
Empire can protect the entire network
from online threats the apps allow you
to control your home network phone
anywhere and that's because it's not you
who control the whole network is tp-link
the MphasiS tum' is connected to
tickling at all time so whatever you
want to do with the system you set the
comments to tickling and then typically
you can relay the command to the system
so if there's no internet you cannot
make any changes to the system at all
another thing is that for now the system
only works in route to a mote and that
means if you have an existing router or
a modem router combo box that cannot be
replayed
the system would create a nettled
episode on top of the existing network
and that means devices connected to the
m5 and those connected to the existing
network cannot talk to each other
locally and that's a bummer
still though you should get the deco M
PI system only if you intend and can use
it as the only router of your home and
in that case you'll be totally what's
the current price of some three hundred
dollars for three units now it's exactly
cheaper that other system like the
Google Wi-Fi or the luma but it sure has
more to offer and when it comes to Wi-Fi
and me more is always better than less
and that's because I'm down low and this
is the deco my Wi-Fi system from tp-link</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
