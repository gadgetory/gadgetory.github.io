around the corner and there are really
so many pieces to this puzzle so this is
for all of you that really needs to know
everything and anything possible about
all the rumors surrounding Apple's
keynote on the iPhone 7 now first up
design wise don't expect anything
special here this phone is really gonna
look almost exactly like the 6 or the 6s
but they're just gonna remove some of
those antenna lines for a cleaner look
overall
rumours point to potentially five
different color options this time
including silver gold Space Gray rose
gold and yes this really cool black
glossy finish that looks like the Mac
Pros the home button is still here but
it'll be a little different it's no
longer going to be a physical button
that you press down but instead a
sensitive pressure kind of like a
touchpad that based on the force you
press will respond with some haptic
feedback and the biggest most
controversial change is apple's plans to
remove the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
and replace it with the all digital
lightning connection an unconfirmed spec
sheet details that the next iPhone will
come with lightning capable ear pods and
a lightning - 3.5 millimeter headphone
adapter now buckle up because Apple
wireless earbuds are coming and expect
them to be an option Apple already filed
for the trademark ear pods back in
October rumors point to a new low energy
Bluetooth chip that Apple has been
specifically working on and optimizing
it for a low power consumption with
these new air pods as well and then if
you know the iPhone line the 6s is
pretty water resistant but they don't
really promote that so expect even
better waterproofing with the iPhone 7
this time around Apple has been
notorious for starting their phones with
a 16 gig capacity even with the 4k
capable camera so rumours point to the
starting capacity finally being bumped
up to 32 gigs we might even see storage
options as high as 256 gigs for the
iPhone 7 plus you can always expect the
iPhone to get better performance this
time it's coming in the form of a custom
8 M processor plus we can expect the
iPhone 7 to get slightly improved
battery life 14% more than the iPhone 6s
phones have become most of our go-to
cameras and a dual lens camera is
expected to come to the iPhone 7 plus
but not the regular iPhone 7 now getting
DSLR features into a phone camera
always been kind of like this Holy Grail
but expect to see that with this
improved camera lens we're talking about
better low-light photography and then
even better shallow depth of field shots
this is what they call this bouquet
effect that is typically found only in
DSLR photography if you're a big screen
phone user and someone who really has to
have the best camera I do think that the
new iPhone 7 plus could be the phone for
you but at the same time I'm just not a
fan of splitting up these product lines
and having one with significantly better
features than the other now if you look
at this it could make the iPhone 7 with
the 4.7 inch screen arguably the least
compelling iPhone upgrade we've seen in
a long time
but it's really up to Apple to WoW us
especially with all of our eyes set on
the next 10th anniversary iPhone I mean
we're talking about something that's
rumored to have an all glass body an
OLED screen the removal of the home
button entirely and iris scanning so
yeah that one sounds pretty good to me
Apple's iPhone 7 keynote happens on
Wednesday that's September the 7th at
10:00 a.m. at the Bill Graham Civic
Center in San Francisco but until then
this is really everything every rumor
that we have heard about the iPhone 7</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
