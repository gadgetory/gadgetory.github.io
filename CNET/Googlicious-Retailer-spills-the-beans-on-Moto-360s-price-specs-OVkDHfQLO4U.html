welcome to Google ishes it's all the
Google goodness that we can pack inside
of a show now this year has really
become the year of the SmartWatch and in
case you guys didn't know the Oxford
English Dictionary just added that term
to their list of words including tech
savvy amazeballs and Yolo all things
which I live by now there's competing
companies for the wearable space in
there really still trying to figure this
whole market out but in the Android
world it's all about the Moto 360 but
now it looks like Best Buy just made the
booboo of the year after they posted the
360s price and its entire feature list
about two and a half weeks before its
official announcement features like
being waterproof over three feet for up
to 30 minutes including a built-in
optical heart rate monitor a built-in
pedometer a vibration mode for alerts
and Bluetooth 4.0 probably things
Motorola wanted to announce themselves
but this is also the second time they've
leaked the 249 price tag for the Moto
360 yikes who's getting fired for that
one but I don't even blame them they're
called best buy not best at keeping
secrets all right Android wear has
separated itself as the top SmartWatch
platform right now it still needs work
but Google is pushing hard and creating
for ads featuring the watch in action
including finding useful information
like asking the SmartWatch how much does
an elephant way while you're on a safari
adventure see that's the first thing i
would do especially since there's a
solid cell signal that's really easy to
get out in the middle of Africa a nice
heads up for google i/o attendees who
were promised a moto 360 google has
started requesting address information
to start shipping them out so if you
didn't hear anything from them you can
just cry and curl up in a ball but if
you missed out there don't worry the
Korean Times reports that LG is planning
to unveil the G watch too at Aoife in
September that's less than six months
after announcing the first G watch and
it's planning to be a more high-end
SmartWatch with an oled display
so get ready for what i like to call
September it's really going to be one
crazy month in tech with smartphones and
watches and tablets in who knows what
else now we're expecting the next
flagship phone for Motorola called the
x1 this time around phone Arena has
revealed benchmarks for the device and
it's expected to have a 5.2 inch screen
2 gigs of ram and a 12 megapixel camera
with 4k HD video support with what's
believed to be a Snapdragon 801
processor clocking in at 2.5 gigahertz
its hands down the fastest Motorola
phone we've seen a date based on early
specs now sprint also announced they'll
be getting the HTC One e8 think of it as
a more affordable plastic version of the
current HTC One m8 phone no official
price point or release date was given
but expected to be around one hundred
dollars cheaper and in a concept that
could breathe some new life into the
design of current smartphones sharp
known more for their television sets
unveiled this teaser of their sharp
aquos crystal 5-inch phone with a 720p
display but most importantly it's near
invisible bezel around the phone that
thing screams do me baby but for
whatever reason they're going to be
wasting it away on mid-range phone specs
featuring a Snapdragon 400 processor but
that design goodness that looks amazing
and we need to see more of that in a
less of this and in other product news
the nook and Samsung will be making an
announcement this week to show off their
rumored co-branded Galaxy Tab 4 ereader
they decided that tease us with this
video featuring a disturbing trend in
teasers that started with Amazon this is
absolutely amazing this is so awesome
this is brilliant this is the great the
suspense is killing me now the new Klein
had previously decided to quit the
tablet business before changing its mind
with this Samsung partnership so we'll
see what they have to show off and
Samsung not one to be complacent
recently acquired the home automation
company smart things for about two
hundred million dollars according to
reports smartthings develops motion
sensors light switches and power plugs
that can be controlled remotely through
your Android or iOS device using an app
smart things plans to continue running
as an independent company under
Samsung's open
innovation group and the smart home is
really another one of the emerging
battlegrounds in the tech space that has
a long ways to go we saw google acquired
nest in the beginning of 2014 Samsung
just swooped up smart things in if
you're curious about Apple they've been
nothing major here up to this point all
right that's going to do for this week's
show email us at Google issues at cnet
com or tweet me a brian Tong and I'll
answer you a after I clean out my
parents fish tank thanks so much for
watching and we'll see you next time for
some more of that Google issues Gillis</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
