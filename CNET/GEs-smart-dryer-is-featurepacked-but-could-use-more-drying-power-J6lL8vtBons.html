a dryer you'd better be getting plenty
of features for the price the new Wi-Fi
connected dryer from GE hopes to tempt
potential shoppers with a laundry list
of extra features and Wi-Fi connected
smarts this dryer offers plenty of
drying cycles modes to handle lots of
different kinds of fabrics and clothing
types you also get a large seven-point
eight cubic foot capacity as well as an
easy-to-use knob style control what's
really interesting about this dryer
though are its app connected smarts
basically it has a Wi-Fi radio built
into it and that links to your home
network so you can see what is happening
in the dryer from your phone or your
tablet but there are definitely some
things I do not like about this dryer
first of all it's design is definitely
on the boring side especially for if
dryer costs $1,200 what's also annoying
is that the controls are back mounted
that means you have to reach over the
entire dryer just to manipulate the
controls and that's pain I could forgive
all the other failings except for the
fact that this dryer dry slower than
other dryers we've tested so for all the
hard work that GE put into the smarts of
this dryer hopefully next time they'll
come out with a machine that dries a
little faster</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
