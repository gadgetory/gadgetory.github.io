around the neck wireless bluetooth
headphone that's similar in design to
LG's collar-style bluetooth headphones
this is a noise-isolating headphones
which means you Jam the tips into your
ear canal and seal out the outside world
that's different from the standard level
you which has buds that sit loosely in
your ears and let in a lot of sound I
like the comfort level of the standard
level you better but the sound on this
pro version is significantly better it
offers clear sound and stronger bass I
used it with both an iPhone 6s and a
Galaxy s6 and all the volume and
function buttons work fine with both
devices and I was able to answer and end
calls without a problem if you do have a
samsung phone this does support
Samsung's uhq audio standard which is
supposed to provide ultra high quality
audio over Bluetooth the jury's still
out on how much of a difference it
actually makes but it's a small plus to
use the headset with one of Samsung's
latest Galaxy phones as for other extras
the headset is water-resistant and its
ear tips adhere to each other
magnetically to prevent them from
flopping about when you're wearing them
out of your ears however they don't
retract like they do on some LG
collar-style headphones which is a nice
feature battery life is rated at 9 hours
for music playback that's decent though
not exceptional in all I like this
headphone I thought it sounded good was
well designed comfortable to wear and
perform well as a headset for making
calls my only gripe are that the buds
themselves look a little cheap and
plasticky and I would have liked if
Samsung had included some sort of winged
silicone tip so the buds would stay in
place while I was running but apart from
that this is a solid in your bluetooth
headphone that's worth considering at
its price point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
