it's episode 369 of the 359 yes I'm BVG
he and the microphone explode because
the house is full with Ben Roger and
Alfred yeah hey morning what up what up
I wasn't even supposed to be on the show
today then some breaking news happens
yeah you kind of snuck in on yes
what are you gonna be talking about
Alfred and act former equifax executive
has been charged with insider trading
shocking Attorney General's Office in
Georgia and securities so that that'll
be the last story on our segment we'll
be talking about been scooped on using
Amazon's Alexa to send friends money it
hasn't happened yet but it's expected
will attentively later this year it will
and then we'll also be talking about
graphene from our colleague Katie
Collins she talks a little bit about
some of the practical applications of
what is considered a a wonder material
but we'll get into all the crazy stuff
bottom line is a phone that will charge
in seven seconds and may last days using
graphene no way all right uh as always
if you have any questions in the comment
section
Brian will get to the best and we will
try to answer them in three minutes and
59 seconds see you guys on the chat
starting in three two welcome to the 359
I'm Roger Chang I'm Ben Fox ribbon I'm
Alfred hang well you use Alexa to send
cash to your buddies Ben you've got a
scoop on a cuppie making this happen
yes so give us the details what's going
on here yeah it's a Virginia company
called day owned they work with
governments and banks to create a lot of
different biometric and security
software and platforms they created this
way for you to actually send money to
your friends and family it's
peer-to-peer payments using Alexa so
it's not as simple as saying Alexa send
mom 50 dollars but there is a chance
that eventually it could get that easy
and so how does this work is like can I
just go into your house and like Ben
send Roger 50 bucks no so that's an
Roger and 50 if I'm gonna send you money
I would
first have to set you up as a payee
online online do that now right yes yes
and then after I say that I want to send
money I still have to use my phone I
open up my phone verify that I actually
want to do this payment and then you
have to do some sort of authentication
whether it's using face ID touch ID a
pin something like that so there are
some additional it wasn't that like I
feel like that's just another spike
that's just really annoying yeah could
you just pay on your phone would it be
simpler to just take out the Alexa yeah
potentially it could be and also this
isn't this isn't out now
Dejan is hoping to partner with banks
where this could come out in the next 9
to 18 months the idea would be that
eventually voice authentication could be
available through Alexa so it could be
eventually as easy as just saying you
know Alexa pay this person and as long
as they're set up as your payee
you could do it is that so you know
after mobsters and loan sharks have
beaten you up so badly that like you
can't handle them the money or use your
hands to use your phone that you got
your voice to do it and that is exactly
it yeah I always think as I explain this
to people they're like what if somebody
has a gun to your head I'm like somebody
has a gun to your head in your house
yeah you probably really a problem your
buddies probably gonna write exactly
all right let's know next up if you
haven't heard of a material called
graphene graphene is a thin layer of
pure carbon atoms tightly packed into a
honeycomb structure but all you really
care about is it can do amazing things
because it's super thin and super strong
it's ideal way to transmit power so in
theory this could be used like a 5g of
material oh really you're over-promising
yes like Toby used to theoretically
charge a phone in as little seven
seconds and because it can hold a lot of
power it could theoretically run the
phone for days I'm also super thin and
super strong by the way just so you know
it's not flexing Alfred I don't I mean I
think it has a lot of potential I'm on
Ben's side here was like I'll see it
when I believe it when I see it
it definitely promises a lot the
material is absolutely fascinating I'm
Stevie shangkun's write about it we've
heard about in the past about sort of
the different applications for it
obviously the I think the most
attractive for most people is like the
application in battery power but mostly
in the
research world right it is Katie's
talked to the sort of the graphene some
of the graphene experts at mobile
Congress two weeks ago and you know she
thought this might be happening in a
couple of decades but they're so they're
saying two to three years no way no
commercially not commercially but I
imagine like it'll start showing up in
research or R&amp;amp;D with companies right now
is totally academic but I imagine it'll
actually get a lot closer reality that
we think those are DS hoarding all the
cool tech for themselves for sure are DS
lastly a new development
Equifax trauma alfred you've got all the
details yeah so this is a breaking news
story a former Equifax executive who
used to be their chief information
officer he knew about the breach in
August and price sold his stock ten days
before they announced it publicly making
nearly a million dollars had he waited
until after he only would have lost one
hundred and seventeen thousand dollars
so now he's facing these charges over
that also he's been fired over this as
well ouch
okay first of all there it's just a
legend at this point he hasn't actually
been convicted yet that's right for more
details on the story check us out on
seen it I'm Roger Cheng
I'm heading facts Rubin I'm Alfred Inge
thanks will sing shock oh it's starting
I know yeah he just it's it's from a
legal perspective he hasn't been
convicted yet so he's not he's not
guilty until he's proven guilty that's
true that's how the legal system works
yeah I'm like reading through the court
documents right now the complaint
against him and there's this one part
where he so apparently they were only
assigned to look at a breach like they
didn't tell him what company was
breached when they were investigating it
in July and then around August he sent
up he allegedly sends a text to a
co-worker saying basically saying I
think it was us that was pretty oh my
god sounds like they have him like dead
to rights at this and then the Monday
after they saw his search history and he
looks up the like stock like impact on
the Experian criminy
well he did this on his work computer I
don't know what computer
just said he searched it up but then a
few hours after that so he looks it up
at 10 a.m. on August 28th and then like
he looks up Experion breech experience
stock price September 2015 and then
after after that like a few hours after
he sails like he allegedly sells all his
shares but well no no he's definitely
sold all his shares that's problem that
information that we know but you missed
the one part where they checked a search
history and somewhere in like 11:15 a.m.
he googled how to insider trade yeah
that's I don't know I mean this was like
a major issue for a lot of folks like
after the breach had been announced they
cited him and two other CEO do this as
well tell me okay he got fired and has
like a major he has like a 19 million
dollars right okay shoot yeah sell any
stuff okay this CEO got an oxime a
million dollars yeah I mean they all
they all do right it doesn't matter if
you failed your job you still get paid I
mean like this was a huge breach excuse
me for still being surprised at the fact
that you can only fail up when you
become a CEO but that's what you should
Michele OPC is I mean that's really the
key and a name I'm actually more named
Macklemore did name is he as you are you
are the CEO of breakdancing there you go
I applied to chief breakdancing officer
right there I applied to be one but
there's no listings on LinkedIn
you're not looking the right places yes
I mean I and they need some experience
points but I just don't I don't have it
under my belt yeah I'm sorry
alright I kind of want to talk a little
bit more about this graphene stuff
graphene that we're all skeptically
optimistic it just sounds like like
charger 5g seven seconds and it's gonna
last forever so like look the thing of
it is is this is a it's good to be
skeptical about it for sure but Fame
does this graphene would represent like
a wholesale change out of our battery
technology which which we've is really
really difficult to write because
everyone is very used to lithium ion
with the way we charge things with the
materials that's used to charge phones
so that
this would require like a wholesale
change in everything like the entire
universe of how batteries charging all
works right so there's a lot of
logistical issues that have to be have
to go through before this becomes
something that you and I can actually
use but the fact that is there like and
is a there's actually promise to this is
encouraging well and the other issue is
is that the current solution with
lithium ion is just bigger battery not
good I mean that you know like I haven't
been able to significantly improve they
as in all the mobile phone makers and
the manufacturers haven't been able to
significantly improve battery technology
and what decades yeah because I mean
everyone is useful with Iran it works
its stable aside from the occasional
tendency to catch on fire right if you
puncture it it's like the standard so
it's for everyone it's like it's
comfortable to use it's reliable but
there was up sometimes right and there
but there is there are yeah there's very
little innovation as you said and it
seems like the only way to get more
juice from a battery is to make the
battery bigger and that's the only issue
and that conflicts with the industry's
need to have every phone be super thin
and it's belt right so something like
graphene I'm looking forward to I'm
skeptical about it as well but I'm
looking forward to that right
so by the way other applications up
because it's so thin because it's so
light it can be used it can be weaved
into clothes as sensors it could be used
to make robotic limbs more it's easily
controllable so that's what caught my
attention the most is how versatile it
is we're looking at Katie's article and
I have only maybe kind of in passing
heard some of your comments about it
yeah in the past and then looking at the
article itself and seeing how many
different applications there are from
like shoes to robots
yeah to food identification yeah hang on
I'm gonna bring some of this up right
now that's kind of blowing my mind how
is this it's like the hemp of tech it's
so it's like a multi-purpose miracle
drug of a kind of it I mean they keep
calling a wonder material this was you
know this is found out in Europe that's
why a lot of European research
are really putting a lot of energy and
resources behind it but yes it's like at
some point I think it can be applied to
sensors and actually be able to read and
understand whether or not it can it can
tell whether milk is like soy milk or
regular milk they can tell whether it's
gone bad does graphene talk graphene has
hold conversations may be your best
friend right it's just really you can
barely see you like then Nick and this
just sounds like vibranium what's the
one is vibranium is not the one from
that's the one from black man I'm mixing
it with some thinking about the other
one from the people the giant blue
people what's that one possibility
somebody from the Chad tell us what the
avatar thing was I've never seen avatar
okay two people here I haven't seen
avatar and Roger and I are not
remembering so there's more than a few
people who are upset with Equifax I
think we should all come up with an
appropriate punishment for those by the
way just wonder it's unobtainium least
vibranium sounds exotic and unique vibe
radium sounds cool like there's a
purpose to it
oh yeah cations will never be here iums
so yeah let's let's talk appropriate
punishments for Equifax I mean this is
incredibly unprofessional news reporting
here but I don't think anybody in the
world is like no let's defend them are
you they've already like how many how
many of their executives have already
been arrested I mean I would have loved
for the CEO did not get his money that
would have been nice
that would be nice I would have been at
least something you know I screw up on
the job and I think fired out I don't
get like really million dollar payback
really the last post I worked in $19
that's why you're working here man I'm
looking at another court document on
this right now so correction he didn't
use Google to search up did he use zoom
that's what I meant to say lock him up
that is terrible
that is that's a reason that is a reason
it I mean that's that's parchment it's
not right just be just using pain
constantly like that should be that's
punishment that's just funny yeah using
anything but being the rest of his life
Microsoft is so pleased you will get
Bing right now how do you become a chief
information officer and use Bing of a
like multi-million dollar company and
you're using Bing people use Bing I
think it's got I'm what person people
market that aren't chief information
officer oh good lord
how do they get this far I'm floored how
did they I failed so far up rush you get
remember life a company like Equifax
like experience these are like
institutional companies that don't they
compete with each other they're they're
like that you have to use them have to
use and so there's not motivation to be
better when you earn in a salt position
and oddly enough there are three of them
so I would think that there would be a
competitive reason for them but they're
trying to be better than there really
isn't cuz everyone needs to get like
scores from all three exactly at least
you out it but this is a company that
like has no motivation because it it's
sort of entrenched in this its business
and so maybe there isn't motivation to
be better we were talking a while back
about just sort of saying that are they
gonna change their name yeah are they
gonna cease to get as much business it
seems to me like they seem to be skating
along just fine you kind of have to use
them that's the problem yeah so there's
no like there's even if they screw up
you're still paying them for your credit
score's so where's the motivation be
better mm-hmm
I just love they even in the chat mic
sauce like no wonder they were hacked
they freaking use Bing yeah they're dumb
enough to use Bing to take away from
this yeah I mean I'm still digging
through a lot of the court documents
right now but yeah this is I'm curious
to see what will happen to the other two
executives that were also caught like
with not insider trading but like
clearly sold their stock like wait
before this announcement happen right
because they haven't been charged and
you know with the other two they had
mentioned I remember when they asked
their former CEO Rick Smith about this
they mentioned
yes they sold their stock during this
timeframe when we knew about it but they
did not know about this like they were
just selling it randomly but so look
maybe it takes time to develop a case
yeah it'll be the evidence on the CIO it
sounds like from look clearly he wasn't
like he was like leaving a trail pretty
yeah the CIO is like that's kind of easy
to figure out only because he's this yet
yeah thanks for he's directly in a
voyage yes you know for like there are
other roles I can't remember what their
roles were but it didn't have that much
to do with security so they legitimately
might not have that knowledge and there
are by the way there are executives who
have pre-established plans where they do
sell stock on a periodic basis if I
remember correctly that's what Intel
claims yeah that they have plans that
they're signed up for well in advance
and like at certain times automatically
stock gets sold and so it does look bad
yes timing wise but we don't really know
what happened yeah with the very little
amount of time we do have left then we
kind of blue pasture with your scoop but
it was such cool potentially cool but
potentially frightening scoop yeah who
out there would use voice pay cuz right
out the gate I'm super nervous about
that I think the idea is to just try to
provide an additional convenience and
try to like do more habit-forming using
Alexa that's why I think a lot of these
banks are interested in doing it and
they can already do balances you can
check your balance which is a low risk
issue you could also you know send your
monthly auto loan or your monthly
mortgage payment but actually like for
me to send Roger or Alfred money that's
a little bit more complicated and yeah
that does come with additional risks and
there's no telling if it'll take off so
there's a lot of different ways to do
purely there there's that element where
like I think every company in the world
is seeing this trend of people embracing
smart home speakers and trying to
develop a way to form a relationship
there right mm-hmm so like if you have
your the bank you like you want you
basically want to be able to say like
Alexa called Chase or Bank of America
because they're like it gets it gets
that in your head right
if forms assault slow flies that
relationship right and it's something
people do fairly regularly and if it if
this I could see this as potentially
being something that people could use
somewhat more often because like there
are like 30,000 skills that Alexa has
and like I would say most of them hardly
anybody uses this could actually be
something that people might try the at
least the first version of this with all
the authentication steps you've gotta
jump through wow it makes total sense
like I don't know if it's worth the
trouble like I am more intrigued by that
sort of ultimate idea of like voice
authentication and be able to read your
voice and like it knows it's you and
identifies you and it sort of confirms
that payment right away yeah hey Ben
Alexa take take fifty dollars from Ben
ouch awesome power by the way like when
you're talking about earlier if you walk
in the Ben's house or you're like Ben
give me money before you corrected
yourself and when you meant to say the
echo right then give me money I just
picture Ben in the couch like what are
you doing I'm watching Umizoomi
interesting concept here from Sir enjoy
do we think the Alexis step into making
transactions will actually push voice
detection technology into a much higher
more secure level I think that's a very
good point and it's entirely possible
the the company they own already does
voice authentication the problem is is
that Alexa doesn't oh we gotta stop
saying Alexa we're triggering everybody
which our echo the echo doesn't allow
them to grab audio snippets so they
can't do voice authentication now that's
one of the primary hurdles for doing
that but as banks insurers
governments all these different or major
organizations wanted try to start using
the echo speaker for things yes
absolutely I think voice authentication
will have to get better yeah to them to
have them start adopt I imagine like
that's I mean Google start things with
like being able to recognize different
voices right mm-hm and so I imagine this
is sort of a logical next step like
Amazon has to be working on something
like are we are we only looking at
voices like the security measure here
though because didn't we have our
on video where that producer in Kentucky
was able to like like do impressions of
others peek other people's voices and it
recognized him as them yes but like I
said we're not even there yeah I think
this is something that's down the line
right this isn't a year or two maybe
this is two or three years where the
technology actually gets good enough
that it can authenticate brightest and
you actually and you'd have to get
Amazon's okay on it and you would also
have like a passphrase so you would say
something like my my my voice is my
passport or something ridiculous like
that Wow any other applications that we
think this could apply to with with
money now coming into play I know we can
always shop on Amazon with the echo but
that has been constrained do we think
there's gonna be doors open for things
like online betting gambling that kind
of you know because right now let this
is my mind the thought in my head is
this is already risky I already make
terrible drunk purchases on the internet
yeah and if you have to take one less
step out of enough to do is oh my god
stop it Roger all right you all right I
can already do that yeah and but you
also have to set it up yeah there's
there are a lot of potential
applications for it I forgot when ajan
like bets or something like that where
you can like tell it to like put like
$50 down on something like that and then
it automatically transfers over you
could also do like in skill purchasing
potentially a little bit more easily
using something like this so that would
help developers actually charge a little
bit more effectively during this time
can only well you can order on you can
order pizzas but dominate you you shop
elsewhere with Alexa
Best Buy is one of the few other
retailers that you can shop with using
Alexa I mean have any voice I'm sorry
with the echo with the Google smart
assistant with okay double the very you
can shop with Ferb at other places like
I think it's Walmart Costco there are a
handful of places that you can do
through google shopping so you you get
more
I think target is another I mean being
able to make purchases
we're and having your voice be the
authentication the confirmation of that
purchases that'd be kind of handy yeah
and there's there's a potential for that
at this point peer-to-peer payments
looks to be something that folks should
look out for I guess by the end of the
year maybe and we'll see
well obviously like keep track of when
which first bank if this actually does
happen will actually entail with that so
much bank hold it'll be it might be
somebody internationally I'm not sure
yet so it may be somebody in the US it
may not be I was thinking Capital One
has been very heavily into the echo
speaker so my money is on them but I
don't have any proof that that would or
would not happen I feel like other
contenders are like H&amp;amp;R Block we're
pretty kind of on the up-and-up as far
as digital transactions have gone and
maybe even chase being one of the bigger
bigger ones who are more prone to try
new things and are already pretty secure
and safe in their own methods yeah the
other banks in the u.s. that have
already started with all amazon skills
our ally bank US bank a bunch of credit
unions so there's there's definitely
potential there yeah we are right at the
end of the road here
Danny Green reminded me I forgot to say
this morning happy pi day everybody
that's right yeah and not to end on a
too somber of a note but just want to
send a Godspeed message to hmm Stephen
Hawking who we lost late last night and
the world will be will severely miss
this mind and this inspiration of a
human so not to not to bring it down too
far and the very well-put yeah it's a
huge loss a really massive loss to the
to the theoretics
community to the world medical community
to humankind yeah right so and like the
potential of a person what you can do
and not letting things stop you having
literally literally every single
roadblock in your path and still
persevering and surviving and
maintaining and succeeding and that's
the kind of inspiration and motivation
we could all use in our lives these days
that's like all right and at that on
that note if you liked anything you saw
or heard here check us out on CNET our
podcasts also available on itunes tune
in stitcher feed
Google Play Music and the Amazon echo
cool cool take care everybody see you
