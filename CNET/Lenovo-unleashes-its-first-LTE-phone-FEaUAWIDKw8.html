CES 2014 in Las Vegas I meant Lenovo's
food and they have announced for new
phone so I'm going to take you on a very
quick tour we're starting off with the
lenovo vibe z this is their highest end
smartphone it's their purse with LTE
ever there is a 5-inch 1080p HD display
qualcomm snapdragon processor that's
quad-core their 13 megapixel camera on
the back this is a black phone pretty
basic it's got this backing that is
polycarbonate it's been laser etched it
feels very silky smooth this could be
good because it's sort of Matt you're
not going to pick up a lot of
fingerprints but it might be a little
bit slippery have to wait and see
because I've only just now picked up the
phone the phone is running Android 4.3
jelly bean it will be upgradable
eventually to android 4.4 moving along
we've got some lenovo s930 this is their
phablet variety phone it is 6 inches
there is a 720p HD display which is a
little surprising because it's not going
to be quite as crisp and clear as other
phones especially not the high-end
device there are two front speakers with
dolby audio 8 megapixel rear camera 1.6
megapixel front facing camera it's too
has a quad-core processor one point
three gigahertz this time its media tech
that makes it not welcome on here you
also have android 4.2 jelly bean the
lenovo s650 rounds out the S series it's
got the same quad-core MediaTek
processor in here it's a smaller device
4.7 inches and it has the step down
a qHD resolution at 960 x 540 it's got
the same kind of rear cover which is
pretty neat 8-megapixel camera point
three megapixel front facing camera and
Android 4.2 jelly bean finally we've got
the Lenovo 8859 this one has a 5-inch HD
display against 720p not the 1080p here
you do have the 8 megapixel rear camera
the 1.6 megapixel front facing camera
and the same one point three gigahertz
quad-core MediaTek processor that we've
seen on three of the other phones this
is a dual sim card device and it's
running Android 4.2 to jelly bean these
lenovo phones are going to be going on
sale worldwide in January in February
respectively and the prices will range
from 220 of the low end to about 550 on
some high end so if you're interested
keep an eye out for them I'm just is all
for Christina you can catch all of our
great des news MPs cement</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
