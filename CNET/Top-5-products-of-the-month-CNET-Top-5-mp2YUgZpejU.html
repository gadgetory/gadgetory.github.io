readers have been checking out in the
last month we ran some numbers to see
what you guys were most interested in
during the past 30 days spoiler you guys
like bones let's get to it coming in at
number six is the 2019 GMC Sierra yes I
said number six and that'll make sense
in a little bit the Sierra is a massive
truck and it's got a lot of interesting
features the tailgate can operate in a
number of configurations it can expand
be used as a step or even a workstation
when you decide you want to bring your
boat along check out to the infotainment
system you can define what you're
trailering there and it even gives you a
checklist so you can make sure
everything is securely attached the
infotainment system can also handle
Android auto or apple carplay
coming at number five is the Apple
iPhone 10 are the most affordable of the
new iPhones the 10r is not yet available
it has a lot of the features of the
fancier iPhone 10s models with a few
compromises sure it has one rear camera
and an LCD screen but it has the
top-of-the-line processor
face ID and can handle depth of field
effects like the other iPhones it looks
like you guys want to know more about
the 10r
before choosing a 10 model and number
four is the sony WH 1000 X mark 3
these are Wireless noise cancelling
headphones the design of the XM 3 is
more comfortable than the previous
version
additionally Sony uses USB C to charge
the WH 1000 x m3 instead of micro a new
microphone system makes these headphones
better as a headset noise cancelling
matches and may surpass that of the
industry leader Bose and here's what the
numbering gets a little weird at number
three is the iPhone 10's max and number
two would be the iPhone 10 s if you
combine them as one phone it would be
number one so with all that being said
I'm going to lump them together here
Apple's latest iPhones have definitely
grabbed your attention
the huge max packs a 6.5 inch screen the
largest screen in an iPhone yet
otherwise the two models share a lot of
the same features take a look at Apple's
own 10s compare page
lots and lots of the same features both
have the a12 processor true tone display
3d touch cameras and face ID I know if I
were deciding between the 10s and max
I'd be checking out CNET's reviews Scott
and Jess know what they're talking about
and then number one is the Samsung
Galaxy Note nine similar to the iPhone
10s you're looking at an investment of
around a thousand bucks
of course you're researching the note
nine has some great features storage
starts at 128 gigabytes the new S Pen
works as a remote if the pen runs out of
charge it still operates as a stylus the
note 9 has top-of-the-line specs
everywhere along with a huge four
thousand milliamp hour battery is the
note 9 for everybody maybe not but it
definitely is drawing eyeballs that does
it for us and if you were wondering what
number 25 would be on this list that
would be the naked labs body scanner yes
that's a real thing
Amaya Zak turn I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
