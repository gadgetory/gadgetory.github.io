earlier this year was the razor blade
stealth this was a high-end 12.5 inch
laptop from Razer a company best known
for gaming laptops and accessories but
rather than another highly designed
gaming system the stealth was a pure
Ultrabook now we've got an updated
version of the stealth with a new low
voltage core i7 and better battery life
at the same time we also have increased
competition from the excellent second
generation of Apple's 12-inch MacBook as
well as 12-inch windows laptops like the
new Asus Zenbook 3 but despite the more
competitive landscape Razer is still the
price King when it comes to premium
ultra books the $9.99 base model it's a
really great value with the same better
than HD touch display and core i7
processor as more expensive
configurations including the one we
tested which had more RAM and hard drive
space one of the standout features is
Razer signature chroma backlit keyboard
it's an under the fingers light show
unmatched by anyone else it's basically
a backlit keyboard that can display
millions of color combinations in a wide
variety of patterns it's a fun little
show-off feature but can also be
distracting if you're actually trying to
get some work done
unlike most 12-inch laptops you actually
get real USB ports here not just a
single USBC for charging but it's also
been on the big side for 12-inch laptop
closer to the 13-inch MacBook Air then
the 12-inch MacBook still the Razer
Blade stealth is a well made high design
laptop and a really good value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
