you don't want to pay professional level
prices if you want to spend less than
you would on something like I don't know
a Lenovo ThinkPad x1 tablet or a
Microsoft Surface pro 4 well then you've
got Dells new latitude 11 5000 series
Nestle's right in there more powerful
and more capable than a lot of the least
expensive atom powered tablets that's
because this guy has an Intel Core M
process at the second generation of
those programs that give you decent
performance really good battery I've
designed for really slimmed really light
systems that don't need a lot of fan
cooling all right now this version right
here it's got a 10.8 inch screen it's
actually got some nice features you
don't usually see in mid-price tablets
and then it's got a 1920 by 1080 Full HD
display it's got a magnesium alloy
chassis and of course if you wanted to
turn it into a clamshell laptop if you
just snap on one of the couple of
keyboard docks they have this is the
most traditional looking one right here
and you have something that looks and
feels like a regular laptop you put the
entire thing together and it's going to
cost about 750 dollars to start when
it's available later this year at CES
2016 that is the Dell Latitude 11 5000
series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
