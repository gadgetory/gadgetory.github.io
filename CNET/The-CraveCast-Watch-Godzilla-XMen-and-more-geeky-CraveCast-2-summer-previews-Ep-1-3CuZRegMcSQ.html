20th 2014 I am Eric Mack in Taos New
Mexico creative contributor and I'm
joined by Michael Franco who is calling
in from North Carolina and I believe
they're in the studio in San Francisco
we have got Steven Beecham Bonnie Burton
and Kelsey Adams you guys all there oh
yeah all right excellent
so we're running this for the first time
out of the the big studio clicks there
so it's kind of cool to see all that in
effect and Michael's got the blue door
rock in there as well so glad we could
all be here we're coming up on Memorial
Day weekend and the traditional
beginning of summer which means we are
not too far from comic-con and a whole
bunch of Hollywood blockbusters and the
great summer geekiness that we always
expect when the temperatures warm a bit
so what we did here is we've we've
picked about nine or ten of the upcoming
summer geeky blockbusters that were most
anticipating some we might not be
completely anticipating we're gonna go
around and talk about them really quick
if you guys want to get in on the
conversation go ahead and tweet a
question or a comment too at crave and
we'll be monitoring those and that we
can get your questions and comments on
the air here as they come in so real
quick preview were gonna be talking
about in rough order of release Godzilla
x-men Days of Future past
Maleficent transformers age of
extinction the sink the signal guardians
of the galaxy edge of tomorrow dawn of
the Planet of the Apes Lucy and maybe a
little Batman bonus at the end if we
have time so that's what we're working
on here so first up Godzilla
this is the only one of these movies
that's out right now came out last week
on Friday and did insane like boot Quyen
and dollars all over the place and
they've already announced for sugar that
they're gonna be doing a sequel to this
coming up which i do not think is is any
surprise and i won't tell you why
because that would spoilers but let's go
ahead and go
what do you guys think start with Bonnie
Burton and Kelsey and Steven they're in
the studio you guys going to see this
are you excited for it what do you think
I'm a huge Godzilla fan I've heard so
many mixed reviews about Godzilla that
it's it's like okay it's like it's like
90% relationship issues with humans that
no one cares about and 10% monsters so
that's a problem with a lot of monster
movies I find that we you know but I
don't know I'll go see it because I love
gods Ellen anything I mean I watch the
Godzilla cartoon so I eat Godzilla
cereal I'll do anything with Godzilla's
showed up on Real Housewives of Beverly
Hills I would watch that show
so especially especially if he ruins all
of their homes I would watch that
so I all watch that I don't I don't
really care if it's it's crap or not so
if anything I'll just pretend it's
Breaking Bad sequel yeah Bryan Cranston
is the star which is one of the few
things I think I'm actually excited
about what do you think he'll see um
well what I wanted to say was actually
in response to something that I think
Michael Franco is gonna bring because an
article about this about Bryan Cranston
yeah
Time magazine where he said that what
drew him to doing this I mean it's his
first big picture after his after
Breaking Bad and he said that what drew
him to doing this was the fact that
Godzilla is so boy he basically said
Godzilla makes no apologies and just
goes around crushing stuff and that's
very boy and that's what he liked him as
a kid now and I actually did see it this
weekend and I'd say it's more like 50/50
monsters to human pretty good I may even
go see it again
really well so what drew you in the
human story or just the pure destruction
um definitely not the human story if
anything I think the acting was a little
bit light but the the way the
destruction is handled sort of there's
moments where it's you know like things
go silent and there's kind of this moody
atmospheric background I think it was
handled really really artfully instead
of just you know there's big crush and
destroy kind of movie it was handled in
in a really artful artfully way artful
way I heard that there's a lot more new
monsters to actually isn't there like I
heard that Godzilla was just a small
portion there's a lot of other new
monsters well this would be a spoiler
alert if I see if I say ear muffs ear
muffs everybody ear Muppet there's that
there's only two other monsters there's
a very low spoiler threshold on this one
I think to even reveal kind of the role
that Godzilla plays is a spoiler right
Michael can I just interrupt at this
point and completely derail the
conversation so so Michael when when you
posted that thing about bring Bonnie
retweeted this very cute cartoon on
Twitter this one yeah the artist is
Panda porch by the way she's great and
that little kid meets like a girl to me
and I just say yes okay that's a girl
that's what I'm seeing he's wanting to
be outrageous wanting to stomp around
and be obnoxious and rude and
destructive and rampage like yeah so
it's not a boy thing that's a human
thing and they tell us it's a boy thing
but actually Godzilla is for everyone
yeah I have to agree with that that's
that's one of those things that I
thought with all geek culture I think
we're at a point now that we don't have
to do the fake geek girl discussion
anymore at least I hope not
but little girls like monster movies
little girls like Star Wars little girls
like Star Trek little girls like
Godzilla we don't have to keep saying
this is guys only kind of give a more
universal sense about why we like
Godzilla so much you know the monsters
always coming you know that nature is
always coming I think that's you know
probably more well the funny things my
people like that so the funny thing too
is if you watch all the original
Godzilla films there's always a little
there's usually a little girl and all of
them and then if you watch the more
modern-day ones there's always a fighter
pilot that's a girl so there are women
in these well maybe not our movies but
they're all the
no Godzilla movies that are from the
sick 50s 60s 70s 80s 90s they all have
female characters that are pretty strong
female characters so especially little
girls and I mean if you are a fan of
Mothra you know that there's twin girls
that are kind of authors keeper so know
you're Godzilla what there is a girl
monster how can you tell I feel like
please don't tell me there's it matters
to them please don't tell me there's a
bra on one of them because I would be
really upset if that's how you tell
Godzilla remember when transformers did
that wasn't there a female transformers
and wasn't she was she paint I can't
remember anyway sorry but that's a good
segue what about Bonnie and Kelsey
Steven you guys gonna see this one or
wait for Netflix or what what Godzilla
Godzilla yeah I don't know I don't like
disaster movies to be honest but that in
no way invalid it's my point I want to
go but it doesn't cause like $100 for
IMAX now I don't remember like $20 for
popcorn $30 for soda I don't if I can
kick-start it I'll go well the next one
next movie on her list is one that I
know I would definitely spend $30 on
popcorn for this one
and that's x-men Days of Future past
which is I mean this isn't when it comes
to the movies we're looking at this is
kind of the all-star team of the summer
I think you got Patrick Stewart and Sir
Ian McKellen I mean I'm sold at that
point before you even bring in Hugh
Jackman and everyone else so it's got
it's got time travel in it it's got some
more origin stories particularly
professor Eck's
think I think I'm not sure what do you
guys think is this on your list it's
definitely on mine it's so excited yeah
it feels like x-men Boogie Nights I mean
I know it's not about the same thing
book net was but anytime I see something
with the 70s or 60s anything set in the
past
what is this timeline is that 60s or 70s
70s 70s yeah it's just a first class of
60 I think it's the lapels in the long
hair I I'm excited for this I think
there's gonna be good witty banter I
think that's a good thing with x-men is
even though it's it can be depressing
and heavy at times there's always that
possibility for jokes and especially
with Wolverine involved but I'm excited
for the cast and I'm excited for the
story we'll see all the Marvel movies
have done a really good job of drawing
that a great great cast and especially
what the one we'll talk about later with
the guardians of the galaxy also a great
cast also what a woody banner there must
be something I don't know if there's
something with the Marvel team or what
but I agree completely yeah no I mix I'm
excited for that like I think it's gonna
be fun III don't know we'll see it's
funny because it's great to see all
these comic book based movies coming out
all at once so I'm really looking
forward to x-men because I mean I've
always loved a series and partly for me
and I think for most people probably the
one of the big things about the x-men
story the way it's been shown is that
it's kind of saying everyone can be
special like all the weird kids are
actually special you know you feel - I
do you feel too smart but every
professor X's at home for you you know
whereas in the the Marvel movies and the
shield show that I've been watching and
been loving but there's definitely this
undercurrent that only a few people are
really the heroes and anyone else is
just dangerous yeah like you think
you're special but you're wrong you
diluted you need to be taken down yeah
so it's really nice for me to get back
to here and be like hey everyone in this
preview is flying around yeah you know
everyone's jumping around they've all
got costumes this is gonna be great yeah
I mean what do you think is a unanimous
you agree Michael I do
yeah I definitely agree with that and
I'm definitely gonna see the movie just
because of the you know what it's about
and you know I think it's gonna be a
spectacle but I I tend I'm not looking
forward to it as much as other x-men
movies because time-travel movies kind
of freak me out I think I'm too literal
that couldn't happen
you can't do that I'm Welch
I'm well trained and ignoring that
because of Doctor Who that's a great
reference yeah Mystery Science Theater
is sci-fi just don't pay attention to
much it's so fine I remember getting
into really heavy arguments with my
college buddies about The Simpsons
about stuff and then we had to stop for
a minute and go oh wait a minute a
cartoon it's not real it's a cartoon
supposed to care that they don't age
ever it's just you know you're gonna go
on with the steel endoskeleton you got
to go along alright I think we're
unanimous x-men there the next one on
our list I'm not quite sure about this
that's Maleficent this is coming out May
30th and it's kind of Disney's creepy
take on Sleeping Beauty and this is also
an origin story it's actually the origin
story of Maleficent who's that mean evil
stepmother in the Sleeping Beauty tale
it's kind of like as far as I can tell
this is kind of like what wicked creepy
or is it whitewashed you know I don't
know Angelina Jolie look at her she
those cheekbones are awesome is that
digitally enhanced she's got some makeup
issues it's all her teeth are always
pretty I mean that's Hollywood nobody
has real teeth there but those can't be
real no they're they're prosthetic that
yeah this whole thing is a CGI I imagine
her cheek no there's a real castle
that's a real Prague right that's all
Prague that's she almost looks a little
too powerful in this trailer it looks
like she can just flick her finger and
pretty much do anything she wants again
that's the point when a character gets
that powerful and I'm gonna have this
comment again about Lucy yeah it starts
to become you know I don't know
unrealistic if you can apply that to a
movie like this I don't know I love her
in this and I love her wings i love that
they make her like a Valkyrie almost
like
she I'm excited for this movie one cuz
Angelina Jolie I think is just owning it
I mean look at that look at that mean
girl smile she's great and and I think
that the story is gonna be really fun I
don't think it's gonna be a kids movie
which is gonna be interesting to see how
many little girls and little boys that
watch this are kind of nightmares for
the rest of their lives
and it is you know Kelsey you were
saying did they kind of whitewash the
story and from what I understand it is
kind of like trying to make her a little
bit of a sympathetic character who was
just she had a bad childhood and so did
that with Darth Vader I mean come on I
mean every bad villain has not all
villains are born evil a lot of them
were made evil and I think that this is
a I'm excited for this but the funny
thing the backstory on this is I can't
remember which character I but this when
the little girl is super small her own
daughter had to play this role because
when they auditioned small children to
act with Angelina Jolie when she was all
had all of her makeup and prosthetics on
they all cried and ran from the room so
the only little girl who did it was her
own because she knew that was her mom
behind all that so her kids make an
appearance in this film which is kind of
interesting Entertainment Weekly I think
did a story on that so I I'm just excite
a big fan of Disney fairy tale type
stuff so I'm I'm stoked for this I don't
know maybe it's just because I'm goth
ins like off side just wants to see
Angelina Jolie be evil I'm not going to
see it in in protest because in fact not
only am I not gonna see it I have to
basically hide the fact that there's a
Sleeping Beauty moody movie for my
six-year-old
this is gonna be too scary for her so
I'm gonna express solidarity in it you
can't wait for Cinderella
you can wait Cinderella teaser trailer
just came out this I think this is
really reboot
it's hahaha nice one the teaser trailer
the reason I'm laughing at reboot
because that's a shoe pun as all they
did and I hate teaser trailers for this
very teaser trailers usually just show
the spinning
logo or they do have beaten switch where
they make you think it's gonna be a
horror film but thence the Muppets it's
like maybe stuff like that right but
this was just a picture of there's no
spoilers here by the way it was just a
revolving image of CGI glass slippers
which look very strippery' were not
8-inch heels they were not cha-cha heels
these are cha-cha heels I feel like this
is step up to or something like well
maybe not I mean oh no Barbie didn't
exactly wear sensible shoes that's that
it's a minute long minute of shoot it's
like a really long Jimmy Choo ad to Jax
I do want to know actually I might do
some recon because I want to know who
designed those shoes because if it was
an actual Jimmy Choo you type right
probably smart
anyway anyway yeah look how high that
heel is oh my god and look how the angle
is for your foot those are Betty Page
shoes yeah those are and then the little
butterfly lands on it yeah it's a
butterfly killer okay anyway sorry we're
skeptical of all fairy tales
we're so judgmental
well here we can we can fix that a
little bit with the next movie that's a
next one transformers age of extinction
and you can be cynical about the
Transformers franchise and about Michael
Bay but when it comes down to it it's
dinosaur transformers and Mark Wahlberg
I know BOTS know more
you know Dinobots
I haven't actually seen any of these
Transformers movies are you serious I
watch I love them I only saw the first
one I thought the first one is good I am
a horrible person because I love them
all because I don't take them seriously
and I was never a hardcore transformers
cartoon fan I love the cartoon but those
weren't exactly Citizen Kane either I
rewatched the cartoons a few years ago
it was kind of funny how just odd and
childlike the robots are like they
really don't think like humans now but
then again most aliens are kind of
childlike with an ant farm that's us
Michael what do you think of
transformers
you know based on the trailer I'm
definitely gonna see it it's somehow I
missed the whole Transformers thing in
my life like I was just like my brother
who's 7 years younger than me was a huge
transformer fan and had the toys and
watch the cartoons and everything and I
just I don't know I fell into this hole
where there was no Transformers in my
life so I haven't really watched the
cartoons or seen the other movies but
this trailer you know it looks fun I'm
kind of sold on Mark Wahlberg I feel
like that's an upgrade for this
franchise I mean I've got a paperweight
on my desk that would be an upgrade from
Shia downgrade in Mark Wahlberg view and
I think he's really relatively savvy
about the action films he does and he's
a pretty decent actor he's actually
really funny to Sony's and comedies he's
pretty great but you could argue there's
no such thing as a 20 million dollar
downgrade - here's the thing - Michael
Bay is Michael Bay you can't expect him
to be David Lynch she can't expect him
to be Wes Anderson he is what he is and
that's he's always gonna be that and if
you don't like Michael Bay ask movies
you probably shouldn't go see
transformers this is the only part that
I'm gonna see them
yeah I mean he's writing one that's
I know I will say especially after
seeing the very first Transformers my
favorite thing about transformers is the
sound design oh yeah because the sound
design is so dead-on brilliant so well
thought out it's just it especially if
you're in a theater that has a really
good sound it just reverberates the
whole building and it's just amazing so
I really not in an obtrusive way but it
just made everything happening on the
screens so much more like like heavy
things were heavy yeah I don't think
people really give sound designers
enough credit and that to me it can make
or break a movie especially if you watch
really crappy sci-fi movies on Netflix
and the sounds is like I do sound
designs not there it can ruin a whole
movie it really really can so I think
that's something people should you know
give kudos to so we're all gonna go see
this one in IMAX it sounds like if I can
kick-start it yeah I can't afford IMAX
maybe I'll just sit by a speaker if I
can find the speaker I'll sit by it I'll
come over and crush tin cans outside
your window body okay cool I appreciate
that tomorrow that's transformers age of
extinction coming out in June so the
next one on the list is kind of the
oddball indie film on the list it's
called the signal it's starting Laurence
Fishburne and I watch the trailers and I
look for as much information online as I
could and I still can't really tell you
what this movie is about all I know is
that it involves hackers and waking up
imprisoned in the desert and some kind
of conspiracy theories I was kind of
interested in it because it was filmed
here in New Mexico and actually here in
Taos where I'm sitting right now and
yeah that's much else about it it's kind
of intriguing it's a Sundance movie like
I said it's it's indie do you guys know
anything about this that I don't you've
said everything I know yeah I don't I
don't really know anything about it like
I didn't hear any buzz about it or
anything so I don't I mean it's good to
see Laurence Fishburne and something
other besides an insurance commercial so
I'm glad you're acting again that's
awesome
do you want to know what the signal is
now it is intriguing yeah yeah film
tackles something in the sci-fi sort of
realm you know looks really seeing
massive reductions to see a small boat
maybe a smaller budget film tackle
tackle the genre and it looks really
slick for there's a cow there's a cow
are you sure it's about hackers and
aside about alien abduction I know it
looks like well it could be both but the
the characters are definitely hackers
well aliens are smart they would start
abducting hackers and not dumb farmers
that just get probed Matt grew up in
Kansas and I've never met anyone that
was abducted by an alien in Kansas but
as soon as I moved to Colorado
apparently everyone in the trailer park
kept getting infected so I don't know
what that means
design I saw that earlier only we had
the Internet okay I do like that more
and more indie directors and filmmakers
are trying to do sci-fi and monster
films I think that's great I mean
obviously district 9 was a great thing
monster with Gareth who did Godzilla
I mean he started off with monster so
director of the signal is William Ewbank
by the way okay I mean I don't know I'll
probably wait till it's on Netflix or
on-demand or something I don't normally
go to a theater for indie films when I
saw the the trailer it kind of reminded
me a little bit about Europa report
which is a really lesser-known indie
film from last year space travel sci-fi
thing that was that was really good and
nobody thought it was good I was well
done and it was smart and wrong so I
have hopes for this based on a slight
Renaissance of the indie sci-fi that I
think might be doing is that the one
where astronaut an astronaut was sent
out and
space - I miss the name well you wrote a
report your report no they land on your
Robo which is all right now I'm thinking
of a different trailer that just came
out by the way one of the things William
Ewbank has done is called crave
endorsement any what's really young cool
so it sounds like we're waiting for
Netflix on this one what do you think
Michael so the next one our list I think
by the way that comes out also in June
the signal so another one now this one's
coming out in August but I think will be
worth the way there's guardians of the
galaxy
another Marvel one with a really super
weird cast of characters
well Rocket Raccoon oh yeah they're all
incredibly excited about this one guy
yeah it's good Chris Friday I don't even
want to talk during the trailer I'm so
excited
I think the first trailers better than
the second one
what's the ball over and over whatever
star-lord who star-lord man it's
legendary out locked
oh okay I mean these five bands and our
check out the rap sheets
aka the destroyer since his wife and
family were killed he's been on a
rampage across the galaxy in the search
for vengeance Gamora soldier assassin
one run over a dozen counts of murder
rocket one on over 50 charges of
vehicular theft and escaped from locker
room it's been traveling recently as
Rockets personal houseplants / muscle
Peter Jason quill he's also known as
star-lord
he calls in that himself mostly he's
wanted largely on charges of minor
assaults public intoxication and fraud
Paul I'm sorry I I didn't know how this
machine worked so good but to me this is
like channeling and Chris Pratt is like
channeling Nathan Fillion from like oh
yeah but he's better I'm not prefer he's
doing more of a loser thing like melon
Firefly was not a loser
this guy's sort of a rebel and me misfit
offbeat sense maybe I don't know captain
Moll definitely had this misfit element
to him in an angry sense of humor yeah
yeah short fuse I think in a more heroic
yeah I wasn't yeah I was temperamental
in a different way and you know anytime
you you know it's so good that they have
a good mix of Americans and Brits in
this - that was Peter
sarin Seraph I can never pronounce his
last name I know Sarah and geeks will
know him as the voice of Darth Maul but
he's also been and a bazillion things I
mean he's a really well-known comedic
actor and in the UK as well and he was
also on Parks and Rec because when Chris
Pratt was in London filming guardians of
the galaxy that's why they had a London
British episode of Parks and Rec is
because they wanted to make sure Chris
was still in the show while he was
filming and Karen Gillan's in this -
yeah Oh from Doctor Who anyway and Zooey
and Peter Dinklage yeah Peter and Zoey's
and everything Zoey's in every sci-fi
show which I'm okay with Bradley
Cooper's the voice of rocket racoon
which I I don't really like him as actor
by might like him now because we can't
see his smug face and diesel so I I'm
looking forward to this because this is
the misfit sci-fi movie of the year that
I've been wanting to see forever I'm
actually more excited to see
this than the new Star Wars when it
comes out I know that's a blasphemy yeah
I worked really whose phone for like a
decade so I feel like I have to return
my Lucasfilm card but Ari walks are
gonna come for me in the night but I
cannot wait for this I love the comic
I've been wanting this to happen for so
long it's funny cuz Star Wars sort of
has an equivalent to this called Wraith
squadron which has a Jackson the rabbit
which is the green rabbit and Star Wars
is all expanded universe expand the
universe so as we know Disney's already
said yeah you're not getting that movie
but it's it's got like a grammar
grammarian guard Jedi in it - I mean
there's so many great things so I'm I'm
always for misfits I'm always for
animals that shouldn't be talking but
our I'm just so excited for this I think
it's me funny and it's gonna be witty
and it's gonna be action-packed and the
trailer really sold it to me that this
is the one that's gonna be a little
different from the other Marvel movies
gonna be the one with the attitude I
have nothing but faith and James Gunn I
think he's a great director I'm excited
that he's doing this um I think people
are gonna be surprised pleasantly about
this movie Joseph Smith says on Twitter
that the completes our complete silence
during the trailer shows that this is
pretty clearly our favorite how could
you tell I actually watched this trailer
at least once a day now I watch all the
trailers by really and then I do because
I can't I'm so excited for this it gives
me chills and I'm just so I'm just so
thrilled it's it's when you're a jaded
sci-fi fan and a jaded comic book fan
like I am when you finally see something
you're like oh that's how you're
supposed to feel with all of these
movies we're talking about
unfortunately I'm actually not looking
forward to this one at the risk of
really all the same reasons you guys are
looking forward to it like I kind of
don't like comedy in my sci-fi you know
I like them the more big serious you
know kind of sci-fi things in the
comedy just always here takes me in
general I don't watch comedy movies so
that's probably why this one's just not
resonating with me I've tried and tried
to like it but it's just not moving not
a Simon Pegg fan no really my bet DC guy
the like the characters look cool but I
think I think the comedy is what's
turning me off a little bit and and also
I like like you know more of an x-men
kind of fans so I like people who have
powers and these characters don't look
like that but there's comedy and x-men
oh there's comedy x-men I mean that's
what Wolverine though I mean it's funny
Deadpool's just put in there to irritate
Wolverine and the last movies I mean I'm
still waiting for a Deadpool movie I was
hoping that was gonna happen with Ryan
Reynolds but who knows where that lies
and that's definitely comedy because all
he does all deadpool does is break the
fourth wall it upset Wolverine actually
had a question do I have to see the most
recent Wolverine movie before I see the
new x-men movie yeah that's a good
question oh yeah I think people on
Twitter should answer that because I
honestly I don't think I think it's
gonna be fine as a standalone but yeah
it is a good question cuz there are
things that might tie it in yeah anyway
okay movie gave me come to a Galaxy
Quest vibe when I when I first saw the
track
music hey Steven so we've got three more
movies we're at 30 minutes to kill are
we cool to keep going yeah yeah okay
alright well I think we're three to one
on
guardians of the galaxy and maybe wins
so another one okay so this is another
one that I forget one of us was excited
about this one it's called edge of
tomorrow with Tom Cruise and this is
basically a movie where you see Tom
Cruise wearing an insane exoskeleton get
killed over and over again he just and
that's Emily Blunt for those wanting to
know who else is in this film
it's basically Starship Troopers grand
Hawks day yeah so you just watch not
it's funny a starship well I never saw
the movie on time at the book actually
okay
Touche sorry no I'm not attached alright
I just read the book of Link's I look at
those so I have kind of mixed feelings
on this one I haven't been too happy
with Tom Cruise is a sci-fi attempt so I
wasn't big on oblivion and I'm
withholding judgment you know if I don't
entirely aside from the trailer I don't
know what this is about but it seems to
have this oblivion theme of it and that
he can get killed and keep coming back
so I find it odd that he's in another
movie where he gets killed and comes
back well no it's the groundhog stay
play you know every day you get a chance
to use a clone and I guess here he
actually yeah I said a clone he's just a
regular dude but he has to be trained by
Emily Blunt over and over and over so he
can actually become a soldier and I
think it's pretty funny that she keeps
shooting him to start the day over
because and she's the one that's the
ultimate soldier which I love that that
they make a female the ultimate soldier
that's training him to be a soldier well
there's a line in the movie where she
says I'm not a soldier I'm a weapon
right yeah but there's still very
lengthy training montages yeah because
you have to have that no Tom Cruise
movie which is basically reminded me of
Starship Troopers because it's like
you're going up against this you know
vile and looks alien over and over but
what does that make you you're basically
human flyswatter you're just yeah you
become nothing but luckily there's no
Busey in this one ship troopers have
some real political overtones it's
probably the most quoted sci-fi film
ever like I love the humor in it I mean
Michael would hate it but I know
the fact that he is doing these movies
where he keeps you know being
reincarnated here's the thing I I
Scientology is what it is I I was raised
in a very religious Catholic family so
to me all religion sort of has that
sci-fi element to it so whether it's
angels or aliens I to me it's all the
same it's just a matter of what you put
into your faith and Scientology is crazy
controversial but Tom Cruise is an actor
I think is really good and he totally
commits and I don't care if he's crazy
if he's a good actor and I believe him
in that character I think he's great
because there's a lot of really crazy
actors in Hollywood religion aside and
if you could put their kind of their
personal life to the side and really
focus on whether or not they're talented
to me that's what matters if your
characters are known for their intensity
he does his own stunts a lot of time
he's paying for a lot of these movies to
be made he's producing these movies I
love that he likes sci-fi just as much
as he likes Mission Impossible or Jack
Jerry started I don't know I don't know
so I I'm glad that he does sci-fi but
you are you're correct didn't some of
these movies are starting to blend in so
Bolivian and this could kind of be
blending into each other it just makes
you wonder how he makes his decisions
what he's gonna do but who knows I think
he just goes for it and honestly you
know I I can't think of too many flops
he's been in recently so I feel like a
lot of this money is well spent I don't
know I I'm I'm excited to see him in
this I'll go see it because I I love
Emily Blunt and I love this concept and
I like movies that kind of warp
timelines it has a good Groundhog Day
fan so you know by the way if you guys
like the sorry they Groundhog's Day plot
there's a cop thriller with the
groundhogs a plaid starting Taye Diggs
Adam Baldwin from Firefly Victoria Pratt
from Cleopatra 255 you can get it on
Netflix it's really good I recommend it
what's it called daybreak two words like
daybreak but it's two words nice Adam
Baldwin's another one that you have to
separate person
life-form acting right he's little he's
horrible conservative well he's really
bad at conventions and he's bad to other
actors so you know but again he's really
good at being Jane though yeah I mean I
went to see Ender's Game even though
there was all that controversy with
Ender's Game so it's it's just a matter
of what do you care about and what do
you want to throw your money at and I
don't know it's it is hard for socially
responsible sci-fi fans these days she's
great unfortunately since we are talking
about sci-fi we don't have to bring up
what yelling so anyway and so okay two
more to go and I am really hoping that
we will all universally pan this next
one because this is my least favorite
reboot I think ever and so it's the
second one in the Planet of the Apes
dawn of the Planet of the Apes and so
this is number two after Rise of the
Planet of the Apes with James Franco so
now we're 15 years in the future beyond
that one we don't have James Franco
anymore and I think we just have this
this movie is apparently just a bridge
to get us to the third movie which is
already in process
I have no new yeah good cast though I
mean the Gary Oldman was at the
beginning
he's timeless he's a vampire he's
Dracula he doesn't need trick question
yeah look at those eyes seem to anybody
a little bit maybe I'm not gonna open
that kind of worms
you're gonna say Mel Gibson we're in No
just for the record I always root for
the Apes I never I never wait for the
humans the humans had it coming
it really does roots for the trees yeah
seriously
humans had it coming I these movies
original movies were some of my favorite
movies because the political aspects
it's supposed to reflect the times
they're made in and that's I mean
they're they teach these original plan
the Apes movies and social history
classes a lot of times in college
because they reflect directly with
social injustice and they used to be
great and I mean they weren't the
special effects weren't there clearly
but they were believable now I don't
know if that is still in those movies or
if they're just kind of sci-fi horror
films now I don't know if they still
have a political message so I I might go
see it I might I don't think I'll go see
it in a theater like I'm out I don't
know saying I'll wait for Netflix is
such a lazy cop-out because I watch
everything on that place I mean it
doesn't matter so it's true
so I'll still watch I just don't throw
money on it I don't know what do you
guys think so you'll watch it instead of
sleeping how do you how do you pan
something as a movie fan when you pretty
much watch everything anyway I just
won't go out of my way to see it but if
it's on Netflix I'll watch it so I don't
know what that makes me
passive ly caring I don't know normal
this it's because didn't Tim Burton
direct one of them yeah Marky Mark mark
mark I'll never call him Mark director
Matt Reeves who's also done oh well if
you want that I don't know it's not that
it really matters
Felicity part of the robot crew under
siege to dark territory that's terrible
Oh No so was anyone interested in this
what did you think Michael
I'm not interested especially since
James Franco's not a that who shares my
last name keeps doing a bunch of other
stuff though I think he has another
movie that's coming out that he wrote
the screenplay
I mean he doesn't sleep and he have you
seen his weird he's like whispering and
then the mics like there's everything
half the movie there's just going like I
don't I'm probably gonna get lambasted
on our Twitter for this but I kind of
feel like he's like a young David Lynch
in the sense that he's got a lot of
weird stuff going on David Lynch has
he's doing filmed he's doing films that
he just wants to see he doesn't care if
you want to see it or not and he does
coffee and he does weather reports and
he writes books and he does art shows I
kind of feel like that's what James does
is he's just doing whatever he wants and
if you want to come along for the ride
great and if not he doesn't really care
but he's got a great following I loved
him on the soap opera he did when he's
basically playing himself as an actor on
a soap opera like that was a giant like
art project and like a medium that a lot
of people take very seriously so I agree
with you on at least on James Franco
that if I were in his position I'd like
to think that I would if I had a month
to kill or so I'm gonna go film and alan
ginsberg movie instead of make a Capital
One commercial yeah yeah yeah I mean and
the great thing is his choices are so
left-field I mean he did a weird art
show where he was basically just drying
male anatomy on everything and then he's
done like poetry readings and then he's
done audiobooks which is kind of a
no-brainer most actors do audiobooks but
just what he chooses to do and his
off-time is just so bizarre and and and
kind of commendable because no one can
really figure him out and he's cool with
hipsters but also that's okay because
even though he's cool tipsters we still
like him because I know that's like the
thing to hate on hipster love so I don't
know I I kind of want him to do sci-fi
stuff so
maybe he'll do more he was in that OS
maybe that's true yeah I actually got
his master's degree in my little town
here in North Carolina you know so there
were all these James Franco sightings
around town while he was working on his
his poetry masters so he sandals isn't
it a lot of masters he's got a peach two
PhDs and they weren't honorary he like
actually went to class for them and hang
out with Kesha
so we endorsed the actor that's not in
the mood I don't know I you know what
I'm not gonna go see this movie so
they're done next so okay so that one is
in July down on the planet of the apes
if you totally disagree with us go check
it out so the last one let's do one more
we'll save the Batman stuff for a future
crave gasps oh boy one more that's
coming out this summer is Lucy and I am
excited for this but I think both the
right and the wrong reasons reasons
probably being associated Scarlett
Johansson who stars in it I don't know
what you mean Erik reasons being it's
kind of a fascinating premise but the
basic idea is that she's a woman who is
taken and forced knocked out of them
they basically put drugs in her she's a
drug mule against her will and the drugs
leaked and somehow this gives her access
to more of her brain than the average
bear and she basically turns into a
insane fighting machine so it's
basically a lot of Scarlett Johansson
just kickin butt but also there's kind
of an interesting you know I guess
biotech aspect to it no did anyone else
here read Hyland's book Friday this is
based on not I wouldn't say so but the
whole thing so this there's a super
strong like genetically altered woman
and in the beginning she's told that
she's smuggling something in her belly
button like this lady and then it all
turns out to be a scam and they're gonna
kill her and I think actually she was
pregnant sorry book spoilers but yeah it
just made me think of that in the
beginning and I went
if anyone else about that - I guess not
I'm just gonna pretend this is black
widow on vacation so I have a question I
think Michael Franco's shares this with
me once she gets so powerful where does
the story go from there like if
characters don't have limits it becomes
more a question of what is she what does
she want
what's her goal but their endgame here
yeah exactly she seems pretty she seems
like he could do absolutely everything
you know from from reading Wi-Fi signals
in the air to disintegrating people with
a snap of her fingers so I think that is
the question it's in the trailer that it
kind of becomes a battle against the
self because she's like battling against
you know the old her this is making her
less human and less empathic but so
she's kind of badly to preserve her old
self then there's this Morgan Freeman
character that seems to be playing some
kind of a guide I'm guessing that's
where it goes I don't well and of course
the name Lucy you know the first human
is called Lucy the priest human skeleton
so nod to human evolution
she's been next you pulling in the
science I wish I could swipe traffic
away and that you putting everyone to
sleep I can't tell you how many annoying
drunks are outside the bus stop outside
my home at 3:00 in the morning I would
love to do that and I'm gonna be there
with ten kids all the powers I want
which is being able to find things
quickly changed my hair instantly yeah
she's like shapeshifter fighting machine
I'm down I'll watch it I mean it's an
interesting idea what could you do if
you can actually use the full potential
of your brain I'm not sure why affecting
your hair color in the physical world
would actually be part of that but you
know it's just just go with it it's a
Harry Potter tongs thing we all want to
be able to change our appearance easily
like a shapeshifter because then it's
also you can hide within plain sight as
well not just vanity issues but you know
one thing I really love about this movie
- not only because it's a strong female
character kicking butt but you have to
kind of wonder when you have that much
access to everything in your brain how
quickly do you go insane right um we're
gonna see that probably and are we gonna
see that mean we kind of you know that's
not that's a trope that shows up in a
lot of sci-fi TV comics movies where if
you kind of get the god gene if you
suddenly
become this overpowered human what do
you do with that the parable you don't
have the practice you don't have the
setup yeah you haven't built the control
mechanism superheroes are people that
have sudden power do you use it for good
to use it for bad do you just use it to
cheat things that you didn't get before
if you're lucky you have some baby steps
yeah I'm interested that the other
recent movie with pretty much the same
premise has not come up yet and I'm
thinking maybe that's because it stars
Bradley Cooper limitless that's right
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
you become he's like a frustrated writer
and he takes the pill and he gets his
book done and then gets a whole lot more
stuff done I'm not sure it's like the
anti answer aren't archiving over its
like pre hangover psychologist yeah I
don't know I don't like this one better
cuz I think I love where it's set I
don't know I can't wait to see it I'll
go see this and I love seeing Morgan
Freeman as a guide or any kind of like
Yoda ask Kara it's kind of funny because
it seems like she's gonna turn into a
god at the end maybe been working
Freeman is God talking about this not to
give any spoilers right because we won't
but at the very season or series finale
of Supernatural on CW I'm hoping that
God shows up and I really hope it's
Morgan Freeman cuz that would be great
cuz he just needs to play God and
everything that could be great but your
theory that it would be a woman but if
it's a woman yeah but if it's CW well
the problem supernatural is they don't
always
they'll probably you know it the first
two seasons is supernatural it was like
every demon was a Hooters waitress so I
don't know if they'll really make that
and vice versa and vice versa so anyway
sorry tangent but yeah I'm excited for
this movie I will totally go see it
sorry
yeah Michael anything yeah Franco I kind
of agree with with your initial
assessment Erik I'm definitely going to
see it you know probably largely because
of scarlet but I
think you know it's it looks like a good
movie and a good action movie but you
know I guess I also have this thing that
I said earlier that you know when a
character become so so powerful the
movie just you can almost get a little
bit boring you know where she could just
wave her finger and pretty much do
absolutely anything conceivable it's
it's you know I don't know that it makes
for a good movie but we'll see I'm gonna
see it something just occurred to me and
we're talking about the choices of the
character choices and the roles people
take so you know this evolving
transcendent characters kind of also
what happened with scar Joe's character
in her eye so I wonder if maybe maybe
she has some sort of a keep in mind to
the movie release date is not signifying
when they were filmed so a lot of times
movies are filmed not released are
filmed out of order of when they
actually were in them so her evolution
as an actress and what she's choosing
his roles that may not quite have the
same relevance we kind of want it to but
I loved her I thought that was a great
movie and I guess yeah it's sci-fi right
yeah so I would or just is it just from
five years from now I don't know okay
I've got a comment from favorite
colleague Jeff Sparkman on Twitter here
and I'm not sure he's referring to you
but he says that basic premise reminds
me of the Teen Titans Vil in the
Terminator both are based on that ten
percent myth oh if they using your brain
yeah I just I wonder about that to you
if you could have the capacity to use
all of your brain would you really be
that much smarter or would it just be
amplifying how you already are which is
just amazing memory yeah like a migraine
if you were always a douchebag and you
could use all of your brain would you
still be a douche bag but with powers
imagine having a migraine 10 times as
bad and you'd be annoyed with dumb
people even more yeah sleep like she
does in the trailer or like Maleficent
yeah but it's just I feel like if you're
already kind of annoyed with dumb people
and you become God like smart how do you
keep from just pushing everyone off a
bridge that you think stupid I know
you're gonna get a stern lecture for
Morgan Freeman oh that's it that's it
Morgan Freeman's your base of morality
for everything yeah I think we have a
real world analog here I think you
become Bill Clinton you become really
smart really charismatic but still
sleazy I would like that in the movie
characters you become a sleazy a really
sleazy superhero well actually um the
young professor exit their showing in
these movies it's kind of like yeah yeah
we did a drinking game one time watching
x-men first class and one of the things
you drank on was every time Xavier does
something that kind of douchey and yeah
we were all pretty sozzled in the first
minute or so Captain Kirk is probably
the one of the sleaziest but he's not
really a superhero
he's just excuse me oh sorry sorry sorry
yeah I mean we should do that maybe we
should write a scene that article of our
favorite sleazy superheroes I feel like
that's I mean it's a little BuzzFeed
esque but I think we could get away with
it on CNET crazy okay so Twitter send us
your suggestions of your favorite sleazy
super whoo yes and we'll go I think I
think we're pretty much wrapping up here
Lucy comes out in August at some point
so watch for that so one last thing we
could do Kelsey you suggested maybe we
could go around and just kind of blurt
out some some things that we would like
to see maybe we could do movies we'd
most like to see in the future so you
want somebody to make okay I'll go first
cuz I'd go story just went up today the
Blade Runner sequel I mean huge Blade
Runner fan by the way I got some angry
comments on Twitter for people saying
how dare he's saying that Deckard's are
replicant I didn't say that in the
article that says that some fans think
he's a replicant so you can draw your
own conclusions so the whole thing is
that Alcon entertainment asked this week
Harrison Ford if he would be interested
in reprise in his world as Deckard in
the Blade Runner sequel if you recently
want read his AMA on reddit which we
covered on CNET he did actually cover
this art of our this comment last month
when a fan asked him about Blade Runner
sequel and if he'd do it and he said
he'd be if the script was good he'd be
very interested and he liked working
with Ridley Scott even though before
they had sort of a a weird past where
they argued a lot on set
when it first was being filmed the
original in 1982 so but he's interested
in coming back what in the AMA he said
that he hasn't said that recently
because of course as we know he's in
London right now filming Star Wars as
Han Solo reprising his role and even
though the 2008 Indiana Jones movie
didn't do so well when he came back is
indeed there is pretty heavy rumor that
he's gonna be doing another Indiana
Jones movie after Star Wars so we'll see
if you know he's gonna be playing
Deckard I would love to see Sean Young
come back as Rachel but we'll see if
that happens too but I'm excited if
there is a Blade Runner sequel because
Ridley Scott will be the director and
the original screenplay was written by
the original screenplay writer of Blade
Runner the original one but it's being
reprised again I'm not reprise it's
being rewritten again by another writer
so hopefully it'll be good so fingers
crossed
you'll see oh I'm waiting for Wonder
Woman movies oh yeah I'm not too
thrilled by the casting of the one
that's happening I'm not gonna get into
that but I just want them to keep making
more and more Wonder Woman movies until
they hit one that I like that's what I'm
craving iiw with that I can get behind
that to Michael Franco you got one
well I'll quadruple agree to the Wonder
Woman show crush on Lynda Carter when I
was little so I'd like to see that
reprised and I'm speaking of Chris Pratt
there's you know these rumors of Oh or
maybe confirmation that there's a new
Knight Rider movie movie coming out mmm
it was kind of a Knight Rider fan I like
that man in his car against the world
kind of thing so I'm looking forward to
that
cool Steven Beecham you have any
suggestions you know we saw like a
little preview of it in that HBO show
why is it escaping my mind right now but
I'm interested in Aquaman what was the
show with all the guys uh with the guy
from Supernatural JJ no they they had
the HBO show as the potaters in there in
the movie industry I don't know why I'm
forgetting it's rush Entourage yeah he
was
Aquaman there was actually a pretty
stable rumor when yeah storyline and
entourage was happening that that
actually was going to happen because so
many fans of Entourage were also it's
not a movie could end up as a TV show
like well I'd rather it be a movie TV
show I think it only made two or three
episodes before it got canceled yeah I
the guy from New Sun Smallville I think
it was yeah we'll see you do it they
could do a good one do it right yeah
yeah I agree and the movie screen you
get really with that budget you get good
underwater stuff yeah I'm down with that
what about you Eric what do you say so
I'm gonna go dark and topical and
current I want I think it's time to do
1984 again and because I think it would
be I think it would be I think it might
not even seem like sci-fi so yeah it
might just be the NBC Nightly News or
CBS CBS News no III agree with you I
that's one of my favorite movies and I
would love to see something like that
but I it's hard to it's hard to redo a
movie like that when it's passed and it
was supposed to be futuristic you never
know what fans and sci-fi people are
gonna say to that but I would love to
see that it's got one of my favorite
soundtracks by the arrhythmia so I was
always a big fan of 1984 yeah I guess it
would have to be 20 84 or or or it could
be like a you know an alternate universe
game Blade Runner was set in 2019 and
we're coming on that pretty quickly and
I don't have a hover car yet I don't
know about you I like the idea of retro
sci-fi though like we have we have terms
for you know rain punk which is awesome
everybody loves that obviously in 1950s
style retro look what what would the
turn be for 1980s style my leg warmer
retro leg New Romantics yeah futuristic
new romantic or retro romantic I don't
know I don't know something to think
about I feel like I owe nines probably
talked about this ad nauseam because I
know that Charlie Jane cares about 1984
as well and
I have other writer friends at CNET also
who love that kind of concept of retro
future yeah so I I would love to see
some Bioshock I don't know we need a
sequel the sky captain I think so sorry
I don't know I I love I love Rocketeer
Teletubbies Jeff wants to know Jeff
Sparkman clever username on Twitter
where's the Greatest American Hero movie
huh yeah that's a good idea
who most looks like William cats right
now I don't know I I think we should
take that to Twitter if you want an
America's greatest hero who would you
have cast in that I don't know these are
the things that sci-fi fans get together
and we get drunk and talk about how we
be cast although we are completely sober
right we really are that's the sad part
but ya know I just I feel like that's I
don't know it's the same thing with
Godzilla everyone says you know well now
that there's gonna be a sequel because I
think did we already cover that and see
that today that there's a sequel coming
there's supposed to be a sequel maybe we
can merge Godzilla sequel with America's
greatest hero I'd watch that and he says
the 80s retro future looks should be
called Xanadu more the quality of this
actor auditioned to play Luke Skywalker
so if Mark Hamill had not that would
have been our Luke mr. Hamill well Terry
none would have been Princess Leia of
Carrie Fisher and come along so that
could have been an interesting Berlin
video I could go all day that may wrap
up the creative cast thanks so much
everyone for for joining us and be sure
to tweet ideas for a future crave cast
to ant crave and also let us know what
movies we missed and how
gonna do vintage sci-fi retro for the
80s sleazy super dope
yes okay the eighties yeah alright well
thanks everyone for joining us and
always as always check in at cnet.com
