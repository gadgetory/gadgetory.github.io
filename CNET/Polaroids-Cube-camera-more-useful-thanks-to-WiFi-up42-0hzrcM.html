it made a big splash due mostly to its
super small design and single button
operation the cube plus picks up with
the first left off same cool little box
with a magnet on the bottom for mounting
but on top the big power and record
button is joined by one to kick on its
built-in Wi-Fi with that you can
wirelessly connect to an iOS or Android
device and preview your shots as well as
change settings and control the camera
coming in at 150 dollars it has a pretty
small price tag too for what you're
getting it records in full HD at up to
60 frames per second or you can drop
down to 720p at 120 frames per second
for some slow-motion Clips the
integrated battery lasts for a little
over an hour of continuous recording and
takes about the same amount of time to
fully charge the Q plus does stills and
burst shooting and time-lapse videos
also and again all of that can be set up
with the mobile app the camera's video
quality is good better than the original
for sure but still not great
especially in low-light shoot outdoors
and good lighting and view the clips on
your smartphone and they'll look just
fine if you need better video quality in
the same cube form factor spend the
extra fifty dollars and go with the
gopro hero4 session now that it's down
at $200 but if you're just looking for a
tiny camera to have fun with and then
share that fun online the polaroid cube
plus is worth its price</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
