I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com joined by staff
writer Josh Lowensohn and Josh today
we're talking about the ipad mini rumors
tell us where we stand with the rumor
mill sure the big rumor is that we will
hear about it in the next couple weeks
there will be an event you know
everybody kind of thought the iphone
event was the last one for the year
exactly this could be kind of a surprise
event mid month and maybe we just see a
release later this month of the actual
device so this is the first offering in
this mini space from Apple when we say
many how many are we even talking sure
so we're talking about a device about
seven point eight five inches so the
current iPad is nine point seven inches
so it's you know definitely smaller a
little bit closer to what we see from
some devices like the kindle fire and
you know the whole idea is just getting
something that's very much like an ipad
but smaller okay another hardware specs
color anything else sure you know
actually been some kind of leaked
pictures or what might be leaked
pictures that kind of have a white or
black style you know not very exciting
and then know sort of colors that you
get with the whole ipod family but
basically just a very simple kind of
portrait device with a metal back and of
course the glass front all the same
ports maybe the new lightning port
obviously things like that i'm glad you
brought up the ipad where does this new
midi fall into the whole spectrum of
pricing for apple's gadgets sure between
the ipod and the ipad where does it go
that's kind of an interesting question
because if you look at the new ipod
touch they start at three hundred
dollars and then if you look at the
bottom line ipad which is actually the
ipad 2 it's 399 dollars so presumably
would be somewhere between then but you
know the whole idea of having these
smaller tablets is that they would
actually be cheaper than the big tablets
and if that's a $300 device competing
against something that's one hundred
fifty dollars i mean they're gonna have
to put it somewhere in the two hundred
dollar level so release hopefully or
announcement and then release hopefully
in the next couple of weeks I'm sure the
release will obviously happen before the
holiday shopping season exactly i mean
this is all leading up to november this
is when people are buying those gifts
for christmas and you know Kwanzaa and
whatever else they got to get that out
there awesome thanks so much
