coming I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your scene that update
the announcement of a new iPhone could
be four weeks away All Things D has a
source saying Apple will talk about the
next iPhone on September 10th the timing
sounds about right the iphone 5 was
announced last year on September 12th
it's widely expected that Apple will not
only upgrade the iphone 5 with new
features but also it will reveal another
cheaper plastic version of the iPhone
possibly called the 5c the secret stand
for color since there have been photos
of colorful outer shells posted online
as we get closer to show time for the
next iPhone the trade-in value of older
iPhones can quickly drop about twenty
percent right as everyone rushes to sell
their old model to get a new one but
trade-in sites like gazelle and next
worth will honor their current quoted
buyback price for 30 days so you could
get a quote ahead of time and hold on to
your phone for 30 days to get the best
treat in price and there's no obligation
to send it off if you change your mind
but if that is your plan you might want
to wait another week or so before
locking in your 30-day quote because if
Apple does announced it on September
10th it probably won't go on sale until
the week after the 16 gig version of the
iPhone 5 is going for around three
hundred dollars on gazelle and the two
year old model the 4s is currently being
quoted for about two hundred dollars on
next worth or you can make much more
money by just selling it directly on
ebay blackberry continues to struggle
financially and it's forming a special
committee to explore different business
options which includes the possibility
of an outright sale of its operations
but there does seem to be another phone
on the way as yet another leaked video
has published this time of a model
called the blackberry z30 looks a lot
like the a-10 model that we've heard
about and you'll be seen ironman star
Robert Downey jr. in commercials for HTC
the phone maker is said to be spending 1
billion dollars on this new advertising
campaign to pump up the brand and phone
features for many students it's time to
get geared up again for school and for
those in college google has launched its
higher education digital textbook store
students can buy a digital textbook or
save a little moolah and just rent a
copy for half the year if you're looking
for digital textbooks for younger
students apples iBookstore has ipad
friendly textbooks for grades K through
12 that's your tech news update and you
can read up on more details at cnet com
