they put their name on it twice but I
found a few things inside that no car
makers should be real proud of let's
drive the 2012 Mazda 3 Grand Touring
five-door and check the tech now I
applaud Mazda for putting an average in
this car at all but I don't applaud them
for what they put in the car once they
did that that thing up there no it's not
a postage stamp
that's a navigation unit they call it
appropriately compact navigation thanks
for the help on that one your interface
is almost nil it's not a touchscreen
obviously you get a broom handle to get
there anyway
voice command doesn't operate the thing
that's just for Bluetooth hands-free
calling instead use this little rocker
you go up and down you push on it you go
left and right and that's how you enter
an address it looks like this you set
your destination press again to do that
press again for address now to enter a
city name here's where the fun begins
what the hell is that I got a chase
around this sort of square Z looking
thing to find my letters and numbers oh
and this thing all blanks out when the
car is on the move so you can't even do
this if you even wanted to when the car
is moving but without voice come in I'll
be pulling over to do that no actually
I'll be pulling over to do this
and that's the kind of compact
navigation I want on a Mazda 3 now onto
the entertainment system on this trim
level we've got a Bose audio system 256
watts 10 speakers a powered sub center
point to move the soundstage around all
decent sounding stuff sources are pretty
good AM and FM but no HD and therefore
no itunes tagging you've got a CD slot
right here no DVD because where would
you watch it on that thing
satellite radio 4 months are included
aux gets you to two things you can go to
the aux jack for analog input or
bluetooth streaming audio do you see
anything missing right no iPod or iPod
USB jack that's crazy now on this trim
level which is kind of the middle of the
three five-door based levels you have a
six-speed Automatic only as part of the
SKYACTIV powertrain if you go higher or
lower you end up getting the choice of a
6-speed manual but not on this guy now
let's go see what feeds it now the
engine in this Mazda 3 is the SKYACTIV
engine a 2 liter inline 4 there's also a
non sky active engine in the mix as well
but this is the interesting motor but
it's complicated
sky active isn't one or two technologies
it's a whole bunch of technologies in
one place starting off with high
compression most cars are maybe a 10 to
1 compression ratio this is a 13 to one
says Mazda and that gets you up to like
180 plus psi per cylinder the point is
you get a lot more the energy captured
from each dose of fuel most cars only
get about 30% of the energy out of a sip
of gas this one does about 15% better
hemispherical combustion chambers so yes
it's a Hemi but no don't go drag racing
any dodge challengers and it's got
headers which is kind of a hot rod trick
four into two into one all that to keep
those high compression cylinders from
backing exhaust into each other all in
they say this has 15% better power and
15% better mpg the numbers 155
horsepower 148 foot-pounds of torque
gets this slightly sub 3,000 pound car
to 60 in about nine
half not exciting but again it's all
about efficiency here and that's where
this guy kind of rocks 28 40 mpg with
the automatic you shave 1 mpg on the
highway if you get the manual that's the
price of fun and finally Mazda took out
30% of the friction and drag in the
engine again not really sexy stuff but
it's important under way this guy is
underwhelming not in a bad way not in a
fatal way but this is a car that is as
more or less gutless as it seems on
paper there's an efficiency thing going
on here not a power thing and that's
fine if this had a turbocharger on top
of all of us other technologies that
expect green with mean but it's mostly
just green as you may have noticed we've
got a slapstick shiftable gate on this
transmission pretty garden-variety stuff
no paddles and that makes sense the ride
is not overly firm but the car makes it
seem that way because there are a few
clicks and rattles here and there I'm
hearing from the back it's just this
side of civilized I don't like the
engine note either it's got a real
4-cylinder sound to it which a lot of
fours don't have anymore but this one
does in all this is typically mazda at
least on their lower end cars it's a
very visceral car which doesn't mean
it's overpowering but you get the
feeling that you can hear and feel every
system at work not my favorite idea when
those systems don't sound or feel real
good but again it's not a bad car it's
just not one that pleases me on a
sensory front but here's what you should
take note of look at that display right
there that's across 235 miles of mixed
driving there's a real world average
calculated out to almost 26 mpg that's
real economy
alright this 2012 mazda3 5-door in the
Grand Touring trim more or less top of
the stack is about 23 5 delivered I
would spend the 1400 for the tech
package that odd basket of kind of
unrelated stuff but they're all pretty
good and a good value at 1400
unfortunately you can't pry the nav out
it's part of this trim level although
with a crowbar you could and I think I
would do that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
