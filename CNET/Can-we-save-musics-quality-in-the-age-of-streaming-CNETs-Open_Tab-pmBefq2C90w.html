audio and fidelity I want to ask you
guys some questions about the way we
listen to music these days and you guys
will hopefully be able to help out some
of our viewing audience so how do you
guys people who take audio to such a
level that most people don't who care
about that that phonic sort of feel the
phonic feel the phonic feel I just need
your podcast ah so simply put how do you
guys listen to music like what what is
your sort of ritual with that I think we
both differ I'm most thing almost
completely digital right with a bit of
vinyl going in there you consider him
like a savage yeah he's a savage Emerson
I am from a colonial Country sure you
know so we worship backwards a little
bit yeah so when you say digital-only
explain that most of the stuff it I will
probably buy a couple of second-hand CDs
but most of the stuff I buy is flac file
straight from the net right and flac
files / buell don't know that's flac
that is the the best encoding or raw
it's the raw sort right so it's
compressed like a zip file so everything
that goes in there comes out again
that's where something like an mp3 you
pull you pull bits out willy-nilly
almost just to get the size down right
people don't realize how much audio
information is being deleted when you
listen to an mp3 Steve's read me the
riot act most most streaming is mp3
rightmost streaming is mp3 as well so
okay so we have your the digital guy for
this conversation and Steve well I don't
be lookin guess what side of the fence
uniform on I'm in the pure and perfect
side but no seriously when you ask that
question for me it's like where do I
listen Vern listening at home is very
different and better in almost every way
than listening somewhere else so you're
saying you're saying quiet everything
people don't take the time to just sit
down from the right whatever it is the
be
take that side of the iphone in your
stereo their gramophone whatever you
want to call it right there not at one
with their music music is they blur do
another thing multitasking whatever so
you don't think there's enough of just
like sitting down and and and
appreciating what you're listening to
I'm not saying that's the only way right
I'm just saying if you love a band
sometimes just listen to a tune close
your eyes and don't do anything else
closing of the eyes I've actually flaps
you for multitask yeah I've done that
I've closed my eyes and I fell asleep so
what band was it uh it was like it was
more like a jazzy is an amorous man no
one else me they they would put me to
bed maybe when I was like a child when
talking about recently okay i can't
speak for their current style well
anyway so well yeah some people doesn't
make any difference do some ppl they'll
hear things they'll feel differently
about the song sure how you feel about
music is really the whole whole bowl and
you just want people to get something
from you so so far connected to the
music i mean the artists may have work
weeks months or possibly years right to
craft a knell of them and if you just
have it on as you're doing other stuff
you're missing a lot of the one is a
respectful say it yeah it's just these
kids these kids what do they know well
they know a lot about streaming music
because that's basically how the planet
consumes music these days yeah it makes
me sad so what what can people do I know
you're not you're in a bit of the
minority there but what can people do to
get the best sound quality out of
streaming services I mean a lot of
people use Spotify as far as the best
you can click the extreme quality button
right that's good is a higher bitrate
right then what you get from the free
version but is there anything people can
actually do to improve the quality can
get a good pair of headphones yes I was
gonna I was going to let everybody in on
a secret what's that whether it's a
lossy mp3s or flac files the way to make
things sound better is to have better
headphones or speakers okay that's way
more important so you think whatever
think that's the number one tool that
our speakers better headphones and
something that
victor is the latest generation of
phones your samsung's or your your
iphones actually have a pretty good
headphone abdomen not really audiophile
quality but they'll drive a good set of
header you can spend 600 bucks on a pair
of headphones and they'll sync sound
great food one of those feels right yeah
because I have a decent set of earbuds
that I use on my Nexus 6p listening to
FLAC files and I I'm super happy without
evasion if you listen to an mp3 file
it's not gonna burn holes in your gonna
die because you know you won't die you
might die a little inside but you're not
gonna actually drop your phone in your
the follicles right the nerve endings
they'll die they'll die Cisco they'll be
like oh I'm not almond impressed yeah um
what about where you listen we talked
about this briefly a few minute ago but
like where you listen to music has a
great deal of an impact of like the
actual content that you're consuming
right like for me I know if I want to
check out the newest you know album from
one of my favorite bands I'm probably
not gonna listen to it while I'm walking
through the street just because like you
said like I do maybe you want to have a
little bit of a quieter thing I'm not
gonna sit in the corner of the room with
close my eyes and do it but I'm never
gonna like like in a lotus position
exactly just like meditate I'm not gonna
do that necessarily but I'm gonna find
the time to do it where I'm not
multitask I think better of you know oh
my stock has risen a little bit all
right fair enough but I think for me
like on the subway is basically the only
time I can funnily enough get it some
alone time sure having a good set of
headphones and a decent music player
even even if you trade up from a normal
phone I've had some pretty you know fun
experiences on on a train listening to
musics right if you get some decent sort
of noise blocking ones and you know then
you'll be okay yeah well yeah aside from
your freaky deaky like listening ritual
where else can people listen and get
like an okay experience you mean other
than home other than home in possibly
gonna be turn a park bench right pose
your eyes just got birds tweeting around
you huh no life is just a big like
fantasy for you big fantasy where you
already thought what do you sound like
you're closing your eyes in public
places
you don't alway York City close my eyes
fair enough I can't doesn't make a big
difference Oh eyes open that's true
that's a whole other story that will get
to the next time on the show don't
forget we're taking your questions and
comments anything audio related you got
two of the most prolific audio reviewers
in the biz right here so knowledgeable
too knowledgeable too i think that was
implied with largest scientific meant a
lot it did not quality nobody hears
stuff the way these guys hear stuff so
make sure you get those in right now
guys what would you say are your
favorite speakers and or headphones wait
because because if you want to get
headphones yeah you do headphones Steve
you're the head fun guy what's a good
headphone for someone with like a
hundred dollar but I am I'm glad you're
sitting down cuz i'm going to say
something that you're not gonna respect
you might think this is april first or
something oh my god you're gonna throw
this is curveball Guttenberg a what am I
yeah hold on just a later and look at
your chicken scratch not move it I just
falls off the tongue so it's the bose
soundtrue ultra in-ear headphones
they're not sound buds that rest on your
router's they actually get jammed into
airs right but the 129 bucks you're
super super comfortable and it's the
first bows in your head phone or your
bud that I like now I don't like it I
love it Wow game for that kind of money
it's hard to beat traditionally you
despise everything by you know impartial
journalist of course I treat everybody
fairly right I used to you just
they just haven't had a great track
record with you yeah everything sucks
everything's okay now we found it
alright this is you know what they say a
stopped clock is Right twice a day so
every now and then they can squeeze out
something good you never go back to make
your crappy ones alright alright so tell
us how you really feel um yeah this is
coming in from YouTube commenters as
well like what's what about speakers
what's a favorite speaker of yours well
speakers is a weird one because you can
get passive speakers for about a hundred
and thirty dollars a pair of passively
I'm up to an amplifier receiver was
right bs22 yes spb as 22lr right so a
lot the
II i guess the future of those selected
720 the future of those speakers is kind
of weird because pioneers sold most of
its musical assets to onkyo who now
continuing the brand and I guess the
Americas the only market that carries
Andrew Jones all a lot of Andruw Jones
products okay so you know some of these
speakers go on sale all the time some of
the speakers disappeared like they had a
sound base which is completely gone now
so if you want to get Android giant
speakers now that he's moved on as well
to elac and produce it some really great
stuff so if you want to get Andruw Jones
pioneer stuff I'd say don't graduate I
mean seriously it's there's nothing
comparable for 129 dollars I love seeing
audio deeds get excited about oh yes I'm
excited to get excited about something
that real people can bots yeah it's
practical and his neck at all i'd like
to get if i can't afford it it's a good
20 min dollars where ya Mac McGill I
mean there are other cheaper speakers
say from dayton audio but i don't think
that had the same hole not even close we
talked about onkyo onkyo i remember went
back in the day I used to check out some
onkyo systems and whatnot those they
make like the whole what his companies
like onkyo it's like vintages of wine
they're good years they're nuts okay so
you like my figures so the 2012 was a
nice yes there's too much rain in 23rd
yeah you could say well before you could
hear it you sound it was wetter yeah I
all I can say about onkyo is that my one
of my favorite experiences and one of
the things that clued me into the hifi
hobby was listening to dark side of the
moon on an onkyo turn I know you're
talking 70s onkyo turntable electronics
beautiful it's good analog yeah I don't
know I feel it say so that didn't happen
on a plaque file no it did you get you
can still experience that lately you
know you can still get good stuff out of
flack like yeah I listen to black I feel
like I'm getting something you got you
are but you're the thing is you
literally do not know what you're
missing with mp3's right it's like if
you only have good rose and orange juice
and you never had an actual
fresh-squeezed orange your type person I
just spine tastes great
yeah because you don't know when an
actual orange tastes like okay how about
this what is the what is the lowest i
don't care it's not it's a little unfair
all right exaggerated it's like not not
the ebon Collins I never called you a
snob Steve but you're a bit of a snob no
I it's because I care it's because you
care and you listen see look I'm cover I
could just say to my house and Sarah I
don't care about you guys oh yeah I got
what I need so screen is because I'm
trying to help people spreading the love
I am through Sam way I'm spreading
everything oh ok height is possible fair
enough oh how do I pivot out of that i'm
not sure what about soundbars you go
back to my shirt soundbars soundbars get
a lot of they catch a lot of heat
because some people say they're crap
some people swear by them would it
what's a crazy to swear at them yeah now
I think there's a number every now and
then that I I admire like they've come a
really long way you're happy I am
especially for movies I'm generally less
happy with their sound for music okay
for movies is there one you recommend
for under a hundred dollars not know
okay that's good to know you want a
sound bar you got to spend a little more
money to spend at least two hundred
bucks okay what a name a brand real
quick that you just got some really good
stuff at the moment pioneer if you can
still get pioneer stuff is good yamaha
stuff is good that's pretty much I'm
learning a lot I actually have to take
some notes because people are asking me
about sound bars I believe we have
questions from the live audience let's
check in with Mike hi guys so we have a
few comments from our about sound from
people Melissa says I do think a bit is
Las via phones for sure mostly her own
hearing Jackson says she just wishes
Apple music and the music app were
separated pizzas that he misses the
attention given to album packaging some
people are still trying he lists to ol
Beyonce etc as examples and Paul is the
question he says he has so no speakers
he's deezer flac high-end service he
used wondering if you guys think more
music services are coming on the horizon
probably not I mean the big one or the
big rumor this week was that Apple
is supposedly in talks to buy a title so
i think that that what's going to happen
is you're going to see consolidation of
your music services because there's a
lot particularly in Europe there's
people like deezer and wimp became time
title and it was its own brand for a
while so it's going to get smaller
rather than bigger I can see people
being really boutique II and collating
and and being like that but they're not
gonna make much money idle began you
missed your big opportunity what's up
just went right past it what the whole
room thing Oh rune I look I love ruin
works room room is a very TWiki hifi
system which integrates meteor on your
hard drive with title that makes them
into one library oh ah ah great service
amazing interface plus five hundred
dollars but oh so this is this that's
for the lifetime okay I mean yani Bugsy
that's actually not every years all
right i love the service yeah i'm still
trying to convince steve of it okay I
like bose headphones and right get
anything's possible yeah oh do you guys
ever think some like a spotify would
switch would turn the flack switch on
sure yeah yeah cuz that's I feel like I
i would pay more money he runs oh I
don't make more I'd pay five dollars
usually double I pay five right now with
Spotify 10 bucks okay look I pay with
your page one I paid 15 I don't think
I'd pay 20 I pay twenty fifth title and
I love it ya got rid of Spotify this is
a regular the stigma associated with
title is is understandable for sure
stench what's that stench yeah the
stench emanating right but at the same
time like the service is great the
service is really good it's just because
the oil rig little molecules around
right yeah um yeah I feel like I would
definitely pay 15 a month for Spotify
titles 20 again yeah see that's like me
that's kind of like the threshold for me
right um I just think like I think
streaming flak is like such a rad idea
right i was super psyched when title
came along say they were doing that but
then all that other stuff happened there
I on the left but on your spot price you
put stuff on your phone do you download
it to your phone I don't why should I I
do
I mean I've never really found myself in
a situation where I mean I also do have
the flack stuff that I bought loaded
onto my run so that's kind of work I i
balance it there you go buy and download
itunes not often but I do yeah I kind of
guilt out of guilt and yeah I you know
good self-pity good that kind of thing I
prefer the kilt alright heard enough
anything gets you to support living
bands right make them say hey guys you
know it's okay make more records before
somebody well yeah well actually buy
it's true and you know to that point
someone in the chatroom brought up the
idea of like the lost art of you know
packaging and and that kind of
experienced of opening the record
opening the Sienna you know I struggle
with that because I used to love that
growing up by buying the new you know no
effect CD like flip them through the
thing fine whatever like seeing oh what
are they saying in that song what is
this Oh what are these awful photos they
decided to include in the booklet that's
interesting oh it's a weird stamp they
have on the CD that's weird yeah I
missed that but just like a book cover
I've kind of just learned to let it go
you might come if you love it set it
free that's what I say but something is
lost it is lost I think you know what I
think's lost I think a band or a group
or whoever an artist has a tougher time
communicating their personality right I
think like that's kind of lost in the
whole thing music videos I guess are
still a thing on YouTube they're nowhere
near as prevalent as they were in the
80s and 90s I feel like that
communication is kind of lost oh oh well
uh thank you so much for being here
Steve you have to say goodbye to you
we're gonna take a break when we come
back someone different is going to be
sitting where you were at all right
we're gonna fill my shoes definitely not
because you have such huge feet 13 why
where can people follow you on twitter
audio philly ack man at audio feely ack
man reach out to Steve on Twitter if you
want any more audio questioning</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
