in a new way I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update google is launching
a new video service called helpouts it
connects people with experts that can
provide assistance with various topics
like fitness cooking music computers or
other education and it's all done
through the Google+ Hangouts video chat
service these helpouts experts can offer
advice for free or they might charge per
minute or per session users can sort
through a list of experts based on their
qualifications availability reviews and
ratings and like hangouts the video chat
can be accessed from a tablet or
smartphone one company that could use
some expert help right now is blackberry
the struggling company couldn't find a
buyer to go private and yet it's still
afloat after receiving a 1 billion
dollar investment but with that deal the
CEO thorsten heins has stepped down
blackberry is holding on to some hope
the new blackberry z30 which is the
company's top smartphone it's set to
arrive on verizon later this month it's
a good phone but it's likely not enough
to bring back customers who moved on to
other systems Netflix has won several
Emmys for its original television series
but now it seems netflix has its sights
set on the Oscars because it's releasing
original films and documentaries and the
first film is already making Oscar buzz
it's a documentary called the square
it's about the Egyptian revolution
through the eyes of young activists
it'll be available on the service early
next year and Amazon Prime instant video
is catching up to Netflix with a few
original shows of its own the first
original TV series for Amazon is a
comedy called alpha house starring John
Goodman and it'll air next week followed
by another comedy called betas looking
ahead there are some gadgets that will
be revealed soon Motorola will unveil a
new smartphone next week on November
13th called the Moto G and it's believed
to be a low-cost version of the Moto X
shown here Samsung is revealing a soft
pink version of the galaxy note 3 to Us
stores next week on Monday
and that's according to a listing on the
website newegg it's not yet known though
if any of the major US carriers will
offer the pink note 3 at a lower price
with a new contract and Nintendo will be
releasing a smaller version of the
original we to the United States on
november seventeenth it's called the wii
mini and for a hundred dollars this red
system comes with mario kart wii and a
matching red wii controller and nunchuk
it lacks Wi-Fi and gamecube support it's
basically just a cheap way to play older
wii games that's your tech news update
