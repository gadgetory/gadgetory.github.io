that is wasted about 85% of that goes
out as heat exhaust systems grills ducts
radiators coolant plumbing and fans
they're all over your car just to get
rid of heat but heat is Just Energy why
waste it why not convert it that's what
car makers are seeking to do via two
main strategies the first is around the
thermoelectric effect that occurs when
connected materials react differently to
heat creating an electronic differential
between them that generates current
spacecraft have long used this to
generate electricity from the sun's rays
an example is BMWs work on
thermoelectric generators that capture
the heat in the cars exhaust system to
make electricity in a solid-state manner
a 7-series for example needs up to a
thousand watts of electrical power while
running any of that demand you can
offload from the alternator saves gas
researchers at Boise State University
along with Robert Bosch Honda and the
Oak Ridge National Labs are working
under an eight million dollar federal
grant to create better thermoelectric
generators by using nanomaterials they
hope to improve vehicle energy
efficiency by a solid five percent now
another main thrust is turbines Ford is
keen on using exhaust heat to warm up
fluid that creates vapor pressure to
spin a turbine generator and make
electricity sort of like a mini nuclear
power plant without the nuclear part
BMWs turbo steamer project is similar
and they say it'll be on the market in
around six years they're seeing up to a
fifteen percent improvement in test
vehicles but are hoping to get a solid
10 percent in the real world on longer
steady drives
now the real keys to all these
technologies are threefold first prove
their efficiency gains in real-world
driving next get the size of the
mechanisms down so they fit in small
cars where efficiency is often more
prized than larger ones
and of course manage the cost so the
fuel savings are not overshadowed by the
price of the ten more car tech
