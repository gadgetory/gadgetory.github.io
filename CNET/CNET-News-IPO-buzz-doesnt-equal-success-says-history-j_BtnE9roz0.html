has whipped the financial world into a
frenzy it's a company that everyone
knows that everyone uses and will be a
valuation and amount of money that has
never been seen from an Internet company
so the hype is everywhere it's never
been this big before just how big is big
some analysts are predicting that
Facebook could be worth as much as 100
billion dollars a price that cnet's Paul
Sloane says as hyper-inflated given the
nature of Facebook's business from Wall
Street standpoint it's really really
expensive but no one on Wall Street
wants to be left out so it's going to be
hugely popular and will probably do
really well what it does after that we
have no idea because Facebook has to
create a business to actually live up to
that 100 billion dollar valuation that
it will likely go public a few other
internet companies have attracted this
type of attention when they went public
not even Google in 2004 or yahoo in the
late 90s it was a good company it's
nothing was a flash in the pan of the
rocket ship came back to her analysts
say it's the social media tech companies
that went public in the last two years
group on LinkedIn and Pandora that could
act as bellwethers for how Facebook will
fare when it debuts Zynga for example
saw early success and now months later
struggles stock went up to 14 14 now
it's below 8 it's lost about forty five
percent of its value in the last six or
seven weeks and that's a really bad omen
for facebook and that's exactly what
Wall Street in the investing community
won't like in San Francisco I'm Kara
