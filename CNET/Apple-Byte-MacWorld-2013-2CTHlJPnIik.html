macworld 2013 in San Francisco we're
gonna check out the floor we've seen a
lot of stuff from CES just a couple
weeks ago but we're gonna have some fun
and find out some of the unique things
here that we want to show you guys back
at home alright guys we're here at
Seagate booth and we know how the 128
gig ipad was just announced but you know
what you don't really need this thing
that thing especially with this this is
Seagate wireless plus hard drive now
what it is this is one terabyte of
storage it's 199 it's available now but
what makes this unique is if you're
familiar with seagates other hard drives
this allows you to have your iPad your
iPhone or other devices talk to it
wirelessly and then take the video
information from here movies pictures
photos things like that and shoot them
out to something like your Apple TV or
just watch it locally on your device now
what also makes this interesting is that
you can stream three movies on three
different devices at the same time and
they've also cleaned up the interface on
the iPad app so the art is a lot bigger
brighter and the interface is a lot
easier used now also this has a 10 hour
battery life the previous models had
less than that so it's really a cool way
to add sports your iPad without actually
buying a new one and I'm really feeling
this product as your mom your dad ever
told you to sit up or stand taller well
you know what we've got the solution
here i'm here with andrew chang one of
the co-founders and this is a really
interesting product that might come you
know might surprise you see here macro
but tell us this is the LUMO yes it's a
lumoback and basically it's a sensor
band right here and when you wear it it
knows when you're slouching and it will
vibrate when you slouch and i'm wearing
one right now and as you can see i'm
standing nice and straight if i start
slouching it will also start slouching
and it will vibrate when I'm slouching
right and that's going to remind me to
stand up nice and straight and what
we're trying to do here is we're trying
to build muscle memory so that people
stand tall and
and sits traitor so can you simulate a
sleeping position sure if you want yeah
we own the ground i know i want to see
ok so here I only worry being on my left
side right and there you go and if I
roll over my stomach it's also on my
stomach right if I roll over to my left
yeah it's it's it's rolling to you like
that yeah this I like spooning the LUMO
is very comfortable here I really like
this guy's how much is the LUMO back
right now it retails for 149 okay and
there's a special here for for the show
right yes and that's 99 so you know how
you said the LUMO has like vibration
feedback I actually felt something in my
back alright guys we're here at Balkans
