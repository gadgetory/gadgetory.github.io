Twitter for as long as uh too many cooks
is yes seriously doubt that no I'm
serious even how long has it been
trending since Thursday and it's Monday
it's Monday nothing ever lasts the
weekend well nothing not important i'd
assume i'm thinking like all those
movements and stuff that happened like
it a bit government i was prompt
government regimes being over to
overturned yeah and then like I remember
when Robin Williams thought that was
maybe only two days though yeah I get
over that real fast what about Harlem
shake that trended you on your right was
it for days I feel like I ok some kind
of chart for this I like the box office
numbers like that most right there's
trying to be long there's definitely
data on it for sure we don't have access
to that data nor do I think I care
there's no I carrots and you care it's
well it's like strange although I think
if somebody is first telling you about
it now that's someone you shouldn't
follow anymore if there's an old house
it's like Jesus Christ I haven't hashtag
winning right now break exact well
you're so on the ball it's all right on
your sits so out of vogue I mean if like
people just discovering it now it's like
how did that happen I saw it all last
week while I was sick i'm like yeah
maybe i'll click it sometime and you
still haven't watched it oh god it's
like the glue of the world right well if
it was on netflix i probably would've
watched it re oh right it's pretty good
click a link it's just no good it's so
oh and i love that a lot of people hate
it i love it love it that's how i'm
gonna use this is like the barometer now
for whether or not i like someone i
don't think hey I'm Jeff before we start
having a conversation did you like too
many cooks no oh this is where we part
ways so you think that this is something
is gonna be relevant to you in like
three weeks that's a good question I
don't really think so maybe I don't know
probably not a bit like nyan cat like
that thing was kind of neat for a while
and then but that's over but no but this
is a dis was a this was an event there's
not an event it was a show though it was
like it was on TV and it was a thing
like true detective stays with me a year
later it stays with me and haunts my
soul and let's see what happens a couple
of ways this and you completely forget
some dick around
three-minute buzzfeedvideo this is a
required a commitment of your time
they're like I'm going to make this a
part of my humanity re oh do you know
what I'm saying it's a feels more
important than just like a viral YouTube
video because this was TV first and it
was like yeah it's a big production yeah
you could tell they put a lot of work
into yeah i think i would definitely go
back to it eventually totally you know
like the macarena that's what he's gonna
do there are points in culture and
history there are needle moving points
it is my belief that this is one of
those moments okay so when the setup is
fantastic I can't wait to watch this
tonight go you're gonna hate it I'm
gonna get mixing Papa Lawrence when we
see like whether or not you and I are
supposed to like calm ever hang on I
feel like this will be the test for that
this is the Linn assess for that sounds
fantastic done done great it's Monday
November 10th 2014 let's start the show

this in the news he was apparently
shooting people in the face with the
salmon cannon yeah then I covered like
two months I saw that too and I was like

I'm not gonna bother because that's a
little petty but you know what we did
find this thing two months ago we did
and I love John Oliver and that show and
he's way better at that you know when he
got access to the same again it so not
only did he you have to go watch it so
if you if you listen to our show you
know about the salmon cannon you know
about this thing that like manually

segment who's the season finale last
night and he's like shooting salmon from
his studio into all these other Studios

Jon Stewart he did it the Homer Simpson

sounds like he's got some clouds he's
got some friends in the biz who do we

chuck salmon like a good wife right what
do you think cool NCIS just gets a
salmon in the acid NCIS days for salmon
I'm sure LL Cool table play ball right
I'm sure he'll get on boy I'd say so all
right but let's move along go check out
that video I'll link to it in the show
notes um there's like Toy Story
controversy hitting the internet and I
know this is you know a sign of the
times big deal for Monday what's going
on with Toy Story and should I care
alright so Pixar announced that they're
gonna come out with a toy story for
coming 2017 okay is that it that's the
news story but what really happened
though is everyone freaked the hell out
because the thing is if you
you've watched toy story one two and
three houki I have not I don't even
think I saw the first one front to back
Arielle did you watch one two or three I
watched one okay yes in just the side
note re l didn't even know there was
right I thought this was number two was
the second well yeah a sequel she does
he go to our story what is good idea oh
the first one I don't even think I saw
that they actually did make a sequel
this toy story so I'll it's gonna be
very two and three doing three exists in
three was pretty freakin good it like at
a great ending people cried people cry
all the time I pics our stuff and
Bridget Carey look the same to me darker
day yeah that's my that was my alter ego
during last week when I'm sick I'm
Bridget Carey I think I knew it it is
going to him phone booth it's kinda like
Shazam you know just like no he just
says she's am one woman does the
clinking of the bracelets I'm at a fine
sorry toy store your jewelry before it
was story for all right so there's all
these stories that people are just
pissed about it cuz the toy story three
was really good toy two was better three
was like really great and like I'm just
like leave it alone cuz you're gonna
screw it up I don't believe that pic
stars never screwed up anything name one
movie they screwed up cars too that
doesn't count know how does that not
count melon cares about that series I
don't care about call talking cars but I
know if it messes with the whole pics
are you know a timeline it doesn't
actually some part of work no one cares
about talking I'm sorry does quite a
second that's cars franchise is stupid
at best it's stupid i agree with you i
totally agree with you my like
Incredibles is great nemo awesome brave
wasn't active brain was that Pixar to
Bert who brave I'll brave with the
redhead yes yes great and see it why
wally was pic wally was baller come on
like where we at Carson says this is a
fourth movie the owner series they
haven't unfortunately anything oh you
mean the most successful franchise out
of the hole pics are that would be
correct archive that's wrong yeah why
not make a notice they had a bunch of
soul in the first three you want to make
sure they keep it there could you
imagine like let's say there was this
really great I don't know crime movie
let's call it The Godfather right he
like part one was awesome and part two
is great people argue
you better agreed then you're like hey
let's do it again but then you're like
oh well why would you hold water
absolutely what does it doesn't hold
water because Godfather three terrible
we all know right compares the first yet
still better than a lot of crap out
there of course but they did the trilogy
with toy story so why not do another one
they did three toy story that's the
point in stopping she already got the
ending of you but like what if four is
great they should make a fine that's
impossible that's what I'm saying anyway
how could you tell way to cut off the
internet freaking out like the people
are tweeting like crazy like you know
toy sorry for were Woody and Buzz sneak
into Andy's dorm room their places
ritalin and adderall with multi-item
I'll get some real problems internet
here we go so define post-grad Andy
struggling with unemployment and student
loans at Pizza Planet using a slice to
dry his tears basically what is the plot
of toy story for this is really no point
to this thing at this at some juncture
valid are I hope and I've had is the
villain into that sword I like that
which one this one I pair I hope an ipad
is a villain that'd be funny is these
toys are gonna be like jettisoned for I
don't know romantic pursuits at some
point maybe those breaking bad action
figures could come into play they start
cooking like toy meth now now I've got
something now you got something a while
you're better than your pencil you got
it you got a grim and gritty Toy Story
war with pg-13 bryan cranston keeping
his role yeah as Walter White who could
never die cuz he's a plastic toy exactly
okay okay I like this know what it is is
there like cooking drugs into action
figures and the Toy Story crew you know
finds out about it they want to bring
these people to just the toys I like
whacked out of their gourds because they
are made of drugs or no they're not
they're not biological so they can't
take away the benefits of drugs so they
could there's merely containers yeah
that's it they're just other lay Stooges
vessel there is laced yeah and then they
gotta be like melted down so these toys
are gonna lose their lives and their
freaking out because they're like
somebody's gonna gonna melt us down
right this is airship okay there's a
villain is the incinerator name like
well that was okay that's actually the
villain in three so really
Boyet and see it well then you wrote
three I do not how do you not watch
these freaking movies because man you
know movies I've become disenchanted
with film over the last decade it's not
movies for the most part not good
they're not good anymore it's pics are
you just said nothing they make sucks
why would you watch something else that
could suck versus a Pixar flick I
because I like you know bigger like you
know stakes I want I want there to be
like drama you know I want to see like
something super hilarious but for adults
she'd watched it or serious drama should
watch two and three really yeah it's got
stuff for like adults in it alright know
that the pier movies are good I I know
that I know it's good i'm just lazy
monsters university that was a lousy
sequel there you go yeah i didn't see
that either i did see the first one
either I've only seen two Pixar movies
your sample size is too small I know I
know your praise is so out of proportion
to the amount of pics are you know
there's a lot of people to watch yeah
anyway people are upset about it I I
don't know I'm afraid that it's just
Disney forcing the issue and making a
potentially craptacular movie and I just
don't want to see them I think you're
crazy if you didn't think they were
gonna make a toy story 4 for the hell
who or where do you live what planet do
you live on right if you didn't think
toy story 4 was gonna happen these are
gonna put that to bed these are gonna
stop making James Bond movies okay so
night comparing toy story and pics on
Jan talking about like successful legacy
franchises that will never go away you
think think we're never gonna see Batman
again that one's been around for like
like 60 I know and toy stories probably
close to 20 and those films are box
office gold to put it to bed now would
be irresponsible so you're thinking
there's going to be like a second set of
dick there's gonna be a second trilogy
woody telling you I Tim Allen is he is
he working besides that isn't he's got a
show on TV right last night is ending
please like a like a Republican I don't
do you like you really think I was gonna
watch that show i watch selfie damn and
I'm not watching last man that work out
it got canceled oh yeah you believe this
crap yeah did you wanna know why no it's
okay is it called selfie that's why Joe
wasn't that bad it's
there's something wrong in the world
where I can tell whether or not a show
will be canceled just on the name never
seeing it I was like there's no way
that's gonna survive eleni is gonna be
cancelled well that's a difference sir
Sir just curious I'd they did bro cut
down the order for the show there you go
it's also probably realize nebula if you
watch guards the galaxy if you watched
it yet which you haven't no I'm I was
coming out on DVD rental soon nebula is
the the lead and selfie I had no
freaking idea you this will make more
sense in about like six years when you
watch the movie I'll see you before that
and ok that'll happen ok I'm glad you're
feeling better all right tell me tell me
what that's good right yeah I do like
okay I think sometimes yeah sometimes
it's rare very rare tell me about
singles day in i believe it's China in
China alright so there was this to boot
comments last week uh in a meeting and
there's this thing China called singles
day it's on a November 11th Alette 11111
get it singles singles singles it for
like actual single people yeah it was da
ruff like a joke originally this this
holiday was about young Chinese
celebrating or lamenting being single so
there was be like this matchmaking
parties or they would just be by
themselves and started off as a joke but
it was turned to like this monstrously
large buying event where people buy
stuff for themselves so their black
friday sort of but like it kind of
dwarfs cyber monday does it makes it
twice as much money in the one day 24
hours means china probably this better
than Black Friday to probably I haven't
seen any stats compared to black friday
last year Alibaba like they're the ones
really that make a lot of money stand to
make a lot of money they're like the
Amazon of China they book 5.8 billion
dollars in transactions on one day oh my
god that was just last year my god
they've been killing it with this but
like this I had no idea this was a thing
I don't know how it didn't make it to
out here yet I mean we've got like
Valentine's Day you like let me
celebrate how much I love you but this
is completely about being alone it's not
it it doesn't work here because there's
a black friday and a cyber monday well
you don't have to have it in november
right no but just making a january
eleventh Rite 111 that's too close to
black friday
it was later to it's less than two
months later this is that big a deal you
put us where people are the most
depressed right you just had new years
right before Valentine's Day actually
might be a good spot for it I think you
do it to 11 you make it februari 11
three days before Valentine's Day super
depressing time of year sounds good all
the heart-shaped chocolates and all the
teddy bears are out and you're sitting
at home with nothing to do doesn't buy
yourself something exactly you treat
yourself singles day USA it's gonna
happen yep it should be a thing like I'm
just waiting for this to somehow be
monetized properly here I don't have
homework can pull it off this is
something they can do do we look the
homework to do these days make
everything a freakin holiday they're
gonna help with the card company yeah
yeah like I mean do you think like
mothers Mother's Day is so important
right why cuz you got to buy a freakin
card and send it to your mom you can't
just call her up and say I love you mom
you have to send her a car is this a
mother issue you have no it's an actual
thing with the mail right no okay of
card issues I don't say I don't 10 cards
what you're just a horrible person I
call people your or see them implies you
have not bought into the hallmark
mentality Jack we gotta buy into one of
the good guy into it no buy into it okay
yes the Jack Jack Bauer approach i'm
just going to say it three times until
and then you whisper it and that'll work
right it just did buy into it buy into
it okay there we go but yes you're back
on this day in china though they also
eat for fried dough sticks representing
the four ones in 1101 see that's the
part of the holiday i could get on board
with matt i'm eatin some like zeppoles
on a stick i frickin i love this idea i
think i think i think it's gonna be here
I don't know if 211 is the right one to
go cuz it's that would be more
depressing I mean in November how
depressed are you it's you know how many
times it is depressing for a lot of
people you have had some depressed
holidays think we all have I think so
name one see for me i don't i don't
really ever know when Hanukkah is so I
don't know when I should be depressed so
it's it's actually great being doing it
is time what about you you have
depressing holidays are you um I've had
a few like you know we all experience
the holidays like
I had a breakup right before holiday one
year um the year I first moved here that
was kind of a depressing holiday because
alone you know well do it it just
depends on where you're at in life you
know I guess so maybe should have just
converted to Judaism yeah of his
depression would have been on a date in
on it would be on a such a magnitude
higher yeah because you're supposed to
be really upset all the time so then we
convert out so that he could realize
that like it wasn't so bad this is like
a holiday movie right here now this is
this is a boy like a bird app clinic
this is how to get people off heroin the
boy who converted to not feel pain um
yeah I don't know I can't really say
about a depressing holiday but I think I
know there is this amazing Chinese
phenomenon with like dating and then
they all seem that country seems to be
obsessed with it right so this just
plays right into it I'm not so sure I
know dating and online dating in the
tendering and all that is very large in
America but I don't know if Americans
are willing to celebrate it in the way
that the Chinese people also have
embraced like the anti valentine's day
thing that people do on the fourteenth
ever popular size how papi it's just an
offshoot racing but like it starts up
that way I me if you can celebrate dress
this is a global economic machine this
day in China I know it's crazy anti
valentine's Day is not even on the radar
it should be alright why not yeah I've
nothing wrong i'm talking you're
preaching to the choir like heytvelt
it's like when you go to amazon is like
ones you buy yourself something at the
very end you're like hmm maybe maybe I
will maybe I should it's busy you
deserve it 111 alright so that's
tomorrow yeah well that's actually
happening it's happening right now right
then water and a ton of money already
I'm sure it's amazing are speaking of
ton of money uh Mark Cuban went on
record being asked what it's like to be
a billionaire and I as found this uh
important to talk about it's really
important okay because you know you got
billionaires in technology like Bill
Gates right guys all serious and taking
care of Radek ating diseases that kind
of stuff lanta prints like crazy saying
is not going to give all his money to
his kids not gonna make them set for
life that's Bill Gates right real
serious dude
you got Mark Cuban on the other end who
I think he used to stunt like broadcast
calm or something that's what he where
he made his money he's asked by Rolling
Stone okay what's it like to be a
billionaire in the last question he says
is what would surprise people about
being a billionaire he goes nothing it's
effing amazing and off the charts what
did so humble yeah he's super humble
right man Mark Cuban's one of those guys
that I like love and hate at the same
time why is that because he acts like
this well why wait is it acts like this
why would you how often do you hear
these freaking super humble
people like us well you know I really do
find there's a lot of pressure and yell
of this dog there's a lot of people like
that he doesn't bother with that is like
I would a jock smack he's he's in denial
he's delusional if he doesn't like see
the issues right who says he doesn't see
issues they just actually what's it like
to be a billionaires like right freaking
awesome I'm sure most of it is awesome
but I'm sure there's a lot of it that's
terrible like what like having to
constantly tell people and friends and
strangers no you can't have money I
think he would enjoy that actually likes
what are you I'm not paying anything I
mean I dude due to his wealth that's
gotta be like a regular daily act he
probably has a guy for that I guess so
I'm sure he's like threatened all the
time I'm sure he's like a target in
terms of criminal activity and you know
like yeah he's his money's all tied up
and like if the mat we owns the
Mavericks yes that's correct he's
basketball sucks like I don't know so
this is why this is why you actively
choose not to be a billionaire problems
you would have as a billionaire up
constantly being kidnapped and being
held for ransom you know what they say
what's that what do they say what do
they say about having a lot of money mo
money mo problems des'ree ok that's the
entirety he did he said it a long time
ago he did with with big biggie in a
song and mase where they sampled that
old 70s I look to them for all my
financial advice yeah right I like the
way you guys make your career choice 90s
hip-hop song is amazing mutual funds I'm
not gonna mess with
10 I was lost I was at a bar on Saturday
and we were listening to 90s hip-hop
there was like Warren G was on a pool
and what do you laughin I just haven't
heard the the warren g in years I've
ever dog like he was that music was so
good I was good when you it's this so
amazing and then you know you I don't
know arielle's the guy to talk to about
this I'm really upset with where
hip-hop's gone is it it's not really
around anymore like our be no hip-hop
it's definitely a thing still doesn't
know just got to dig around for it but
it's just I mean like rock and roll was
a thing like it was like you want to
find it the middle is freaking ukuleles
and crap playing over it like no that's
not rock and roll stop calling that rock
and roll take that banjo and ukulele get
it daddy that sounds like bluegrass
anyway I'm just saying I I'm waxing
reminiscing about you know especially
that song was so good man it was good I
remember I that was like the first
hip-hop something I like knew all the
words to which one Mo Money mo problems
okay and that's why you're not a
billionaire that's why I was like gee
Dan that what they're sending a very
clear message they're like dude it don't
matter how rich you are shit's gonna pop
up yeah but you can pay off the problems
that's part of the fun can't throw money
that's it you know i'm pretty sure there
might be a maybe I'm crazy but maybe
there's like a song or like I don't know
50,000 that talk about how having a
ton of money is actually lots of fun
well all i can gather from how i don't
know i might be wrong that's um all the
other rap songs will don't know what
they're talking about clearly all i know
is if you have a lot of money you can
kill people get away with it like Mark
Cuban does he doesn't guard Markel does
he know me well some people kill people
get away with it if you have a lot of
money seems like that's how that works
okay you survived diseases that with
other people wouldn't necessarily true
you know and so that's you know that's
it but that is just the the diamonds in
the rough amidst all the more problems
you will have you will pay and survive I
just I just like the refreshing honesty
cuz I mean he's basically visit dick all
right that's right
does this say that the Rolling Stone
like he's not a dick he's a dick no he
would mean he's not yes he is he is but
like i watch it sometimes I watch shark
tank and I'll be like whatever mark
cuban says i agree with it you know
winces dick that's okay that would be
the first time so yeah I mean like that
sure maybe I'm set to be a billionaire
and I just have that Mark Cuban way to
look at it rather than hell yeah um all
right so here's the deal people uh we
have to select four winners for the back
to the future contest how do we select
them up you and I have to do randomized
back to the future hashtag Twitter work
okay we'll do that but the legal crap
says we can't announce them until we
hear back from them but I did hear back
so listen to this the guy who won the
xbox one bundle yeah made it with like
12 hours to go if he waited a little
longer he would he would have missed out
the good thing he acted good thing he
acted okay so congrats the Steve he's
going to get a sunset overdrive Xbox one
bundle the call of duty one will start
next week i believe so stay tuned for
details on how you can win a one
terabyte xbox one call of duty advanced
warfare bundle that's a lot of bites
yeah terrifying right and then we'll
announce the Back to the Future winners
hopefully by the end of the week so stay
tuned for that as well if you want to
hear how you likely did not win that in
the off chance you're now I don't know
or they are not good we gotta be you
were you even maybe maybe not not you
it's likely none of you it's like the
truth about God so likely keep on
listening so we can call you a loser
what are we doing I don't call you a
loser right we can call what if I just
winning the lottery doesn't make you a
loser what if we did that instead we
just don't announce the winners we're
