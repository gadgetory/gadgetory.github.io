it appliances and right now we're taking
a first look at the bonavita bv1800
we've all been there you wake up in the
morning you you know put on a fresh pot
of coffee and you have pretty much five
minutes to drink it and you run out the
door and most of your coffee is wasted
because by the time I get home it's cold
so this machine is basically made to
make just five cups of coffee at a time
or even smaller batches than that that
way you can just you know drink what you
make and don't waste a whole lot of
coffee which is expensive priced at 140
dollars it's also a little bit less than
it's bigger and more expensive sibling
the Bonavita a 1900 TS that cost one
hundred and ninety dollars unfortunately
though I have to say it doesn't quite
live up to the hype it is a little bit
inconsistent in its brewing temperature
you know somehow it takes a little
longer to reach the optimal brewing
temperature if it does at all and
whatever the reason as resolves what you
get out of this machine often tends to
be over extracted and bitter and that's
something that is definitely not what
you want in a coffee machine the 1500 TS
has a thermal carafe right here so it's
designed to keep your coffee warm for a
few hours on this side you're gonna find
the water reservoir it's pretty big it's
easy to pour into it's just like the
1900 TS and then you there to switch on
the front to activate it holding down
the switch also toggles the pre infusion
mode on and off this mode just like the
1900 TS enables the water to go into the
brewing chamber and sit for about 30
seconds and that way it pre saturates
the crowns and and kind of cooks off
some of the more unbeliever full-on
desirable aspects of fresh brewed coffee
so when you boil it all down the
bonavita bv1800 TS doesn't quite have
the performance that you'd expect from a
Bonavita product in my opinion I think
you're better off saving up for the
bonavita bv1800 TS that's an additional
$50 but you're going to get
a lot better performance and much more
flavorful coffee for more check out my
