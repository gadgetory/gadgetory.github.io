commute or just looking for another way
to get around electric bikes or a bikes
are becoming more and more popular today
we're taking a look at the system from
Bosch which combines three different
parts to make getting around with a
little assistance from a motor just a
little bit easier Bosh's e bike system
consists of three parts the drive unit
the power pack in the control center the
drive unit is a 250 watt motor that can
get the bike up to speeds of 20 miles
per hour sensors inside monitor torque
cadence and speed enabling precise
control over speed the power pack is the
battery running things it can be frame
or rack mounted and you can lock it in
place for safety and can be charged
while mounted under ideal conditions and
using different riding modes you can go
up to 60 miles on a single charge and
the power pack can be charged to 50% in
an hour and a half or a full charge in
three and a half the last part the into
via Control Center lets you pick one of
five riding modes from eco for the most
efficient use - turbo for the most power
or you shut the assistance off entirely
there's also a remote to allow for
easier changing while riding in - via
also gives you important trip info like
speed distance and battery life
unfortunately you can't just slap one of
these on your current bike and call it a
day the bikes are designed specifically
for Bosh's system for the best
performance and for safety the bikes
currently started about $4,000 and are
available from brands including felt
electric and extra cycle and soon from
Cannondale and Trek and others ten
partners in all taking one out for a
spin in New York it's easy to see how
bashas system has the incredible
potential to get people out of cars and
onto bikes and because you choose when
to use the assistance the bikes can be
used for exercise just as well as for
commuting or running errands with ease
or anything in between
