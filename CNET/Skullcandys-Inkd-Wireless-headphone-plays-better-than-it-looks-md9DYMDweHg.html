bluetooth headphone which costs about
$40 online I can't say it was wowed by
its design when I first took it out of
the box frankly it looks a little cheap
but I gotta admit once I tried it out it
exceeded my expectations it's very
lightweight you have a shirt on you'll
barely feel it around your neck it's
comfortable to wear the band's got some
flexibility to it which is good and
while the cords that run from the neck
pan to the ear buds seem a little thin
some of LG's tone headphones have very
thin cords and I haven't had a problem
with them breaking or fraying over time
you find the integrated remote on the
left side of the collar
I like the controls were large and easy
to operate by feel there's a pause play
button that also doubles as a call
answer end button and volume controls
the double as track control buttons the
buds themselves are all plastic they're
very lightweight and the headphone ships
with two sizes of silicone ear tips I
was able to get a tight seal and
surprisingly secure fit the larger
default set as for the sound I was
pleasantly surprised it's pretty well
balanced and by that I mean you don't
get the treble and bass push you get
from a lot of headphones these days and
while there isn't a ton of bass it
offers decent clarity in the treble and
mid-range measures up well against neck
band cell bluetooth headphones that I've
tested it cost almost twice as much
battery life is rated at seven hours at
75% volume it also works fine as a
headset for making calls the end as I
said the Inked wireless exceeded my
expectations it's a pretty no-frills
neckband cell headphone but it is
lightweight and comfortable to wear and
the sound is decent I'd like to see it
cost even less it's a reasonable deal at
its current price point David Carney for
cnet.com thanks for watching
