I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update with spring in the air you may
have the urge to make a fresh start and
jump on some spring cleaning but chores
are hard and no fun in this special
edition of CNN update you can pick up on
a few tech tips to help freshen up your
cleaning routine and get you better
organized for starters who doesn't love
making lists of things to do you feel so
responsible and organized for writing
down all the things and then there's the
glory of crossing off the tasks you
conquer well the app home routines gives
your list a boost not only can you set
tasks for different times of the day but
you can be very specific about when some
tasks repeat whether a chore is once a
week twice a week every other week or
even just on Saturdays it also offers a
few suggestions for what to clean the
catch is that the app isn't cheap it's
five bucks but with the price you get
the ability to sync your task list
online to share with other family
members at my home routine scom now if
you rather make chores more of a
competition you might like Norma it's
free and the idea is that your family
members or roommates will compete to see
who can complete the most chores to earn
the most points you can assign how many
points a certain chores worth maybe
loading the dishes in the dishwasher is
only two points but mowing the lawn is
15 points Shores can also be set to
repeat on a schedule you can make up
your own rewards for an individual or
group to redeem but you have to pay for
the pro version to type in custom
rewards when you make a reward for
Charma it's really whatever sort of
silly thing you want to make up but
parents can give their kids real gift
cards for completing chores with the app
goody-goody it's very similar to trauma
and that you get points but you can set
every point to be worth one dollar
toward a gift card for places like Toys
R Us gamestop and footlocker to name a
few but a parent has to put in a credit
card to get those gift cards and they
charge an extra one dollar per gift card
so maybe you're better off just handling
the allowance on your own terms with
torma but if you have some spare cash
just
by a robot to do the chores for you to
keep your garden growing there's the
droplet it's a robot that can aim to
water specific plants it also is smart
enough to not water after a big
rainstorm it's available for pre-orders
now on amazon for three hundred dollars
and neato is releasing a new line of
vacuuming robots in mid-april the room
up that's so yesterday the neato has a
sensor to avoid ramming into your
furniture and these new models have
added side brushes to make sure they
don't leave dirt behind and debris when
they change direction the colorful new
models start at four hundred and eighty
dollars that's your tech news update
