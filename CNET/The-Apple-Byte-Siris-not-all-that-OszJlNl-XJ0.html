welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now I know we were gone last week but
we're making it up to it a little longer
show and our can of chicken noodle soup
giveaway following is not a paid
advertisement for Campbell Soup see
awesome totally worth in all right now
to the stories we know Apple posted
record ipad sales numbers selling over 3
million units in its first weekend and
that didn't even include pre-orders but
it's not all roses for the Cupertino
kids overseas there have been complaints
by regulators about the term 4G because
the networks and countries like
Australia home of the very cute
tree-dwelling koala use different
frequency bands and are not compatible
Apple's now offering full refunds to our
mates down under that feel like they
were being misled and treated like
didgeridoo do now European countries
like Sweden and the UK are also
investigating the 4g fracas because of
their strict regulation of advertising
claims but that's not all there were all
the stories about the ipad still not
being fully charged all the way even
when it showed it was 100% charged but
whatever you read and no matter what
apple says guess what you're still
getting 10-plus hours of the promised
battery life so that's a non-issue and
let's not forget about the overheating
hysteria so the new iPad runs a little
warmer but that's it it doesn't run any
hotter than a laptop and it's another
non issue but Apple known for spinning
things their way should have taken
advantage of this golden opportunity
just think about it the new iPads heat
feature allows you to do things you've
never done before like cook a warm meal
wherever you are on a lonely day in the
streets or save you time as a portable
iron for that all important job
interview see you could have done it but
you drop the ball Apple now when a
follow-up to the foxconn story the fair
labor association finished their audit
and says the manufacturer had violations
in working hours and compensation but
they plan on fixing the situation the
report says sixty percent of workers
were not being paid enough to meet their
basic needs and work weeks that hit as
high as 60 hours per week will be scaled
back to 49 hours now in other news a new
study says eighty-seven percent of
iphone 4s
owners use Siri monthly not daily or
even weekly but monthly which really
isn't that much when you think about it
there's already a few class-action
lawsuits against Apple claiming that
Siri doesn't work as advertised but you
might not care if you're a sports fan if
it actually works ESPN has released its
developer api's for accessing sports
scores to strategic partners and as part
of the ABC disney relationship that's
very close to Apple report from apple
insider claims they are ready to add
sports scores into the sea remix so go
and say where your fans will only need
to ask Siri how much are the Warriors
losing by tonight all right let's take a
quick break to check out an app of the
week from my man Jason Parker and it's a
good just about everyone who has a
smartphone knows about angry birds rovio
released Angry Birds Space a game that
takes the same winning concept but adds
interesting twists with gravity fields
asteroids and new birds to experiment
with in an entirely outer space
environment the game starts you off easy
so you can get used to the new concept
of gravity fields now when you fire a
bird towards a planet or asteroid the
bird will go into orbit around the
object within the gravity field
sometimes giving you several chances to
hit your targets as you progress through
the game the levels get significantly
more difficult with multiple gravity
fields asteroids that block your path
and other interesting objects and
obstacles that require some thought
before you fling your bird there are 60
levels to play through and some will
definitely have you hitting the reset
button numerous times to get that
perfect shot fortunately I'm
particularly difficult levels you have
the option to use the new space eagle
the ultra powerful eagle in the original
angry birds game is pretty much meant
you could beat any level but this new
space eagle creates a black hole once
you tap the screen and has the explosive
power to take out a large area of the
level it's still possible to miss some
pigs though depending on where you place
the space eagle just like the original
Angry Birds you can get up to 3 stars
based on how efficiently you can take
out all the pigs so it's still important
to try to get them all in one shot
another new addition comes in the form
of bonus levels that are nod to classic
video games hitting a randomly placed
hidden golden egg steroid
is a wormhole that sends you to a
special level the level i encountered
seemed to resemble classic super mario
games once cleared you'll take the
wormhole right back to where you left
off it's important to note that unlike
spin-offs angry birds rio and angry
birds seasons while fun we're mostly
about putting a new theme in some extra
levels on the original angry birds space
is a completely new game with new birds
new levels to figure out and some secret
levels you can warp 2 it's easy to
recommend everyone tap this app
immediately angry birds space goes for
99 cents for the phone versions on both
iOS and Android and 299 for the HD
version on both as well thanks Jason um
maybe next time you could smile for me
at the end you know like okay all right
now some cool patent use involving Siri
Apple could be interested in bringing
Siri to the mac by pairing it with an
iPhone a new patent filing called voice
control system from the big a describes
a remote device communicatively coupled
to an electronic device that runs Siri
now this would keep the voice processing
exclusive to the phone no matter where
you are and the phone's constant data
connection would allow the speech
functionality to always work when it
pings its servers also if you're
wondering what's happening with the
Apple TV stuff a new report from
research group csla says it will be
coming out in 2013 now right now you can
pick any day or year you want but not
everyone can be nostra Tongass all right
now we know not all these patents come
to the market but another one for
apple's advanced TV remote describes a
process where you can take a photo of
your current remote that's then sent to
the iCloud for analysis then it sends a
virtual copy of your remote back to your
phone with all its functionality it's
like magic then you'll be able to
control your current TV with this new
apple remote mind below all right to the
quick bites a new digit times rumor
claims the new 15-inch MacBook Pro will
be ramping up production in April but
the 13-inch model will be ramping up in
June the April timing falls in line with
the availability of Intel's new ivy
bridge chip line with a launch for
sometime this summer and if you're one
of the many people who live through the
iphone floors antennagate and you never
took advantage of apple's bumper case
offer
webpage called iphone for settlement com
is where you can collect a hefty fifteen
dollar settlement that's a full meal at
boston market with those little tasty
good moves mm-hmm my gosh that mac and
cheese on the side now this applies to
people who bought their phone before
februari 17 2012 and you'll have until
August twenty-eighth to file your claim
but if you guys are looking to collect a
big time from Apple just walk into an
apple store literally an 83 year old
Evelyn paaswell walked into the glass
door of an Apple store in Manhattan Long
Island and broke her nose she's now
suing apple for 1 million dollars now
she claims she still has great eyesight
saying I may be elderly but I'm very
active and I'm still driving to note to
self stay away from Long Island roads
now I know this has happened to some of
you before but come on walking into a
glass door at an apple store who does
that who is that stupid pay attention
walk with your head up it's actually
very easy alright that's going to do it
for this week's show send us your emails
to the apple byte at cnet com and if you
want that can of chicken soup will send
it to you i'm brian Tong thanks for
