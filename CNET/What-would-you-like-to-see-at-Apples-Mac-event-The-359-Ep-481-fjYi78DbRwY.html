description play now take - I screwed
everything up but that's the charm of
this show right Ben and Alfred it's it's
really I love how we continually get
worse with each new episode very much a
DIY podcast that's right a diva di BVG
it's dude you're doing great the fact
that the TriCaster didn't completely
fall apart this time is proof enough I'm
you're learning I'm just really glad the
microphone wasn't working before because
we had acts accidentally unveiled some
secret information about the Apple event
tomorrow right I'm really glad that that
wasn't caught so we were both we're both
under very strict embargo and we know
that they're gonna be releasing a new
can we cut off the Mike's again sorry
okay that's that's all I we're not under
embargo but we are gonna be talking
about the Apple event and what we are
expecting the various rumors and reports
that have been coming out about it we'll
also round out the show with Sam's Club
now which is Walmart's effort that's
similar to Amazon go anyway sending your
questions and comments well get to as
many as we can at the end of the show
let's get to the podcast standby for
podcasts time in 3 minutes and 59
seconds from 3 to welcome to the 359
cast pod I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred
hang and it's more Apple news today the
tech giant is hosting a press event in
Brooklyn tomorrow starting at 10:00 a.m.
Eastern where it's expected to refresh a
bunch of devices that aren't iphones big
surprise let's start with the one that
I'm really excited about and really care
about it's a rumored refresh of the
MacBook Air
99 sorry $999 laptop is expected to get
a high-resolution display and keep its
price you excited as I am
I'm never excited for anything boy I do
think that you know a refresh is very
much needed for all of these fan
favorite favorite devices a lot of
people love the MacBook Air just because
it was so small light but the fact was
that it wasn't getting the updates that
it needed or anything like that and you
can also say the same for an iPad Mini
which hasn't gone a new version since
2015 are we expecting a new iPad I'm not
expecting it but that's also one of the
brands for Apple that like has not
gotten like any updates or anything like
that for a while now-like
similar to the MacBook Air yeah it looks
like the one that's gonna get the
biggest refresh is the iPad pro which is
obviously much more expensive and it's
helped really update the tablet line and
you know get a little bit more
enthusiasm into it and get bigger sales
it's expected to get a bigger display
with no touch ID home button and face ID
instead so you're gonna be unlocking it
by like looking at it like you would
with your iPhone
there's also expected to be an eye USBC
connection added in and it's supposed to
get an updated Apple pencil stylus two
sizes expected 11 inch and 12 point 9
inch so the last time Apple had an event
for its iPad it was done at a school in
Chicago or at least Illinois it's one of
those two it was in Chicago okay then
I'm glad I'm right but so you know they
had done that because it's this whole
theme about the iPad pro being for
schools and you know they wanted more
teachers using in their classrooms and
things like that so this time they're
doing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music
and I'm curious if that's an indication
of you know what they're gonna be
unveiling with potential new iPad or new
updates or anything like that
they're like content or something like
that pushing forward with like maybe
like a video streaming service or
something like I don't really think
we're expecting that either but that is
something that Apple has been working on
for the past couple of months if not
like more than a year now so we'll see
what goes on with that I also wanted to
mention the update for the
Mac Mini which is another fan favorite
because it's Apple's lowest price
computer at $4.99 that's also expected
to get an update I'm not really sure
what they would do with it maybe update
its specs it's just kind of like a
little block that you plug into a
monitor
yeah actually was oh oh that other thing
I was the iPad Mini but you're talking
about the Mac Mac Mini I would be
surprised if there were an update for
that just because I think they're
they're more all-in on the just the iMac
itself I just have been seeing a lot
more people using that and Mac Mini but
to be fair it also hasn't received an
update in a while so yeah next Walmart
introduced a new test store in Dallas
called Sam's Club now which does away
with cashiers instead letting you scan
and go using your phone it's kind of
like Amazon Go which now has six stores
so maybe we're gonna get rid of cashiers
altogether not really sure every single
time one of these new types of stores
gets introduced though it's always
interesting to me that the companies
belabor the point that like hey we're
not gonna have cashiers but don't worry
it's not just gonna be robots we're
gonna you know move people around to
different places it's still gonna have
as many employees as previously yeah it
should definitely be interesting I would
have loved to use something like this at
Costco
there's no sam's club around where i
live or anything like that but it i
would i think it adds a lot of
convenience to things but at the same
time i would agree that you know that
kind of sucks for cashiers dude
literally every single time i go to
costco there's like a line of like 100
people yeah so i don't know much that
would really be a value to having that
type of situation and maybe we'll see if
Walmart's getting into it amazon's
getting into it maybe we'll see a lot
more of this kind of thing in the future
if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox
Ruben I'm Alfred Hank thanks for
listening
and thanks for joining us for the
recording of the audio podcast as bumpy
as it was I don't know it wouldn't be
Monday if I didn't screw something up so
anyways let's go ahead and jump into the
chat and take some questions and
comments from you guys to keep the
conversation going right out the gate
sir enjoy what I would like to see it
apples Mac event a friendly apology to
one plus for screwing up their event
date oh good point so one plus was
supposed to have their event date
tomorrow and then they switched it to
today because of Apple yeah that's just
that's just life
yeah one plus you're not Apple not yet
anyway sometimes it be like that right
so they're they're better off switching
the date and I guess maybe you know I
think it would have been fun if they did
it on Halloween then everybody would get
dressed up to go to the oneplus event I
would be incredibly surprised if they
did open up their event like at like Tim
Cook walks out I was like I just want to
start this off by saying sorry to one
plus we didn't know that was the same
day of my back yeah that's just
unfortunately that's just a reality for
like us like reporting in the tech
industry literally any Apple event like
it's it's always funny to me how any
like press otherwise tries to like sneak
in there and I'm like guys sorry like
everybody's just paying it was actually
supposed to go to a security event
tomorrow and then Apple made their
announcement so I had to tell them hey
sorry there's new it's like a conference
though right computers yeah yeah yeah so
anyway sorry 1 plus yeah ok go on CNET
if you want to learn about oneplus today
cnet.com just to clarify cnet.com or the
app we also have an app or news.com we
own that one too
okay go ahead be mad that's relevant
okay so for more from the Mac event john
paul hunt new mac mini me edition and
pro editions we shall see do we know how
many breakout sub models that we're
gonna see in any given Apple product
tomorrow I don't know the the problem
with this is is that these are a lot of
the as Alfred mentioned like the fan
favorites but that have been
unloved because Apple makes so much of
its money with the iPhone and the iPhone
prices keep going up and up and up my
hope is is that with these fan favorites
the reason their fan favorites is
because they're less expensive there's
still Apple products so you could still
go and get like a Chromebook for for
less money or you could get like I don't
know like a Samsung Tab I I think for
less money like there are always like
cheaper alternatives out there but if
they are gonna update the air if they
are gonna update the Mac Mini hopefully
it doesn't bust the price yeah because
that would that that kind of like ruins
the whole I mean looking at the eyelid
looking at the iPad Mini which at the
time the for at least was the budget
version it's currently more expensive
than any iPad that's out there now
that's a lot more updated than it yeah
so I'm hoping that like if they do
update all these like outdated devices
or introduce a new version of it that
it'll be like the price scale will
actually make sense now yeah the the
MacBook Air was like that too right the
yeah the air is like at least a hundred
dollars cheaper than whatever you know
comes up afterwards if I'd don't don't
like take that to the bank I haven't
checked the Apple website beforehand but
anyway the the problem that I'm worried
about with the air is is that if all
they do is update the screen and they
kind of keep the same look like and they
have like the same like frame around the
display that they have currently it's
gonna continue to look like pretty
outdated it what do you want like a
notch for a year no I don't like care
this is a MacBook Air we're all very
aware Ben look at my password if you
wanted to I'm gonna shut down everything
if you wanted to we could we could look
in the Chen just see how many people are
aware that that's a Mac okay yeah I
wonder where I know that how do you know
that this is an apple I'm not really
sure whereas this computer is a complete
mystery and it's a machine it's the CBS
issued corporate machine right so I hope
that they do more than just to refresh
the display but I know Tim Cook probably
isn't watching the show and it's paying
attention to what I'm telling him to do
it's it's I guess for me like most
consumers we wanted to get updated but
don't want the price to change and Apple
is not very good at doing that so I
don't know we'll see what we see you
tomorrow I'm just glad they are gonna do
a refresh all right more questions from
Yoda Akbar
any word on a new Apple TV then we just
get a new Apple TV like late last year
did we didn't we feel like we keep
waiting for a new Apple TV and then it
never shows up
I will act like a ruler or something
either way as far as the rumours are
concerned no we're not expecting a new
Apple TV to come out this time around so
don't hold your breath
and yeah that's that's not part of the
rumor roundup at all we're really like
expecting this mostly to be based around
the Mac products and the iPads and
that'll rule out any potential for a new
Mac iMac pro or any word on peripherals
Timothy dews got a good question about
4k or 5 k LG monitors uh I think they
did come out with a 5 came out of it or
quite like a couple years ago so maybe
they'll make something that's like a
little less expensive but I really doubt
it like the the 5k folks they're more
than willing to spend a ton of money to
get 5k because there aren't a lot of
folks that actually want 5k at this
point not yet
I mean it's it's it's coming and I bite
my tongue when I say that but yeah it's
it's definitely not ready for for a
prime-time I would say any word on a
home pod - pretty much everybody's just
asking hey you listed those three
primary Apple things what about every
other Apple thing are they updating
those - okay so as much as I would like
to see an update to the home pod that's
also not something that's been rumored
and Apple has actually been pretty
sleepy when it's been coming to you know
smart home stuff whereas like Google and
Amazon are really like in a pretty
intense fistfight it would be really
cool if Apple came out with a home pod
mini bite there would be rumors for that
device or like some expectation that
like something around that were in the
works and we're not hearing anything
about that so and the home pod also very
recently came out I think it was just
introduced
started selling like lastest it was
introduced last year and then didn't
start selling I think until January so I
don't think that they're going to update
the home pod I also don't know what an
updated home pod would look like you
know like it's guy I mean this man is
already yeah I mean a tiny home pod I
would be into that but I don't think
that's happening yeah horns not right
now
student a pod you could put it anywhere
in your house and it would cost a
million dollars it cost more than at
home
okay anyway yeah Brian you're right
Apple TV 4k was first introduced in last
year so I think we're gonna get another
Apple TV not a too soon
long story short like the rumors have
leaked what they said they're gonna
unveil was probably what they're gonna
unveil anything else will be a surprise
to you and us and I wouldn't expect many
surprises out of them at this point yeah
I think the MacBook Air as long as they
refresh the design and give it a higher
resolution screen that really is gonna
be a crowd-pleaser for a lot of people
people have been waiting for that for
years every single time there's a Mac
event like this one in October usually
like the what we would like to see type
of thing from tech reporters always
includes a refresh of the MacBook Air
and usually what they only end up doing
is improving the process or you know
like the the guts of the thing so I
would definitely want to give them
credit where credit is due if they spent
any time improving this device because
they don't make nearly as much money off
of the air as they do with their iPhones
like the iPhone 10s max I mean I I can
only imagine what the profits are on a
device like that so yeah thousand dollar
device Apple doesn't really care as much
about alright I really when it comes to
a laptop anyway I really want to get
into the Sam's Club now but we got a
couple more real cookies about Apple
event I like this question from Ed
hudley has Apple abandoned trying to
push the iPad pro into business haven't
really heard anything since the
relationship with IBM that's a good
point like what is the iPads supposed to
be doing now when their latest update I
mean it looks like what Apple wants with
the iPad pro is mostly in schools I
think they wanted to compete with what
Mike
soft is doing with its surface and also
what chrome has been doing if all its
Chromebooks in all these schools you
know they talk about how the iPad has
much more usability or like it lasts
much longer than a Chromebook would for
students like a school can buy they're a
lot more expensive than Chromebooks are
but they can buy these iPad pros and
they'll be able to use them for like
years as opposed to Chromebooks which
are obviously a little bit different so
I don't really see it as like selling it
to like a company or a business or
anything like that but they are dealing
with like departments of Education like
across the country so there was that IBM
push that's a good point
from the commenter there was that IBM
push I would imagine they probably have
a couple contracts out there but that
did get a little bit quieter afterwards
so yeah I'm not not really sure what the
status of that is but I imagine they got
at least some people they got them all
right moving on here's one from Josh
Moya let's move into the Sam's Club now
cuz this is kind of an interesting idea
for one like we've seen the scanning
stuff before what I was really
interested in we only kind of brushed on
was that it Maps the store for you oh
yeah you can use voice commands to help
you use it to find specific things in
the store which goes against all of the
laws of the grocery store right just
that any grocery store I know of hides
all the important stuff and makes you
browse through all the candy and crap to
make you want to buy more on the way to
the essential thing you came there to
buy but yeah that's that's me maybe we
can talk more about that later josh says
i know that the greg the grocery stores
with the cashier list approach there's
been a lot of pushback from the grocer's
union i don't know much about that but
he goes on to say i don't know how i
feel about having an app for every
single store i shop at it seems to be
more cumbersome than just having a
regular self checkout so i guess what do
we feel about this whole phone shopping
situation luckily it's not nearly in the
mainstream as i mentioned on the show it
like earlier on the podcast amazon go
only has 6 locations that's amazon's
small cash earless convenience stores
and this is just the test
in Dallas like the the Sam's Club one so
if it's going to end up becoming a much
bigger deal it's probably gonna take a
couple years for that to happen by if
Amazon sees a lot of benefit in this if
Walmart sees a lot of benefit in it then
I would expect it to start generating a
lot of interest but at this point
they're not really like laying people
off were they're not reducing their
staffs to have these types of stores
because people because they know that
people have this sensitivity to
automation whether that's going to
change when there are you know hundreds
of thousands of these stores it still
remains to be seen and you know it's the
technology is still new enough that I
don't know if this is gonna result in
people shopping more at these stores or
not I don't know if I'd actually
consider any kind of change in the
shopper volume but in a perfect world
it'd be great if Sam's Club Walmart
whatever the corporate is would offer
training programs for people who were
cashiers to perhaps become engineers and
technologists that would look after
these automated systems
you know because you always need the
human to fix the robot because the robot
is going to break down yeah that's that
is definitely a cool idea but they are
introducing this new a new concept
called a member host I'm gonna read this
off of their blog post from today
think of these associates as concierge
to the club so that's that goes back to
that whole idea that okay we're not
gonna have cashiers but we are gonna
introduce other concepts so we're gonna
help people transition into other jobs
so yeah all right we only have a couple
minutes left I like this idea from John
Paul hunt they should put that tech in
the Apple watch or I'll go ahead and
addendum that any mobile device any
wearable to help with mobility and then
syringe oi says China has been
successful in cash airless stores using
RFID which utilize NFC and capable
phones for easy payments why isn't that
used elsewhere they're not enough NFC
the
I know Apple restricts NFC usage so
that's that's the iPhone which is about
50% of the US market that might have
something to do with it here also I
don't really know what other retailers
are trying to do at this point related
to cache earless stores like we saw the
Sam's Club thing that was just announced
today Amazon Go has been pushing out
Amazon Go stores but there are only six
of them and they're planning on opening
only a couple more of them so the RFID
idea with with NFC or like the NFC RFID
idea obviously sounds interesting but
until retailers see an enormous value
like they see a value in completely
redoing their stores for this kind of
thing I don't know if that's gonna go
anywhere I think the sam's club approach
does help these stores though like
outside of the convenience factor and
outside of making it easier for you as a
customer like go out and also not having
to pay cashiers as much as far as like
using an app to it's like set up a
shopping list and tell people where
things are like that you have to make an
account for that obviously they make a
log of that and like they can probably
send you push notifications on things
like that to make you come back to the
store more say hey your milk is about to
expire like that you bought like last
week we're definitely tracking all of
this so please come back and like buy
some more stuff from us soon until they
incorporate buttons like Amazon did so
it's just all fully automated also
here's a question are they actually
going to start removing the humans from
the store experience in general cause
like I let there was a question that
came through and I apologize I missed
the name but somebody asked something
about you know what if you can't reach
something on the shelves there's still
gonna be clerks in the store there
should be that can reach something off
the high shelf if you need or fetch
something from the back if you need it
right I'm still pretty sure people will
figure out ways to steal from these
stores too so you do need clerks and you
do need like a human eyes watching
what's going on
so with Amazon go you just log in at a
turnstile grab whatever you want and
leave but self checkout has been like
known in the retail industry for just
being rife with like people figuring out
different ways to game it and steal from
it so
this is similar in the sense that you're
not checking out with a cashier so I
definitely think that you're still gonna
need people there to just monitor how
things are going or else people are
gonna like walk out with like a ton of
free Lucroy which is a problem yeah the
croix shortage of 2018 thanks a lot Tech
Deck made it really hard to buy Lacroix
terrible yes all right good chat today
guys thanks everybody for putting up
with the technical difficulties in
eginning and will happen again I promise
but until then we'll see you folks not
tomorrow probably there's a 99% chance
we're not gonna do a show tomorrow scene
it's gonna be of course covering all the
Apple stuff so there will be live show
coming out of our SF office throughout
the day coverage from the event in
Brooklyn and then lots and lots of other
redundant crap so we'll see you back
here on Wednesday at the regular
scheduled time and we'll recap all the
things you've probably already heard
about the Apple products unveiled
Tuesday so until then everybody take
care Ben yep the 359 is available on
iTunes tune in feedburner
stitch or google play music google
podcast the amazon echo and of course
