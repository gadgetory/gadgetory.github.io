version of Android lollipop 5.0 comes
with a dockable keyboard and costs less
than $200 is it too good to be true
I'm Xiomara Blanca frisina taking a
first look at the next book heiress 11
as a standalone tablet it's kind of
weird
I like the comfortable feel of the
smooth matte texture on the back but
that's about it
it's big bulky and awkward to hold
aesthetically it's homely and looks very
outdated
however dock it into the keyboard and it
becomes less awkward to use when
attached it slightly elevates the
keyboard for a more ergonomic typing
angle the blue plastic surrounding the
keys adds a touch of color and it lights
up to illuminate them in dark
environments
unfortunately the keyboard has its
design downsides too
it feels frail and cheap and the tablet
tends to take a long time responding to
the top row of keys the underdog feature
of this tablet is the screen with a 1366
by 768 pixel resolution don't expect to
be blown away
but HD content still looks sharp and
crisp interacting with the screen is a
different story touchscreen accuracy
isn't consistent and gestures were
commonly unrecognized inside it houses a
1.8 gigahertz quad-core Intel Atom
processor 1 gigabyte of RAM and 64
gigabytes of internal storage
that's expandable another 64 gigabytes
via a microSD card due to its bare-bones
specs if performance is slow and the
tablet easily becomes overwhelmed when
trying to multitask switching from app
to app launching games and loading
videos all takes five to seven seconds
at least apps open in the background
also called it to severely lag the front
and rear cameras are both 2 megapixels
and they have a low res charm too
they're washed out colors and fuzzy
focus but otherwise they're pretty good
at adjusting exposure and bright
environments I don't like calling
tablets cheap but this next book is
definitely cheap in price performance
and build quality it's found exclusively
at Walmart for a hundred and ninety
seven dollars and though there's no
other tablet hybrid deal like it right
now I suggest taking a
get inexpensive Chromebooks if the
included keyboard is a deal-breaker for
full details make sure to check out my
full review i'm Xiomara blanco prasena
and this has been a first look at the
next book eros 11</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
