you I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update on Netflix you have always
been able to save an instant queue of
shows that you want to watch but now
Netflix tells you what it thinks you
really want to watch next replacing the
instant queue is something called my
list Netflix will sort through your list
and its algorithm will order it based on
what it thinks that you will like the
best but if you don't think Netflix
truly understands your taste you can
switch back to manual list management
there is another perk to my list it'll
flag any titles that Netflix is about to
lose the rights to stream so you can
watch it before it disappears Facebook
CEO Mark Zuckerberg has more than 1
billion subscribers to Facebook but
there are about five billion other
people in the world without internet
access so Facebook formed a partnership
with major tech companies like Samsung
Nokia and Qualcomm to find a way to make
internet access available to everyone on
earth even free in places with economic
troubles the group is called
internet.org there are many countries
out there that have bigger problems than
lack of internet access but the group
thinks it's reasonable to get more
people online with mobile phones when
technology becomes much cheaper and more
efficient in about 5 to 10 years right
now only a third of the world's
population roughly 2.7 billion people
can get online if your school or your
child's school is having the students
use the Bing search engine on their
computers that could be because the
school is hoping to earn some free
surface tablets it's part of Microsoft's
newly launched program called Bing for
schools a school gets points when
students use Bing on a regular basis and
after a month about 60 students can earn
a school a free surface RT with a touch
cover it wouldn't take much for a school
to rack up a few free tablets and others
can sign up at work or home to give
their points toward a school and bank
for schools also has enhanced privacy
controls to filter out inappropriate
content which is another incentive for
schools to use it over Google garmin the
company you know for GPS is taking
on the GoPro with new sports and action
cameras the verb is a full HD sports
camera that records 1080p high def video
and it captures 16 megapixel color
images in bursts or time-lapse modes the
body is waterproof and it will stabilize
the image when shooting those shaky
sports but with Garmin involved it of
course also tracks location the elite
version has an internal GPS an
accelerometer an altitude meter and
Wi-Fi GPS data can be embedded and
displayed within the video and Wi-Fi
lists the camera communicate with Garmin
smartphone apps that's your tech news
