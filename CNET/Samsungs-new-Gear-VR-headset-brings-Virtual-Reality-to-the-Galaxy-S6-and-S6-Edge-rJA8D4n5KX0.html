taking out the latest version of the
Samsung gear VR virtual reality headset
now this is available now for $200 and
it works exclusively with the Samsung
Galaxy s6 and galaxy s6 edge smartphones
and it brings a pretty cool virtual
reality experience you can take with you
anywhere the gear VR hasn't changed all
that much from the original gear VR we
saw back in December for the Galaxy Note
4 it's still powered by software built
by oculus the Facebook own VR company
that makes the oculus rift it's also
still called the innovator edition a
signal from Samsung that while anyone
can pick one up it's really aimed at
developers and not the average consumer
the new headset is about 15% lighter
than the last model and you'll use it in
exactly the same way tuck a Galaxy s6 or
s6 edge into these notches on the front
here and the phone will snap right into
place the straps on the top and side
have been tweaked so the headset is a
little more comfortable the touchpad on
the side has been recessed and there's a
little not so it's a bit easier to find
the same go through the back body you
can't wear glasses while you're wearing
the gear VR headset but a focus wheel up
top lets you adjust the focus to suit
your liking I was told to work for folks
who are nearsighted with a focal range
up to about minus 9 diopter there's also
a fan built-in but you can't see it and
I can't hear it it's supposed to keep
the phone from overheating and keep the
display from fogging up there's a
microUSB port on the bottom of the
headset when I was told it won't
actually charge the phone it'll just
keep the battery from draining so you
can keep playing for as long as you're
willing to be tethered the headset is
light and while it took me a bit of time
to get things set up just right I
eventually found a fit that was
comfortable and offered a great virtual
reality experience I played one game
that turned my swivel turn into a jet
pack and made me fight the rings and
robot to other giant city and then I
watched a few movie clips and checked
out 360-degree images of places around
the world virtuality is going to live or
die based on the content that's
available and I still feel really
awkward and isolated whenever I put one
of these things on but making it
available on a mobile phone is a great
first step this could be a neat little
bonus option for someone who's VR
curious and already owns one of
Samsung's new smartphones
head over to see that for all the
details I'm Nate thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
