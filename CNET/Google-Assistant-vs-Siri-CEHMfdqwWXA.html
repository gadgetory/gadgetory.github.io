down some beats here's one I've been
practicing boots and cats and boots and
cats and boots and cats and boots and
cats
okay so we've determined which one is
the more talented of the two assistants
but how do they handle more practical
commands what do I have going on today
good day Vanessa the time is 1204 p.m.
the weather in San Francisco currently
is 68 degrees and mostly cloudy have a
wonderful day okay Vanessa I found three
events for today when is my next flight
okay I found this on the web for when is
my next flight American flight 208 from
San Francisco to Miami leaves at 8:30
a.m. on November 14th when it comes to
calendar integration Google assistant
has a slight advantage not only connects
scheduled events and weed through your
calendar but it can also look through
emails for things like flight
confirmations how do you say I want a
beer in Spanish quiero una cerveza let
me check that even though Google
assistant is not yet available in
Spanish it is unbeatable at translating
languages Siri sometimes can't even
understand my English show me Sofia
vergata movies critics say these are
some of the best her movies include hot
pursuit machete kills and 19 others okay
so you're not always gonna say Sofia
Vetta gotta with a Latin Flair but the
point is Google assistant gets it no
matter what the accent where's she from
I can't do that what are you trying to
find out Vanessa and you can continue a
conversation without having to repeat
information because it's just that smart
Barranquilla Colombia how tall is Tom
Cruise Tom Cruise it's 5 feet 7 inches
tall Tom Cruise is 5 feet tall looks
like Siri shaved off a few inches and
it's not the only thing it's gotten
wrong no one can be Google assistant at
its own searches so things like stats
hours of operations or your basic
searches tend to be more accurate
pixal so they can both do this activate
bluetooth okay i turned on bluetooth but
only google can do this turn on
flashlight show David Bowie songs on
Spotify okay
searching for David Bowie on the iTunes
Store not so fast
Google assistant is undoubtedly better
at controlling Spotify but it's not
better controlling all apps and for apps
like lift and venmo Siri still reigns
supreme
that is until Google assistant gets lift
support which it will so that one's a
draw but let's see which ones can do
this name that tune hang on I can't
identify songs yet I believe this is
deck the halls' by sounds of Christmas
this was a feature that was available on
Google now and for some reason it's not
on Google assistant so let's see which
one can do this read my last email
here's one at 10:25 a.m. Vanessa Hansen
and it's not just for email Siri can
also read back your text or give you
information about your voicemails how
many days until May the fourth it's 174
days until then here's what I found
maybe Siri is better at math so that was
a pretty obscure command and overall
Google assistant is the better of the
two for now but artificial intelligence
still has a ways to go before it can
completely replace humans but it is
getting closer</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
