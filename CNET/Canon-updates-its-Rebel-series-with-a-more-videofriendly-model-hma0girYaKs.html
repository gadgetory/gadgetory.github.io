enhancements over its predecessor the
t3i including a touch screen and the
incorporation of a hybrid CMOS that
makes the camera better at auto focusing
in live view and video provided you use
it with one of the new STM line of Canon
lenses the body remains very similar to
the t3i slight weight and a little
plasticky feeling but it has a couple
major exceptions in the design first
cannon move the video mode from the dial
to the power switch since you used to
have to rotate the dial all the way
around to get from one mode to the other
this makes a huge difference if you
frequently jump between still and video
shooting second the addition of the
touchscreen makes performing operations
like rack focus during video much easier
if in fact you use the auto focus but it
also makes it faster to change settings
like iso sensitivity because you can
choose them directly rather than cycling
around the options the cameras
performance is also improved a bit
putting it on par with recent competing
models it's fast burst drop
significantly when you're shooting
moving subjects though with the servo
autofocus with one of the STM kit lens
is the live view autofocus actually
becomes usable but with the cheaper 18
to 55 millimeter kit lens it's still
pretty bad in Live View I do like the
tonality of low light video despite the
appearance of some color noise on blacks
the camera tins to disappoint on the
features front however it's got the
basics you'd expect from a nine hundred
dollar body but lacks a lot of modern
options like GPS or wireless as well as
interesting traditional features like
time-lapse multiple exposures and
intervalometer if you're considering the
camera I'd opt for the more expensive
kit with the 18 to 1 35 millimeter lens
the lens is pretty good for a kit faster
than the cheaper 18 to 55 millimeter
lens but still sharp and it's a nice
flexible focal range the 24 eyes overall
a good option but it's not a no-brainer
if you just want a decent still Canon
DSLR the t3i still fills the bill and
it's cheaper if a bit slower for video
the t4i is a great cannon pick but
they're comparable alternatives
available if you're willing to sacrifice
an optical viewfinder I'm Lori Brennan
and this is the canon eos rebel t4i</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
