7100 it's available in 48 55 and 65 inch
sizes this is the 65 behind me here
among the company's numerous 4k TVs for
2015 the 7100 has the best balance of
picture quality design features and
price that I've seen so far plenty of
Samsung sets are curved but in my book
the curve doesn't add much to the
viewing experience so it's not worth the
extra price the 7100 is flat but still
managed to look just as futuristic as
those curved TVs I really like the extra
thin bezel metallic finish and angled
frame the sleek stand is the same low
profile version found on the company's
more expensive TVs samsung's remote is
equally stylish with slick motion
control much like a Nintendo Wii
controller it has a minimum of buttons
because most the action takes place on
screen at times the dual cursor controls
can be confusing but overall it works
well and I especially appreciated the
rapid-fire speed of its menus Samsung
Smart TV system powered by Tizen also
offers plenty of apps including HBO Go
and the 4k versions of Netflix and
Amazon Instant Video it's similar to use
than past Samsung efforts but not quite
as good overall as Roku TV another
feature that sets the 7100 apart is one
connect mini this little box which
houses all four HDMI inputs in addition
to USB and optical digital means you
only have to run one cable to the TV
itself and the future samsung says it
will sell upgraded one connect boxes
that can make the TV compatible with
future formats or improve other features
this kind of hardware upgrade ability is
unique to Samsung TVs the Ju 7100 also
delivered very good picture quality if
deep black levels are helped by local
dimming improving contrast and punch and
its color accuracy and video processing
are top-notch this Samsung is not the
best performing 4k TV I've tested for
the price that stink to belong to Vizio
but it's definitely no slouch that's a
quick look at the Samsung unj you 7100
4k TV I'm Debbie Catz Mayer cocina</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
