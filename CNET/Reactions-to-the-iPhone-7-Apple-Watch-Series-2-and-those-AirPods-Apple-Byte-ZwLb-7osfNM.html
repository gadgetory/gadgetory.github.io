our state night to O'Brien yeah we go
what's up Nick that's the new air cuts
yeah I thought they weren't coming out
October you know how we do how does he
always get the coolest stuff so I love
yeah you know hippies what's good Brian
Chong here and welcome to the Apple bite
after an Apple Keynote
and you know you're getting plenty of
good and bad apples now we aren't going
to get into every single minut detail
and really that's what the extra crunchy
podcast is for anyways so let's start
off light and work our way through this
together
alright first up the Apple watch series
- that's the official name and they get
all the upgrades we expect it with GPS
better battery life but I was impressed
with the water resistant up to 50 meters
it can be used for swimming and it can
be worn while showering which someone
from this show might have tried out with
the original Apple watch and let's not
dismiss the water ejection speaker
now watch OHS trace will be available on
September 13th and it's what makes this
watch worth using plus there's even a
Nike Plus version that screams hey I'm
sporty now the overall improvement gets
a good apple from me
but it's probably not enough to make a
significant change in sales and how
about the Pokemon Go app which was given
about the same amount of time as the
actual watch can't wait to get Pokemon
go from our watch maybe I can finally
break out a level 2 and catch my
daughter get to level 2 yeah that means
he's never even played Pokemon go now
pre-orders start September 9th with an
upgraded series 1 starting at 269 the
new series 2 starts at 369 and they'll
be available on the 16th but what about
that killer all white ceramic Apple
watch that looked awesome until I looked
up the price see 1249 with the cheapest
spore pen are you kidding me that's a
bad apple
like really bad a surprise the iPhone 7
is without a doubt the most advanced
phone they have ever made you know
because it's their newest one and they
made sure to remind us over the world's
most advanced mobile operating system
deserves the most advanced smartphone
and / iPhone 7 the most advanced iPhone
ever now it's a whole lot faster with
the a10 fusion chip and you've got to
love the stereo speaker design at the
top and bottom of the iPhone finally but
Apple kind of set us up with their
initial iPhone 7 promo video showing
only a dual lens camera and made you
think for a moment maybe it's coming to
both sizes of phones now now the best
part of this keynote had to be the new
dual lens camera on the 7 + sure I'm
bummed it's only on the plus I'm not
going to get one just because of it but
camera lovers will be going to town with
its new zoom control and its portrait
mode that allows you to take those great
bouquet style photos now this camera
ain't a bad apple this is a rad Apple
yeah you like that now portrait mode
will be coming later as a software
update it wasn't clear but my hope is
that this effect can eventually expand
to things like food flowers or anything
so it's not just restricted to people's
faces also ear pods come with the
Lightning connection now you can get a
lightning to headphone jack adapter as
well in there so who's coming out with a
split lightning to headphone the phone
charger adapter because for now you
can't charge your phone and listen to
music unless you go wireless
and everybody charged 40 or 50 bucks
you'll be rich plus jet-black now looks
like the new black to Apple kind of like
how rose gold with the new black last
year and it's all about the illusion of
a seamless design but then scroll down
on the iPhone 7 tech specs page keep
scrolling no you're not done yet keep
scrolling like all the way to the bottom
and look there that's where it says the
high-gloss finish of the jet-black
iPhone 7 is achieved through a precision
9 step anodization
and polishing process its surface it's
equally as hard as other anodized Apple
products however its high shine may show
fine micro operations with use if you
are concerned about this we suggest you
use one of the many cases available to
protect your iPhone are you serious
a case the jet-black iPhone you know
your new flagship color that makes the
lines disappear it needs a case and
that's a bad apple but I'm just looking
one the iPhone 7 starts at 6:49 but jet
black starts at 749 and starts with 128
gigs the seven-plus starts at 7 69 now
apple also quietly updated the Apple
Care Plus plan is still extends your
phone's coverage to two years and two
incidents but now if you have a screen
damage issue that will only cost you a
twenty nine service fees and any other
damage will cost $99 see in the past
screen damage also costs a ninety nine
dollar fee so good Apple iPhone 7 and 7
plus our 129 for Apple Care Plus but
let's get to the air Potts yes those air
pods they look so good at first like
during the reveal so good the wait for
it wait for it
NoHo what the heck is that it's called
the shaft now the tech inside of them is
legit so remember this before you get
all mad at me the tech is awesome the w1
ship is sinking an ability to manage the
air pods is ridiculous there's nothing
like it but the look yeah there's also
nothing out there like it and guess what
looks matter then you tell yourself come
on it probably looks fine in person so
you check out Apple's website and then
you tell yourself see it's not that bad
but then you finally see it on someone
oh no that's a bad apple
and I get it you are packing that thing
with tech but Apple what was your
inspiration like honestly you can tell
us was it a q-tip a miniaturised white
hair dryer maybe a golf tee or an
electric toothbrush heads well hold on I
found it what is that on your ear yes
that has to be what it was I'm really
not sure what's going on over there
first the iPhone battery case and now
this I'm having a hard time deciding
which one actually looks worse but I
applaud Apple for taking a big step
forward because in the next couple of
years these will look different they'll
look better and they'll even do more
Apple even told us what it takes to do
something like this courage the courage
to move on do something new that betters
all of us and our team has tremendous
courage so now we all know it takes
courage
well this yes this is what courage looks
like now
and courage will also cost you 115 um
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show please email us at the Apple
buy to cnet.com or tweet me at Brian
songs and tell us what you all thought
about the keynote thanks so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
