and welcome to the Apple buy for
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple let's get to it and last week
we talked about the plans for Apple's
touch ID to potentially be replaced by
3d face scanning that's Apple is
currently testing well a new report from
Barron's claims Apple is struggling to
perfect the new under glass sensor and
has just a couple of weeks to figure it
out the report says Apple has until
August to either place orders for the
new fingerprint sensor components or
miss that window and have no fingerprint
ID at all which would delay the release
of the iPhone now we know Apple always
has a plan B every company does but even
the prospect of having to angle your
phone to capture a face can accurately
while you're at a point-of-sale terminal
just isn't ideal for Apple pay and I
know I don't want to do that now it's
really the biggest mystery with the
iPhone right now will it or won't it
have touch ID now the majority of
comments from last week's show that
Apple by nation supports an embedded
touch ID over any other method now after
last week's episode an Apple patent
application was published describing how
their 3d face scanning could potentially
work using three parameters for
detection including face detection skin
tone detection and even movement to tell
if the face at scanning is a living
person now the same method could be
directly applied to unlock a Mac in
sleep mode as well but it's clear that
Apple is looking to move forward with
this all right two new iPhone 8 rumors
dropped this week the first one comes
from leaker Benjamin Gaskin who says
that the next iPhone will come in four
different colors and one of them will be
a mirror-like finish eScan posted a
picture of an iPhone in a mirror case to
give you an idea of what it could really
look like and you know what I'm down for
that
all right wireless charging is still
expected to come to the iPhone but a
tweet from Darian fireballs John Gruber
claims the wireless inductive charger
accessory will be sold separately which
is no surprise but it might be late to
the party and could arrive with an
update to iOS 11.1 you know I'm just
crossing my fingers and hoping this
isn't another case of the air pods which
is still at a 6-week backorder like nine
months after it was originally expected
to launch ok Apple has also taken some
ELLs this week the first hit comes
a report from the Wall Street Journal
that says Apple is losing ground in its
digital movie business thanks to Amazon
and Comcast the big a claims 20% to 35%
of digital movie rentals and sales but
that's down from 50 percent in 2012
based on the journals estimates Amazon
now claims 20 percent market share and
Comcast accounts for 15% of digital
movie rentals and sales now overall
sales across the industry were up 12
percent to 5.2 billion dollars but more
competition and streaming services
continue to take a bite out of Apple
okay
app analytics company verso reports that
Syria is still the most popular
intelligent assistant with 41 million
users in May of this year but fewer
people are using it Syria is almost
twice as popular Samsung's s voice which
came in second but it lost nearly
fifteen percent of its users from a year
ago now in general the reports still
found that people really aren't using
smart assistance and widespread adoption
has been sluggish at best okay and some
quick bites the third beta for iOS 11
and Mac OS hi Sierra have rolled out to
developers and for the first time you
can now sign up for Apple's public beta
for Apple TV now go and sign up at beta
Apple comm to get features like
automatic pairing to air pods in iOS 11
or changing its appearance from dark to
light mode and more and for all you
early adopters if you have a first
generation Apple watch kind of like this
one right with a separated back cover
you don't want that Apple or an
authorized service provider will repair
it free of charge up to three years from
its original purchase date the issue is
happening to some users when they remove
it from the magnetic charger so this is
an example really where Apple is
watching out for accusers yes I'm on a
roll today and before I leave let's dig
into the Apple by YouTube's feedback of
the week cam sauce jr. says bruh is that
a skunk on your head brah I have no idea
what you're talking about alright that's
it for this week's show
we'll be taking a break next week and
there will be no show like I just wanted
to let you know because I don't want you
to be looking for the latest Apple bite
and then leave disappointed well you
know I'm surfing eating ridiculous food
and turning Ted shades of brown
while I'm on a beach why now you can
email us at the Apple buy to cnn.com or
tweet me at Brian Tom but I probably
won't see it so we'll see in a couple
weeks thanks so much for watching and
we'll catch y'all next time for another
bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
