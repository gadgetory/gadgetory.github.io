google issues for everything going on
inside the world of google the top
stories this week belong to samsung and
LG after an image obtained by the verge
has been confirmed to be the new LG g 6
that is coming februari 26th it features
a large 5.7 inch screen with unique to
buy one aspect ratio and takes up ninety
percent of the front versus space for
the bezel now the g6 will be made
entirely out of glass and metal and
looks to ditch the modular and plastic
design of the g5 and let's not kid
ourselves it's rounded corners and
polished edges brings a familiar iphone
design aesthetic now the g6 will have a
headphone jack it will be waterproof but
will no longer have a replaceable
battery also an image by d for design on
twitter is believed to show off the two
galaxy s 8 front panels with a minimal
bezel and rounded display corners it's
the best picture we've seen the date and
android police sources say this image is
a very close match to the actual device
the galaxy s 8 is expected to come in
two sizes both will have curved displays
and samsung will skip Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona this year a Forbes
report says the new s8 will debut in
Korea on April the 14th now Samsung is
also going to make life tougher for
other phone manufacturers by hoarding
qualcomm supply of their latest
snapdragon 835 processor with a deal
made between the two that means the s8
will get the latest chip while the LG G
6 will use last year's 821 snapdragon
instead of waiting for samsung to get
their share which would have delayed the
g6 we don't really know how much better
it will actually be but the google pixel
that runs the 821 chip does just fine we
can assume the tech specs knobs I know
who you are you'll make a big deal of it
but it might not really matter that much
so we'll see and Samsung revealed this
week it was two separate battery defects
that caused the note 7 to explode
resulting in a massive and yes
embarrassing recall the first battery
from Samsung SDI suffered from an
external case design that was too small
for its internals causing it to
short-circuit and ignite then the second
battery from hong kong-based and / x had
a different flaw according to samsung
from a manufacturing defect because they
were trying to pump out replacement
batteries
as quickly as possible bottom line blame
it on the batteries and we'll see how
and if Samsung can recover in 2017 all
right let's get to Google News google
home now supports belkin wemo and
honeywell thermostats adding support for
two major smart home brands the Google
pixel will also be getting more support
for home control in the near future
right now the assistant on home has
received more updates for things like
Netflix Google photos and more so adding
home control for the pixel assistant
will help close that gap plus the Google
Chrome OS is known for running on
Google's Chromebooks it's also run on
other devices like chrome boxes and
sticks a verge report says Google will
now be allowing OEMs to build a wider
variety of form factors on the chrome s
including convertibles detachable and
tablets even if it's a declining market
this new approach to Chrome OS tablets
to give them something that functions
more like a surface pro but has more
features than current iPads and as we
get closer to the new Google watch
februari 9th launch google has released
its fifth and final developer preview
for Android where to point o it now
brings iOS support and talks to
third-party apps on iPhones along with
bug fixes developers can now also start
uploading their final where to point o
apps to the Play Store and if you love
space google has announced that five
teams of the 30-plus that applied have
qualified for its Lunar XPrize
competition to land a privately funded
robot on the moon those five teams will
be competing for a 20 million dollar
reward the second team to succeed will
take home 5 million now the team's
robots will not only have to land on the
moon successfully but the robot will
have to travel at least 500 meters and
then transmit back high def photos and
videos to Planet Earth the team has less
than a year left with the launch
deadline of December 31st 2017 all right
that's going to do it for this week you

much for watching we'll catch the next
time for some more of that Google issues
