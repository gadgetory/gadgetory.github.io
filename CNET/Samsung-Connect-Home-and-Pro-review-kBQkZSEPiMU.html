system that's also smart things help
it's available as a 3-pack for $380 or a
single unit is 170 it's AC 1300 rating
capture speed at 400 megabits per second
on 2.4 gigahertz and 867 megabits per
second on 5 gigahertz upgrading to the
Samsung connect home pro doubles those
speeds and costs about $250 per unit if
you want maximum coverage you can
connect up to 5 units for one home at a
time the biggest headache I encountered
during testing was the Samsung Connect
app which is the only way to set it up
it had a very hard time recognizing the
units so be ready to completely close
and restart the app as well as have a
pen or paper clip ready to hit the tiny
reset button in the back of each unit
that isn't connecting while the app has
its limitations Samsung just announced
it will be consolidating all its apps
into one so you'll soon be able to
control a majority of your Samsung
products from a single app for testing I
put two units on the first floor and one
in the basement the main hub which was
wired to the modem showed speeds of just
over 500 megabits per second at 10 feet
away
the second unit also located on the
first floor was about half that speed
and the basement unit where the Wi-Fi
signals generally pour was a surprising
140 megabits per second with the pro
unit as the main hub
I saw speeds of over 600 megabits per
second at close range as the smartthings
hub the samsung connect home worked
great the app synced up with the smart
device is much easier than with the
router and it has an automation feature
so you can do stuff like turning on a
light when you open a door you'll save
money too by not having to buy a
separate hub for your smart devices
overall I would only recommend the
Samsung Connect home for someone who
wants to upgrade their outdated router
and have a hub for their Samsung smart
devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
