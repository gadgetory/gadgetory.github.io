Yuletide episode of the 404 show the
tour of the old studio in a tour of the
new studio so reminds will get the old
one out away yeah you want to know
what's it before picture look like bad
news just want to prep you guys there's
a lot of wires in there it's kind of
fire hazard you think we'll make it hard
check it out so we have a fancy card
scanner and this is what you guys used
to see every day here we are the
skeleton of the old studio remarkably it
actually looks cleaner in here now that
is it when we are actually podcast it
definitely looks better now there's no
doubt about it so yeah this is where I
said obviously Justin Arielle yeah Oh
things are a little in disarray now
because we're in much better facilities
right now but this was it and all that's
left is a couple compressed pressors an
xbox one which is kind of cool that it's
here let me get that off you and that's
really it on the old masters of this
situation here's the mixer that we used
to use an old maki and this is where the
show is produced every single day
obviously all the cameras are gone we've
moved them into the new studio yeah the
TriCaster used to sit back there which
is where it used to make the room about
I want to say like a nice 97 degrees if
you ever wondered why the show maybe
didn't sound as good or if we had
technical errors let me just guide you
over here this is this stuff let me do
these wires right here is the source of
the problem it's like a radio shack
threw up it's bad there's a lot of
random junk in here half of which I
don't think was ever even plugged in
while we were broadcasting so now we're
just using this studio for some
recording we've got one mic hooked up
there still an ISDN which lets us talk
on the radio and get really good sound
quality all that is remarkably
functional some way I don't know what's
going to happen with this room we kind
of want to keep it for audio recording
and stuff like that all right put enough
of this junk really what we forgot one
of them
important things about the old co that I
think we should actually move into the
new one it's right behind Arielle here
this is our hall of fame it's the wall
of fame wall of fame it actually started
before i joined the 404 you guys started
yeah and we basically had these business
cards that we had all of our guests
signs so you can see claymores is on
here in Libby goad ye olde natali del
conte dr. Bruce's first appear look at
2008 I don't know when that was but I
bet you can get some good money on ebay
yeah oh yeah this is murderer if you're
really a 404 fan you remember James Ray
that's correct what is manslaughter yeah
let's be specific but you know let's get
our camera McCarthy yeah Phil Ryan the
brothers look at this david karp that's
worth what's up billionaire well not
billionaire but mega mega millionaire
yeah so good times gone by good times
gone by all right let's go out with the
old in with the new Justin lead the way
to the brand new studio this is gonna be
fun all right we're gonna go in the
subway and go a long travel I know wait
let's also show this part oh just sort
of the 404 graveyard here this has been
like the the studio overflow some some
of the stuff that doesn't really work
anymore kind of lives here in the
graveyard right yeah here check this out
this is what the inside of the internet
looks like looks like that look at that
doesn't work too well yeah all right
let's continue I'll walk over here hey
Sally hey Sally all right so here we go
the short walk knocking over here
arielle's cube hello are you all right
guy so here we are sophisticated
equipment here saw on air light do you
want me to make it from the old studio
right let's go in after you whoa you
guys should play like super chanty I
opening music right now yeah here we are
in the brand-new studio that we can do
miss it whoa
oh I think I've ever seen you move I
know yeah that's cool I'm sore like so
check it out the new studio it's divided
into quarters the first you know ours is
obviously kind of like the bigger sort
of section here this is where we do the
show now this is where we're going to do
our new show you come where I'm standing
and look at Justin you can check out
this is update corner of the studio yeah
I mean look how good this man looks on
that kind I don't know if a lot of
people knew that update and the 40 for
the new versions that were both filmed
in the same studio but we're actually
right next to each other very cool it's
pretty rad and so this is brigette stuff
and then over here this is my favorite
part of the whole studio which is the
control center this is where if our
yellow hi to Mike he would be describing
right now haha but he does not get some
of that board man we paid good money for
that yeah show it off pretty dope got
some of that board porn yeah also as we
call it in the business and here is the
last.fm section of the room they have a
nice foot tall stage and some really
cool space interview people live
performances there's already been what
like a half a dozen people come in here
do a little live set they have a cool
sort of setup for live music that works
out really well check out some of the
equipment we got all brand-new cameras
we got a friggin crazy gosh look at that
looking pretty tight obviously we moved
the tricaster back in here and all the
same problems followed along with yeah
yeah no but I guess that's it right no
that's not it what else is so much more
to look at oh come over here are you
there's more I wanted to sort of get a
close-up of the stuff that we have on
the shelves though this is a work in
progress it'll kind of it'll be fluid so
these things will change out every once
in a while but Jeff do you want to sort
of give a tour of your side because we
kind of split it up Jeff side and my
side so this is this is all just oh well
so I was home for Thanksgiving and look
what I found a bunch of old Nintendo
games all kidding aside these are like a
classic classic classic unbelievable
stuff the price bar worth something yeah
two three dollars maybe
most old-school Dreamcast come on you
got to respect that taxi cab for sweet
Lou yeah and then I mean the Holy Grail
which i think the freaking cartridge is
still in there that's pretty what am I
thinking bringing this in I'm Genesis
anymore so I can't me play but uh but
yeah we got our 40 for custom
controllers and you guys remember from
from last time oh this is my favorite
piece right here this is a Riddler
trophy from the Arkham City video game
classic like thanks to the guy's a
triforce for that pretty sick yeah we
also found these novelty CDs only look
how big they are right it's gonna create
and they're black we found them on the
street yeah I couldn't find a player for
him yet that'll doesn't matter they do
look really cool man I didn't realize we
had all that Beatles record yeah yeah
all right so swing around to the side
much cooler side in my opinion yeah you
true yeah we'll start with my Ming plant
and my fern you'll see these plants get
switched out too so I'm just go in the
next half hour talking about the
different plans what are their names
this is Beyonce and Sierra we have all
the other characters in the room but
you'll see them as we broadcast so
that's the plants and up here we got
some books more records this I am very
excited about if there's anyone who's
into keyboards out there and I know
there's at least one maybe two aside
from myself this is the model m but if
you'll notice it's the ten keyless
emergence of no numbers this thing is
worth 150 or 200 dollars you know he
throws a great party and he has great
like he's a great party home yeah
millions come over to my apartment like
he's the talk of the freaking taxi
dinner you want to be there so this next
thing is uh what sort of the same thing
as Jeff's old genesis games I found a
bunch of these VHS tapes at my house
back in huntington beach that's cool
these are actually tapes that my mom
recorded old television shows on too so
there's Ninja Turtles power rangers
Fantastic Four pretty rad yeah those are
also only got a you know a couple of the
books and then the old junk the old junk
shelf over here it's going to say that
this is junk no of course not it's cool
that people get to see like the close-up
of like what actual like all these
little you know
panels come out which is kind of amazing
yeah everyone did such a good job we've
got some cool lighting in case you
wanted to see like what the deal was
with this we could change the colors of
that you're going to go do that I'm
gonna try I'm gonna check it out right
now okay ready watch this watch this
much as I hope he knows how to use those
three switches do you think he knows how
to do it probably not I want this to be
red come on make it red like red oh it's
just turn are you serious oh you be man

he sits here yeah so check it out like
getting a little techy little nerdy all
of our mics pop into this dope little
bored we got there their snake through
the room it's not the most glamorous
solution but you can't see it when it's
on video and it looks fantastic yeah I
got a couple cubby shelves over here
there's a lot of room over here so
that's what's going on with the table I
didn't realize when I first saw the
designs for the set that the back of the
table was Hollow yeah it was pretty cool
well instead of you thought it'd be one
big piece of wood but it's cool that
where you're sitting there right now
that's our view that's what we see when
we're doing the show you care about that
you know we move this camera around and
that's how it works so yeah I'm pretty
psyched about the tour yeah I hope you
guys dug it and thanks for bearing with
us during this interesting time in 2013

but I think from all of us we want to
wish everyone a very happy holiday and a
happy new year and thanks for sticking
