if you limit yourself to the Apple
universe of music video and podcasts who
wants to be limited i'm tom erik from
cnet com I'm going to show you how to
add divx avi and more to your Apple TV
XBMC is free and open source software
for windows linux and OS 10 that many
consider the best media center software
out there it grew out of the mod chips
that they used to use on the original
xbox and because it can run on OS 10
that means it'll run on the Apple TV
which runs on OS 10 boxee is a service
based on XBMC that is currently in
private alpha you can get some free
invites actually they were nice enough
to set up one just for you at boxee TV /
seen it then you'll have to download and
set that service up separately let's get
started on the mod make sure you have
your Apple TV turned off then make sure
you have a USB stick with at least one
gigabyte of space download the ATV USB
creator from google code insert a
bootable USB Drive into your Mac run the
ATV USB creator select a TV patch stick
make sure the XBMC and boxee plugins are
selected now make sure your USB Drive is
selected and press create using again
make sure your Apple TV is off remove
the USB Drive and plug it in to your
Apple TV power on your Apple TV and the
patch stick will run the ATV bootloader
after the bootloader finishes remove it
and restart your Apple TV it now has
options for boxee XBMC right there on
the main menu click on voxxi then select
update boot launcher this is going to
help prevent some problems with the
remote then select XBMC boxee then
update and then boxee this will download
boxee from the net once it's done
installing restart your Apple TV then do
the same thing for XBMC you'll probably
want to explore the facts at XBMC and
the blog at boxee to make the most of
your new capabilities that's it for this
