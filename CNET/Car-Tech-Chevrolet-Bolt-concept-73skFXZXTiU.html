pony car called the Ford Mustang well
Jimmy's done something similar they now
have the chevy volt and now my nose
isn't stuffed up alongside the Volt
there may soon be a bolt with a beam the
difference is this car is pure electric
all battery kind of like a BMW i3 or
perhaps a competitor to the new Tesla
Model 3 200 miles on a charge after that
you're walking inside of course is a
concept car so the technology is a
little bit out there they see a
smartphone being used to replace the
ignition key and fob they also see three
driving modes that's not too fanciful in
other words you would map the pedal the
ride height and the suspension
compliance to go from really comfortable
and high efficiency to perhaps much
sporty-er but using more electricity now
the big issue here and for carmakers in
general are the almost historically low
fuel prices right now not good news for
anything electrified however this cars
not due to come to market anytime soon
by then perhaps and you can imagine the
Bolton team is secretly hoping that gas
prices will have spiked although I'm
sure they don't want to say that
publicly otherwise electric cars are
gonna have a tough row to hoe even
though this one is slotted very nicely a
thirty thousand dollars that would of
course be after some incentives</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
