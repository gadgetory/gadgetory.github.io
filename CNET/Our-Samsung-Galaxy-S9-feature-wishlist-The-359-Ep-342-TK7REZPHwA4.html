baby its 359 episode 342 and it is so
good to be back how you guys feeling
great amazing been in New York for just
two days now
you know like I'm back in the groove
that's right well this man it's been six
weeks I've been gone for six weeks holy
cow I know we didn't miss you that's a
lie we missed you very much as did
everybody joining us here hopefully
we're gonna see some of the regulars
back sorry we had to take such a long
weird hiatus but scheduling schedule we
had CS and then we had a Detroit show
last week and really we're just getting
our equipment that should do this
literally this morning I had to
literally that's why we're running a
little bit late we actually had to put
everything back together not we Brian we
do nothing Ben and I literally just sit
here I'm just the target your head yeah
that's sweet of you all right I'll take
it
starting the new year with a new
brighter at the new year on the in the
middle of the 20th of January well it's
the first time I've slept in the office
for me it feels at the new year
Touche all right so we're gonna be
talking about a few hot topics we're
gonna chime in samsung galaxy s 9 our
colleague Jessica Dole cork scours Lucy
s trying to find the coolest tech I came
with this nice wish list things we want
to see in the next flagship phone from
Samsung and then next up the big story
the day an inside look at the Amazon go
store this is that fully automated store
are calling sharp tip can got to check
it out the been work at the char on the
story is able to kind of run through the
store what it's like why we should care
mmm-hmm so with that let's let's get it
going as usual if you've any questions
leave in the comments section Brian will
pick out the best and we will try to get
that get to them in 3 minutes and 59
seconds from 3 to
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Ben Fox very been the Samsung Galaxy S 9
is expected to make its debut late in
February at Mobile World Congress but
we've already got a wish list of
features that we want to see in the
phone it's actually not our list
Jessica dual-core hunted down the
coolest tech at CES and came up with a
nice roundup of the best stuff that we
want to see in Samsung's next flagship
phone first up it's personal favorite of
mine something I want to see in display
a fingerprint sensor mmm using face ID
for a while now right and then like
isn't it it's relatively easy right it's
not that hard to use no face ID works
relatively well I mean there are some
errors every once in a while but I do
miss having a fingerprint sensor in the
front now Samsung also when they move to
this all display design put their
fingerprint sensor in the back and
probably the most awkward position
pocket that's a little weird right next
to the camera I'm still not used to it
but it's nice to have it I share with
you that having a actual physical
fingerprint sensor is better for me
anyway but you know Apple moving to face
ID it does make you wonder if they are
ever gonna do another finger print
sensor sure that flagship I mean there
are situations where I would like to
just unlock the phone on the desk
you know without like staring at it so I
could see what's what's going on my
phone and those situations like having
an actual fingerprint sensor embedded
underneath the display is handy and as
vivo this Chinese phone makers shown
that's definitely possible they're
coming out with one you know synaptics
has said that more phones are gonna come
out with the technology so at least on
the Android side I think we're gonna see
some of this technology show up yeah so
another element that Jessica talked
about which I really like but I don't
think it's actually gonna happen in
phones are the physical shutter that you
have we saw these with the Google
assistant smart displays at CES you can
physically turn off or you can
physically prevent the video from
working the selfie cam so I think it's
it would be hard to like embed that into
a phone but ik size-wise those phones
are so small having another fiscal
switch to or shutter even something as
small as a shutter for
one of these cell front-facing cameras
it takes away from the real estate but
they could be jamming in more components
more circuitry more battery power
battery power and I'm just yeah and
especially with an iPhone I mean I don't
know I I mean I kind of disabled space
ideas I've been watching too many black
mirror episodes I would like the
physical shutter I want to know that
there's no way that thanks ray and then
lastly the bendable screens that we saw
with LG televisions obviously we want to
see that show up in Samsung phones
unlikely to be shown at galaxy s 9 I
mean all the rumors pointed at s 9 being
kind of a more incremental update to the
the s8 but can't help but to hope that
you know the the bendable screen
technology doesn't make its way it's
coming it's coming we've been talking
about it for years and it looks like
they tech companies are getting closer
and closer yep actually having bendable
and foldable screens so look out for
that maybe not quite yet but soon so
next up Amazon's fully automated store
amazon go has finally launched our
colleague shark tip can got a chance to
check it out and then you worked with
her on the story just first off what is
amazon go
it's basically a cashier 'less store you
walk in you you scan your phone at a
turnstile you walk in you pick up
whatever you won and the store
recognizes and notices what it is that
you're picking up and then you could
just leave I don't have to talk to a
cashier you don't have to talk to a
person if you don't want to I guess
that's why I'm curious how does that
work like how does it know that you're
picking up a certain object well if you
put it back down well if you pick up
multiple objects like how do you how are
you not constantly trying to fool that
camera they have a ton of cameras around
the store and that are constantly
tracking your your entity your your body
movements everything like that even if
it's a bustling very busy store and this
is something that Amazon worked for five
years on so there's there's a reason
that it took this long because it's a
really complicated problem let's begin
which it was delayed right they actually
set the goal to launch by middle last
year yep early 2017 and we're in 2018
it's just launching now yeah it's a
little disappointing they didn't really
provide much of an explanation as to why
it was delayed everything that we were
hearing was that they had glitches but
they
said that they had so much enthusiasm
from Amazon employees that they just
held off until now and lastly we're
gonna see this anywhere else this is
right now Amazon goes just at the
headquarters right they're saying
they're laser focused specifically on
this store but I would expect other
retailers to start to get a little
nervous and maybe we'll see more of this
type of technology start cropping up in
the next couple years all right for
these stories and more check us on CNET
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks
for listening
I love that thing thanks for that it's
all right this the Amazon store just to
clarify this is only in Seattle right
now this is like right at the end
headquarters yeah and it's open for the
first time today to the public it's been
open to Amazon employees for like
basically the past year and from talking
to like Amazon employees they seem to
love it you walk in grab your lunch
items you get a pasta salad you got a
wrap you walk out you don't have to like
wait in line or anything I like this
idea I hate people yeah this is great
for for people that hate other people I
mean and we see it now like drug stores
they have those self checkout kiosks
exactly fails you know not only for
failures but those self checkouts are
also hotbeds of shoplifting there are so
many ways to so easy to trick them yeah
you couldn't you can pick up two items I
mean I'm not gonna tell people out of
shoplift but anyway there are a lot of
ways to shoplift using the self checkout
so there's good reason to switch out and
not use that technology anymore I am
really looking forward to when they open
up one of these Amazon stores in Detroit
and they can employ Robocop security if
you were given last full circle you know
fully automated I'm so fully automated I
am intrigued by this idea that attracts
your entity yes really vague about or
your phone or do you think they're all
got the Alexa armed toilets in the store
and they're fantastic that's Lucy yes
that's a toilet we never flush we never
asked sure if there was a restroom there
it was like a place that you could just
like run off like there's a
room but only for robots exactly well
you're not gonna be there for very long
that's true like what I did ago so I was
like girl story sorry's in any store has
restrooms is cuz you're never really
stuck behind that lady who insists on
paying with a check and you can't wait
that long
never again never again thanks to him is
on go by it's really as talking about
the self checkout kiosks that's like one
of the only checkout technologies that's
really existed for a long time now we
have mobile payments but yeah I use
mobile payments especially with this
fingerprint sensor it's janky it doesn't
work most of the time or does about half
of the time so something like Amazon go
will be really valuable and useful for
customers and it's worth mentioning
there is a lot of hand-wringing about
what does this mean for jobs but it's
right for automation is just going to
put cashiers out of work eventually it's
hard to say so we got some fun stuff
going on in the chat right now welcome
back some of our loyalists who have a
look out the the ugly last month with a
syringe or Josh etc and hello to some
new fans and friends first up I want a
syringe I wants us to play a game
remember the the hole okay merry f kill
game yeah oh god okay so I hope I don't
get fired implement kill don't care for
Pokemon go Android go Amazon go
implement kill don't care I don't care
about pokum yeah sorry
Amazon go and Android go what is Android
go as usual strange oi knows more about
technology than we do well that enjoy
the show is yours we've know by the
magical powers
Oh Android go it's the it's a
stripped-down version of Android for
entry-level phones kill your friends
with it implement or don't care oh why
don't I kill Pokemon go yep yep I don't
care what Amazon going no I don't care
about God we go cuz it's not an art
Center region and then deploy Android I
would agree but don't want I don't want
mines I hate lines nobody likes them
good that was a fun game we should play
that again sometime yeah we actually
have to figure out the technology right
either our viewers actually mentioned by
the way it's also worth mentioning that
like one of the longer lines that most
people have to go through is a grocery
store line and Amazon is like very vocal
about the fact that they're not gonna
bring this to their whole foods I know
that's kinda it's because it's like
those stores are much bigger they've got
way more complicated it's not a
convenience store Amazon go is a
convenience store it's less than 2,000
square feet it's a little bit easier to
manage grocery store we're just not
quite there yet that the volume that you
tend to walk away with at a grocery
store it'd be the self checkout all over
again yeah plus it's like there's all
the produce that doesn't have barcodes
on it or anything how are you supposed
to know if it's like a gala Apple or
pink lady Fuji or a Fuji sure you know
already licious eventually I think we
could get there but I don't think I'm a
drop machine right man it's all about
machine learning just use the words
machine learner I'm just gonna solve
everything exactly I don't know how it's
actually gonna happen just say it enough
it'll happen deep learning algorithms
there you go
shut up to the dash in the chat and
let's take a comment from Josh Boyd I
says I don't get why people want folding
phones so badly you guys seem more
excited about this and I do I'm totally
excited I totally want to see folding
phones mostly because it's it's about
display real estate right like the idea
of it actually being able to fold out to
a larger display you sort of see it with
the X on em except it's got that kind of
unsightly hinge in the Z T makes that
okay so that came out last year III see
the sort of like the very very early
rudimentary start to this trend the idea
foldable phones but if you can get a
screen that's bendable that is that is
actually whole and it folds down to much
more pocketable size but folds back out
to a larger display when you need it
that's that's cool I mean that's
different we've I feel like the phone
industry he's gotten kind of boring
last couple years I heard it's been very
similar yeah yes very similar a lot so
this minor updates and I feel like 2019
or 2018 might be similar that a year
were a lot of big
phones only see minor updates so would
be kind of cool to see something radical
and different and innovative industry
that's why I'm excited I agree with you
the last point especially that it would
just from a philosophical basis as a
tech reporter it would be something
totally different and interesting to
write about but if it doesn't actually
provide customers with something
different that they really won then yeah
it's not gonna take off because like
there is a reason why all the phones
look very similar now it's because it
works right and people are comfortable
in use - so then the one of the ZT
executives who are showing off the X on
them showing off on the new apps the
phone I don't know if you know has two
screens that fold into one but the two
screens are folded out when you fold the
phone down there's one screen on one
side this is a great this was a great
app that he there's advertising on the
back of exactly no no the app that he
showed me was great like on one side the
when you're looking at is the camera
viewfinder on the other side is like
this little cartoon or whatever it gets
your kid to watch the screen one of
troubles I have is having my kid stare
the screen so I could take a photo of
them oh but it displays cartoons or
little things that grab your kids
attention he stares up at the screen you
know what else works camera action works
out well it's not very high tide yeah my
kid my kids pretty he's already kinda
certain about his visual stimuli so like
he's English at night can be there's a
really specific usage well the point is
trying to make was the phone that that X
on em which isn't really a foldable
phone uses it kind of runs on the same
principle he's trying to get developers
to start thinking about how to create
apps that take advantage of two screens
like that near their other ones where
you're playing games you're teaching
you've got two screens there you're
teaching someone how to clip piano right
just two piano keys on each display you
play one the other one runs through the
same thing for a second person I respect
what they're trying to do but I don't
really see much use for that second
outward-facing screen but we'll say well
see I mean I think that's the thing like
we don't we don't really know what those
killer apps are yet but I think the fact
that people are starting to think about
it is a good sign and I just like the
piece of paper phone
you've been reading about it in
technology or in sci-fi for literally
rolls up yeah or just you fold it like a
piece of paper you put it in your pocket
yeah you know like that's eventually
what I don't think we're gonna have that
anytime soon but that's not cool I was
in that pitch meeting that you isn't it
really terrible when you drop your phone
on facedown and the shadows of screen
hear me out let's put more glass on the
back more screen to shatter
yeah well the zooming Corning will get
the whole grille glass thing down and
they'll be super indestructible no guys
sure sure
why not hey listen gage with the
audience a little bit because we're
running out of time let's do it sir
enjoy on the theme of the s9 wish list
yes is synaptics fingerprint sensor
applicable on every type of oled screen
like AMOLED P OLED etc III would need a
double check on that but I think it's
supposed to be underneath the screen so
I don't think glass type actually
matters as much at least because the
actual fingerprint sensor the way it's
light base yes go through his parents
yeah yeah yeah it doesn't matter what
type I don't know how that works
I know Qualcomm if not synaptics was
we're working on in screen fingerprint
sensors that is using work radio waves
or something yeah so you could do it
under metal or other things like that so
it didn't even just have to be glass it
didn't have to be transparent so that
just provides other potential uses for
different phone makers and one more from
Josh boy won't bending a display we're
over time
good question oh that's a great question
we don't have enough of them ya know
that I don't really know I mean I think
the bigger problem is less the display
more everything underneath the display
like how do you get the battery to Bend
how do you get the chip the processor
all the components and underneath like
how does that all fold right or do you
have one on one side and the other side
sort of a thinner thinner sheet that
bends over I don't know it's really uh I
think there are a lot of definitely
practical hurdles that these companies
have to figure out before this is a
reality mmm meanwhile we can keep
dreaming a little off-topic but Scott
mayates got a good question multiple
news reports today in the UK saying that
there is a leak from KGI this is Apple
will stop production on the iPhone 10
this summer more sales
no Watson is going into that question
any extension on that okay I wish I
heard for the podcast no kg I definitely
wanted to yeah yeah I can't imagine them
stopping production on the phone I mean
I just
okay so Watson then wants you to answer
if there's going to be iPhone 10 plus I
mean I think the rumors are cons more
likely at this point I mean I think it's
gonna be a little - I think I don't
think they're gonna stop production
Productions gonna continue I do think
there is gonna be some sort of iPhone 10
plus or whatever they're gonna call the
next iPhone it's gonna look like this
but bigger - there are a lot of yeah 10
to 11 times I'm not just by phone 12 own
12 whatever whatever I mean I think
there we are gonna see a bigger version
of this phone I mean that's what the
rumors are pointing at I don't think
they're gonna stop production this
current fondo it's been only weird year
for a Salesman I don't watch that it's
unclear that I mean we're gonna find out
a couple of weeks when Apple reports
earnings but I mean all occasions met in
March no no no no but all indications
are I mean it's done pretty well it's I
mean it's sold well I mean I think
they're varying reports about how well
it's done but it's it's not a flop by
any means we don't see in in their own
quarterly reports we don't see a
breakdown of the specific phone models
so but just the absolute numbers would
give us some sort of any totally it's
yeah and it's also it's the fourth
quarter is what they're gonna report and
yeah that's the holiday season so you
should expect very big numbers but even
even a bad quarter for Apple is
something that most other phone makers
would be super jealous of yeah so it's
it's it's gonna be a big number but
it'll be hard to tell whether it's gonna
be I phone 10 did really well or not
right they don't break that out we
should look into it more though so scott
says that the Daily Mail is reporting on
it - yeah the scoop mm-hmm I like that
Matthew d'être says if I
OS X is named after big cats maybe
iPhones are gonna start getting named
after little cats the Himalayan this is
a good idea and we're off the rails hey
I think that's probably a good time to
call yeah nice nice being back thanks
everybody
yeah thank you for all the warm welcome
it's like a nice old comfy chair easing
back into that's right
sorry that's what we got to get on the
budget for next season comfy chairs are
your chairs okay I'm cool with that
these chairs are not that great do the
whole thing from recliners anyways man
Roger it's nice to be back in the
captain's chair here with you it's uh it
feels right yeah
take us home take his head all right you
liked anything you saw her hurt here
took us on SEANET our podcast is
available on iTunes tune in stitcher or
soundcloud he'd burn a google play music
Amazon echo it's not on soundcloud sorry
don't remember I'm going from memory I
forget SoundCloud no longer no
SoundCloud sorry it's okay sorry you're
back you're back also seems like a sound
the echo it's cool
thanks everyone we'll be back again
tomorrow theoretically
