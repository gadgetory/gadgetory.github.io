spend your money on when it comes to
building a home theater system it's
undoubtedly the speakers which are most
important followed by a decent ample
receiver to drive them while some people
would balk at paying over $1,000 for a
pair of speakers a pair of PSB imagine
x2 T's will likely outlast everything
else in your system including your TV at
twelve hundred ninety nine dollars a
pair these are definitely an investment
but you sure get a lot of speaker for
your money there's at all speakers at a
bit over three feet and they're
attractive looking with a black ash wrap
and this distinctive three-way speaker
arrangement consisting of a carbon-fiber
mid driver and two base drivers like
most PSP speakers the x2 t uses a
one-inch titanium tweeter and this and
the mid-range driver are kept in their
own cabinet to separate them from the
base while I had some reservations about
the smaller x1 T's I have no such
problems with these the x2 t is a very
talented performer which is able to
communicate dynamics as well as subtlety
across a wide number of genres they will
also kick butt in a home cinema context
getting as low down as 40 Hertz the only
thing to be aware of is that they do
deliver a lot of bass and in a small
room this could be overwhelming but if
you do have the space the x2 T's are
excellent value for the money this is ty
