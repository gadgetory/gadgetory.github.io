Google licious for everything google
that we can pack inside of a show
smartwatches are still getting all the
attention and Google's all over this
with a big update to Android wear that
brings wrist gestures to the platform
now you can flick through cards
hands-free on Android wear by flicking
your wrist away but I would advise
against doing this constantly in public
now Google's platform also brings Wi-Fi
support so your watch won't always need
to be directly connected to your phone
you can also respond to messages by
drawing little emoji replies as long as
you are decent and drawing with your
finger which I am plus they've added
always-on screen always on apps and your
contacts will be more easily accessible
now these updates are coming to all 7
android wear watches over the next few
weeks starting with the LG watch urbane
really the most stylish looking one of
the bunch alright google recently
announced the works with google
cardboard program that lets you be aware
of all the third-party viewers that are
compatible with cardboard apps they're
marked with a little orange badge so you
know google is implementing a QR code
system allowing apps to identify which
cardboard viewer the user has and it
will adjust the experience to fit now
this is really cool and if you're
looking to still get one the good people
at dodocase are making their virtual
reality cardboard toolkit free for a
limited time all you have to do is pay
for the cost of shipping and it works
with android devices as well as the
iphone 6 and 6 plus and in a what if
story this week bloomberg business
reports that Tesla was almost sold to
Google in 2013 on the verge of
bankruptcy and hustling to fulfill their
pre-orders of the Tesla s to early
adopters Tesla had to Elon Musk started
negotiating a deal to sell his company
to Google through his buddy Larry Page
now the report also says while the deal
was being worked out the company would
have cost six billion dollars and they
also needed to invest five billion more
for factory expansions at that time musk
wanted guarantees that Google wouldn't
break up or shut down his company and
the google-owned Tesla for eight years
or until they pumped out their
mainstream third gen car that would be
priced for the masses now Paige even
agreed to the overall proposal and shook
on the deal but it never happened after
sales picked up significantly within
weeks after that and Tesla was able to
pay off its 465 million dollar loan to
the US Department of Energy but this is
just a fun what could have been story
alright in announcements around the
android world live streaming app meerkat
has announced that its opening up a
public beta for its upcoming android app
it's currently on iOS and alongside of
periscope both of these apps have really
jump-started live streaming from your
phone you'll just need to fill out a
google form that you can find from
meerkat to get a chance to be one of the
early beta testers it's also been about
a month of non stop leaks for Sony's
Xperia z4 and it's now officially out in
Japan it looks almost exactly like the
z3 like we thought and brings an
aluminum bezel this time the biggest
changes a 20.7 megapixel rear camera and
an all new Snapdragon 810 processor
running Android 5.0 lollipop also LG
keeps giving us more with the g4 this
time posting a picture on its google
plus page with its tan leather style
booty we'll find out all the official
details on april 228 and if you want
people to stop caring about your
quote-unquote big announcements keep
doing what the team at one plus did
after teasing an announcement for the
past few days that announcement well you
