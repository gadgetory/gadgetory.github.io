geared surface like tablet with an
excellent keyboard the new 2nd gen model
looks exactly like last year's model but
with Intel's new 7th gen processors on
the inside
unlike the Microsoft Surface pro the
Lenovo tablet comes bundled with its
keyboard they're not as skinny as the
surfaces keyboard it still works well
and feels very comfortable to type on it
has a useful track point physical
buttons for left and right clicking and
a button in the middle for scrolling for
a detachable keyboard accessory it's
really pleasant to use lenovo is known
for its great keyboards and the ThinkPad
x1 does not disappoint it also comes
with an active stylus pen that lenovo
usually sell separately for $40 it works
well for note-taking and the keyboard
has a built-in fabric loop for easy
storage there's a built-in kickstand on
the back of the tablet that folds out
like the ramp the moving truck which
offers more stability than the built-in
stand found on the Microsoft Surface pro
wear the kickstand props open like a
folding chair it's a lot more stable for
using on your lap while its display is
satisfyingly sharp its glossy screen
isn't right enough to ward off pesky
reflections in well-lit environments one
major critique about last year's model
was battery life the 2nd gen model
improves on that but only slightly in
our CNET labs battery testing it only
averaged 6 hours and 38 minutes
anecdotally it consistently lasted me
about a workday though I absolutely
needed to charge it by the end of the
day so the ThinkPad x1 really isn't a
big improvement from the first
generation to its credit it's a capable
business to anyone with a versatile
design but unless you want the corporate
features there are better hybrids at
more competitive prices than this one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
