Francisco California it's the a provide
extra crunching podcast with a number
one top apple expert that you need to
learn from mr. Brian Tong wow this is
these intros are getting more
extravagant by the day by the show up
you the top guy Thanks thanks man I'm
the number one stunner everybody welcome
the ex of Apple byte extra crunchy we
are here for episode 54 we are gonna
recap everything the iPhone pre-orders
just went down today technically 12:01
a.m. Pacific time we're also going to
talk about our reaction to the keynote I
don't know if you saw this show there's
this video podcast that kind of started
this whole thing that comes out weekly
called the Apple bite where I think I
was fair but I also went in on Apple it
was fair though don't you think yeah I
saw an email of someone saying you can
you please fire up is all he does is
talk smack but you know keeping it real
everybody yeah it's just not the case so
um we also want you all to be a part of
the show what I love is you're getting
into the habit of calling our show when
something pops in your mind you have a
thought idea put this in your phone
to the pre-orders then what makes it
really tricky is the phone that everyone
at least how about this not that
everyone wants but the the most highly
sought after phone which is the hardest
again and typically runs out fast was
the jet black 7 plus so when people
jumped on to get the jet black 7 plus I
was looking at the wait times cuz you
can kind of play around with it I myself
personally just got a jet black 7 if I
did not work for seeing it I will tell
you right now I would not have upgraded
I would not have upgraded and I use my
own money to upgrade because I've got to
give you my piece are you mine from my
purchases on my plan or no I'm not so
buy straight up so yes everyone's like
Oh baller no I I have to put down a big
fat chunk of change because I'm still
using 18 C's legacy legacy unlimited
data plan from literally like at least
eight nine years ago
I'm not gonna get on there quote-unquote
new unlimited plan if you draw if you
lock into the iPhone upgrade program
which allows you to get a phone every
year includes Apple care you can upgrade
your phone every year but it'll change
your data plan your own actual they
cheat they put you on their updated data
plan so because I'm stubborn and I'm
like I'm old-school I stick and just put
down the money knowing that I can sell
my phone and the difference will end up
being around 200 bucks so that's how I
approach it yeah that's that's that's
kind of how I do it too I sell my old
phone for like two or three hundred
bucks so the new one cost me you know
two or three hundred bucks it's this
really amazing tool call it tool called
eBay eBay I've heard of it I just
started using no I use it all the time
so here's the I want to give you the
breakdown of how fast the jetpack black
seven-plus really went in about the
first minute or two arrival times right
the goal is to get it on September the
16th drop till increase to one to two
weeks this is about in the first minute
first few minutes then if you talk about
the first 10 minutes when it was
available 2 to 3 weeks and then after
that it jumped up to 4 to 6 weeks and
then about 25 minutes into the pre-order
process you're talking about November
Wow VAM November
Oh Movember are you them do do you do
Movember I think it's dirty no I don't I
get that I get the awareness but it just
a lot of my friends that try to grow
mustaches that can't it's just
embarrassing I just say don't do it it's
uncomfortable don't do it it don't it
doesn't look right the other the other
issue is that a lot of people try to do
direct pickup in stores and when I first
and I was one of these people I first
chose that option and none of my local
stores were available for direct pickup
and I got in right away and that
actually delays you because then you
have to back up and change your options
for how you want to pick it up and that
caused some people also to be moved
lower into the queue that's a bummer so
that was crappy but no fear for all
those of you who are like I want to just
walk up into the store Apple has
obviously cut off their ability to to do
that per se at least in store but they
say that they will reopen in-store
pickups reservations on September the
17th at 8 a.m. and this will be specific
to the US and the UK so again you may
not get on launch day but if you don't
want to wait and you want to kind of
play with your chances play with fate
you can pick it up on September the 17th
or you can at least set it up for an
order so it was it was popular the jet
black was popular because it's like the
the color Thayer were like really
pushing hard but I think that the other
thing that was really my headline my
favorite thing about this this whole
iPhone keynote thing is this story that
was just came out according according to
pornhub a specific white website that's
used for specific reasons I don't know I
think it's about I think it just shows
up a lot of gadgets that are like really
pretty silicone heavy on the silicone
parts but pornhub reports that it saw a
nine point five percent drop in global
traffic journey for iOS users during
Apple's live keynote oh wow so when
everyone was getting ramped up for this
porn viewing stopped like the iPhone was
clearly sexy enough to draw all you porn
lovers oh it's amazing now they also saw
a similar drop around
8.8% in Safari users so iOS users 9.5%
Safari users a drop of 8.8% in use
that's weird because you have to watch
the keynote in Safari so you do that's
weird
so that that means they turned their
priority away from pornhub and went to
Safari so went to that blue key no they
the site also reports that 35% of porn
hubs daily visitors are on iPhones and
iPads Wow
they're there they're there going mobile
okay now here's the other fun thing I
after the keynote finished after it was
it was completely you know not not the
pornhub users after completion traffic
increased back up 6% oh wow it's the
power of Apple yeah that's I would not I
would not put that past anybody the
power of Apple defeats the power of porn
so there you go the other thing to talk
about just kind of some other details is
Apple Care has changed a little bit of
how they do business with the iPhone
plan now normally in the past when you
had an incident or you needed to get a
repair it would cost you $99 per repair
this applied to screen repairs as well
but Apple is doing some good things they
are changing this so Apple care does
cover you for two years and two
incidents okay but instead of charging
you $99 for a screen repair they've
updated it so that will only be a $29
charge wow that's a big deal that is a
big deal huge difference I had to pay
like two hundred dollars to replace huge
different service pair service repair so
at least for the iPhone 7 and 7 plus the
Apple Care Plus plan is 129 if you want
to get that I honestly get on all my
devices and the reason why and I've told
people this before is typically
something happens to my phone I get it
swapped out and then I sell my phone so
it's just as good as new nice and then
you typically get the most money and the
warranty is still on there so it's kind
of a strategy that I like to do Apple
Care swap out anything that's messed up
and then put it right back on the market
and then get the new phone there you go
this is this is the beat easy way
also if you're curious about the iPhone
and its performance before the keynote
benchmarks leaked which rumor were
rumored to be the iPhone 7 of how it
outperformed the 6s and the 6s plus
which should is expected but also the
iPad pro twelve point nine inch they ran
new benchmarks this one alleged suggests
pretty much that the iPhone 7 plus
although Apple never officially says it
comes with three gigs of RAM so all you
people that are like always about give
me more RAM
do more RAM and sometimes people get
obsessed about that not just the general
day-to-day experience you'll use the
iPhone 7 looks like it seven plus looks
like it has three gigs of RAM so you can
no longer cry or get mad about the fact
that it only has two gigs of ram because
sometimes people I think really people
obsess about this yeah so um Steven I
need all my ram we've talked about like
the Lightning port but what is probably
the biggest issue that you see just with
listening music and we talked about this
well it's clearly I mean charging your
phone while you're listening to music
right that's that's the biggest thing
everyone's asking about do you do that
yes when I'm sitting at work I'll listen
to music or listen to whatever you know
radio whatever on my phone I have it
plugged in charging now I can't do that
I don't have the fragment yeah you don't
have yeah well actually I guess you'll
be ok because you aren't getting the
phone I'm not gonna get the phone sir no
technically you'll be ok but there's so
many other people that charge and listen
at the same time so Apple is kind of a
funny response someone sent an email
directly to Phil Schiller and we
MacRumors will sometimes surface these
emails and put it as a story and a
writer wrote in to Phil and said oh they
like to use their ear you know they want
to listen on their iPhone 7 like they do
charging at the same time while having
an actual headphone plugged in so Phil
Schiller suggested that they just buy an
Apple dock the Lightning dock because
you can drop it in there but come on
it's not like we all know that's
something that wasn't necessary before
yeah totally I mean like did he check
with marketing before he answered that
question OTT he check he is well he is
ahead himself he's the VP of Marketing
check on themselves you check
with himself and he said it could go
through so that's that lightning dock
cost $49 but just a day ago
Belkin accessorie extraordinaire
released what they have and it's going
to be a lightning I guess you could call
it not a splitter but it's a lightning
adapter a dongle with two ports on it
that will allow you to charge through
lightning and then listen through the
lightning headphone dongle to your music
so it but again it's gonna be this other
extra pain in the another extra thing
that you don't want it's gonna be $40
but at least it's a solution and I said
on the show the video podcasts like
someone's gonna make a lot of money with
this yeah but what's up with wireless
charging then it's more no mention at
all whatsoever
well that's for the next film that's why
your that's why you're not buying this
that's gonna solve the problem of the
iPhone 7 charging problem exactly
see they created a problem but they're
gonna solve it in the next phone and
then tell everyone that they solved it
yeah so that that's what's going on in
the iPhone 7 world but again the
charging cable Belkin you're gonna you
gonna do good I'm curious how many
people are gonna skip the 7 I'm sure
there's gonna be a huge number but it
seems like the sales are pretty strong
already so well what i find what i find
is ultimately i put out a poll on
Twitter and I asked if you're gonna
upgrade or not upgrade and it was pretty
close it was like a 55 to 45 and 55
percent we're gonna upgrade and when I
say I put out a poll I think around like
1,200 people responded and really all it
comes down to is just your upgrade cycle
right you can talk about how I don't
want this phone oh it's not that good or
I'm those people typically aren't even
eligible to upgrade like they don't need
to but if you're someone who has a phone
and you love tech and you've had a phone
for two years in general yeah you're
probably going to upgrade but if you're
smart this year I'm gonna tell you don't
upgrade just hang like my fiancee she
has a 6
she asked me should I upgrade of course
I'm the one that provides her phone for
I do I look she pays for like tons of
dinners and I feel like bad but we make
up for it
you know how I don't know as a guy
sometimes I like feel weird when I'm
like oh I don't want her to pay for me
but then it is nice when someone pays
for you do you ever write of it right
I'm always paying for everything but it
is nice when the wife you know like
whatever it is yeah cuz I treat show
sell treat me I can you treat me I think
that it that's how it that's how it
should be so um
she is not upgrading and I told her it's
worth worth waiting out and all of a
sudden so it's gonna be what a
three-year wait and she's gonna get this
dope 10th anniversary iPhone oh yeah I
think it's go week wheel we call it the
iPhone future the iPhone future all
right let's take a break

a big number that's right you know it's
even bigger saying this in unison ready
yes
my device is evolving your home it's
like I can tell though my brain is a
little like tired because I was having
trouble reading that like my brain is
the way they wrote it it's a little it's
a little weird how they wrote it hey I
can rewrite us I think it was written
perfectly Stephen think I don't send him
this part of the yeah I sent him the
mid-roll but I don't send me this fuck
that was perfectly written expertly
written by iDevices amazing writing all
right just some quick things about the
keynote maybe some under-the-radar stuff
that they didn't tell you quietly and
this is a this is a a good thing for all
of us they've upgraded the iPad storage
across the board and also kind of what
it sorryi my brain is I can't even see
what I'm doing they've updated the
storage and they've lowered they've kept
it really at the same price or they've
even in fact lowered some prices they do
have 256 gig options available for the
iPads across many of the tiers which is
a huge thing this is really specifically
to the iPad pro big boys but 256 gigs
now are you kidding me it's pretty good
but I'm still you know when we gonna get
it like a terabyte in there something
like that that's probably not for a long
time but when I can do real video
editing on it like real video editing
and real Photoshop like comfortably and
expertly I like that word today
then I'll then I'll put down the change
and say yeah give me a one terabyte
terabyte me right now terabyte me is
that the new show yeah my iPad fills up
quick with videos you know so so yeah
check that out
iPad lovers we are not expecting any
upgrades this year from a standpoint of
an all-new processor design it looks
like that is going to get pushed until
next year so just sit tight it might be
early next year it might be mid next
year but iPad momentum really isn't
there and and we've seen it continue to
dip it's the type of device that you use
for years it really is and the current
iPad line the 12.9 in the 9.7 are more
than ample right now there's nothing
that's being developed that is requiring
us to get a new iPad pro
true dat Mac Mackel Ciara our favorite
friend it'll be available September the
20th but also if you're part of Apple's
developer community the gold master
public beta is also I believe they just
made it available so that is gonna be
yes it is been available to the masses
so this is not the the gold master is
literally the official kind of what goes
out but people that are part of the beta
program or earlier to kind of get a
little sneak peek and get a little
access earlier to it cool that's nice I
mean I'm running cited I'm running the
gold masters on my iPhone 6s and the
gold master of watchlist race on my
Apple watch right now and uh we'll talk
about those in a second but I did want
to kind of transition over all you've
heard us talk so much about the iPhone I
mean we got to regurgitate it but I
haven't really had as much of a back and
forth with you Beach yeah and I'm just
curious off the bat your overall
thoughts on the iPhone 7 is just
completely lackluster to me I don't care
about a camera I don't you know I mean I
like to have a nice camera but that's
not gonna that's not a selling point for
me the headphone thing is a big no-no
for me the the ear pods were totally
like at first when I first saw them I
like oh they look silly right and then
thinking about it later they don't look
too bad because they really are just
just the current ear pods yeah without
the cable right yeah just looks funny to
us because we're so used to seeing a
Knable a cable connected yes but when I
heard that it was like a hundred and
sixty dollars I was like what never
gonna buy that yeah you know you have to
do that any time I just thought it was
ridiculous but the coolest thing yeah
what did you keynote how would yeah what
did you like what did you like le Mario
Mario Mario Mario nothing no big thing
for me see I love Mario
I thought Mario was a great I didn't
even include it in the show because I'm
more mad at Nintendo that this is
something they should have done four or
five years ago yes quite honestly and so
fine Nintendo you're part of the game
now I think that people will love the
fact that they're but it's not going
it's like it doesn't change anything in
the land
escape of gaming it doesn't change
anything in the landscape of devices
it's just nice and dope that Mario is on
the iPhone finally yeah that's how I see
it yes right
and I will play Mario on the bus right
to work so I'm stalking my kids the kids
will love it so you know that's my that
was the most exciting thing for me I my
iPhone 7 thoughts in a bundle because
everyone can hear or have seen a billion
things I've said about it I like it I
don't love it and I wouldn't upgrade for
it but I think it's perfect for someone
who is the ultimate camera fiend and
really wants at least if you're an
iPhone person to have the best camera
available to them the other thing though
that really stopped me from getting
super excited about the dual lens camera
and again I think it is great but right
now it's going to be a software update
for this portrait mode feature now
here's the thing portrait mode is only
going to work on faces like that was my
hunch and then as you've read more right
when I see when you hear these
announcements you don't know how
detailed it gets but portrait mode is
only gonna be specific to doing those
cool pictures with that bouquet like
shallow depth of field blurred out
background yeah with faces so you can't
do it with food you can't do with
inanimate objects you can't do with
flowers so it's really going to be
limited just to portraits and I'm sorry
unless you're super into yourself are
you really gonna just orthography yeah
even photographers in general are you
gonna use that phone just for portraits
I think it's nice it's just the
beginning it's going to get better okay
so I'm not complaining about this I'm
just saying it didn't make it compelling
for me to be like wow I'm even now
flirting with the idea of getting an
iPhone 7 plus and ditching the smaller
version because that camera is so great
and it just wasn't it's not it's great
but it's not boom I gotta have this
great yeah the cool thing though was the
low-light camera you know like being
able to take pictures in the dark is
kind of a big thing yeah cuz you know a
lot of our life we spend in the dark at
like parties and yeah nightclubs or
whatever yeah so I think that is that is
a good thing is every picture you take
with an iPhone in the dark looks like
crap yeah they don't they aren't the
best noisy they aren't the best so I
like that they're try
improve that but yeah I mean other than
that there's really nothing else the
portrait mode when I when I saw that
actually I was like great now there's
more things I have to like swipe lighter
or my camera to get to the right camera
want to use because sometimes you know
you're trying to get a picture in a
hurry and then you're on square you're
like I'll crap and then you get you like
swipe and you get to slow-mo or time
lapse or something you're like ah so you
know it's like more crap to go through
yeah for me I thought it was a nice
upgrade if you're in the market to
upgrade but that's kind of sounds like
sounds like par for the course the dual
lens camera was and here's the thing
even though we're talking about it it
maybe might indicate that this wasn't a
powerhouse keynote but the dual lens
camera was the best thing about the
keynote to me from a feature standpoint
now some people might argue about the
air pods we can talk about that what do
you think about the Apple watch a nice a
nice bump up the Apple watch this look
cool yeah does it come did it make it's
not compelling argument for you to buy
one no because of the price but if the
price was right I would probably buy one
I think the interesting about the Apple
watch for me is in watch OS trace
completely makes it a watch worth having
but the way that I use the watch the new
features that they added were really
specific to two groups hikers slash
runners and swimmers yes and so if you
don't fall into those two groups
specifically there's plenty of runners
that have an Apple watch right now the
GPS on the Apple watch is going to make
it great but for example me I don't go
on hikes all the time no there's some
people that do I'm not swimming laps all
the time either
it'll be yet and I'm not a con I used to
swim when I was younger but I don't swim
all the time like as my primary form of
exercise so quite honestly for me the
way that I use my Apple watch none of
the features that they added changes how
I feel about the Apple watch yeah I mean
it's all about watch o strace really I
mean maybe if there was some integration
for golf or something which there
probably will be there's some apps that
do it yeah totally I use some apps on my
phone actually but I maybe that would be
a selling point for me but yeah I mean
like you or you're even saying if you're
gonna play basketball you're gonna take
off your watch you're not gonna we're
gonna play some sort of physical sport
you're gonna take off your watch yeah so
yeah it's it's
tough one so naughty one looks cool
though yeah the night I mean like you
like oh you like the Nike one that's
kind of that branding and can you
support the support the running aspect
the thing about the Nike Apple watch
that people need to be aware about is
that you're really gonna get a couple
things with it you're gonna get the same
exact functionality as an apple watch
series too but the benefit of having the
Nike watch is a they're sporty sport
band okay and B the Apple watch Nike
Plus Edition will have specific kind of
like watch faces for it that are that
have that fondant integration but the
actual Nike Plus run app that is going
to be updated for that's available on
all phones so the difference is that the
GPS is gonna be integrated on that watch
which helps but it's not some people
like worried that oh this is like a
super exclusive watch like the app is
still going to be available for you so
yeah it's just it's just a funky colored
watch that they can sell in a Nike store
basically yeah yeah and that for Nike
look for Knight lovers of the brand it
makes sense it's like I described it
like if you like the Iron Man's Samsung
Galaxy phone and you're an Iron Man fan
you probably got that if you're super
Nike hardcore enthusiast that runs
you're probably gonna end up being that
person that buys the Nike Plus Apple
watch Joe so um nice update I did
pre-order for the record I did pre-order
an iPhone 7 jet black just cuz it's jet
black but that's for me to play around
with in review I did order an Apple
watch series too but also with watch
show us trace on this current Apple
watch the battery life is basically
about the same it actually seems even a
little better and so that's not even
compelling for me to get an Apple watch
- just a slightly better battery yeah
and the GPS but I'm gonna check it out
and probably play with it for a couple
of weeks and then just return it be
through apples normal return policy but
I just want to see how much different is
it and really doesn't make a difference
for me and my hunch right now is is that
it won't too much so we'll see how all
that plays out and then finally you know
the air pods arguably the the most buzz
worthy talked about part of this whole
keynote was the air pods and I love the
tech inside of it the technology
G is something we have never seen before
Apple's custom W one ship that really
deals with the communication with how it
talks and sinks to different I love the
fact that it can switch off to multiple
products depending on what you're using
your watch or your phone or your laptop
or your or your iPad that's awesome the
battery life is pretty much on par with
what we have out there five hours but I
just can I cannot get past that design
man I was screaming about it at the
keynote and then there are specific
angles of those air air air pods that
just look atrocious yeah like the
straight on the straight on look looks
like you have either your choice of
either tampon golf tee toothbrush
electric toothbrush q-tip it cigarette
it just looks it looks goofy in five
hours to only five hours of battery time
like people are pointing it pointing out
like if you're on a flight oh yeah five
hours you're screwed unless you have
some sort of battery with you
you know and and yeah I don't know what
the sound quality is gonna be like
battery life it's yeah it's there's a
lot of things and 160 bucks 150 959
that's ridiculous that even even with
the charging case like you said okay
it's five hours of battery life right
you have this charging case that gives
you 24 hours more but you still have to
put them in it yeah you have to how are
you exactly so you hand them in there
for a lot for a little while all right
yeah you can't use it uh and I will be
the first to say that I know exactly how
apples singing I think this is a great
move from a standpoint of the future
like I'm gonna get an A headphone with a
w1 chip in it but I'm gonna get the
beats
what is it the beats power it's the
power three wireless ones it's there if
they're workout ones I love the to the
version too but I'm gonna get the third
the third generation that's coming out
sometime in October I think it's it's
the power beats three Wireless sorry
that's what they're called because I
love those and they hook around the ear
and they hold and they still feel like
nothing's there because this little
strap that's really like non-intrusive
goes behind red but
earbuds have to fit your ears - that's
the thing out any earbud has to figure
you're never certain ones have fit me
better than others the current ear pods
fit me the best but well I just look
like I really like the way the current
ear pods work and fit my ear yeah and
these look exactly like them so I'm sure
these will fit my ear you know it's just
a matter of the price and then a lot of
people were talking like in our office
like what happens if you lose one like
are you gonna go to Apple and and
they're gonna sell you one there where's
they not where's the fine my air pods
function that yeah that was not
discussed it needs this is a real first
world problem issue that we need to
resolve where find my air pots
yes it's possible to do right I'd then
the good thing is I think you'll see
like we you might randomly come across a
straggling air pod like on the ground
like lonely like in the corner on a
sidewalk all dirty and will you put that
in your year well no way but again I
think the technology is amazing it's
only going to get better give me give
them give Apple about two years when
some of this some of these chips can be
more miniaturized and basically fit into
the earbud yes and I think it'll be
it'll be a different story but they are
kind of getting people comfortable with
the idea of it we know that Samsung has
their ikonics earbuds that have heart
beat tracking in them already
oh yeah well biragi has their own ear
buds as well so this is going to happen
it's just it takes kind of gradual steps
but apples twist on the technology with
a w1 chip is what makes this really
special and I'm more curious about how
that w1 chip technology is going to be
integrated in the future and with better
design and then I think then I'll get
really excited about it
and for people that are early adopters
you'll know who their early adopters on
this one are oh yeah you will walk on
the street you will yeah but if Apple
needs to drop the price by at least $100
seriously well I think that here's the
thing any Bluetooth headset right now
that's Wireless is already okay I don't
want to say any but some of the quote
unquote more popular brands yeah are
already like a hundred plus easy for
wireless
Bluetooth headsets I think that's that's
just because it's such a new thing that
people aren't used to and it's like it
seems like such a luxury you know I'm
gonna get some wireless headphones I'm
willing to spend the money but it's just
now that Apple's doing it everyone's
gonna do it and they're just there's
gonna be so many of them to choose from
the price has to only come down you know
what you know what someone's gonna do
and it'll be silly and I'm sure Apple
discussed this but they decided not just
purely have because of aesthetics
someone's gonna make a cable that clips
to both air pods and goes behind your
neck yeah and that's and people are
gonna probably buy that and a to keep
them together so there's a wall together
so you won't lose you know they can't
really pop out of here like that's one
of those things right like tech here's
my best comparison or argument about
this Google glass was an amazing
technology but it looked so people could
not get past how they look
Apple earpods do not look nearly as bad
as Google glass but if you read comments
one of the main reasons why people don't
to read reasons why people don't want to
get this is a the price and that's
always subject to what you're willing to
pay but be the second most common reason
is because of how they look and you
can't ignore it you can never ignore
that yeah you can never ignore that so
this whole transition between tech and I
guess aesthetics I can't wait to see who
in the office gets them first
well you up pre-order them and I'll wear
them for I'll try them for I don't even
think I'll wear them regularly I I will
try them out but the other thing that
I'm curious about is so they talk about
double tapping for Siri but then a lot
of headphones have a remote control or
the ability to tap on them to change
your music or your tracks I do it all
your call so is it gonna be a it can't
all be on that one side will once I'd be
like music control and then one reply
sorry yeah there's gonna be so I just
they didn't get into it enough because I
know it's early but it's gonna be
interesting to see how they actually put
this all together yeah so I'm not I just
think they're they just I would they're
something I would never wear regularly
just the way they look is just too silly
for me that's what it comes down to for
me but the tech on point okay
um we kind of like went through all of
that but I've done one thing that I want
to tell people don't forget about the
MacBooks all right everyone oh yeah I
had a lot of people say what happened to
the MacBooks and we weren't expecting
necessarily an actual you know MacBook
release we are looking towards that
potentially in October that's what all
indications point to so for all of you
that missing out look to October someone
even wrote Tim Cook directly and said
are you pulling away from the Mac line
and Apple again the Mac line may not be
there most what's the word that I'm
looking for because my brain is totally
dead right now most popular your most
popular most lucrative category right
now but it still is a it's one of those
tried-and-true
you're going to bring this much to our
bottom line from the Mac books and it's
Mac line and it is a part of their
identity so they're never going to
abandon it they're never going to ignore
it but we are expecting something in
October
IMAX MacBook Pros we might see some
other things but again you know iPads
look towards next year and Mac's will be
the main focus for before the end of
this year yeah we all remember the
iconic moment when Steve Jobs took one
out of a manila and below that was yeah
that was the magnate error I have I
still have that MacBook Air
really yes cool I still have that model
I didn't get the first gen I got the
second gen because they finally put some
real power into it much like their
current MacBook like ultra thin that
thing is amazing but it just has it's
very weak yeah it's super weak Plus lack
of ports that's Apple's big on like
getting rid of all the ports now and
that drives everyone crazy yeah it's
it's a little insane so let's go check
out our voicemails we have tons from all
of you so we will get right into that
all right hey Brian hey Beach this is
Kenny from Texas kind of a marketing
question I was watching the keynote and
just kind of struck me how they're
complicated and complex you know the
keynotes are and talking about the
phones and the cameras and all the specs
and I remember reading some books and
articles about their marketing before
and how it was well
spec's and more about the look in the
feel and how you know what a pleasure it
was to use all of their products so I
kind of wanted to get your thoughts on
whether or not you've seen that shift
whether is it a result of just the
phones being complicated now is that a
difference between Tim Cook's Apple
versus Steve Jobs Apple so you just love
to get your thoughts on that love the
show
Thanks I think that's a great point that
he makes and I think part of it comes
down to having Steve Jobs get a give a
keynote versus having anyone else give a
keynote and you can tell that Steve Jobs
is he was a great storyteller he was
emotionally invested in the product and
there's a difference when he would tell
stories of how things came to be or how
it affected him where Tim Cook and Phil
Schiller just say this is amazing we
love this but Steve Jobs would like kind
of build stories around it and also you
could just in you could tell he was like
anything you can there's a sniff test
you could tell he was intimately
connected to them you would like create
a situation when he'd be like sitting in
a chair me oh look at mine holding my
iPad look how comfortable it is to sit
in this chair with my iPad yeah stuff
like that you know and yesterday I cut
this this super cut every time Apple
introduced an iPhone and they say this
is the greatest iPhone that we've made
as of now you know or something like
that and it was funny to see the the
evolution of their script because it's
felt like the last like four iPhones
they were just copy pasting the script
from the previous it's like getting
right to it and it was like a you know
the overall design this is the greatest
iPhone that Apple has ever made it's the
most advanced iPhone let's bring out
someone said to give the demo each one
was the same exact but in the beginning
with Steve Jobs it was more like organic
and he was like I got something for you
guys it's really hot they're so excited
yeah yeah it was just really interesting
to see that progression of how they
introduced all the iPhones I remember
even here's another point when you guys
were trying to edit this piece you kept
on saying yes Steve Jobs doesn't really
get right to the point he's kind of
talking about a little more before he
actually says it in fact in some cases
he doesn't really
right safe does this is the this is the
greatest he'll be like like you said
you're gonna love what we have here then
he you know he doesn't say that generic
line this iPhone blank is the blank is
blank you've blanked yeah yeah like she
said for the iphone 3gs you said this
product is one of the this iPhone this
new iPhone 3GS is one of the best things
I've ever had the privilege of working
you know it was like like a person it's
like a which is way more personal than
like this is the greatest iPhone we've
ever made yeah I mean yeah so it was
very cool go check out that video yeah
so I I agree with you from the
standpoint of it's it's more of the
personalities involved because you can
tell stories about these things you can
connect to certain things but it's
always about the sniff test and that's
one of those call it the reality
distortion field whatever you want some
people are just better salespeople than
others some people just better talkers
than other it just comes down to some of
that instinctual natural this is who
person a versus person B is yeah it's
like now the mention of the color is
just kind of a mention whereas Steve
Jobs is like we got these blue MacBook
gatech this ah you know it was like so
much it was so different now they're
like we have Space Gray and you know
it's just very like scripted it's just
dry it's it's a lot drier there's
there's less heart and more just like oh
yeah that's the best way to put there's
less heart you feel less heart yeah all
right excellent thanks for the call
that's great point though Abdul from
Iowa checking in hello I will bite my
knees Abdul from Ames Iowa and one
question
32 gig or 128 gig you get four times and
more storage I don't know if I should go
ahead and go to 128 gig yeah it's gonna
shoot in 4k the picture is gonna be much
bigger and the videos are gonna be big
files I'm just trying to decide which
one is best 32 128 32 I'm not sure
alright I'll puke aside please thank you
guys bye here let me help you out cuz
one of my friends has the same exact
issue one of my friends actually has
been surviving and I use that word you
know loosely and surviving on a 16 gig
iPhone 5 or 5s for quite some time and
literally he was at the point where he
would get a text message and it would
say you need you have run out of space
you delete like a text chain and they
get another text message and it would
pop up again like you every action he
was doing he had to delete something
okay I'm imagine this horrible world for
this young man okay so anyways he's like
alright well I'm just gonna get the 32
I'm like you know what you might
reconsider this because first of all
yeah you could talk about 4k video and
cameras and apps and all that but 32 now
for what these phones do it's gonna fill
up the filter fast and especially if
you're someone who bought the 7 plus
specifically for the camera you have got
to go 128 and again again it's a hundred
dollar difference between the 32 and one
yeah yeah only $100 yeah I believe so
okay yeah so just go honestly my
recommendation long-term is to go 128
now you want to go a large you want to
get 256 you want to get crazy like that
then do 256 but I would say 128 would be
a would be a smart choice just in the
long run especially think about all
these apps that are using more resources
higher fidelity textures and I'm not
talking about Instagram or Twitter I'm
talking about other apps you know are
these devices are multimedia machines go
for 128 that's my recommendation yeah I
agree
I agree cuz unless you're into like
managing your phone you know like every
few months that's connecting it to
iTunes and taking everything off and
backing it up then yeah definitely get a
bigger phone so you have to worry about
that stuff so okay next call hi this is
Rodrigo from Brazil I think it's bad
when the keynote speak the best thing in
the keynote speak is Pokemon girl
there's nothing to do with any Apple
products just spoken one go so I don't
know if that call if that was his
favorite thing I guess to him Pokemon go
was the best thing about the keynote
because he was like that was the best
thing I'm like well maybe that's
he thought that was the best thing no
I'm thinking he's he's saying that I
think he's thinking that Apple was
thinking that was the best things they
spent so much time on it he's a date
about it they spent a lot of time on
that it was it was about equal time as
the actual Apple watching it but I hate
you gotta love it
we live in a new time a whole new world
yes sir yes sir okay Mike from Cambridge
UK hi Steven hi my name's Mike from
Cambridge UK just wondering wondering I
guess maybe this is an eventualities I
don't know is the do you think the
iPhone 8 will have the dual lens sort of
thing I think I'm waitin fat to uh to
show up it's kind of hard to choose me
anyway there we go right this man is the
smart man I literally had this
conversation about men and I kind of did
it with the wing cream like I just can't
wait for that dual lens camera to be in
the regular-sized iPhone 10th
anniversary phone that's what I'm hoping
I'm really hoping that so I hope he's on
the same page
I hope Apple is on the same page as him
and apples on the same page with me
because if so oh man and by that time
you're gonna be able to do this a
bouquet effect with so many more
different things so yeah so many more
yes I am down with that okay last call
George Haines from Houston Texas my
birthplace hey stout hello this is
George Haines Houston Texas I believe it
was genius of Apple to allow the new
iPhone to delete all our ultimate
expectations so they could deliver a
greater than anticipated keynote I was
impressed
until they showcase the new airport
after that I found myself questioning an
entire keynote and I want to buy
anything however I do have two questions
with a new tier two series i watch and
the nike wired to be able to do the same
things if not what you think be the
difference between the two and my second
is do you think the barrage of
headphones would be a good option for
the new iphone was whole thanks I think
that the bra geezer bra see I honestly
don't know if they actually I called it
biragi from day one and then I started
calling it bra G and then I switched
back to biragi
it's like bougie so I'm gonna go I'm
gonna go with my man to say broschi so
here's the breakdown brah brah G just on
Monday two days before the keynote
announced a new or more affordable
version of their wireless headphones
that are 119 now there they have they
don't they aren't touch control earbuds
but they are an earbud design they don't
have these long what Apple calls shafts
on them mmm
I feel like I've talked about the air
pod so much that my brain is just like
mush right right so these the bra G's
are 120 dollars the entry-level model is
which they just announced on Monday
still think that's too expensive well
then you're gonna have to wait they're
like your Apple iPhone is gonna market
us so we better jack the price up but
but here I'll tell you why the bra G
original ones which do everything
they're waterproof they have heart rate
monitoring they are touch tap controls
they don't you don't need to press
physical bonds that are touch like
that's cool
those are $2.99 $2.99 they come with
their own charging case but they're
$2.99 I guess I'm like and they have an
intern they can be used on their own
because they have storage on them for
music playback that's pretty cool yeah
that's $2.99 so you basically have like
300 and like mp3 wireless wireless bud
music players in your ear that's what
the broschi $2.99 one so that's pretty
cool see for that you're kind of like
huh that's not the price is still but
see but these aren't I mean I think this
whole bluetooth headphone world it's
they've got to be at least one 120 yeah
right now so we will we'll see I mean I
have never been able to check them out
they have like different fittings
sleeves on it that's also the other
thing the earbud ones they come with
different sizes for different ears that
I Apple earpods
one size hmm it's not gonna one size
will not fit all we've it just it just
won't so if his recommendation is what
it did he asked what he should get yeah
and he was also asking about the Nike
watch and the regular Apple oh yeah so
third yeah I guess I should answer his
question so I would say go buy what fits
the best for you and what you like how
it looks I think the bra
just look better because they're just
less obtrusive and they're also $10
cheaper but if it fits good then go for
it but they do not have any touch
controls they have like physical button
controls on on the 120 design now from a
Nike I think we talked about a little
bit the Nike watch versus the regular
Apple watch they're going to both do the
same exact things the difference is that
the Nike watch has a different band it
also has some wall people watch
wallpapers that you can use but the Nike
Plus run app that is kind of this whole
platform where you tracks your steps and
gives you reminders and motivational
things that's gonna be available on both
so I would if you're really Nike fan and
you like how that one looks go buy both
the things you're talking to me about is
all about personal preference and looks
sure so go buy that and own it the Nike
one does look cool it's got that whole
like mat you like that support you like
that yeah that whole volt the volt
yellow action going on everything like
that you like the Nike Vapor drivers for
golf or pretty cool looks exactly like
one of those that's pretty sweet
alright ladies and gentleman boys and
girls if I sounded a little low-energy
it's kind of just cuz my brain has been
destroyed this week so happy aren't you
feeling it too
oh yeah I think we're both feeling it
we're like our laughs are like hahaha
