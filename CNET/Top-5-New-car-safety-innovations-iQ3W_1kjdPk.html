done not by the car companies you know
but by their suppliers companies that
used to supply them things like nuts and
bolts and tires today supply them entire
transmissions electronics and whole
interiors I'm Brian Cooley with the top
five of the best personal safety
innovations from the pace Awards these
are given to these suppliers by
automotive news and Ernst &amp;amp; Young it's
just some of the unsung names and the
car tech biz here we go
number five auto leaves pedestrian under
hood airbag just when you thought they
put an airbag everywhere inside the car
Sweden's Auto leave puts one outside the
car because statistics show that a lot
of pedestrian injuries and deaths happen
when you're hit by a car and your head
wings down and finds that rigid area at
the base of the windshield this puts an
airbag right there to cushion you number
four Continentals pedestrian impact
sensor now to detect that pedestrian
impact a rubber tube is laid along the
inside of that flexible front bumper
during an impact with a pedestrian the
tube is collapsed a little and that
generates a puff of air which is read by
a couple of simple sensors on each end
of the bumper and in 1/100 of a second
they can figure out if it's a pedestrian
versus a parking lot sign and fire the
airbags
number three valios camera and sensor
module it used to be that the ultrasonic
sensor is in your bump or those things
that beep and the camera in the back of
the body which shows you what's back
there operated completely without any
knowledge of each other that left the
driver having to blend all that info but
Francis Valeo has merged them into a
single module so it all works together
and it's a tiny component that has the
added benefit of leaving your bumper
without those little sonar dimples in it
number two taqaddas center front airbag
okay just when you thought they really
had put an airbag everywhere including
under the hood Takato works with GM to
slide one in between the front seats
this helps to secure the driver during a
far side of the car t-bone impact or to
keep the two front
passengers from smashing heads and
earning each other but with this and up
to eight more airbags in the front of
the car alone it's time for our number
one number one is Auto leaves Green
airbag inflator now when all these
airbags go off
they're typically powered by what's
called a sodium azide inflator it's
basically a little rocket propellant in
your face and it's received some nasty
headlines lately
the Swedes being the Greenies they are
took note and auto leave developed a bag
inflator that uses mostly hydrogen and
oxygen and leaves behind mostly water
vapor if you could get these in a Nissan
Leaf that is charged off a windmill
that's pretty green now everything new
in high-tech cars and modern driving
