project G boom this is a wireless
Bluetooth speaker and it's claim to fame
is that it puts out a lot of sound and a
lot of bass for a very reasonable price
it costs $99.99 and it obviously has a
kind of a funky design not everybody's
going to like that design but there's a
handle on top looks a little bit like a
lunch box but you can carry it around
with you from room to room or outside it
has four drivers it's a woofer tweeter
there are two sets of those on the front
and then there are two bass ports on the
back so it does sound loud you usually
don't get a speaker this big that cost
$100 at least a wireless bluetooth
speaker that does and a lot of these
speakers that are in this price range
are much smaller speakers this does have
a rechargeable battery it gives you
about six hours of battery life however
it doesn't charge via USB it does charge
be a standard AC adapter so you don't
want to lose that AC adapter because
it's required to charge this device one
of the nice features is that it does
have some playback control buttons on
top of the unit a lot of people like
having some playback control buttons
even though they're controlling their
music mostly through their device
usually a smartphone or a tablet and it
has a USB port on the back it's a
charging USB port so you can charge your
smartphone while you're using the
speaker and playing music through your
device as far as features goes that's
really it there's no built-in
speakerphone but this is really about
big sound big bass and as I said in my
review you will probably not find
another speaker that delivers more bass
for $100 I'm David Carr noise and that's
the G project G boom thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
