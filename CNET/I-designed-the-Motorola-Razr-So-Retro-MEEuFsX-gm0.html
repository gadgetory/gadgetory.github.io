became razor thin the Motorola RAZR only
from the near singular
I still have people to this day that
tell me odd they remember when it came
out and you know what they were willing
to give up to get a razor it was
something that people just had to have
really became kind of a cultural thing
it became something everyone saw my name
is Paul Pierce at the time the
development of razor I was the design
director for product design focused on
the development of the razor product at
the time you saw cell phones went into
bags because they were thick and kind of
unmanageable this was one of the first
ones we saw sliding in the pockets even
skinny jeans and thin pockets we got
started in 2003 and a couple things
happen then converged at that time this
chipset allowed us to get the circuit
board and the battery into the same
plane so instantly we lopped off a big
portion of the thickness of the overall
device
for us the inspiration was really around
the idea of Star Tech and this notion
that's ten millimeters we had created a
prototype of 10 millimeter clam foam and
I think all of us reacted it the same
way when we saw was like up man this is
pretty unbelievable look at the
breakthrough at the end of the day razor
I believe was ended up at thirteen point
nine millimeters it allowed for an
emotional connection with users it
allowed for an experience that resonated
and stayed with you we hoped it would be
something you would then take and share
with a friend and you see that primarily
manifested in the keypad hi I'm Kevin
senior editor here at cnet.com today
we're gonna take a first look at the
Motorola RAZR v3 C and down here in the
navigation keys like the original eraser
they are flat with the surface of the
phone and they almost resemble a
touchpad what you're looking at is just
some of the very early prototypes and if
you notice like the design here this is
different than where the final design
you can tell by the cutout shape this
was one of the earliest prototypes in
the end this is this was like the
production keyboard that we ended up
with just getting the silicon you know
in the gaps at the proper height making
that work getting the spun metal finish
on the keypad was really difficult
I'd want it to be all pink and I'd like
to figure out how to make the keypad
pink this is a brass and nickel approach
to a keypad we didn't have the ability
at the time to get the color into it but
as you can see on the prototype we were
looking at trying to understand how to
get more of a unified color approach
when used to text used to hit one key
multiple times and you'd move around the
keyboard so the idea of holding
something really thin and trying to
manipulate the keyboard make that work
wasn't as easy to do as when we added
the volume of the chin unable to you to
hold on to it that was one of the things
I think we like to share is like you
know from design we were dead set
against the chin but it became really
well understood as this was
fundamentally better for the user and in
the end it became a very iconic element
of a design it was intended to be a
relatively low volume high priced
product so we thought that might limit
somewhat of the audience that it would
get to but once it hit once we saw the
reaction you know it became something
that people had to have and none of us
probably understood exactly how iconic
it was going to be you look at kind of
the progression timeline this is really
first generation this is maybe 1.25
again came out relatively close to time
of launch but again camera variation
this we started to extend some software
functions we started to extend a few of
the things with cmf we made variations
and then this is what we had called
razor 2 at the time and the richest
mural with cnet.com at the Motorola
mobile experience in New York City where
they've announced the successor to the
razor the razor to first off you have a
bright 2 inch screen on the outside
personally believe we spent a little too
much time riding the the razor it was
something that we started to do too many
refreshes we started to do things
I felt like we held on to it a little
too long
when people ask me about it and they I
don't typically tell people I was a part
of that I know my mother likes to tell
people I was a part of that team
instantly people share their memories of
RAZR the first time they saw it the fact
that they had one they had multiple ones
and that honestly makes me feel good
that it was something that still stands
out people remember it talked about it I
think people are kind of yearning for
and remembering back to that razor when
it flipped open and the sound of that
the feel of that where is that today and
it seems like an opportunity</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
