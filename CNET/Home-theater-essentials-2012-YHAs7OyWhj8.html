a big beautiful TV for your home the
only problem is once you get that TV
you're gonna realize that what you
really want is a complete home theater
and this top-5 we're counting down the
essentials for today's modern home
theater system and we're gonna start
things off with a gaming console even if
you never play a game on one which would
be really tragic products like the
PlayStation and the Xbox are serious
media machines you can watch some
Netflix listen to some music and even
mow down a few zombies with a shotgun at
number four a blu-ray player if you
spent the extra money for a 1080p TV a
blu-ray player is really the only way to
see that resolution at its finest stop
sitting on the fence there's tons of
great content now and our latest
editor's choice blu-ray player is under
150 bucks also remember the ps3 4 number
5 it's also a blu-ray player number 3 is
a universal remote you're buying all the
rest of this stuff you're gonna need one
and logitech harmony remotes have been
the best-in-class option for years the
only thing that's changed is that you no
longer have to spend over $100 just for
the good stuff check out the Harmony 650
for a solid affordable option coming in
at number two and I really shouldn't
have to say it a speaker system don't be
that person who drops a grand on a TV
and then listens to the built-in
speakers we have an editor's choice 5.1
speaker system for a fraction of what
you paid for your TV and if you don't
have the room try a sound bar the bottom
line is if the movie explosions don't
make you pee your pants a little bit
you're doing it wrong now before we get
to the number one home theater essential
let me point out one component that you
should avoid overpriced HDMI cables
these things carry a digital signal like
a USB cable and that $10 HDMI cable
sends the same ones and zeros as that
extra thick gold-plated $100 cable and
with that hundred bucks you'll save you
can buy our number-one modern home
theater essential a media streamer now
you could go with an Apple TV or a Roku
HD but there's a good chance that you
already have what you need the Xbox the
ps3 and even a blu-ray player will have
a huge slide
the streaming options including Hulu and
Netflix so there you go see net list of
surprisingly affordable home theater
essentials for more like this check out
