editor at cnet com here to show you guys
the tmobile mytouch by LG the phone runs
on android 2.3 Gingerbread on t mobile's
4g network and it has a 3.8 inch AMOLED
display above the display is a
front-facing vga camera and below are
three navigational buttons and the
buttons actually don't stay lit so when
you want to use it at night it's kind of
inconvenient there's also no search
button and in order to access that you
actually hold the Settings button down
on the back of the phone there is this
nice soft black coating that I really
like and these tapered edges that I'm
big fan of and there's a 5-megapixel
camera too the one thing about the
camera is that there is no LED flash
which is kind of a big disappointment
because you can't take pictures at night
or in low lighting on the back there's
also the output speaker and the quality
of it is kind of low so when you listen
to videos or music the sound actually
kind of bounces from the back and you
hear it and you feel it on your phone
and it makes the sound quality kind of
muffled and unclear as far as software
goes the phone comes packed with a lot
of pre-installed apps like t-mobile TV
and mobile life organizer unfortunately
some of these can't be uninstalled so it
might be annoying to some people who
don't like it overall I really like this
phone you have to keep in mind that it
is a mid-tier phone so it doesn't have
all the fancy features that higher end
phones might have although I did find it
really odd that it didn't have an LED
flash which is kind of standard in most
phones these days
