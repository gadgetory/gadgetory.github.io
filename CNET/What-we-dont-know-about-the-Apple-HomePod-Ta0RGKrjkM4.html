the home pod will it support other
streaming services the home pod is
designed for music so naturally it plays
from your Apple music library but what
if you want to use another streaming
service Amazon echo and Google home play
from apps like Spotify but we don't know
if the home pod will do the same and the
specs don't mention bluetooth so it's
unclear if you'll be able to connect
from non Apple devices
how does spatial awareness work the home
buyer has what Apple calls automatic
roon sensing technology to work out
where it is then it adjusts the audio
but the demo didn't really say how this
works
the onboard microphones could be part of
the process how does it reset though if
you move it around and is this automatic
or do you need to calibrate with an app
and what about the wake word to get home
pod to listen say hey Siri if you have a
room full of other Apple devices saying
hey Siri might cause a riot to be fair
this can affect other devices as okay
Google can potentially trigger the
Google home and a phone Amazon kind of
gets around this by having the choice of
different Wake words like computer Alexa
and echo so we'll have to see if Apple
will do the same will it work with the
Apple TV it makes sense that if you have
an Apple TV you'll want to connect a
home pod for a better audio experience
as for voice control Apple TV already
has Siri support so maybe the home pod
could control it from anywhere in the
room not just from the remote how will
you send messages and will this be tied
to iMessage exclusively the Siri API is
open to third-party apps and you can get
Siri on the iPhone to read messages from
whatsapp so anything's possible there's
still lots of unanswered questions about
the home pod that will hopefully be
answered by the time it goes on sale in
