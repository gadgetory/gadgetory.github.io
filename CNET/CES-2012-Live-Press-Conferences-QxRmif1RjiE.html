it's been worthwhile getting up so early
our introduce was a new you know a smart
TVs smartphones as smart appliances and
how they're smart functions ties
together across the different product
category let me start with its Smart TVs
we made a huge improvement in terms of
feature like size early Dapeng light
technology input device and many more
are explained the major improvements to
this year's 3d smart TVs one by one for
this year we have developed larger
display size for an even more immersive
home theater experience we will be
launching our large screen 3 TB in 55
inch a 16g 72 and even 84 inch sizes our
cinema 3d TV
uses an ultra definition panel with a
resolution and screen area four times
their of 40 24 HD panel we have also by
embedding the LED units directly into
the custom developed film we've been
able to create tin opener for a visually
stunning display like some of our
competitors we use a direct LED penlight
unit to recreate really rich and deep
black levels introducing our cinema
screen design we've gone to great
lengths to reduce the thickness of our
TVs pricing picture quality LG cinema
screen TB has just a 1.0 millimeter
bezel and 28 millimeter thickness let's
talk about input devices last year we
introduced an innovative new way of
interacting with TBS the ROG Magic
Remote this year medic limit as a wheel
for scrolling to improve navigation of
large list pattern register for
intuitive control of common features and
most exciting of all voice recognition
as a natural solution for text input now
searching through the endless amount of
content available on our Smart TVs
becomes easier than ever before with
voice recognition taking things a step
further we are developing a more lowest
natural interface and translate physical
gesture into user input this year in
addition to voice recognition we are
introducing another another major
natural interface feature 3d gesture
interface using a 3d camera not only can
you use your hand to
emulator function of the Magic Remote
you can also enjoy the gains that
recognize entire body gestures masher
which is our feature for sharing media
between all the products this year we've
updated it by adding a lot of new
features and we called it Smasher plus
we've added wife mirror the older
display on the mobile devices second
display for mobile devices which allows
the TV to be used as supplementary
display mobile high-definition link for
the best quality video connection from
comparable mobile divide a wide i drew a
strategic alliance between LG and Intel
LG cinema 3d smart TV will be the first
in the TV industry to feature intel widi
technology we know the importance of
application and to build a successful
smart TV ecosystem we build we form the
smart TV alliances with other ce
manufacturers created the cellar lounge
to help the developers register their
application easily and launch it
exciting new services and contents like
our tradition and kpop zone these
initiatives have helped us grow our
platform and we now support more than 80
countries and offer more than 1,200 high
quality applications since the start of
the smart TV revolution we've heard that
industry chipset have held us back from
providing high performance and powerful
solution on our TVs after a few years of
development we are announcing our own
chips
the airline the airline chips the
features a to your core arm CPU
architecture a quad-core GPU and
enhanced 3d this year we are going to
apply the airline chipset to our Premium
TB liner since last year we've been
promoting the benefit of LG cinema 3d 3d
technology with this lighter more
comfortable and affordable glasses and
will be improved 2d to 3d conversion in
our set this year with superior tabs
effect and smoothness to enhance the 3d
experience we are adding a 3d depth
control option and 3d streaming so that
the audio can now be as exciting as the
picture also as I mentioned earlier with
our largest larger side TVs consumers
can enjoy a more immersive and realistic
3d experience for single use of it we've
created gracias pre 3d monitors and
laptops the system features head
tracking technology with the built-in
camera and advanced 2d to 3d conversion
you jerk and viewed of virtually
limitless 3d content available or
available on our pc today before we move
on to the next product category I'd like
to introduce another new product as you
know google launched their updated TV
experience last year and we believe
cinema 3d magic remote and your core
airline chipset that would make on LG
google to be a popular choice for many
consumers so this is your SES be
showcasing our own series of Google TV's
learning on the latest
Google TV software our technology
coupled with the Google TV platform will
form the basis of strong future corking
relationship with Google now let's move
on to the smartphones as we will
probably her we have invested heavily in
LTE for the last few years this research
in the world's first LTE demonstration
the word 1st Lt chipset and world-class
patent filings in fact LG was recently
recognized as the clear leader in LT
peckin by the Forbes magazine we believe
this give us a firm foundation for
future growth in today's comparative
mobile industry building on our tea
capabilities we have launched the LG
optimus LTE smartphone this mud phone is
currently our flagship model and is our
first product to integrate the true HD
IPS display this display features 4.5
inches I'd with HD resolution and 329
pixel per inch a 100-percent color
accuracy for natural life like colors
lower power consumption smartphones and
tablets are becoming critical component
of an enterprise mobility solution we've
noticed that more and more employees are
using their personal mobile device for
both work and play the LG revolution
smartphone integrated with VMware's
horizon mobile technology is world's
first 4G LTE virtualized smartphone and
was honored with 2000 tariff CES
innovation award
this smartphone enables to Android
operating system on a single device one
for personal use and the other for work
employees can now maintain privacy and
control over the personal side while
organizations are able to import
corporate IT policies over the business
profile you can expect many more
exciting smartphones and their
consumer-friendly features at the Mobile
World Congress next month the final
product carry that I'd like to talk
about is smart appliances smarting is
LG's unique technology for smart
appliances which debuted last year and
has evolved and been expanded for 2012
last year we introduced smart diagnosis
heat smart adapt and smart access we
also presented a feature that called
food management which keeps track of the
food stored in your refrigerators we've
improved these features so much this
year and it's been given a new name
smart manager LG smart manager
transforms the appliances into a
complete food management system user can
be called food item items stored in the
refrigerator using the LCD panel using
voice recognition or scan grocery
receipt with a smart phone around the
refrigerator to automatically download
the food item list smart manager offers
recipes based on what you have in your
refrigerator region to this is health
manager which suggests daily or weekly
meal plans based on your family's family
members
files not only can you refer to your
shopping list via your smartphone during
grocery shopping but you can also
directly order your grocery from the
refrigerator in your home I'm really
excited about another appliance
innovation that we are launching this
year blast chiller imagine you have a
can of lukewarm soda oh you put it in a
refrigerator to cheer it but it takes
such a long time a typically fridge I
rotates about 40 minutes to chira can
even in a freezer with our blast chiller
this is dramatically cut down to less
than five minutes for a terrible wounds
can of soda this innovation is made
possible by a jet air planned swirling
motion perfect for the chilling a can of
beer on a hot summer afternoon what
smart product possible is connected and
in 2012 all of our devices will be able
to connect interact and communicate with
each other no matter what category they
are in TVs and mobile phones will be
able to show the energy usage and
control appliances mobile phone will be
able to share and stream content to our
TVs and moving for our appliances will
be able to connect to the plant smart
grid systems around the world although
we are focus on consumer electronics you
at CES I'd like to briefly mention about
LG's commitment to the future of smart
grid the importance of intelligence
energy management system is growing more
and more so we are preparing home and
building energy
systems that help ensure our consumer
products and energy solutions work in
harmony we are also advancing our effort
in green energy solution by developing
the latest technologies for solar panels
LED lighting energy storage and healings
ventilation and air conditioning systems
through these various initiatives I'm
sure that our grander vision will put LG
in a readership edition for energy
management before I leave the stage I'd
like to unveil one final product one of
the product that we showed last year
that really excited visitor was our
small or LED TV well Your Enthusiasm has
not gone unnoticed here we've got a much
larger version for you this is our
55-inch oled TV at just 4 millimeter
thin and weighing only seven largest and
lightest or LED TV the beauty of this TV
isn't just his appearance either the
picture quality quality is superb and of
course this is 3d capable and one
hundred percent comparable with other LG
3d glasses as we expected from LG
Electronics the products and
technologies that I've talked about
today are just a small taste of range of
product that LG is showing here at CES
2012 thank you once again for joining us
here today please to come along to our
booth in central hall where you can see
many new interesting product thank you
very much happening
thank you doctor on that's an amazingly
thin screen I wanted to thank our good
friends from google TV for joining us
here today as well now I'd like to
introduce three speakers who will
provide a more detailed account of our
us product launches for 2012 to begin
with our to begin our product review is
someone that you many of you know really
well Tim Alessi the director of new
product development for home
entertainment in the United States with
more than three decades of experience at
Sony sharp and now at LG since 2004 he's
responsible for us product development
across all consumer electronics
categories at LG here to share LG's us
home entertainment product roadmap for
2012 is my brother from another mother
Tim Alessi thank you John good morning
again everyone it's hard to believe that
a year's already passed since last CES
when we introduced cinema 3d technology
we were pretty much a lone voice in
supporting a passive technology based on
LG display's fpr but we were armed with
consumer research that showed a strong
preference when compared to active
shutter glass and a lot of positive
critical comments so based on that that
gave us the confidence to mount a very
aggressive marketing campaign for
passive technology does that make us
passive aggressive I don't know it makes
us aggressive about passive I know that
and the response from our competitors
was pretty predictable they said well
research is research but consumers vote
with their pocketbooks and ninety-five
percent of the market is using active
shutter glasses pretty easy to say in
the first month of our product launch
but you know what they turned out to be
right people do vote with their
pocketbooks and as the year progressed
it turns out that more and more of those
votes are going towards passive
technology this is
not a red state blue state thing in this
political climate but you can see that
according to NPD the unit share of
passive 3d has grown to over thirty
percent of the market based on the
latest reporting period being November
and looking at it from a brand
standpoint since our launch in April our
market share has grown steadily we
passed sony several months ago and we've
got samsung square in our sights we
think that trends going to continue for
a couple of reasons first the core story
for cinema 3d still resonates with
consumers reinforced with the new
technologies at dr on explained before
we're going to go to market with a
complete new lineup and we've expanded
coverage of cinema 3d within our line to
roughly fifty percent of the models but
that's not the only story because this
year we're asking the question how smart
is your 3d another big trend in the
industry obviously is smart TV and you
heard a lot about the the new
improvements since last year when we
introduced a very innovative and
intuitive and easy to use Home Dashboard
combined with the magic motion control
as well as plentiful content this tube
was hugely successful this is just one
example of a positive review we got from
a very high high-powered publication who
named us as the number one smart TV
platform for the very reasons that I do
dr. Ron already talked about the
improvements to the motion remote
control and that's going to be combined
with a newly redesigned Home Dashboard
even more easy to use because it's more
customizable and it will provide access
to the content that people want with
less clicks in a very easy fashion we've
also upgraded the browser to support
html5 and flash 10 video for a true web
experience right from the TV as well as
new content partners and enhanced search
capability we're sure that this is going
to take
to the next level in Smart TV as well in
about fifty percent of our lineup will
feature both smart TV and cinema 3d we
also have two companion series with the
Google TV platform for those who might
desire a little more interactive
experience and that's just LCD smart TV
also permeates the rest of the lineup in
plasma smart TV upgrader boxes blu-ray
players as well as home theaters several
have which of which have already been
honored with CEA Innovation Awards an
additional feature I want to cover on
home theater is 3d sound this combines a
very unique combination of physical
speaker design and sound processing
technology to expand a sound field not
only horizontally but also vertically
completing an immersive 3d experience I
encourage you to get a demonstration at
our booth over at the show I think
you'll be impressed by what you hear
finally design design is a tough tough
one to portray on PowerPoint slides but
I'll just say that our cinema screen
design with its near bezel list design
you can see two examples right behind me
on the stage when you see it up close
it'll blow you away it's going to set a
new standard for industrial design in
the LCD category so we'd like to
encourage you to come over to our booth
we look forward to explaining these and
all the rest of the products that we
have to show at this year's CES as the
saying goes we're here all week thanks
thanks Tim for the second year in a row
at CES LG is showcasing its home
appliance technology to share highlights
from this year's appliance lineup we
have Ellis mass LG's director of brand
management for home apply today's he
came to us in 2007 after holding key
positions with brand name CPG and
pharmaceutical companies he's still my
go-to guy for pharmaceuticals Ellis mass
thank you John good morning everyone so
as John mentioned throughout this entire
time I've taken pride in LG's leadership
in both smart technology and stylish
design among home appliances but 2012
marks the start of a new era for LG home
appliances one in which LG is helping
consumers access their smart appliances
in more ways than ever before for living
in a connected world one in which we
change our facebook status as often as
we change our moods but it isn't just LG
smart phones and smart TVs that are
helping people stay plugged in as dr. an
highlighted earlier LG's new generation
of smart appliances lets consumers
seamlessly keep in touch with how
they're managing their households almost
as easily as they can manage their
Twitter accounts as exciting as these
upgraded smart features are LG is also
delivering innovations that help meet
more tangible consumer needs
game-changing technologies that can
really improve the day-to-day lives of
American families let's take a quick
look at a few of these groundbreaking
innovations as dr. Ann mentioned earlier
the smart appliances that we debuted at
this very show a year ago have now been
significantly upgraded the new smart
manager food system on our smart
refrigerator lets you check whether
you've run out of yogurt or whether your
lettuce is close to expiring while
you're still at the supermarket right
from your smartphone and you can now
enter the new items that you've bought
into your home through a simplified
touch screen on the fridge or just by
scanning your grocery receipt or barcode
through this
art phone if like me you're working hard
to keep your new year's resolutions you
may be interested in the new health
manager feature which lets each family
member store a custom profile in the
fridge including dietary restrictions
and weight loss goals not only does the
fridge suggest shopping lists and recipe
is consistent with your goals it will
even send a selected recipe directly to
the smart oven which can automatically
set the proper cooking settings another
upgrade to LG's smart sweet is our Wi-Fi
connectivity LG now boasts a Wi-Fi
certified washer so now when consumers
access our smart features whether
they're downloading custom wash cycles
to meet their families changing needs or
troubleshooting problems without the
need for a service call they can do it
all from the convenience of their
personal computer last year we unveiled
our home bot robotic vacuum cleaner this
year well the smart home but isn't just
for cleaning floors anymore it still has
all of the automatic cleaning features
and dual camera mapping of last year's
model but in addition you can now
remotely operate your home bought
directly from your smartphone no matter
where you are and you can even use the
home BOTS built-in camera to monitor
what's going on around the house so
speaking of smart technology there's
nothing smarter than meeting our
consumers core needs in a better way
than ever before that's why we're quite
excited to be expanding our wildly
successful line of super capacity french
door refrigerators at 31 cubic feet LG
makes the largest french door
refrigerators available and in 2012
they'll be available in even more
configurations including a four-door
version providing the ultimate in both
storage space and organization but LG is
offering more than just more choices in
refrigerators we're also offering
instant total gratification in the form
of our latest innovation which dr. I
mentioned we call the blast chiller the
blast chiller can bring a 12 ounce can
of your favorite beverage from room
temperature to delightfully frosty in
just five minutes by the way you can
also chill either two cans
a bottle of wine in just eight minutes
so feel free to invite the friends over
this feature is so groundbreaking and
immediately impactful that it helped
this refrigerator earn the CES 2012 best
of innovations award for which we're
very excited also worth noting we do
expect this model and all of our 2012
french door models to meet the do is
Energy Star standard we're also very
excited about some significant
innovations that were bringing to market
in the laundry category LG has been the
market leader in front load laundry for
over four years but were not content to
rest on our laurels we strive to remain
first in innovation as well and in 2012
there isn't even going to be a close
second today we're unveiling the new
turbo wash ultra-fast washing cycle
which will enable consumers to wash
full-size loads faster than they ever
thought imaginable in a front load
washer without sacrificing cleaning
performance when you think of how many
times you could use that dress shirt
school uniform her jersey clean faster
so that you can get more out that door
more quickly it's easy to see how this
technology will fit into people's lives
and speaking of fit you'll also be able
to fit a whole lot of laundry in our new
washers in 2012 LG will once again boast
our largest capacity washer available so
not only can you wash more quickly you
can also do more clothes in the fewer
loads as in previous years we anticipate
that all 2012 LG washers will meet the
do is Energy Star standard so this year
our new laundry innovations will help
families save energy and water and that
most precious of all commodities time
I'm sure you'll all agree that LG's
newest home appliance innovation truly
delivering on the brand promise of
life's good I know there was a lot of
information I just went through there's
simply too much innovation packed into
LG's newest appliances for me to do it
justice and a six minute presentation so
please do come visit us at our booth in
central hall if you'd like a more
detailed briefing thank you very much
themselves Thank You Ellis I want to
officially put my request in for that
blast chiller in time for my adult
beverages on Super Bowl Sunday now on to
our final speaker Tim O'Brien is the
vice president of marketing for LG
mobile phones he's a seasoned executive
joined LG in 2008 with over 13 years of
experience driving brand growth and
innovation for companies such as Mars
Microsoft and Procter &amp;amp; Gamble here to
share our newest mobile innovation and
partnership efforts Tim O'Brien good
morning welcome to CES LG Mobile has a
history of innovation in the early 2000s
though we were relatively unknown in the
mobile space but we put our focus on
winning and feature phones and quickly
became number one in CDMA by 2004 and
then in five years grew to a 20 share
across all categories we're now putting
that same focus on becoming an
innovative leader in smartphones looking
back on 2011 we feel really good about
what we accomplished we set a great
foundation for 2012 globally we
introduced the world's first dual core
processor in a smartphone we also
introduced the world's first glasses
three free 3d display in a smartphone
and most recently we introduced the
world's first HD display in an LTE
smartphone looking ahead we're going to
continue our commitment to delivering
smartphones for all consumers but
specifically focusing on the high end
LTE market that's why today I'm excited
to announce our first premium LTE device
of 2012 the LG spectrum exclusively at
Verizon the spectrum is truly a super
phone with all the features consumers
expect from a high-end device it's got a
1.5 gigahertz dual-core processor it
comes out of the box with android 2.3
gingerbread upgradable to Ice Cream
Sandwich it's got an 8 megapixel rear
facing camera 1.3 megapixel front facing
camera and can record video in 10
ADHD and of course it runs on Verizon's
4G LTE network we think these specs make
for a great device but what we really
think is exciting you want to focus on
is why does this screen make this a
great viewing experience for consumers
so let's talk about it this device has a
4.5 inch true HD IPS display many people
in this room you follow TV technology
closely you know about the superiority
of IPs you also know that not all HD
screens are created equal this is the
same technology used in our highest end
TVs now brought to a mobile phone but
let's talk about why this matters for
consumers first spectrum has a 1280 by
720 resolution in a 4.5 inch display
that gives an eye-popping 329 pixels per
inch crystal clear crisp images and text
it also has a 16 by 9 aspect ratio so
you get a true HD widescreen viewing
experience without Distortion also our
RGB striping technology gives
true-to-life color accuracy the most
natural real colors you're going to see
on a phone and finally IPS displays are
