machine has a lot going for it at least
at first glance it has a large 5.2 cubic
foot capacity which can easily fit all
of your dirty clothes it has 13 cleaning
cycles and works with Samsung Smart Care
an app that's supposed to help
troubleshoot potential problems with
your washer without you having to sit on
hold forever with customer service its
main feature though is its built-in sync
so you can pre-soak particularly stained
items or simply hand wash them it's a
clever space saver but a niche option
that likely won't appeal to everyone
you'll pay more for it to know 899
dollars isn't terribly expensive for a
top loader but it's a lot to spend on a
washer whose only significant feature is
an integrated sync you might not want
it's also missing settings found and
less expensive models like delay wash
this Samsung washer doesn't do a good
job removing stains either in fact it
earned one of our worst performance
scores to date look elsewhere for a
washer that cleans well and offers a
good overall value</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
