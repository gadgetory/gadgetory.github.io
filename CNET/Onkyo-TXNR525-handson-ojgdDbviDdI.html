we're gonna take a look at the onkyo TX
NR 525 this is a mid-range 5.2 AV
receiver with networking features that's
currently selling for $400 as you can
see this is a full size AV receiver so
it's big its boxy and it takes up a lot
of space the front panel has sharp edges
and corners and it's also cluttered with
buttons so it's not exactly the nicest
looking receiver out there the included
remote is good as far as AV receiver
remotes go the white input buttons are
easier to see in a dim home theater and
the directional pad and volume rocker
are centrally located the big feature on
this receiver is it offers six HDMI
inputs on the back which is more than
most $400 AV receivers it also has
built-in networking functionality which
includes smart phone control DLNA
compatibility in several integrated
streaming services including Spotify
Pandora Rhapsody slacker and internet
radio to use those networking features
you do need a wired Ethernet connection
as the onkyo doesn't have built-in Wi-Fi
but they do sell a USB adapter which
lets to get Wi-Fi for 30 dollars there's
also an adapter for Bluetooth which
costs $50 those adapters are pretty
reasonably priced the only issue is
Sony's competing strd n8 40 offers
built-in Wi-Fi Bluetooth and airplay for
four hundred and fifty dollars which
isn't that much more when you consider
the cost of Aki's adapters in the first
place
sound quality on me on kia was just a
little below average action-movie still
sounded impressive over the onkyo but
when we switched over to other models
they delivered slightly more powerful
sound it was the same story with music
which sounded just a little more
realistic on competing models again
listening to the system on its own
sounded fine but in head-to-head
comparisons we tended to favor its
competitors so overall the TX and our 5
to 5 does offer a lot of HDMI
connectivity for the money but it's not
quite the best value pick if you want
wireless audio streaming even though
it's adapters are affordable I'm Matthew
moscovia and this is the onkyo TX
and our 5:25</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
