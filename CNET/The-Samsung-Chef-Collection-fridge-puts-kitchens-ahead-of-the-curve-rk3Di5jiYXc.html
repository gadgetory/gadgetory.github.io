is the samsung chef collection
refrigerator this is a very large very
fancy very expensive refrigerator
retails for $6,000 so break out your
checkbook if you want one for your money
you are getting an excellent design this
is a tea type model that gives you sort
of a French door design with the fridge
up here and then kind of a side-by-side
approach with the two freezer sections
you can take that bottom right freezer
section called the cool select pantry it
can be set from anything from a hard
freeze to a soft trees for things like
ice cream or a chill mode for things
like meats and fish and also just a
basic fridge mode for your beverages and
one happy
other features have the word chef stands
in front of them those features include
two chef's pans you can slide those
stainless steel trays right under the
shelves there also a chef pantry here
that'll hold meats fishes whatever you
want and this chef's basket that you can
take right out of the fridge for prep
items like chopped vegetables or grated
cheese the design is also pretty
terrific I think the key type design is
great the recessed handles make it nice
and elegant type of fridge I'd want in
my dream home although I put it in my
current apartment it would make the rest
of it look like crap by comparison hey
anyway moving on to the inside of the
fridge you've got plenty of spill proof
shelving you can move around as you see
fit you can also slide these two shelves
back to make room for larger items
plenty of space in this thing and a star
capacity test was able to hold the
entire standardized grocery load that we
test with along with all six of the
stress items we use all at once without
having to rearrange anything very very
good result you've also got this LED
display on the front of the fridge that
shines through the little pin holes
there and the front facade with numbers
telling you what the temperature is
inside and little icons for what modes
are running in you can also see that the
controls are located down here on the
inside of the door that's one kind of
minor quibble you have to open the door
to use those things but I kind of like
that they did that because it takes them
off of the front of the design and
leaves it looking nice and streamlined
as for cooling performance the fridge
did quite well it is able to hold the
temperature around where we wanted it
and did a very nice job on our test for
the most part if you're expecting this
thing to be a dramatic performance
upgrade from the fridge you already have
it might be a little disappointed oh
this is a pretty exceptional fridge the
design is very
and looks fantastic in my opinion and
the features are unique too so if you
were spending a lot of money on it
you're gonna feel like you're getting
something special thanks for watching
