welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the universe I'm Ashley
sceva and Chuck kanata is at home after
an eye doctor appointment in which his
pupils were dilated which I'm assuming
all just means he's playing uncharted
for both that being said let's talk
about the headlines MIT is at it again
after unveiling a platform that shape
shifts as you touch it the name of the
platform is material and it can mimic a
variety of real-world materials like
sand rubber water clay and more a grid
of 3d printed blocks act as individual
sorts of pixels that can react to
physical touch and computer software
tells the blocks how to respond with
chosen physics you can see here how it
reacts with ripples and other visuals as
it's being used mit offers some
interesting real-world use cases in the
video including geo scientific models
education medical exploration and even
material interaction honestly though I
just want to throw bouncy balls against
it like that one guy the video because
it looked really really fun alright guys
so now we've all seen Captain America
Civil War I think we can as a collective
get excited about this supercool
electromagnetic cap shield YouTube
channel the hack Smith decided they
didn't just want a prop replica Captain
America shield so they did what any team
capping fan would do they added a pair
of commercially available electromagnets
to a gauntlet which then allowed the
hack Smith to attach and throw a Captain
America shield from his forearm just
like Steve Rogers the electromagnets
have the power to lift over 3000 pounds
but since their power decreases
exponentially with distance we won't
exactly be seeing the shield fly from
across the room to reattach itself to
the hack Smith's arm but we can't
appreciate the work that went into the
project so high fives the hack Smith if
you guys want to talk about either
subject I'm gonna let you pick for this
Thursday's deep dive show
use the hashtag hey TD on Twitter and
whichever one gets the most comments and
questions out of these two stories we
will discuss on Thursdays long show will
also be welcoming the creator of honest
trailers some of our favorite videos on
the intern
we'll be welcoming the creator of honest
trailers to the show on Thursday so send
in your questions as well
oh that being said let's look at our
phone time of the day our phone talker
