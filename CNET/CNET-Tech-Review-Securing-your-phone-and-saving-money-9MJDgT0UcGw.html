unveils its first windows phone handsets
our favorite high-tech cars for drivers
on a budget the asus zenbook might make
you forget it's not a mac and is your
smartphone spying on you brian cooley
has the answer it's all coming up right
now
hi everyone i'm molly wood and welcome
to the cnet tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our own unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line let's start things off with the
good nokia announced its first two
windows phone handsets on wednesday the
lumia 800 and the lumia 710 the lumia
800 though is the phone that Microsoft
and Nokia are calling the first real
windows phone it's due to hit stores in
europe sometime in november but nicole
lee has one for you to see right now i'm
nicole a senior associate editor piscina
common this is a first look at the nokia
lumia 800 out of Nokia's first Windows
Phone devices supports the latest
Windows Phone 7.5 mango operating system
it's made out of a unibody polycarbonate
material on the frontier is a curved 3.7
inch WVGA AMOLED clear black display and
that music has a polarizing filter that
makes it look good under bright sunlight
the display is made out of Gorilla Glass
so it's scratch resistant and it's also
slightly curved to make it easier to
swipe between screens on the frontier
underneath the display you get the
windows phone controls like the back
button the windows button as well as the
search function on the side you get the
volume rocker the power button as well
as a camera button on the top here is a
headset jack as well as a little micro
USB port on the back here is the 8
megapixel camera lens with the LED flash
the 8 megapixel camera can record in
720p HD video it also has a Carl Zeiss
lens the Nokia Lumia 800 is powered by
1.4 gigahertz single core processor
along with 512 megabytes of processor
memory it has 16 gigabytes internal
storage because of its unibody design it
does not have a removable battery but
you can go to a nokia store or a carrier
store to have that replaced it has the
usual features like Wi-Fi gps and more
it is a quad-band gsm phone so you can
be used internationally the Nokia Lumia
800 also comes with support with a
variety of Nokia sir
like Nokia drive which is Nokia's
turn-by-turn navigation system nokia
music just Nokia's music store and Nokia
mix radio which is Nokia's streaming
radio service the Nokia Lumia 800 will
be available in cyan magenta and black
you'll be available for a five hundred
in eighty five dollars without a
contract I'm Nicole in this has been the
first look at the Nokia Lumia 800 it's
still unclear whether the Lumia 800 will
ever make its way to the US but Nokia
plans to offer a whole slew of Windows
Phone phones to America in early 2012
and be sure to check out the step-down
model the Lumia 710 over at cnet TV com
up next we've got a couple of products
that offer big-ticket features at
bargain prices first Scott Stein shows
us an ultrabook laptop that's even
cheaper than a macbook air followed by
matt mackowiak with a surround sound
speaker system for less than a hundred
bucks I'm Scott Stein senior editor at
cnet com and if you were a Windows user
who has been envying the macbook air
there is no better time for you than the
present because thanks to Intel's term
ultrabook there are a ton of laptops
that are now coming out that are thin
that are light and look a lot like the
macbook air one of the most notable and
one of the most macbook air like is the
asus zenbook well here it is in this
nice little padded envelope this
actually comes with the zenbook unlike
MacBook Airs has a little pouch that's
kind of attractive and you open it up
and sure enough here is the aluminum
zenbook and it certainly looks like a
macbook air in terms of its unibody
aluminum design there's a little bit
more of a radial design here that I
catching light shimmering effect on the
back lid and a little bit of a darker
metal brush metal on the back but it's a
lot of the same feel a tiny bit thicker
and a little bit heavier but really
comfortable and very sturdy to hold in
fact the Asus Zenbook the UX 31 which is
the 13 inch version comes in at a lower
price in the macbook air about two
hundred dollars less for the same
internal
it's the UX 31e dh50 too that's not very
zen-like name but that's the name of
this particular version is 1099 and
comes with a 128 gigabyte SSD Drive and
4 gigs of ram and that matches what
you're going to see on the 12 99 macbook
air so it's a pretty good value and into
that this comes with a USB 3.0 port an
HDMI although take note this is a
micro-hdmi port you're going to need a
converter cable to be able to plug that
into your TV but it does have VGA
dongles and an Ethernet dongle that
connects with USB that comes in the box
the zenbook is named probably to create
a sense of Zen composure and simplicity
in a laptop this does have pretty fast
boot times and a very fast wake up from
sleep about two seconds which is very
competitive with the macbook air but we
didn't really find that keyboard or that
trackpad to be very zen-like in fact we
found ourselves missing a lot of key
types when using this slightly mushy
keyboard and the trackpad uses sent Alex
instead of synaptics which means in our
experience we found the trackpad to be a
little more finicky and a little harder
to pull off multi-touch commands with
but it is a very large trackpad and
equals the macbook air in its size and
its clickability but if you're an AV
hound you'll appreciate the fact that
this 13 inch screen has a 1600 x 900
resolution that's a lot more resolution
for your pixel dollar than the 1366 x
768 that you're going to see on most 13
inch laptops and the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen
design speaker system and audio in this
zenbook laptop does live up to the hype
it sounds a lot better than similar
ultra slim laptops and it's not going to
blow you away like some super high-end
desktop replacement but it's great for
listening to music and to movies if you
want to pay more for your zenbook you
can pay as much as 1449 which is going
to give you a core i7 processor and 256
gigabytes of storage that's still less
than you would pay for the equivalent
macbook air at its high end now if you
love great sound and nicer screen
resolution and you can give up a
keyboard and a trackpad then maybe
you're a little bit disappointing and a
battery life that is still okay
but doesn't perform as well as we found
the macbook air to perform give this a
try this is as close as you're going to
get to a macbook air without it being a
macbook air i'm scott stein and as a
look at the asus zenbook ux31a hey I'm
Matthew miskovic at cnet com and this is
the monoprice 8 24 7 now most people
know about monoprice from the company's
excellent line of cheap hdmi cables now
the company is branching out to some
other home theater products the
monoprice a 24 7 is a 5.1 speaker system
and the pricing is just incredible with
this whole system costing just $84
that's less than fifteen dollars per
speaker if you include the subwoofer now
the system includes four small satellite
speakers a center channel and the
subwoofer the cabinets are plastic with
the sandy texture but they have some
weight to them so they don't feel
completely cheap at this price we were
also shocked to see monoprice included
four swivel wall mounts in the package
which is something you don't even find
on more expensive speaker systems now
around back you'll see the metal speaker
connectors which are pretty decent
although they won't accept banana plugs
and you'll need to use 16 gauge or
thinner speaker wire the 60 watt
subwoofer has a down firing 8 inch
woofer with a baseboard on the front and
the design is a pretty plain boxy look
now for eighty-four dollars we were
expecting pretty lackluster sound
quality but monoprice really surprised
us it doesn't sound great but for a
system of this size it sounds pretty
good the subwoofer blends nicely with
the satellite speakers and it can play
pretty loud without getting distorted of
course like any system this size it does
fare better with movies rather than
music so if you expect to listen to a
lot of to channel music you'll probably
want to consider something else we also
put it head-to-head with the $400 energy
take classic 5.1 system and there's no
doubt that the energy sounded better in
just about every way possible but the
energy system is more than four times as
expensive and we're sure many listeners
would be perfectly happy with the mono
prices sound so should you bind the
monoprice 82 47 that depends on how much
you
to spend for four hundred dollars you
can get much better sound quality from
either the energy take classic system or
the larger pioneer spp k21 BS but if you
can't spend that much the monoprice 82
47 is the best deal we've seen for under
four hundred dollars and it really is a
perfect starter 5.1 system I'm Matthew
miskovic and this is the monoprice in 82
47 I gotta say I am loving a world in
which quality electronics are also
inexpensive what a concept also that
zenbook is h-o-t hot continuing on with
the budget theme it's time to talk cars
having a lot of cool tech in a car is
great but not if you can't afford to pay
for it so here's Brian Cooley with
cnet's top 5 high-tech cars with low low
prices
in this economy when I suggest a
high-tech car you probably blanch at the
thought of buying something which costs
as much as a foreclosed house but you
can actually roll cnet style for a
monthly nut low enough to swing even
after you're laid off I'm Brian Cooley
with the top five high-tech cars that
cost under 20 grand reviewed and ranked
by cnet so far in 2011 let's hit the
road number five is the hyundai accent
SE now we love us some hyundai and kia
these days so why the bottom of the list
well because you can't even option a
navigation head unit on any accent at
any price and it doesn't have a very
elaborate voice command system like a
Ford SYNC so this is all kind of a
throwback to a few years ago when car
companies positioned their small cars as
utilitarian transport that offered less
now the accents a nice car but they kind
of missed the boat on this idea of
really loading it up closer to the
mid-range cars at least optionally
number four is the lovable fiat 500c the
most stylish car on our list though
unnerving ly close to Fred Flintstone's
car in some aspects navigation consists
of a clip on tomtom unit and the cars
powertrain is shall we say modest but it
does offer a cousin of Ford SYNC called
blue and me and a very cool power ragtop
that opens up to la dolce vita all for
under 20 grand number three is the chevy
cruze eco it scored high in cnet's
review because of its Wonder of an
engine a 1.4 liter turbo four-cylinder
that cranks out 28 42 mpg while being
sufficiently powerful and refined on the
road as is the whole car you can't get
factory nav on a cruise either but it
does have onstar which can bring in a
form of nav and it also supports the
nuanced our mobile app which lets you
control various aspects of the car
remotely from your smartphone while it's
sitting still of course number two is
the newcomer in the bunch a little Scion
iQ very small but not stupidly small
like a smart car instead Scion has a
smart strategy of offering an array of
high-tech head units at good prices and
the IQ has pandora integrated
right out of the box it's little motors
a 1.3 liter engine its best in cities
confidence killing on the highway and
sounds like it's grinding coffee in both
situations but overall it's an
affordable car with interesting tech
options and a style that stands out just
don't trip on it before I take you to
our number one cheap tech car check out
this survey according to arbitron and
Edison research the tech that we use
most in our cars is still AM FM radio CD
player and cell phone but when you ask
folks what they love to use in their car
it's satellite radio ipod and gps and
the mainstreaming of all those
technologies and more into inexpensive
cars like i'm talking about today is a
very happy trend ok the number one tech
car to look at when you're on a budget
is pretty easy it's the Ford Fiesta two
things stand out for us first for its
excellent Sync system which I almost
think is better on a simple display like
in this car then on the elaborate LCD it
does a great job of recognizing contact
names and music titles when you bark
them out by voice and Fiesta offers a
dual clutch manual gearbox nobody else
does that at this price not even close
on the other hand the navigation is kind
of an OnStar like system which we found
was sort of hit and miss and even then
it only works when you have a cell
connection but still if it's our 20
grand we're probably going to buy a
fiesta by the way everyone always asks
at moments like this what do I Drive
sorry to disappoint you but my 88
country squire doesn't even have airbags
and I want you to be safe for more top
5s like this go to top 5 cnet com I'm
Brian Cooley thanks for watching
of course if money is no object you
might want to check out the 2012 Porsche
Panamera Turbo S I'm save it up for that
you can find our review over in the car
tech section on cnet TV right now but
not right now we've still got a lot more
tech review coming up right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good given the
amount of personal data we store on our
smartphones these days if your phone
isn't passcode protected what are you
thinking while iphones only offer the
numeric keypad pin options android users
have a few other choices here Sharon
Vaknin with the pros and cons for each
one hey everyone I'm Sharon Vaknin for
cnet.com and today I'll show you how to
pick the best screen lock for your
Android phone when ice cream sandwich is
released android phones will get a super
futuristic face unlock option but until
then i'll show you how to choose the
most secure lock setting already
available on your phone let's start by
heading to settings location and
security and head down to screen lock
settings to get started tap change
screen lock enter your current unlock
code and check out the three possible
lock options pattern is the default and
most popular screen lock setting but
it's also the least secure because it
can be easily cracked with the smudges
you leave behind each time you unlock
your phone I don't recommend using a
pattern lock but if you insist on using
it maybe to impress your iPhone using
friends enter the pattern you want to
use enter it again to confirm then
uncheck use visible pattern this way
anyone looking over your shoulder as you
unlock the phone will have a hard time
seeing the pattern now the next option
is a pin lock pins are easy to remember
and offer decent to great security
depending on your number combination the
majority of people choose terrible pins
like 1 2 3 4 or 11 11 but please don't
be one of these people instead choose a
pin that's at least 6 characters and
doesn't follow a numerical pattern once
you choose your pin then confirm it
uncheck visible passwords so that when
you unlock your phone your pin is hidden
as you type the last and most secure
lock setting is password which can be a
nation of letters and numbers offering
the highest level of security it is the
most annoying form of security because
it does take extra time to enter but if
you pick a strong password you can rest
assured the data in your phone is safe
just tap password here enter it and
confirm it and uncheck visible password
so that your secret code is hidden as
you unlock your phone if you have any
questions or tech tips that you'd like
to share hit me up on Twitter or my
facebook page for cnet I'm Sharon Vaknin
and i'll see you on the interwebs i'm so
glad that Sharon is finally calling
android onto the carpet for the
underreported problem of greasy finger
security flaws because you speaking of
you let's have a look at some of the
gadgets unfortunate enough to end up in
the bed o printers so necessary and so
aggravating even the best of them make
you want to smash them occasionally so
what about when they're not actually all
that great let Justin you tell you all
about it what's up guys I'm just a new
printer editor for cnet and this is your
first look at the lexmark pro 7 15
multifunction printer we're seeing the
prices drop for all in one printers
these days those are devices that
combine a printer scanner copier and fax
machine in one unfortunately though this
one will set you back two hundred bucks
so is that worth it well not really it's
more or less the same as the previous
version that's the pro 705 which you can
now get for a hundred bucks on third
party retailer websites the LCD display
up front here sits more flush into the
control panel than its older brother but
for some reason the company got rid of
the shortcut buttons all together and
they put them up as virtual controls on
the screen a little bit more
inconvenient it's also missing the media
card reader so don't expect to print
photos directly off a memory card you'll
have to do it the old-fashioned way and
plug your camera in with a hard wired
USB cable another thing we don't like is
that you can only fit a hundred sheets
of paper in there at a time just for
perspective we prefer the epson
workforce 845 printer for the same price
that gives you a huge touch screen
control panel to separate paper drawers
with a 500 sheet
Cassidy and two separate media card
slots with an additional USB port for
printing all flash drives that's a lot
more functionality for the same price so
we're giving a thumbs down to this
lexmark pro 7 15 and recommending you
buy the older pro 705 for cheaper or by
the epson workforce 845 if you're really
looking for a printer that can do it all
you can read all the details in our full
review on cnet but that's going to do it
for me I'm Justin you you just took a
first look at the lexmark pro 7 15
printer thanks for watching thumbs down
indeed plus seriously why haven't
printers gotten any smaller alright
let's leave that poor printer alone and
move along to this week's bottom line
this week in the bottom line we want to
highlight a new show here at CNN TV
called device and concur with Brian
Cooley this week the device in question
is your cell phone and as Brian points
out it may be giving up more info about
you than you know or than you want to
know seems everybody's freaked these
days about being followed or tracked
from up there but one of the biggest
misconceptions I hear about GPS all the
time is that those satellites are
tracking you they don't they actually
can't but they do enable devices down
here on the ground to do so and one of
the most insidious isn't even a tracking
device per se it's your smartphone
first a little explanation how all this
stuff works the global positioning
system or GPS is a network of about 30
satellites constantly orbiting the globe
run by the US government and what
they're doing is always sending down to
earth a signal indicating where they are
and when they are there with extreme
precision now devices down here on earth
with an inexpensive GPS receiver chip in
them pick up all those signals and can
make sensitive that's how they know
where they are now as you know there are
dedicated gps tracking devices like this
guy here you drop this in someone's
purse attach it to their car hide it
somewhere on their person and you'll
know where they are all the time in real
time but when it comes to sheer numbers
the smartphone is a far more ubiquitous
GPS tracker it's growth has been huge in
the last few years as of now some forty
three percent of us carry one and that's
growing fast but unlike a simple tracker
it marries your location to details
about your life and makes all of that
available via a constant wireless
internet connection for example I'm out
running errands right now while I should
be at work my phone basically knows that
because GPS tells it where I am and what
time I'm there I left on my google
latitude feature that's recording
locations and since I probably have 3g
and Wi-Fi on most or all of the time
those various information gatherers can
report my information and things about
me without me really being aware of it
do I have your attention now
Facebook Apple Google Microsoft just
some of the parties that have been in
the headlines recently for recording and
storing this kind of information okay as
bad as this sounds the good news is this
kind of tracking happens on not just a
smartphone but your smartphone therefore
you have access to some controls that
will let you manage how much of this
happens so know these settings in the
menus on any smartphone you own first of
all be familiar with your phone's GPS
menu you can often turn GPS on and off
in several layers but note that any
phone made in the last few years will
always reveal your location if you call
911 I assume doesn't bother you secondly
pictures combined with location that can
be particularly creepy so locate the
settings on your smartphone's camera app
that can disable automatic GPS tagging
of your pictures thirdly know what your
apps are doing with your location check
their settings look at the disclaimer
when you install them and know that in
some cases you may have to adjust your
privacy for them on the full website not
within the phone app itself now if all
this has you thoroughly demoralized and
laying awake at night take heart in a
couple of real-world facts first of all
among the millions of us you and I
probably aren't that interesting to be
worth tracking anyway least not
specifically also you can take more
dramatic steps to shut down your
smartphone you can turn off all GPS
technology you can even turn off the
wireless connections when you're not
using it but at that point you're
probably also in the market for a nice
three-bedroom cave in Tora Bora
the bottom line this week only you can
prevent cell phone spying a lot of
people are worried about their privacy
but not that many of you do what it
takes to lock down your information it's
your day to folks dig into those
settings you'll be glad you did all
right that's going to do it for this
time but come back next week for an
all-new cnet tech review until then
there are tons of great videos available
every day at cnet TV com I'll see you
next time and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
