spin some new beats I'm Bridget Carey
this is your scene that update as the
year wraps up several changes are coming
to your favorite streaming music
services for starters Pandora and other
internet radio broadcasters but then I
have to pay 20% more in royalties to the
music copyright holders and artists but
it's not a huge price hike it's really
just point zero zero one seven cents per
song streamed and it currently pays
point zero zero one four cents a song
now one of the issues with streaming
online is that services like Pandora
have to pay out more royalties than a
traditional radio station Pandora CEO
says the company can work with the new
rates and the free service is making
some other changes too just recently it
launched a station called thumbprint
radio where it takes everything you've
ever liked with a thumbs up and mashes
it all into one playlist it also adds
some new music based on the tunes you
liked this is similar to something our
do used to have but last month pandora
bought up some of the assets of our do
for seventy five million dollars and our
do is shutting down next week on Tuesday
December 22nd but if your Spotify user
there is a tool that can import your RDO
playlist to Spotify now Spotify is also
adding some new features to stay fresh
apps for iPhone and Android now have a
feature called Spotify party which
serves up a mix of music for a party and
you can adjust the mood based on the
type of party you're having these
playlists are made by so called music
experts and you can find this in the
genres ammu's area in the Browse section
of course you could have made your own
party playlist before but now Spotify is
helping you make one it's a way to
compete with other services that have
preset party playlists and this was the
key focus around the free service Songza
which created specialized playlists
based on moods or activities Songza was
purchased by Google and it's now
shutting down at the end of January but
every single playlist will still live on
inside Google Play Music and yes you can
still stream for free that's it for the
second is update and there's always more
as seen accom from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
