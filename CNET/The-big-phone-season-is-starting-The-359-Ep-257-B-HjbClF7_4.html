it's episode 257 of the 359 podcast with
Ben Fox Ruben and Scotts time my name's
Bibi G good morning everybody thank you
for joining us guys hey good morning hey
thanks for being here man this is great
yeah so since Scott is such a brilliant
brain when it comes to the mobile world
we're gonna do an all mobile episode
mostly talking about the Moto Z to force
you were at the launch event yesterday
and we'll also crack into the Samsung
Galaxy Note 8 which we updated the
preview on that and it's not expected
until later next month bye Scott as you
would accurately mentioned this is
basically the start of the phone season
so let's let's talk about that and if
folks want to ask after the show about
the iPhone aid or maybe the Google pixel
to which we're also expecting definitely
throw those questions in there Brian
we'll get to as many as it can at the
end of the show and yeah let's get
started with the podcast and then we'll
get to the questions after alright
thanks everybody for hanging out sure
thanks Danny Green shout out to Matthew
dacher our good old friends it's so good
to be back and here we go 3 2 welcome
another 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben and with
me today is special guest Scott Stein
our mobile reviewing maven hi hello it's
really good to be on yeah phone season
is about to get crazy and it's like
starting in the summer so get ready nice
well you are at the Moto z2 Force guy
that's a mouthful at the event yesterday
is this a phone that people should be
paying attention to is this something
you expect folks are gonna want to buy
definitely well the Moto Z is a really
good phone and you know not everybody is
going to be in a mobile phone but this
one has top-notch respects this has a
Qualcomm Snapdragon t35 processor a nice
display it's got the ability to attach
mods it's really thin dual camera dual
camera which is the new trend that's
hitting all phones now basically so it's
got dual camera
they also debuted a 360 camera that
attaches onto the back of that this
newest mod that worked long yea with
other but $300 which is expensive $300
just for the mod yes I'm not buying that
I mean that's the problem twos we'll get
into mods in a moment but as a phone's
you don't need to get the mods it looks
like a really good phone and you know
it's about it's in that 700 to 800 range
depending on carrier it's like that
you know how much you're paying a month
they said as low as $30 a month in the
US the last year what's also nice is
most importantly it has a shatter
resistant display mine was there shatter
shield tech last year that was on the
Verizon exclusive force it's always hard
to figure out which model of the Moto Z
we're talking about but basically this
is like kind of the best really like a
sequel to the mo dizzy last year yeah
and a Z this is this is like the one to
buy as far as you're concerned and you
got a chance to drop it a bunch of times
which was pretty funny yeah they really
set up drop stations they're just kind
of drop on brick and you know I don't
know dropped it a bunch of times and it
seemed fine supposed to survive four to
five foot drops however the case seemed
to get a little bit scuffed so we're
gonna do a bigger drop test on that I
think the question you know the display
may survive how much of the phone will
look like crap when you're done with
that though so so let's get to the
aspect of mods we on the podcast have
talked about the fact that mods were
really hot like what was a year or two
ago and it looked as if it was basically
dying off by moto I mean like they
they're leaning into it this is a
second-generation phone for them is this
something that you're gonna continue
expecting to see or is it kind of the
idea sunsetting a little it feels like
it's sunsetting last year he had the LG
g5 you had project ara which never
materialized Google made then you had
the debut of the Z which was the big one
this year we have the Z continuing but
moto is not expanded lenovo motorola
they've not expanded that modularity to
other phones
you also have essential right which is
also promising which they're declining
to call it muds is ruben at a conference
and he was like - not really mods
there's something else right because
they I guess Moto mod is the brand they
stay away from that's true
it is mods they're modular there is a
difference however that essential is
using it looks like a broadband
near-field Wireless
mmm-hmm which then it uses what they're
saying is that that connection is all
about power not about throughput on if
you want to get technical on the
essential month which we haven't even
seen yet on though so it could suggest a
network of things near you that can
interact wirelessly whoo that is so that
could be a next wave trend I feel like
that could leapfrog mods if you get into
stuff like the technology of Y gig which
I've been obsessed with for a while
soon as fast really taking on it's not
really taking off but I feel like people
need to kind of emphasize or I would say
you know make the most of finesse what
why get could do because then if you
have something nearby then it could
seamlessly interface potentially without
having to be attached yeah at speeds
that would be like you know USB 3
regions as if it's wired yes it's wired
but that's a problem these specific mods
II have a 360 camera you can snap on now
there's a gamepad but what's the value
of that versus one that does not need to
be specific and proprietary that you
could use with other phones that's a
cool idea too there are other 360
cameras out there that you that don't
have to be specific mods and as Josh
Goldman reminded me of those costless
and we haven't done tests comparing them
that's my concern is like do you really
need yet another camera they'll be your
third camera on the back of the moto z2
so I also with the time we have left I
also wanted to get to the Samsung Galaxy
Note 8 we're expecting that launch event
in New York August 23rd and Jessicka
dual-core another one of our mobile
reviewers updated our preview story
about this what are your expectations
for this phone you think it's going to
be a big deal for Samsung hopefully they
actually get the right foot forward this
time it's a huge deal for them and it's
also about image as far as what happened
with the note 7 but also in terms of a
you know product line that's always been
the most boundary-pushing
Samsung phone it's like their flagship
for the future even more than the than
the Galaxy S phones and so there's
rumors about dual camera that wouldn't
be surprising maybe like you're saying a
speaker in the stylus we were discussing
this earlier a speaker and the stylus
which sounds I am your stylus
it could translate as you write
everything like flippy yeah a more
annoying version of clipping that you
can't get rid of Buon Giorno like your
stylist talks to Italian stylist now so
there could be reasons for for feedback
however maybe to give like you know tell
if you have reached an edge to give kind
of a like not haptic but maybe sounds
who knows Samsung I always got it has
some wild ideas maybe pressure-sensitive
display like 3d touch although if you
have the stylus already I don't know if
there's that much value to it then
there's the question of Bixby mm-hmm
Bixby Bixby's been because been a little
little embattled so that is you know
Samsung's a I also you know expanding
into areas of computer vision to
recognize objects through the camera
kind of like google lens so that's a
cool upcoming idea but again do you need
an extra AI on your phone well your
assistant yeah is it really gonna move
phones I mean like that's the primary
reason why they release these things is
is it gonna convince people to buy
Samsung versus something else I think
most people really get annoyed by
assistants at this point so like I don't
want another assistant and knowing me on
top of my assistant and something like
which assistant is good at this point I
feel like they're all kind of a series
got a lot of problems Google assistant
is like okay Alexis fine but it's not on
phones that much at this point and you
know anyway so that's nothing it's can't
be good
all right good I think we're well past
three minutes and 59 seconds so let's
call it a day on the podcast today but
there are more to come many photos I
mean many more to come
if you want to read more about these
stories check us out on Sina I'm Ben Fox
Ruben I'm Scott Stein thanks for
listening i Scott you are a wealth of
information this is I feel like
especially for like a phone show we
could have gone for like eight hours
they just flew out of me and I didn't
expect it to it was great good Scott
gets really excited about phones you
never know when there's like phones I
don't even like phone I don't care
all right so on that wealth of
information we do have some questions
dhurpa purple asks great name by the way
what about the speakers and this is in
reference to the Moto Z - what about the
speakers are they front-facing and how
is the audio fidelity that's a really
good question so we didn't get much of a
chance to experience much sound and a
crowded yet however we have a unit in
the reviews in progress so more to come
on that
I will we'll check it out I would be
concerned that the speakers aren't that
great don't forget that the Moto Z
phones they flaunt the idea that you can
attach better speakers there's a JBL
sound boost speaker which is really good
if you're really into that if you want
to pay more and that is that is that is
my problem with the mods is that I think
everyone wants it all on the phone and a
lot of what Motorola's doing is like
just pushing that off into yet another
thing yeah the - totally had hit it on
the nose I'm spending seven hundred
eight hundred dollars on something and
it comes with crappy speakers that I
have to pay even more for yeah you could
see why people might be a little bit put
off by better speaker by another camera
is that better zoom camera a 360 camera
and dual cameras it would be great if I
had a mod where you just attached a
better phone on to it you'd be like oh
you don't mean they're still fine that
was a great what means they're still
alfred was here for that he's a big fan
all right we have some more commentary
Jacob Kraft is talking about batteries
he says I wonder if Motorola dropped the
size of the forces battery to encourage
the purchasing of battery mods it's a
very good definitely noticed that this
is a smaller weaker battery previous
year yeah good spot interesting analysis
on that 27 30 milliamps row up this
first thing actually there's all my head
still for the battery on the Moto Z to
force 3000 milliamp for the Z to play so
the batteries all took a dip the YouTube
play got really good battery life on our
test not as good as last year
z2 force we don't know the motor
claims still have really good battery
life but yeah that is a thing there are
so many damn battery packs that are
being made as mods it's like 70% of the
mods or battery packs watch yeah it went
damn so many turn battery packs that's a
very good point though I hadn't even
thought about that before or maybe they
just feel that we don't need to worry
about this it's a smoke you can buy it's
a small dip but people are so annoyed
that they don't get enough out of their
phone battery life that going backwards
instead of forwards is obviously
something that's going to annoy
customers it is something that when we
heard about it when we were first
briefed we were not thrilled I don't
think any tech person is thrilled with
the back dip in battery that's not the
dock being said okay with the smaller
battery about how much less lifespan are
you expected per charge like half an
hour unclear right now I mean the claims
anytime is a battery claim it's like I
don't know we gotta we gotta test it but
you know but the claim is that much like
when the iPhone reduced its battery
capacity one year in the iPhone 6s I
think that there's like oh the battery
life is still the same maybe it's more
efficient processing etc but the fact is
it's smaller capacity batteries so I
ever 27:30 should be fine it's not like
there's a small battery it's just not
the force was all about like super power
before you know and it was big it was a
big phone um now they're going with the
thin design it's really thin it's like
the z2 I mean it's like this the
original motive is better be like the z2
it is exactly it's like the Moto Z it is
thin when you pick it up and you see it
you'd be like oh wow this is thin also
you want to put a back cover on it I
think because the weird thing about the
Z designs is they feel like something
has been lopped off to me they have
exposed gold pins on the back where it
connects which was a mods
yeah which always looks kind of raw and
unfinished kind like oh did someone
remove the cover to your laptop
and there was a camera bump comes out
but if you put a cover on the zphones
the bump goes away so for a variety of
reasons aesthetically I would like to
put a cover back on which would add a
bit of thickness again nice catch-22 if
I can get met here for a second it's
kind of fun too
once again we love to shout out or
loyalists and as well as our new friends
and fans der Poel purple Matthew Yahoo
they're noticing some of the the more
technical things that have taken a bit
of a step up and they're curious about
the the improvements that I installed
over the weekend Oh for real yeah so you
can see my face now Matthew you know I'm
not gonna yeah right I'm not gonna go in
a tie right here but I have toyed with
the idea of doing like a studio tour
video for CNET just because we do have
some kind of cool tech that's not the
typical you know consumer tech going on
here between our switchers and our
mixers and our mics and cameras and if
anyone's interested in that you know
just leave a comment I'm it's not the
kind of thing that's a super high on the
to-do list but it could be fun even for
just me to like kind of poke around and
revisit our but yeah I said appreciate
as a shout out to Brian we would not
have a podcast without you and he's
constantly upgrading our attack to make
us look better so thank you I love that
there's conversation in the chat right
now going on about the Lego phone a
proverbial Lego phone and I like that
Matthew caught the reference he says
would that look like the handheld
admiral al head and quantum leap and now
I can't get that out of my head a
modular phone that looks like that
multicolored brick like almost it looked
a kind of Tetris II in a way project
Aria had some like a goal to that yeah
Oh God Lego really should make a phone
mm-hmm I mean I just finished 18 hours
putting together a robot 18 I feel like
it was like 5000 the it probably was 18
altogether yeah that robot kit boost
sorry yeah I just reviewed that if you
should check out farting robots and all
the other stuff that it can do but why
not why not make a Lego phone for kids
or for anyone right you wouldn't want to
have like a monthly data plan attached
to
but it might be kind of fun to put it
together and actually be able to like I
don't know turn it into a walkie-talkie
or something
I had a Lego iPhone case at one point
there was like an official one that you
just had the the stubs that you know the
little thing you can put figures on and
you could build on the back ear your
phone but it doesn't serve any technical
no no but I mean think about it there is
a market for you simplified phones kid
phones Legos should get on that people
love Lego these days these days they've
been having quite a renaissance I heard
this thing coming out it's called the
Lego I feel like they went quiet for a
couple of years and I would probably say
over the last like three to five years
like there's been Lego mania you say so
some movies of hell okay good it's been
non-stop since my childhood I know
you're claiming yeah okay you may be
right the movies were a brilliant move
yes like now they're always like I just
saw the Batman one a couple weeks ago
and they have Ninjago which now all of a
sudden they're able to boomerang that
that humor into their own traditional
franchises and things yeah now like
suddenly you might get someone to care
about Ninjago who wasn't a Ninjago
person yeah Ninjago phone
Nexo Knight phone I think we should
start with the core first yeah I think
that's going too far
my son buys a lot he buys them we buy
him a lot of Lego kids he has a credit
card so I know a lot about this he's
super in an X tonight's he's scanning
all the all the shields into the app and
alright okay bit of a detour under Lego
we're getting a little low on time but
Michael Brown shadow Michael Brown he
says I think personal assistants need to
become more ambient what do you guys
think having to remember exactly what to
say as a command is kind of annoying and
yeah point but they're getting
progressively smarter and it's sad
they're in there in the clouds so
they're getting better
every single day and understanding
context is very important Google
assistant tends to do that better than
some of the others but Amazon is
certainly trying to do that as well so I
think the trick will be and this is an
interesting question about privacy to me
about what happens with AI because a lot
of times the companies will claim you
won't really have much of a record of of
all the things that consecutively or
maybe we do but we don't knit them
together but basically yeah I feel like
AI needs to understand everything you've
said going back a period of time so they
can certain itting together
understanding so if you start saying
something like no that other thing or
can't you tell me about what I just
asked you or stuff you know stuff that's
like a little more off the cuff I wanted
to understand that because I feel like
I'm always starting again right and
let's go going back to Michael Browns
point by the way I just remembered what
I wanted to say as far as like I was
talking to an Adobe analyst that said
that in many ways when you talk to these
voice assistants you need to learn how
to speak voice I think that's what he
was saying is that you almost have to
speak in this technical code where you
sometimes you even have to trigger like
if I'm gonna use an IFTTT command I have
to say trigger this you know to the
specific voice assist then so there are
these like different steps that go on
and you know you you have to it's not
it's not quite natural language it's not
like you and I talking to each other do
you know what it's exactly like it just
occurs to me it's a lot like those old
text adventure games yes it's like
Zorich anyway they were text adventures
and in order to look around a room it's
like you know get the key on the table
you couldn't just be like get the key on
the table it's like look table oh
there's a key right you're looking
writing code basically yeah yeah left go
left
get key um that type of stuff go forward
what is forward right like oh I don't
know how to put the key away put key in
pocket okay it's in your pocket it is
this whole other like subversion
language almost and I wonder if down the
road this whole now they get to weird
and philosophical here at the end of the
show
I wonder if it'll have any kind of
adverse effects on our natural speaking
it definitely will have it you think so
yeah Brian and podcast hey Brian hey
Brian doing Brian what's the day I'm
having trouble connecting to the
internet the good news though is is that
all these companies and they're all the
majors recognize this and they want to
get us closer to natural language but
the problem especially with what you
were saying is natural language
understanding is super duper difficult
oh yeah actually like voice processing
that's one thing natural language
generation that's what they've been
working on now the next steps are like
natural language understanding and like
it's very like computers are super
literal and so it's really hard for them
to understand what we say when we say it
because they don't understand a lot of
our context well and this is dialogue
this is relationship building so at some
point the deeper you get the more
connected you're supposed to be in that
opens up identities too because right
now when you talk to an echo
everyone's talking to the echo but at
some point you need it to discern you
versus your wife versus your kids at
some point needs to understand your
history sometimes a I like like Siri
will remember you know I call my wife oh
that yeah that's yeah that's Johanna
like it'll keep certain bits for you is
that me is that someone else talking to
Siri like that's that distinction needs
to happen more as well and that's gonna
be immensely difficult right you can't
go forward to understanding what's in
your head and being able to pluck pieces
out of there wherever a relationship
happens I will tell you that these
companies are very much having these
conversations multi-user is already
available with the Google home and I
would expect it to be available at some
point through the echo as well and you
know you're hitting on a lot of stuff
that's gonna make this stuff a lot
better so I thought to go out on riffing
on what you were just talking about it's
got dirt purple says maybe they should
give it something that makes it learn
your habits and personality and I that's
cool and that would increase the
functionality and comfort zone with
operating these devices but
point do we get into how 9000 creepy
territory where it knows you too well
totally we get there we get there pretty
fast thanks it's a balance yeah for sure
it is that it is that perpetual balance
and at what point do you start living
your life to a routine to match the
system so that is kind of what already
happens in life that is kind of
mind-blowing hey hey that's what I do
everyday running to get to the train and
coming into work yeah below that but but
the functioning your life is writing the
in the areas of your voice assistant
sounds super creepy get ready for the
for the continuing exploration of
symbiotic mm-hmm that's exactly I do
think that's the most interesting part
is to what point is it evolved to a
point are we evolving that goes back to
how we speak and how we learn to speak
it's gonna get weird but it has to
change on both sides let's let's call it
or else we're gonna be here all day but
Scott thank you so much for coming and
yeah let's wrap this thing up the
podcast is available on iTunes TuneIn
stitcher SoundCloud Google Play Music
Feedburner
and also on a little website called
cnet.com thanks everybody for listening
great questions everybody and we are
back tweaking you out the rest of the
day oh god it's really happening
robot uprising don't be terrified don't
stop be terrified while they scan your
bracelets you could turn everything off
alright so we're gonna be back on Monday
by the way we're off tomorrow just a
bunch of people are gonna be out of the
office and we'll see you on Monday
thanks everybody thanks everyone and be
back
