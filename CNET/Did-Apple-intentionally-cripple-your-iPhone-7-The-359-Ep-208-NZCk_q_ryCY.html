of the 359 podcast I'm BBG and I'm here
without fitting and Roger Cheng good
morning guys what are we talking about
today morning morning we're gonna be
talking about Apple and the go figure I
know I know not something Apple wants us
to talk about it's not all positive it's
not positive I know it's Qualcomm
leveling some serious charges
specifically one of the biggest ones is
that sort of confirming Kwazii
confirming a rumor that apple had
actually dumbed down the Qualcomm chip
in certain iphone 7 that came out last
year if you had a tmobile or a 18t
iphone congratulations you had a
slightly slower slow down artificially
slowed down modem thanks to all kinds of
shenanigans with that with Intel we'll
get we'll get more into that in the
podcast yikes on bikes um well there's
only the iphone 7 though right so it's
only be my inferior iphone that's not
the seven that has a headphone jack is
perfectly fine whoa maybe maybe problem
is that so the new iphone sevens were
theoretically supposed to tap into
faster networks because your phone
couldn't accept apple kind of done that
work down so i will explain why the
podcast will also be talking about a
cool feature that alfred wrote about how
tax season is really open season for
hackers yes file your taxes now if you
haven't already which you should all you
should and because they live in a week
yeah but you should really yeah there's
another reason for that with what what's
on bombing that you know hackers and
lastly of course we'll have to talk
about united airlines incident because
that's at what everyone's talking about
right now yep and how it's it's just
gone viral it's exploded though and
really heads to do use the word explode
with the plane i know that's terrible
yeah not intentional not intentional at
all alright so let's let's get started
as always if you have any questions
leave them in the comments section brian
will pick up the best and we will get to
them in three minutes and 59 seconds
from 32
welcome to the 339 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day all the
crap we want to throw in I'm Roger Tsien
I'm Alfred hang the gloves are off to
spat between Apple and Qualcomm with
Qualcomm filing a response to apples
patent licensing lawsuit one of the
biggest charges is a Rubens floated
around for a while the idea that Apple
dumbed down the Qualcomm modem chip in
certain iphone 7 so that would perform
the same as the supposedly inferior
Intel modems as a reminder Apple started
selling iphone 7s with the both Intel
and Qualcomm modems in different
versions for instance if you had a
tmobile or ATT iphone you had an intel
chip if while verizon and sprint iphones
got the Qualcomm one so up what do you
think I mean this is rumors been
floating around what do you think of the
idea the Apple intentionally dumped down
one version to keep it on pace with the
the inferior chip I mean I can't confirm
it or anything like that but it seemed
very plausible considering that there
had been plenty of rumors as far as Mac
product goes where there's kind of as
like planned obsolescence anybody aware
you know instead of just having it work
forever after a certain point it just
kind of slows down and I've noticed that
on a lot of my devices right where okay
i'll just buy an entirely new one I just
don't understand why would only be for
t-mobile and Sprint iPhones one so I
mean I think it's less about planned
obsolescence and more about sort of
keeping things competitive again for the
first time Apple opened it up so Intel
could provide a modem chip into some of
the iphone 7 and at least as far as what
the qualcomm charges state that Intel
modem was not as good and so to keep
everyone on a level playing field they
actually in technically dumbed down the
qualcomm ship and I think it's because
Apple wants to have two suppliers right
they don't want to just get Qualcomm
chips they want to have Intel Qualcomm
together you know keeps them both on
their toes and theoretically gets them a
better price all right well I wrote a
story and if you haven't filed your
taxes yet you definitely should so
during tax refund season you'll find
that or a study found that spam email
related to taxes increased by about six
thousand
Wow or so and they're all basically
saying you know hey we have your tax
information here like do you want and
they can come in a word document that
contains a virus on it and then once
they fish out your password and all that
all the information they first thing
they look for is your tax information
like your w-2 your driver license all
that stuff and your emails hopefully
just just to break it down like what is
a I mean there's the term fishing comes
up a lot with security yet what does
that mean it basically means when you
what they send you a link and it looks
like a link that you would normally log
into but you know in in fact they're
just keylogging your password gotcha so
then they get act they basically get
your password by pretending to be one
website you know it's like just stealing
it that way and then using that to log
in on your account gotcha so yeah file
your taxes follow taxes now and be
mindful of random emails up here alright
we couldn't do this podcast without
talking about the United Airlines mess
was what a passenger was violently
ejected from the plane after refusing to
give up a seat videos of the incident
went viral on Facebook and Twitter is
this at the end of United and what do
you think I mean I think airliners tend
to have a lot of money but I don't think
they can really shake this off literally
after last week with the leggings yeah
yeah which at least with that one you
know they had an excuse an excuse
although it's a terrible excuse but at
least they had an excuse with this one
you know they've tried you know months
it's sad that they can look back to
leggings and sit ago what those are the
good day yeah but it's it they tried
they tried mucking it up with basically
their um their answers like oh well he
was being rude and using right but then
we painted on the passage but there's
video of what happens and it's just you
know this whole thing is inspired just
have a serious backlash against United
there's an entire subreddit now devoted
just to you know United horror stories
wow that's crazy alright lastly I wanted
to plug our tech enable package which
explores the role that tech plays in
providing new kinds of accessibility the
last chapter just how-to guide on
talking to your parents into adopting
smart home tech published today but the
whole series is worth a look so for that
story more check on cnet i'm robert
chang i'm out for doing thanks for
listening
so going back to the Qualcomm chips yeah
let's talk about the timing of when this
started to come to light because some
people are alleging that this has been
well known since the debut of the phone
yeah yeah so there was a lot of
discussion about sort of speed
differences between the Qualcomm chips
and Intel chips just in general the the
sort of speed tests have shown that the
ones running on the Intel chips
performed worse than the Qualcomm ones
but in this particular instance cual
comes actually accusing Apple of
basically limiting the capabilities of
that Qualcomm chips so it actually could
theoretical faster can tap into faster
network speeds and Qualcomm is saying
the apple com dumbed it down to kind of
keep it a little bit more on pace with
the performance you get with an intel
chip sure and do we think that there's
any influence from carriers over this ah
no you know what I've talked to the
carrier's about this I mean most of them
wouldn't even touch this topic a lot of
the times you know they basically just
get the phone the Apple gives of them
they don't really question it that much
they do their own testing for sure but
the thing of it is that the testing
isn't going to find that the chip isn't
going to perform well because it does
perform well in connection to network
you get a decent coverage with it but in
terms of that full network speed you're
not going to get the full full access to
the network carrier speed technology
right and just to quell some fears this
is only isolated to the iphone 7 not the
iphone 6 success right because the
iphone 6 but basically all the
generations before the other 17 used
only qualcomm modems that for the first
time they open it up to intel and
Qualcomm because they want to get a
second supplier frankly we just want the
competition there for suppliers and I
think that's sort of result and you know
until you know they're not really known
for making modems for phones they're
really kind of very they're very few
customers or like a handful of INEC
Chinese phone makers and the apple was
their biggest customer so it's it's
again it's kind of a it goes back its
kind of black mark so would it be just
to keep like their phones equal with the
phones with the Intel chip so make sure
that Intel kind of stays in the game I'm
like having a hard time understanding
why
Apple would want to purposely cripple
their own devices because they think
they want hit around but among equal
playground video they wanted to avoid a
situation where like half the iphone 7
South there performed significantly
better than the other half mm-hmm and
like you'd be able to figure that out
via speed test and they did some just be
tested find that even even after they're
the alleged crippling those Qualcomm
ship phones proceed to perform better
than we're consists more consistently
than the Intel mean if they wanted to do
the whole you know we want to keep
diversity and our chip so that in case
something kind of goes wrong like yeah
this batch is still fine why wouldn't
they just put all the Qualcomm chips
that perform better on like the plus and
then you know the Intel chips on the
seven on its own I think it's a matter
of carrier technology if you look at the
carrier the way the cares were segmented
sprint and verizon run on kind of
similar technology then you know 18
t-mobile they kind of run similar type
of technology I think that's why the
chips got kind of went that direction
they couldn't it would be more expensive
to segment a different versions of the
phone as opposed to like different
characters because you could design
because you have to design a specific
chip for sprint verizon anyway so you
might as well just have one manufacturer
do that shelton in the chat is asking
why should Qualcomm care wouldn't this
her Apple not Qualcomm well I mean
Qualcomm cares because you know they
they argue that I mean it's part of the
lawsuits part of the charges that
they're throwing em and one of them is
that their argument is that Apple hurt
customers by doing this by basically
keeping customers from having the best
possible experience on their iphone 7 by
artificially dumbing this chip down
throttling darling yeah and hopes that
you'd buy it again well I don't know if
it's that I mean I really think it's
more about trying to keep things on
level pace with with Intel because they
want to keep until the game because they
want that second supplier there well
isn't this also in response to a lawsuit
from Apple against absolutely this is a
counter lawsuit it is they are it is
actually a formal legal response to the
patent licensing law suit the apple
filed back in January an apple for the
record I mean then really comment
specifically on the Qualcomm charges for
guests
they basically just referred back to the
filing from January and basically they
argue that Qualcomm has been benefiting
from unfair royalties for years the chat
wants us to move on to United all right
boy discussion here so charming it back
out to you guys we want to know what
your personal response and experiences
are maybe you've got a horror story from
united yourself what is your takeaway
from this I mean we make a lot of jokes
on this but this is dark this is this is
awful now yeah maybe you watch the video
it's pretty graphic yeah it's it's it's
a little disturbing it's mean I me a
favor from almost tech perspective like
it just sir shows you how unsaved a
united is in terms of like the social
elemental things because they're the
verb the initial statement they put out
with this kind of like robotic statement
yesterday really blame the passenger and
then the fall of stain from the CEO
wasn't that much better way more the
over bookings like for Rhea comma dating
the over book isn't Pastor Mike even
addressing the issue here yes it just
and it was yeah I have to wonder if that
guy's job is on the line I mean you also
have to kind of consider how often this
has happened before talking like tech
angle on this like consider how often
this probably happened like before you
know smartphones were ya thang know that
you might like the idea of like adding
the video element whether it's live
video recorded video and having it post
to live definitely adds an element like
just the idea this public shaming that
you just consider all the things that
like United might have gotten away with
you know we have the effect of social
media putting a magnifying I didn't even
know they did so I don't know if you
guys knew the situation right like the
full breakdown the situation this guy
was randomly selected to be removed from
the plane because they need to make room
for United crew that needed to get to
Louisville uh I didn't know they did
like I know they offered incentives to
get people to get off the plane but I
know they're like had a computer like
randomly select you can get it I think
it's their their failsafe and it could
still be a complete load of BS right
just you know throw a dart at a board I
will carry a lot of people actually
asked about their computer how it
randomly selects people and I've learned
bit like a fury if you're a
I'd like status member there's no way
you are randomly selected for this yeah
yeah um oh I had I had a oh this is also
so we're on on the tech angle of the
power of the mobile phone and the social
network and how this quickly came to
light and there's not a whole lot of
great i mean there's always gray area
but there's a whole lot less in this
scenario because you got a front-row
seat yeah this is also all coming to
fruition on the tail of the new FCC
Commissioner making moves to try to ban
any and all phone activity Ron air I
thought I was just talking on the phone
was it just to shock just I think
verifying and also they I mean that was
that never went to affect really like
they had band-aided about and I think I
just effectively said yes we're not
gonna do I'm surprised I was even being
considered cuz like do you get reception
when you're on a plane mmm not only yeah
I don't ya so I was like being in
relation ritory it because if you gogo
inflight Wi-Fi Wi-Fi calling you can
actually talking about okay or we could
facetime yeah I mean you could be yeah a
jerk about it I just thought that was
interesting that they were unfolding
kind of side by side but no yeah when
you're saying there's no gray area
because everyone can see it because it's
all online and somebody just happened
and there's multiple camera angles of it
to ya oh yeah and the thing is that you
know typically the responses from major
corporations has been to create a gray
area where it's like oh well he was
being belligerent let's blame it on him
right it's his fault you know you look
at the Chicago Police Department's
response was like he fell and then you
look at basically you know everyone's
calling them out on their on their
answers was like yo there's video we all
saw what happens when I can't tell us
that like this is like spin it yeah have
you guys ever had any nasty experiences
with united we got Josh in the chest as
i got stuck in SG for two days because a
mechanical problem on the you a 78 is
that SJ singapore right i'm assuming so
right that's the code that that's what
anytime I hear SGI yeah it's mr. Kapoor
um that's a rough way no I don't fly
united I tend to fly delta just stay
away from united and i probably will so
even more after this but yeah I mean I
don't
experiences with you know that's this
about anywhere near this level yeah
usually the only issue for me with
flights is like it's delayed or you know
yammering overbooking kind of issue
which i feel i did have one situation
where i was booked in the same seat as
another person and i was done we were
double booked but they found to see for
me really quickly yeah so that wasn't
like a real issue I was panicking for a
second like wait what like I'm looking
at his ticket my takeaway they're the
exact same this how's this happening
that's really responsible uh there no it
happens a lot though they over by me
they overbook planes they really
shouldn't do that right absolutely like
the only industry that does that it's
such a terrible practice yeah so I've
had a rather positive experience with I
think it was a long time ago but i
believe it was american airlines almost
20 years ago i was flying to florida and
back alone I was younger and then uh
what ended up happening was like a
mechanical problem caused the plane to
like last flight out of that I get
cancelled and they they chauffeured me
out got me a suite in a really swanky
hotel gayi you know cop my ticket got me
back in the plane first thing in the
morning gave me free round trips for a
year Wow nuts that was 20 years ago yeah
that's kinda what United was Connor they
were offering first 400 of four hundred
dollar voucher and it's not a stay at a
hotel and then they bumped up to 800 and
still nobody wanted to know what the
like why not bump it up a little bit
more or why not bump them up to like
business class unless that's over book
to you know the idea that like if the
people can't be moved by money I
guessing the plane itself is over but
yeah like but why yeah why not come up
with another airliner be 1000 or 1200
like if you kept going up in increments
like that can someone's gonna raise her
yeah and then like if you only needed
for people to get off you're not really
cutting yourself at a loss that much
right that's why likes one of the thing
is such a stupid response on their part
to call the police yeah over a man who
was on the phone with his lawyer and at
the same time just essentially you know
he paid for his ticket right it's not
like he snuck on it's not like he was
drunk or belligerent all just like
really what this comes down to is how is
this put so poorly managed in advance
where they didn't pre accommodate for
the necessary cruel and he schedules
yeah do change and bring evan flow but
come on there should be some kind of
reserved seating program
the extent where the customers are not
impacted by poor management of the crew
and people asking why why couldn't the
crew just get on the next flight well
then that would have only caused a
domino effect on the further flight
right those guys need to be in
Louisville to get that next flight out
kind of thing um it's uh it's a tough
one dad is it reminds me I don't know if
you guys watched 30 rock but uh the Matt
Damon episode was on ways the pile of
the plane yeah he's declaring sky law
this is what it is Scylla I gotta you
gotta wonder if there could be a better
system if anybody out there has an idea
that I'd love to hear a better system is
to not over book no seriously like no
other industry does this imagine you go
to movie theater right you know we all
the way through be like sorry no no we
have we have proceeded reserved for
somebody else yeah it's absurd they just
don't don't do that such a terrible
practice and it's like to maximize your
profits but at the same time like you're
you know it's at the expense of the
customer yep on the flip side of things
JW in the chat says to be honest I've
owned always flown with United and have
only had a good experiences I'm six foot
eight very tall and they're always
complimentary towards me to the exit row
if available no I mean if your regular
thing is if you're a regular flyer of
your status flyer hmm they treat you a
lot there there you're definitely treat
differently there's a there's definitely
like sort of a a long gap between sort
of regular common flyers and folks who
like our regular travellers frequent
fliers who you have status or gold
diamond whatever whatever the little
levels are but they definitely treat you
better imagine saggy says the problem is
not with the customer it's on the
airlines agree with Alfred there you go
Alfred by a vote of confidence on why we
did something beside your no no actually
thank you that sounded pretty sarcastic
for me but I try um there's a delivery
yeah it's hard for me to say anything
positive without it sounding sarcastic
that is it what about a cooperate here
we go i think i might be reading between
the lines here but Sheldon says how
about several airlines would stand by
pilots to shuttle era to other locations
so I'm thinking like maybe that means
why couldn't the United staff jump on
the Delta flight in the next 10 min yeah
and I thought they did that too I
thought there was some sort of why
you know handshake deal where other
airlines could help like provide what
were they called jump seats or whatever
for four crews of other companies right
going I mean that yet that makes sense
right it's just a simple cooperation yes
you know synergy between the airline's
they're like that happens but maybe not
to the extent that it should be I mean
it's definitely a thing I've seen in the
movies yeah it's gonna try to be too
real that would that sounded dumber
after I know I know but you know what
that's where I got my facts too so it's
it's cool um why couldn't they just
randomly choose again why were they so
locked into coming after this guy who
obviously was severely resistant well
that mean they did randomly choose he
was what I can I randomly choose they
chose four people three people actually
already left I thought I thought like a
couple left a couple like a man in a
woman or someone there was three other
people out begrudgingly got up left and
we compensated yeah the last guy was
this one well I think I think it's one
of those things where maybe like it's
like a Hunger Games kind of thing where
oh well we rolled the dice you four were
picked we can't do it again kind of
thing right right right like yeah like
if you obviously if he like he makes
that much noise they can't like I'm has
a weird pressing yes sit there like we
do the process just because of what I
was superb like imagine imagine if like
you're on that flight and they decided
to do it again and then like somehow you
get picked and well liked the idea is
like okay well that guy raised such a
fuss right I'm going to do the same
thing I'm just gonna do the same gang
nubs in the chat clarifies and thank you
for this this is the term I was trying
to think of it they do have that my
brother is a pilot and they can deadhead
daddy yes yeah yeah I've heard that yeah
it's a it's an unfortunate situation I i
personally have concerns about United as
a company in the near future yeah
because this is far from the first and
certainly far from the last as things
start unfolding as you said there's an
entire subreddit dedicated to it now I
only got to kind of skim through this
but I did see a horror story about a
luggage handler throwing a dog cage ooh
like I I don't know what I kind of feel
like that's a little bit worse just yeah
that's that's call me crazy it's pretty
bad um let's see if they're still an
airline at the end of the year I don't
may be about out
that would be nice to see all right
that's probably more than enough time
yeah but there's been a great discussion
everybody thank you for yeah thank you
let's wrap it up for the day yeah if you
like anything you saw or heard here
check us out on cnet our podcast is also
