I'm cnet's car i cboy joined by senior
rider Seth Rosenblatt Seth Wednesday
Google's I owe the big developer
conference kicks off the big news
expected out of this year's is all about
your wrist it's where our watches
watches what are we expecting we know
for a fact that Samsung LG and Motorola
will all be coming out with watches
running Google's new android wear
Android wear is their version of Android
for wearables so three different
manufacturers coming out with watches
differences similarities we don't know
yet we don't know obviously there will
be a form factor difference we've seen
the motorola watch they did a sort of a
soft an ounce of it in March it's
circular LG also made their announcement
in March we don't know what Samsung's is
going to look like we we heard that
they're coming with two watches we don't
know if both are going to be using
Android wear or just one but at least
one will have where I mean this has been
a gadget long talked about by different
companies manufacturers so the fact that
Google is putting the name behind it
being launched this could be a this is
going to be a big deal right now the
wearables market is only one point four
billion dollars that's projected for
2014 its projected to be 19 billion
dollars by 2018 so a tenfold increase in
four years this is just the beginning
this is just the beginning and this is
just the beginning where else is Google
hoping to you know get their products on
this this year at this announcement
everywhere they're looking at tvs we
hear that there's going to be a google
TV rebrand as android TV we don't know
necessarily what's going to be coming
out with it but we do know that it's
going to be very big for google and we
know that they've developed a
partnership with car makers so that your
car's entertainment system will be
running Android in that we also expect
news about that tomorrow and what about
google glass any updates here there's
there's been some updates in the past
week there I suppose there could be
something tomorrow but we're not really
expecting anything there they most
recently
a glass for work so more niche use cases
of glass which I think Google is hoping
we'll get people to understand how to
use glass a little bit better instead of
just being a product that you have on
your face all the time you can use it
when you're in a museum or when you're
on a construction site in very specific
use cases and with Google's acquisition
of nest and the smart thermometer yeah
home thermostat I'm sorry yes what are
the announcements expected around the
smart home we don't know necessarily
what's going to be coming we do know
that Tony Fadell the CEO of nest is
expected to make an appearance today we
had big news from nest with the
announcement of their API for developers
and that means that other app makers can
tie into nest users can opt into sharing
their data and google it seems like
Google really wants a nest to be the hub
of your connected home so it sounds like
there's going to be a lot of hardware
announcements it's not the show but what
would you say the overall theme is
overall feel that sure sure well as you
can tell by the sign behind us Google is
really going for an emphasis on design
last year that sign was filled with
color and life this year it's very stark
and minimalist and we know that they're
going to be emphasizing designed to
their developers they're also
emphasizing distribution they want
developers to begin thinking more like
entrepreneurs and not just programmers
when you think of design you obviously
think of another big you know Silicon
Valley giant which one could you be
talking about perhaps like a little nod
or a little you know call to order to
compete with that company of course yeah
there's no question that that's
happening especially considering that
Fidel used to be an Apple employee
Google's really I think they're a little
anxious you know this is a bargaining
market with screens everywhere and
there's an opportunity for Google to
really take control of it before things
get out of hand the way that things in
with smartphones so we expect to see
their first salvo in this battle
tomorrow well lots of 42 thank you so
