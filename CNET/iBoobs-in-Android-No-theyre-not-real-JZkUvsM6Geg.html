and it's time to get loaded Google
confirmed that it did remove a few apps
from the Android Marketplace because the
apps were malicious we've reported this
last week but Google had not confirmed
it until the weekend only devices
running Android 2.2 point 2 were
susceptible to the apps which took over
a user's device there were 58 rogue apps
downloaded to about 260,000 devices
which Google does say they can remotely
disable with a kill switch and here's
one thing Google will not remove with
the kill switch
I boobs this is a rather juvenile but
also pretty comical app that lets you
jiggle a pair of boobs up and down Apple
removed it from the App Store in 2008
but now it's in the Android Marketplace
the app costs $2 but there's also a free
version called I boobs Lite I think
there are fewer features on this free
version not smaller boobs but I didn't
test to verify that the Today Show is
relaunching it's morning show page on
today.com this is a morning show on a
competing network from our parent
company CBS but I think this is worth
mentioning because it's a total
reinvention of a broadcast shows web
presence most broadcast news programs
cut up their shows and just throw them
online in bits and pieces today is
treating its website like a completely
different entity they will have a
separate broadcast just for the web and
put a greater emphasis on video on the
site it launches on Tuesday we love our
technology but not at the expense of our
health a new study shows that Americans
dependence on their gadgets is costing
them precious sleep the National Sleep
Foundation found that 95 percent of
respondents in a recent study reported
to using some type of gadget before bed
experts believe this is not only pushing
back our bedtime but the light from the
gadget also stimulates you so you don't
fall asleep quite so easily the
recommendation from these experts is to
keep your gadgets out of your bedroom do
you think you can do that our parent
company CBS has acquired clicker which
is sort of like a TV Guide for the web
it helps you find and watch the shows
you want on the Internet I first became
familiar with clicker when it launched
on buxi over a year ago in this
acquisition CBS took on clickers CEO Jim
land Zoni as the news
Oh CBS Interactive this makes him my
boss CBS Interactive is the digital
media branch of CBS corporation we had
been without a CEO for a few months and
now we have one
I don't know LAN zona yet and we have no
inside information on this deal and
finally I would be remiss if I did not
mention that the hottest thing on the
internet this weekend was actor Charlie
Sheen Sheen took to Ustream to do a show
and I used the word show very loosely
here he is calling this Sheen's corner
and it racked up over 300,000 unique
viewers on Saturday night and has been
viewed on replay over half a million
times
it was pretty nonsensical which makes me
wonder if I could get more viewers for
loaded if I just started running my
mouth and talking nonsense maybe I'll
try that tomorrow tune in for that
that's your news of the day you can find
