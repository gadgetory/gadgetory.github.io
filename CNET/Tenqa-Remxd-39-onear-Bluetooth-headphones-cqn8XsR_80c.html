com and I'm here with the tangka remixed
bluetooth headphones yes these are
wireless headphones and they are very
inexpensive wireless headphones their
$39 usually stereo bluetooth headphones
go for around a hundred dollars you will
find some in the fifty dollar range but
$39 really is about as low as you get
this is an on-ear model and they have a
pretty generic design you've probably
seen this design with urban ears and
there's a bunch of other headphones that
have a similar design so pretty ho-hum
in terms of design they're fairly
comfortable I found the headband a
little bit large I have a somewhat
smaller head so they didn't fit me quite
tightly enough but people with larger
head shouldn't have a problem with them
they have a couple of nice features in
terms of button placement is good like
other bluetooth headphones they serve as
a headset for your cell phone so you can
make calls with these the microphone is
built into the left earphone I wouldn't
say the qual quality was fantastic with
these particularly outside but I
definitely could make calls with them
these do have a built-in rechargeable
battery and the battery life is good at
around 16 hours one of the small
problems of these is they don't come
with a standard micro USB charging cable
rather it's a headphone jack that goes
into a USB a charger so if you lose that
charging cable you can't just grab a
micro USB charger that you have for your
phone for instance and use it with these
headphones that's a little bit of a
problem as for sound these are only okay
they just not terribly dynamic sounding
or terribly clear the base is there but
just not a lot of punch to it but you
can't expect a whole lot for $39
bluetooth headphones and you certainly
sound fair for their price so all all
the real headline here is the price
point these are a decent value for
thirty nine dollars not a great pair of
headphones for that price but an okay
pair of headphones for that price and
these are the tank up remix bluetooth
headphones thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
