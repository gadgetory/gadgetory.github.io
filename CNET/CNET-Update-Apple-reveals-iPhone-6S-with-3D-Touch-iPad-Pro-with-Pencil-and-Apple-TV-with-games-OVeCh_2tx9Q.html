are moving photos I'm Bridget Carey and
in this CNET update I'll cover all the
highlights from Apple's news events in
under three minutes there's lots to
cover from Apple's latest news
conference so let's first hit the top
product the new iPhone 6s and 6s plus
they look similar and designed to last
year's model but the big new feature is
called 3d touch the screen can now tell
how hard you're pressing and it will
respond in different ways to pull up
shortcuts or previews of a message
instead of just a tap you press deeper
to pull up menus or other options you'll
have quite a number of new gesture
tricks to learn there's a new color to
the pack it now comes in rose gold
aluminum which looks like a soft pink
the processors are much faster than the
last model and the cameras got an
upgrade 12 megapixels on the back with a
5 megapixel sensor on the front there's
a new photo feature called live photos
and when you snap a photo it's also
recording a second and a half before and
after you took the photo so a photo
essentially becomes a very very short
video a moment in time the word live
will appear on the screen when that
features on press deep on the photo to
see it in motion the front camera now
has a flash it's actually the whole
screen that lights up to become your
front flash the new models are priced
the same as always for iPhones if you
have a payment plan it could be $27 a
month or $200 with a new two-year
contract pre-order it's Saturday
September 12th and it'll arrive in
stores Friday September 25th Apple is
also putting a new spin on the Apple TV
streaming box by opening it up to games
and apps some of the same apps and games
from your iPhone and iPad the new Apple
TV comes with a remote with a glass
touch surface to swipe and tap to
navigate and has a motion sensor just
like a classic Nintendo Wii Remote use
Siri to ask for specific things like
only show me James Bond movies with Sean
Connery other streaming boxes from
Amazon Google and Roku they have voice
commands too and they are less expensive
Apple TV starts at a hundred and fifty
dollars and it will arrive in late
October and how does Apple hope to get
you excited about buying a new iPad by
making it more like a laptop and
creating a new keyboard in style
accesory the new iPad pro has a high-end
processor chip the screen is as large as
a laptop screen at twelve point nine
inches and there are 5.6 million pixels
packed into this screen which is more
than the 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina
display never before has Apple made a
stylus but behold now we have the Apple
pencil which changes thickness of the
line depending on how hard you press
there's also a special fabric keyboard
cover Apple is making a big push for
this as a workplace tool it has a 10
hour battery life and it starts at $800
the pencil is $100 and the keyboard is
170 dollars it's all coming out in
November we're out of time for this
update but you can dive in deeper on all
the Apple news and the new Apple watch
