of galaxy phones I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update samsung is
giving us a hint at the new interface
that's coming to the Galaxy s5 you can
expect Samsung to show off its new top
phone the Galaxy s5 at an event taking
place in less than two weeks on februari
24th samsung shared this image teasing
new features for the smartphone with a
series of icons for different categories
their speed outdoor curiosity fun social
style privacy fitness and life this new
TouchWiz interface could have more of a
focus around things like fitness
tracking and privacy but maybe this also
shows us that the graphic design of
menus and icons will change to be more
flat and simple the event is taking
place during Mobile World Congress it's
a massive expo for smartphones and
tablets held in Barcelona Spain also
during the mobile conference you can
expect Nokia to announce a low end
android phone it's likely an inexpensive
phone that will be sold to developing
markets and some news reports are saying
that it may not have access to the
Google Play App Store instead it'll have
Nokia's own app store it's similar to
how Amazon puts a limited version of
Android on its kindle tablets now what
makes this interesting is that Microsoft
is in the process of acquiring Nokia's
mobile business so that means
technically Microsoft will be selling an
Android device we should learn more
about this during Nokia's press event on
februari 24th the same day as Samsung's
announcement the redesigned PlayStation
Vita is coming to America Sony confirmed
that the slimmer and lighter handheld
console will arrive in North America in
the spring for two hundred dollars and
it will come bundled with the game
borderlands 2 and an eight gig memory
card some places can pick from multiple
colors but as for North America the only
choice is black and in other video game
news microsoft revealed details of a
software update that's coming to the
Xbox one next month in March owners of
the system will see improvements to
multiplayer and party features Microsoft
will also really
a new Xbox one stereo headset for eighty
dollars looking to the future wireless
charging technology made a leap forward
after two rival groups teamed up to
agree that they would use the same
standards of technology and that means
in the future it'll be easier for you to
put your phone down on a wireless
charging mat and have it just simply
work regardless if it's a different
brand of charger right now the wireless
charging market is so fragmented that
not all chargers are compatible with
each other that's your tech news update
you can find more details at cnet com /
update and be sure to follow along on
Twitter from our studios in New York I'm
