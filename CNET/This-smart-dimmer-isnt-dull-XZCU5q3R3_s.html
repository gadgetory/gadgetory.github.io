appliances here with the Lutron smart
bridge this 150 dollar gizmo gives
Lutron brand dimmers and other products
smart functionality so where in the past
you could buy a Lutron dimmer at the
store for 55 bucks get the pico remote
that goes with it and control everything
manually
now the smart bridge lets you do that
with an app I really loved this app it's
really intuitive it looks nice and it
makes it so so simple to use this works
with the plug-in module or the in wall
unit that you have to install you can
set schedules that you can initiate
manually or you can do auto schedules
say these lights will turn off at 9:00
a.m. when I leave for work and come back
on at 6:00 p.m. when I come home
something like that the one big problem
I have with this is price you can get a
Belkin Wemo smart plug for 50 bucks that
has built-in Wi-Fi capabilities and be
able to turn your lights on and off from
an app remotely
since these Lutron dimmers are actually
dumb they don't have built-in Wi-Fi
capabilities you have to spend the extra
150 bucks for this smart bridge to get
that capability so that's a bit of a
bummer the benefit you're getting is
dimming capability it really allows for
a whole new range of lighting options
that you couldn't have before if you
want some of those extra features this
is great it works great it's just going
to cost you one thing that would make
this a better value is if you
incorporate some of the other
third-party products that are available
with the smart bridge for example there
are Sirena battery-powered shades that
can be installed on your windows and you
can use the app the regular Lutron app
that you use for these plugs to lift
your shades up and down on a schedule
that's all it works with currently but
Lutron also has plans to incorporate
Honeywell Wi-Fi smart thermostats not
the new Honeywell lyric thermostat but
the older smart thermostats into this
mix also ge is working on a dimmable LED
bulb with built-in Lutron capabilities
so you don't need the switch you could
just buy this bulb screw it into your
lighting fixture and use the app to
control that
so this Lutron smart bridge isn't coming
out until september first so you have a
little time to think about if it makes
sense for your home you could always
just spend you know the fifty five bucks
get one of these and see how you like
and then add on the smart bridge later
on but overall I love this product I
love the app I think it's great even
though it's really pricey thanks for
watching I'm Megan Willerton for
