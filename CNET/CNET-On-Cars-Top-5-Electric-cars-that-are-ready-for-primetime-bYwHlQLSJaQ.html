an electric car you probably lived in
Florida golf Talaat and no longer worked
my things have changed
I'm Brian Cooley with a top five list I
probably couldn't have done even a year
ago top five electric cars from major
manufacturers that are all ready for
primetime we're gonna rank these guys by
my impressions I've driven four of the
five also by their range on a charge and
their miles per gallon equivalent that's
kind of the MPG rating for an electric
car we'll also tell you where they fit
on the price scale let's go number five
the oddly named Mitsubishi I'm Eve
range of 62 miles mbte 112 this one
barely makes the cut because I don't
know that American consumers are ever
going to embrace the looks of this
electric easter-egg it also feels
uncomfortably close to a golf cart when
you're driving it but I gotta say it is
fun to drive like your perennial E
approaching the 18th hole and it costs
under 30 grand plus your rabbit will
never complain about the ear room number
for the smart electric drive range of 87
miles MPGe
a hundred this is the newest car on the
list it'll also be the cheapest with an
MSRP around 25 grand but I'm mostly
excited about it as sort of a redemption
for the smart car which should have
always been an electric car I mean with
its current gas engine it's truly one of
the awful driving experiences in the
world this conversion may absolve many
sins number three the Nissan Leaf range
of about 73 miles MPG e99 the leaf is
the Prius of v's not in sales but in its
charmingly
odd look urban nature and strong
execution
you'd be surprised by its luxurious
Drive manners cool cabin tech and smart
phone app but I slotted at number three
because the looks are just a little too
Barney and it lacks the fast charger
we're about to see in car number two
which is the Ford Focus
evie number two by a whisker ahead of
the leaf range of 76 miles MPGe 105
forty grand it makes once a four-hour
focus but the car looks great leverages
the underpinnings of a great compact car
already
and has a sporty Erdem meaner than the
leaf it's also got this fast charged
technology that can do a full charge in
three to four hours on a 240 outlet that
can mean hours left on the nipple then
against its competitors before I get to
number one I can tell you it's not going
to be the Chevy Volt or the Fisker Karma
you see those are not really electric
cars in the pure sense their range
extenders they use a combination of
electricity to drive them but also gas
engine to generate electricity I call
that a separate list for another time
except there aren't five of them to rank
the number one electric car ready for
primetime without a doubt has to be the
Tesla Model S range of 140 miles on up
MPGe of 89 and it's the first
evie to win Car of the Year it looks hot
goes like hell has great range and can
be optioned up to around 265 miles on a
charge check out its 17-inch central
cabin screen rewrites the rules of cabin
tech on the other hand the Model S
starts close to 60 grand and if you want
the 265 my learn now you're pushing 80
and up still this is the car that
doesn't just accomplish an electric
conversion but sets a new level for the
bar for more cool top fives on high tech
cars
