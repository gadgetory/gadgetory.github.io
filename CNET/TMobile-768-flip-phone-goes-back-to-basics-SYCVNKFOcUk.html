talking about the t-mobile seven six
eight
it's a $72 flip foam that's gonna be
best for folks on a tight budget we'll
start with the good things um call
quality it's pretty good actually I know
I tried the phone out in San Francisco
and in parts of Oakland and the call
quality was always pretty good you could
always you know hear people clearly in
people whether I was having people you
know in the Bay Area or on the East
Coast they said you know they could hear
me clearly and that's pretty much kind
of video at least there was a time when
that was the primary purpose for a smart
phone but we'll get to that in a minute
the phone also has an FM radio which I
thought was a pretty cool addition and
it supports up to 32 gigs of micro SD
storage in an expandable slot right
underneath the battery so that's also
really great if you want to carry in
your own music around unfortunately
that's pretty much all that's great
about the phone the keypad for example
uses old-school t9 texting which makes
send things like sending text messages
or emails a kind of miserable experience
which is not that great because the
phone does offer 3G connectivity and
there is a web browser it runs the Opera
Mini web browser so while you can't
technically get online and check your
email and things like that with the
phone because of the keypad you aren't
really ever going to want to there's a
two megapixel camera but it's a pretty
terrible camera and the video camera is
also pretty terrible but here's the
thing
it's a $72 phone on one of t-mobile's
cheapest plan you get unlimited talk and
text and no data caps and no contract
assigned for 40 bucks a month that means
over the course of two years you're
spending about 43 bucks a month for
unlimited talking and unlimited testing
I guess I wouldn't recommend testing on
this phone but if you're looking to
spend
relatively little on a phone just so you
can keep in touch with your family and
your friends you just want to make voice
calls you don't really care about apps
or browsing the internet or sending lots
of emails or things like that
the t-mobile seven six eight actually
isn't a terrible deal I'm Nate Ralph
thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
