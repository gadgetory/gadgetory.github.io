smartphone display Sony thinks there may
be room for a few more its unveiled this
it's the xperia z5 premium a phone with
a 4k display let's take a look now it's
definitely the headline feature so let's
talk a little bit about that 4k display
so this is a 5.5 inch panel the precise
pixel resolution is 3/8 40 by 2 160
which is the same resolution that you'd
get on a big 4k television so as well as
having an insane number of pixels sony
says this phone will actually upscale
video to 4k now upscaling doesn't always
look amazing so we'll be interested to
see exactly how good that upscale 4k
content really looks packing 106 pixels
per inch the detail on this screen is
absolutely immense but the big question
is can you really tell the difference
between this and a regular phone I would
caution that personally I can't see a
huge amount of difference just here but
if you do have to have the highest
resolution screen the most pixels
available well Sony's made this phone
just for you now if you do go for this
phone one thing you'll be battling is
that there isn't a whole load of 4k
stuff to watch at the moment the
technology is still reasonably new one
nice concession however is as well as 32
gigabytes of onboard memory sony says
that this thing will take up to 200
gigabytes of expandable storage so
there's plenty of space if you do have
those bigger 4k movies or TV shows this
phone doesn't just do 4k of course it's
a fully featured smartphone so you have
a 23 megapixel camera on the back which
sony says has the fastest autofocus of
any phone it's also waterproof and
despite that 4k display sony says you
can expect up to 2 days of battery life
that's quite a claim and we look forward
to putting that to the test in the full
review the design doesn't stray far from
what Sony's done in the past this phone
comes in a number of colors and as you
can see this one has a very very
reflective back which is useful if you
need to just touch up your appearance on
the go so is 4k the future of smartphone
displays or is it just a little bit
pointless we want to know what you think
so let us know and check out senior comm
for so much more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
