Google issues for everything Google you
can think of and the top story may not
sound all that sexy but the February
security patch is rolling out for pixel
and Nexus devices with full download and
over-the-air links available for you to
get right now
now the pixel to line is getting some
nice updates with this patch including
improved Bluetooth call quality improve
camera performance in certain light
conditions for what's already the best
camera phone on planet Earth right now
there's also improved Wi-Fi uplink
performance and even improved battery
performance for some pixel to XL devices
that sounds like a good goal to me now
another win for pixel 2 fans the googs
is enabling its custom image processing
chip for third-party apps starting with
Instagram snapchat and whatsapp your
camera now just got a whole lot better
for some of your favorite apps it also
allows these apps to take advantage of
the same computational photography and
machine learning that powers the pixel
Tuesday hdr+ functionality now these
pictures show images on the Left that
don't use the pixel visual core while
images on the right do with HDR plus in
action you know what I have to say
congratulations to all the Philadelphia
Eagles fans out there fly Eagles fly and
Patriots fans I'm sorry but after
escaping with Super Bowl wins against
the Seahawks and Falcons a you were deal
and on behalf of the Niner faithful we
thank you for Jimmy G Q but what does
this have to do with anything well
nothing really but if you watch the
Super Bowl for the TV commercials
YouTube has put all of them in one place
right here at this link like it's
totally worth checking out including
those awesome Tide commercials and yes
infinity war baby now I also know we
have Apple users who watch the show the
YouTube TV app their own TV streaming
service is now available for the 4th
generation Apple TV and Apple TV 4k a
roku version of the app is out as well
and on Apple TV YouTube TV costs 39.99 a
month versus the normal 35 because of
course it does offering 52 channels the
big for broadcast networks and a few
other cable channels and the Google
Voice app it's finally been updated to
support the iPhone tens new screen
lucien while squashing some bugs and
improving the overall performance so get
that update if you use the service
alright let's go to the phone's an AC
sees next flagship phone the u12
allegedly leaked out at a 5g event where
the unannounced phone was on display for
everyone to see
now there isn't much info about this
phone there's no branding or marking but
this is believed to be the you 12 with
it's rumored 5.7 inch screen you can see
slim bezels around the edges and the
fact that it's pulling near gigabit
speeds is another tip-off that it's
likely using Qualcomm's 5g capable
snapdragon 845 chipset with an ex 20 LTE
modem designed to get speed results like
this and the oneplus is back at it again
after teasing us with a star wars
edition of the 5 t that you can only get
in India a few months ago well now
they're looking out for us and
delivering the lava red edition of the 5
T to the US and Europe right before
Valentine's Day now their commercial
also includes some amazing acting by
Emily ratatouille
who wouldn't want the best smartphone of
the year that's amazing
now we talked about everything we know
about the Samsung Galaxy S nine up to
this point and last week's show but Evan
blast is back at it again releasing
images of the front the back and the
sides of the new Galaxy S nine in one of
its new colors lilac purple stay with me

expect our midnight black titanium gray
coral blue and this new lilac purple
