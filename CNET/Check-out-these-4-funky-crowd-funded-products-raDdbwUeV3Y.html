won't look what I won't look here it is
hmm and wait what what what is going on
oh yeah you gotta guess what the purpose
of what did you bring this for um hi i'm
sarah and i'm lynn and today we're
testing out some kickstarter products to
see if they actually work okay you ready
for this yes first up I have porch which
is a portable jacket heater so basically
you take these velcro pads you put them
into your jacket then you attach the
velcro are nothing to it you put this in
basically the whole goal is to like make
your jacket a little bit warmer like
this finishing around the waist feet in
area yeah like you know your back your
waist see you like feel it it's getting
a little warm but at a hundred percent I
don't know like how formidable a
dimensional cramps you know I feel like
when you want to feel like dying but you
don't want to show it so you just want
to warm it up and so this product is
called T stand and it's for your tablet
that's where the tea you know put it in
there and then oh alright 00 top-heavy
oh no plastics a little bendy it's a
little scary um well how aggressively
are you watching these be shown yeah but
i got a boy supposed to like sit on my
chest or like yeah in bed with me like
no not in bed like this but like but
like in bed like this like really
sitting up on there all right it's not
comfortable like i meani I mean it's
good okay I don't know about you my
posture is terrible and this is supposed
to fix it it's called better back it's
very stuff whoa yeah ok so the premise
here kinky is that you put this part um
on your back with the arrows facing up
you put these around your knees and
these straps basically forced you to sit
up straight I'm gonna put it around my
dad look weird at all like if your wings
right you know at the office and then
you're basically just gonna put these
around your knees you can adjust these
straps on the side it's a little bit
kooky
and then voila I have to sit up straight
is it really for she doesn't really like
yeah I think that it does and there's
this like clip right here that don't
like what you like I mean now like I
can't except for it kind of falls apart
sometimes and you do the mother that's
right yeah right out a little bit ok how
it feels and then I and then I could go
video oh yeah that's like a chastity
belt ok ok I see it yeah yeah it's a
little bit different yeah all right I'm
ready for whatever you got next ok I'm
very excited about your reaction to this
product oh my god I'm gonna guess what
it different look what I won't look here
it is hmm and wait what what what is
going on hey you gotta guess what the
purpose of what did you bring this for
um ok I ok how's a grape it does your
list food ok ok ok lot more innocent
than you think it is it's not in phone
sex toy oh thank you gotta get it um ok
what do you think it is there it says
air cork so i'm going to assume based on
that name and this that it's something
to do with stopping a wine bottle nice
ok so we have a wine bottle here ok half
drunk not by me oh so basically what it
is is to keep your wine fresh stick it
in we'll go say you know you've done
drinking for the night you know you did
your Netflix and chill and there you go
and it's all plugged yeah yeah ok and
I'm it's I don't have a date / yard owe
you a dime in my half drinkin cab glad
you said so all right all right
you know it's good cuz then you know cuz
you move around and then it's just kind
of like you don't know what's going on I
don't need and then sometimes it like
you know catches the light of your
reflection and then you see how sad you
are and then you're like and you're like
