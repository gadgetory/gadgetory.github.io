going to take a look at the 3d systems
cube 3d printer so this is the second 3d
printer we've reviewed here at scene it
the first one was the MakerBot
replicator kind of an enthusiast really
hardcore hobbyist design system this
though is purely aimed at consumers
everything from it's designed to the way
you print objects on it all the way down
to the software the system is really
focused at being easy to use and kind of
simplified so if you're not familiar
with 3d printing the way it works is
that this head deposits this plastic
material down here this print surface
prints up layer by layer until you get a
solid object at the end of it the object
comes from a 3d design on your computer
that you send to the printer to print
out so what we like about this printer
in particular is that it's really easy
to use you can see here is a big drum
that contains a neon green plastic that
goes here into the head the drum just
slides in really easily and then to load
the plastic you go to this menu and it
walks you through the process of feeding
a plastic in there's a couple ways to
actually get a design from your computer
to the cube you can plug a USB key into
the port here and have the design show
up on the menu here or you can connect
via Wi-Fi setting your plans from either
your computer or your smartphone to the
printer itself so once you have those
plans sent to the printer you navigate
through the menu tell to print and then
begins the warm up process that takes
about 10 minutes and it's actually
pretty quick compared to the replicator
and what happens is this bed and this
printhead here get very hot and that
heat is partially what keeps the object
stable on the surface as the print
progresses now it also helps objects
stick is this magic cube glue and that's
unique to the cube you lay that down on
the surface and that along with the heat
make sure the object stays put when the
print is finished you lift off the plate
then set it in a cup of water in order
to dissolve the glue at that point you
can take your print off so the cube is
actually pretty unique in the landscape
of consumer price 3d printers and that
it is a really really consumer focused
device all the other printers out there
in the sub $2,000 price range at least
are really designed for hobbyists that
like to get into the software tweak all
kinds of settings you can even customize
the hardware in those models if you want
to with this one it's really about
getting a design
to the printer and just cranking it out
so when you go to use the software for
the cube it's not a lot of settings you
can play with sometimes it's simply used
but it also means you can't correct if
something goes wrong in a print the
other thing is that it feels like 3d
systems is trying to monetize you
throughout the entire process of using
the printer before you even turn it on
you have to register it at the cuba 5
comm website and then when you're there
3 systems really pushes you to pay for
plans on the website you have to pay
extra for the glue you want to replace
it these cartridges are proprietary and
they cost a little bit more per volume
than you get from the other 3d printers
so as much as this is a Consumer Focus
3d printer they really do try to push
you do consume let's head the process of
printing the cube is a whole lot easier
than with the replicator we never once
had a print slip off from where it was
supposed to be glued we did get a little
bit of lifting here and there but
nothing that totally damaged the output
so speaking of its output we have a few
objects that we've printed here on the
cube some of them came out great
others less so so this napkin holder and
this little rook design both came with
the printer and they printed out
perfectly there's really no complaints
about the way they look now the plans
for these two objects as well as the
others you'll find on Cuba fire are more
or less designed to work very well with
the cube that's great the problem is
here it's pay form now they're planar
designs out there that are free but as
you can see from this chair they don't
always come out as well as you want them
to
now this chair being messed up might be
a product of the software and the way it
interprets the design but because the
settings are really sparse in the 3d
system software there's not a lot you
can do about it to try to improve it you
can take the design file to an outside
3d design program and try tweak it but
your results are going to be guesswork
until you actually print one that works
now that's certainly not the case with
every free file you'll find out there in
fact we printed these devil horns from
MakerBot Thingiverse website you can
download the plans there and that works
fine so 3d printing is still in its
experimental stages for consumers and
while this one is certainly one of the
more consumer focused devices we've seen
it's also not cheap it comes in at about
1,300 bucks that's not including extra
glue any extra plastic or the designs
you might want to buy for it but because
the free plans don't always work as well
as you want them to there's still a lot
of guesswork and sort of hit or miss
outcomes when you actually print it's a
little expensive hobby and particularly
with this printer you can find yourself
shelling out a lot of money in order to
keep at it
but overall this is probably easiest
use device that we've seen so far so I'm
rich Brown this is the 3d systems cube
