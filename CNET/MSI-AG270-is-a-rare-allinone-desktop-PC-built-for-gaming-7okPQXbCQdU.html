gaming all-in-one desktops I'm Dan
Ackerman and this is the msi AG 270 it
is a very rare beast indeed it is an
all-in-one desktop which means it's got
the computer components and a big
monitor built in together in one package
kind of like Apple's iMac but it's
targeted at PC gamers usually you see a
big bulky traditional desktops or even
gaming laptops you're certainly seeing a
lot of those lately but we very very
rarely have ever seen a dedicated gaming
all-in-one what we have in this case is
essentially a very high-end gaming
laptop this has essentially laptop
components it's got a high-end intel
core i7 processor but a mobile version
and it's got nvidia geforce gtx 980m
graphics card that's the high-end Nvidia
graphics card right now but again the
mobile version not the big bulky desktop
version all packed into a 27-inch
display so you get performance that's on
par with super high-end gaming laptops
from Sue's or origin or alienware not
really the same level as a dedicated
gaming desktop but I'll tell you for
playing current games at high settings
at 1920 by 1080 the resolution of this
display it actually works out fine
there's a couple of other things I
really like about this display one it's
got a matte coating on it so it's not
overly glossy so you're not going to get
a lot of glare from lights in the room
and it's got a nice kind of muted look
to it and it's a touchscreen something
that you see an all-in-one sometimes but
you see on gaming systems rarely
especially high-end gaming systems so
the fact that I've got just a standard
Windows 8 touchscreen interface on here
just antol√≠n it makes as much more
usable as an everyday PC besides just a
gaming system unlike things like the
iMac which are very slim and light and
put their screens on these delicate you
know telescoping arms this guy just sits
flat on the desk it's heavy it's just
got one big plastic kickstand and you
can tilt it back a little bit and throw
it a little bit and that's about it does
pack in a an optical drive this
particular configuration has a blu-ray
drive and you get a standard set of
ports connected with the back kind of
like a TV would have you've also got the
same mounting screws you would need to
mount let's say a flat-screen TV so you
could put this on a wall if you wanted
to now
of course all this unique charm does not
come cheap this particular configuration
is 2699 but keep in mind it's got two
terabyte of hard drive space a separate
256 gig SSD the blu-ray drive the super
high-end processor and graphics card you
could knock out a few of those features
get it down closer to around $2,000 a
gaming all-in-one is not for everybody
as somebody very rightly described it as
a gaming desktop you can never upgrade
but I found it be a lot of fun to use
especially because it combines pretty
high in gaming parts and a touchscreen
and a matte display all things I like to
see and I very rarely get to see them
together I'm Dan Ackerman and that is
