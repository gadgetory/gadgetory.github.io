we're here at Sony's booth I can't
exactly touch it right behind this glass
is the PlayStation 4 that we just found
out about it the company is III press
conference it is a lot smaller than we
thought and it does seem to appear to be
a little bit smaller than the Xbox one
it's got a interesting sort of angled
edge to it we can't really see any of
the ports here but we do know that it
has HDMI out and we can see that there's
two USB ports by checking out the side
of the console right here the
PlayStation 4 is a blu-ray player and a
DVD player all right here it is that
Dual Shock 4 it's the first time I'm
getting my hands on what that middle
sensor feels like it's kind of one big
button you can push it from really
anywhere on the entire surface of it it
does feel a little wider than the
DualShock 3 but I really have to get
them side-by-side not a gigantic
difference on the actual button face
buttons here but I'm super excited to
find out that the analog sticks have a
much more reliable grip to them the
d-pad is pretty similar to the original
DualShock 3 let's check out the triggers
here you can see the color sort of led
back here that's going to work with the
PlayStation camera the touchpad is
flanked by a share and options button
and then it looks like we've got a
speaker right below that as well and
then
that is the police-station partner so
this has been a first look at the
PlayStation 4 it'll be $400 when it
releases later on and this year I'm Jeff
