a torrid pace of refresh lately and
they're not stopping here's the 2015
that is free to fly now that the CLA
occupies their $30,000 price point this
guys coming upscale notice they make you
very obvious of that with that s-class
style front nose and very curvaceous
styling not the kind of pedestrian
entry-level look the c-class has often
been cursed with in the cabin you're
going to find a lot of niceties from
really high-end finishes and
accoutrement which this car didn't
always have to a finger handwriting
recognition pad you'll see on this car
kind of a tablet shaped center screen
and the main head unit this car doesn't
say mid or low scale anywhere now
because this cars moving upscale to a
price that's still TBD they're able to
offer you a lot of driver assistance
tech it'll have the option for a user
selectable air suspension first ever in
this kind of car you'll also be looking
to get an adaptive cruise control if you
like head-up display automatic braking
in case you're about to get into a
collision self-parking technology even
active lane departure tech so in other
words you can load this guy up into a
true baby s engines will include a 235
horsepower 2-liter turbo inline 4 or a
329 horsepower 3 litre v6 they are going
to make a wagon version of this but
because they hate me they're not going
to bring it to the US this car comes out
in September of 2014 pricing will be
locked in around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
