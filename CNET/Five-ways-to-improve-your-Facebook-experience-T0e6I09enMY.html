missing out on a better experience if
you don't adjust any settings here are
five ways you can get the most out of
Facebook with some simple tweaks
everybody has at least one friend who
post several times a day or just post
things you find really annoying rather
than removing them as a friend you can
unfollow their updates go to their
profile page and look for a button that
says following simply click it and their
posts won't show up in your newsfeed
some websites and apps have a feature
called facebook login that lets you use
your facebook account to sign up to
their service it's convenient but by
default you give away lots of personal
information to change this tap the log
in with Facebook or continue with
facebook button and then edit the info
you provide from here you can choose
exactly what is shared like the friends
list interests and birthday just
deselect any options and login tell
Facebook whose updates you want to see
first in the mobile app tap more scroll
to newsfeed preferences select
prioritize who to see first and choose
the people and page as you like while
you're here you can also see options for
unfollowing or reconnecting with people
for budding artists the facebook
messenger app lets you add drawings or
text to photos before you send them just
tap the pictures icon in the message
window select an image and press edit on
iOS or the pencil tool in Android then
you can type or draw as you please
before you send it if you love to post
photos of your kids or pets there's now
a feature called scrapbook that collects
images in one place turn it on from your
profile page by clicking about then
