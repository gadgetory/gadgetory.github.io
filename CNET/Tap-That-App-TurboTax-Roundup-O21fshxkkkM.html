that means right
tax season exciting right now I know
you're probably thinking how can I bring
my w-2s and 1099s into other parts of my
life how can I think about my taxes like
all the time even when I'm out well look
no further than these TurboTax powered
apps for your answer first up we have
tax caster a free app that helps you
estimate your tax refund before you even
start filing just input some basic
information about yourself like marital
status age and dependents enter your
income information then go in and select
your deductions credits and payments at
the top of the screen you'll see the
little refund meter with your estimate
and of course the more questions you
answer the more accurate against next
when you're ready to start filing try
snap tax you can use it without an
account or use your TurboTax login if
you have one what snap tax does is let
you file a 1040 EZ return right from
your phone yeah it may sound strange but
if you have a super simple tax situation
it could make sense for you and the cool
thing about the app is that it can
actually pull your payroll data from a
photo of your w-2 so you don't have to
hand answer everything complete the form
with all your personal information and
you'll see your federal and state tax
refund numbers at the top of the screen
snap tax is free to download but if you
use it to file it'll cost you $19.99
finally when you're finished filing your
tax return you can check on your refund
status with another free download called
my tax refund just input your social
security number and your zip code or
your expected refund amount and let it
do the tracking whether taxes actually
do excite you or they make you want to
rip your hair out of your head be sure
to check out tax caster snap tax and my
tax refund and as always if you've got
another hot app that you want me to tap
holler at me on the Twitter thanks for
watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
