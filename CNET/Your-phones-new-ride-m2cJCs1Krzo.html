we're talking to keller renato of remote
of high and he's got these robots that
are controlled with smartphones show us
how they work and tell us what they do
sure so this is Romo he is a robot that
uses your smartphone as his brain
because Romo leverages the power of a
smartphone's processor he's smart he's
really flexible and he's also cheap to
build so currently you can control
Romo's motion from any smart device
anywhere in the world because we go
through the headphone jack he works for
Android iOS and windows phones so is it
just for fun or takes pictures can you
use it to spy on people tell us all the
youth scenario the use cases here sure
so a lot of people who have bought him
in the last in the last couple months do
it because kids love playing with them
they spy on each other they drive it
around they like you know getting him to
a moat and smile and they can annoy each
other with him but he's also useful
because you can use them as a
telepresence robot so you could if you
left horn at the office you could drive
it around the office and see what's
going on at the office when you're
abroad or if you left it at home if you
had teenagers who party too much and you
were traveling in Europe you could
always you know dr roma out of the
bedroom when you're in beijing you could
take your ipad out activate romo drive
them out of the bedroom and the one of
the coolest things about it is that it's
a really open platform so anybody who is
out there who writes for iOS or for
android can go to our website download
the movement library and can code their
own behaviors and personalities for romo
and it's really easy to distribute those
personalities to all of our users and so
you're making you're making these out of
an apartment now I hear yes funny
stories so we weren't expecting to grow
quite as quickly as we have so we sold
that we built and shipped 100 robots in
December
we have pre-sold about 2,000 robots that
are going out in February and those are
getting bolts in our apartment so we
hired like for nerds from UNLV to come
and basically live our government in Las
Vegas and run an assembly line like
building robots every single day 8 hours
a day so it's you know it's it's a
little bit like a sweatshop right here
in Las Vegas it's like a startup
sweatshop but um yeah we build them by
hand here in Las Vegas and where they
available they're available right now on
our website remote of calm their 99
bucks and you know you can support like
robotics which is totally awesome and
they're easy to use their fun to play
with make a great conversation starter
at parties and stuff like that so thanks
so much when Paul Sloan with cnet here
at CES thanks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
