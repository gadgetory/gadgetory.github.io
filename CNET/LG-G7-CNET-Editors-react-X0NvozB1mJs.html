launched the LG G 7 think here we have
it here in two colors blue and raspberry
rose
okay so Glyn tell us about this bonus
it's going to wipe out the iPhone 10 is
this going to take down the galaxy
offline plus what can we expect well the
important thing to remember is that the
g7 is not part of LG's super premium
line that goes into its B cereus line
this is a g7 it's still a high-end phone
but it's not necessarily going to be
competing with the iPhone 10 or the
Galaxy Note series it's actually more in
line with the galaxy s 9 and the iPhone
8 and 8 plus right but there's still
some pretty robust features on here
right so starting with the camera for
example right it actually has two 16
megapixel cameras on the back and LG
loaded it with AI smarts so what that
means is that the camera can recognize
more than a thousand images and
depending on where you are like if
you're taking a picture of a person of
Quetta sunset that it will kind of
automatically adjust the photo settings
and optimize it so you can take a more
perfect photo so it sounds a lot like
what Huawei put in the tooth of ki 20
and the p20 Pro except one thing I like
about what this phone does is instead of
just heavy handedly applying those
settings and you neither accept them or
you don't this bonus gives you the
option to choose from four different
settings different color schemes and
tones so you really have a lot more
choice over the process right and
another new feature and it goes with a
front-facing camera and the rear cameras
is that it's easier to take portrait
photos and that's the kind of ones with
a bouquet like photos with a blurred
background it's really trending right
now and on the g6 it wasn't so
straightforward to take pictures like
that on the g7 you just tap a setting
and then it will take those kind of
photos you can adjust the blurriness to
now tell us more about just the phone
design I'm holding in my hand it feels
pretty good it feels like I can use this
one
it's narrow it's tall but else and we
got going on it's definitely solidly
designed on the back you can see it's a
little bit of a fingerprint magnet but
taking a fingerprints there's also the
fingerprint reader so that's still here
but this time around it's not a power
button like how it was in previous G
phones now the power buttons move to the
side well I am happy to see one thing
here at the bottom it is the headphone
jack kind of disappearing a lot of
phones don't have it but I'm glad to see
that LG retained it and what's also nice
is that it's still waterproof it's rated
ip68 so you could still dunk it
underwater and it will survive and you
don't have to go run out and get a new
phone house wireless charging as well
which is something that you don't always
see it's starting to come out and more
phones the iPhones have them as the
Samsung phones have them and LG has it
too so it's really closing that gap that
used to exists in some of the features
speaking of closing that gap with other
phones there's also a button here that
launches Google assistant and it's very
similar to what Samsung has actually
yeah that's right so Samsung has a big
speed button on the side and LG put the
button exactly in the same place
underneath the volume rocker and there
is a difference of course because this
isn't using proprietary software LG
worked with Google really hard on this
you don't have to say ok Google the idea
is that it's a faster way to launch
search there are also a bunch of unique
commands that LG put into this that
works specifically with the g7 phone
right and one of those commands for
instances you could tell assistant to
take a photo with a wide-angle lens on
the g7 another one is that if you double
tap on the button google lens will
automatically launch so you can maybe do
an image search through the camera so I
think it is a really interesting thing
this is something that LG wants to use
to set apart this phone from the other
ones in there I wonder if it's going to
start sort of like a side button
revolution one thing I don't like about
the Google button on this phone and
some phones is that you can't reprogram
them to open the app of your choice so
let's say that you want to double
tapping that button to do something else
anything else you can't do that you're
locked in however else you did tell us
that they might reconsider in the future
that'll be a good thing because actually
that was one of the more annoying things
on the pixel - in the pixel 2xl - when
you squeeze it sides only assistant
launches and you can't program it to do
anything else right okay so there is
something else that's kind of
controversial as a trend and that is be
not all right so my phone has no knotch
in linz phone has a notch what is this
mean so that means that LG is following
that trend like Android phones like the
Huawei p20 the essential phone and the
upcoming one plus six also announced it
adds a notch
but unlike on the iPhone 10 it's
optional so you can actually have it
have with the notch or you can have it
blacked out on both sides and it will
have your regular alerts bar right here
yeah so when we set this up we were
immediately given an option not or no
not so there's really a lot of choice
there and I think that's good so what do
we know about pricing and availability
well for sure
LG said that it's going to be about the
same price as the g6 so its initial
launch in the US is there around seven
hundred eight hundred dollars depending
on what carrier you got an if it was
unlocked and LG although there's no
official pricing has said you could
expect around that same yeah this it's
not going to be a thousand dollar phone
as for availability there's usually
about a month between the time that the
phone is launched and the time that it
goes on sale and this is a phone we
should expect it to sell in a lot of
different stores right right everywhere
that you kind of saw the g6 being sold
and what carriers and what retailers you
could expect the juice time gonna be
sown there - all right so we've talked
about the specs we've talked about the
design which i think is really nice what
does this phone mean for LG well it is
an important phone for the company
earlier this year LG announced that it
was going to shake up its phone
timetable so it isn't necessarily
releasing phones alongside its
competitors and it's not time at the
same way so if samsung goes ahead and
releases a phone in three months LG may
not follow up and do the same exactly
this one actually came later in this
year that the g6
when it originally launched last year
and that's because LG just took its time
with it and it's tied actually to LG's
line of thin qai devices so it's
supposed to work holistically with LG
smart home appliances like it smart TVs
and smart fridges
all right so this is a pretty strong
start for LG's g7 thank you we'll come
back to you as soon as we can with a
full review in the meantime make sure
you let us know what you like so far
what you don't like in the comments
