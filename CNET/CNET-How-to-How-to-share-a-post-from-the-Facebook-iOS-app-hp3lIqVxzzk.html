how-to contributor and today we're gonna
take a quick look at how to share a post
on Facebook through the iOS app last
week reader made a comment to me that
she wished she could share a link or a
post using the iPhone or the iPad app
and there is actually a way to do it
although there's a big caveat to it so I
have a page post pulled up here it's in
my newsfeed and when I tap on the link
it starts to load the URL while it's
loading or after it loads you could tap
on the share button and you're presented
with three options open in Safari copy
URL and share when you share it's just
like you do on the website copies the
link over you're able to comment with it
set your privacy settings and post it to
your Facebook page now the caveat is if
I had come across this link by browsing
to this particular group's Facebook page
and tapped on the link decided I wanted
to share this post I'm not able to I'm
only presented with open and Safari and
copy URL so the trick is the post has to
actually be in your newsfeed you can't
navigate to it through the Facebook page
and then share it
you'd have to manually copy the URL
create a new status update comment and
share it that way that was a quick look

Facebook iOS app make sure to visit us
