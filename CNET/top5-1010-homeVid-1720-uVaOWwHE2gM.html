five TVs which actually was nine of the
damn things lots of ties well to reward
you for that I've got the perfect side
dish top 5 home video gear devices to go
with that new TV and yes it's actually
five this time let's go warming things
up at number five the brand new roku XDS
streaming player you want to join the
whole screw you cable company movement
this is about the best way to do it for
a little bit of money under a hundred
bucks you'll get Netflix Amazon Pandora
MLB TV Hulu Plus for a fee no iTunes or
YouTube support though hmmm this will
not raise the vein on your forehead when
you're setting it up either we like the
simplicity and go for this XDS version
because it has a USB port for playing
your own movies off a thumb drive rounds
out the package nicely number four is
the slingbox solo our favorite place
shifting device now I think slingbox is
something of a niche device personally
you either don't need one or you
absolutely love it it takes whatever is
on on your home media system and streams
it to just about any computer smartphone
or other device that can run the sling
software it's great if you have one of
those pricey live sports packages and
you'll waste a bunch of it because
you're away from the house all the time
you can get one of these guys for as
little as one hundred and sixty dollars
coming in at number three the samsung BD
c 6500 blu-ray deck it's our favorite
straight up blu-ray player but even if
you're just lukewarm on blu-ray itself
like yours truly.this box also gets you
streaming services like netflix vudu and
youtube it has seven dot once-around
outputs and a gigabyte of storage on
board plus built-in Wi-Fi oh and Samsung
is pushing their own apps platform now
so down the road aways you'll be able to
load this thing up with what you want
and make it a personalized home media
terminal at number two we have the
harmony one do it all and make it easy
unified remote these guys kind of own
this space and the model one is the
sweet spot of airline in our opinion you
program tasks like let's say play DVD
in five dot one audio via HDMI input to
you put all that into a little macro and
that's programmed via a web service
could not be easier okay before we hit
the number one present you should give
your TV look at how many TVs we own good
grief the latest Nielsen numbers show
just seventeen percent of households are
scraping by with one television
twenty-eight percent of us have two and
fifty five percent of our households
have three or more in fact the average
now is three TV sets in the home okay
let's reveal the number one best piece
of home video gear to hook up to at
least one of those TVs it's the sony ps3
slim just about the priciest thing at
350 but still the best value games
blu-ray online streaming from their
service as well as others like Netflix
and Sony just gave it a 3d update so now
you've got some future proofing there
with a compatible 3d TV full details on
all these products are over at Matt
miskova ex list on cnet and keep an eye
on it if you're in the market because
this is a very hot sector and new
products are popping up all the time
