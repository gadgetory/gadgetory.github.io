created 25 years ago but I bet you don't
know what it was
I'm Brian Cooley with a scene at top
five the original five dot-com domain
names number five deck comm September
30th 1985 only us o G tech types
remember Digital Equipment Corporation
today but it was a heavy hitter from the
60s into the 80s
I learned programming on one of their
vac system but this isn't an ancient
history course deck was sold to Compaq
in 98 compact to HP in o2 and that's why
deck comm points there today number four
MCC comm
July 11th of 85 MCC stood for micro
electrics and computer technology
corporation not really it was a high
tech R&amp;amp;D consortium that went poof
around the year 2000 or so today it's a
sad part domain the only one of our
originals that sit there in that forlorn
state number three
think comm may 24th of 85 by the way
notice how like a month used to pass
between each comm registration backlund
things weren't quite so busy think comm
was the home of Thinking Machines an
early maker of supercomputers based in
Cambridge Mass the last iteration of the
company was bought by Oracle in 1999
that's where think.com points today to
their think quest teacher-student
learning something number two BBN
dot-com April 24th of 85 BBN was a
legend in the early internet days doing
a lot of the heavy lifting on the packet
data switching that still powers the net
today transmitting the first email and
they came up with the at symbol in email
addresses today BBN calm points to a
Raytheon page because yes they acquired
the firm in 2009 before we get to our
number one oldest dot-com domain a
little trivia dot-com was originally
going to be dot core for corporation but
you can imagine that might have been
misunderstood because it sounds like
core or core or core we have the top
five first domains here but only six
were registered in all of 1985 Northrop
comm would be in our list if this show
is called top six Microsoft comm not one
of the original 100 comm registrations
but Apple was at number 64
and sex comm was also not one of the
first 100 we had more pure aspirations
for the net back then okay now it's time
to reveal number one the very first
dot-com domain ever registered symbol X
comm March 15th 1985 you may not know
the company but it was a high-end
computer maker that among other things
lays claim to making the first computer
workstation that supported real time
video digital video and HDTV 1985 think
about that the next time you fire up
Final Cut today Symbolics is owned by a
domain brokerage that maintains some
kind of a blog there but it's mostly
tumbleweeds well that's it for this
edition of top five i'm brian coolie
from cnet.com registered March 5th 1994
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
