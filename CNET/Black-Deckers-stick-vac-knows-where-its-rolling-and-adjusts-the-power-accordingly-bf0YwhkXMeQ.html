deckers brand new stick vacuum that's
right it's a vacuum and it's pretty cool
because it can actually tell what type
of floor you're vacuuming on so if
you're on carpet it's going to use a
little bit more power than if you're on
hardwoods saving the battery and
stopping you from using that guessing
game huh how much power do I need for
this particular job so the other two
features aren't quite as exciting the
filter sets could be really useful it
tells you when to clean your filter I
often ignore my filter on my own vacuum
so that's gonna come in handy the other
one battery sense is LEDs telling you
how much charge you have that's pretty
standard on stick vacuums but Auto sense
isn't and if it can figure out how to
use the vacuums power better than I can
it'll be a pretty cool feature indeed
this black &amp;amp; decker stick back is going
to be out in stores this spring the
price range is going to be between 159
and 179 depending on how big a battery
you want and I'm excited to test it out
in our CNET appliances last</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
