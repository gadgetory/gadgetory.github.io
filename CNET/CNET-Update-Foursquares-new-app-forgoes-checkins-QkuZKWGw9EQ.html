track your location I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update foursquare
is testing out a new app that would
automatically detect your location and
give you advice about the place you're
at without ever opening up the app or
checking in about 2,000 Android users
will be the first to try it out and
it'll roll out to all 35 million users
later this year this passive location
feature works in the background to
detect when your phone has stopped at a
certain place for a bit say for example
you're eating at a restaurant and then
after a few moments and alert will pop
up on your phone about how you should
try something on the menu that your
friend recommends this feature would
make Foursquare more useful for people
who don't really care to always pull out
their phone to check into every location
they visit but it could also freak
people out realizing that they're always
being tracked not to mention it could be
a huge battery drain on Twitter tweets
are viewed in reverse chronological
order with the most recent sitting on
top but to make it easier to follow
along with a real-time conversation
twitter is changing its design on the
web and in apps to group conversations
together with a blue line so you can
read it in chronological order that way
a conversation is clear with just a
glance at the timeline the change is
rolling out to users now along with
another update that makes it easier to
report abuse if someone is threatening
you on the network got a few updates for
you to keep an eye on for those of you
that video chat with Google+ Hangouts
you'll notice the quality of video will
get better google hangouts are upgrading
to 720p HD video if you're still waiting
for your google chromecast to arrive at
your doorstep iphone and ipad owners can
now set up the streaming device using a
chromecast app for iOS rather than doing
the setup from a pc that's just Google
showing some love to iOS owners and the
flickr app for iOS got a boost the
update has new features including custom
designed filters and camera tools like
grids some pro editing tools like
enhanced crop sharpen and adjust color
are now free flickr is pushing to become
the tool you use to take photos not to
a place to share them the animated gift
library giphy is on a mission to have
animated gifts automatically play in
your Facebook feed well we are one step
closer to accomplishing this important
goal for mankind if you find a gift you
like on giphy just click the button to
share on Facebook and it appears like an
embedded video so others can click Play
to watch it loop animated gifts don't
work normally on Facebook because the
site doesn't want to look like a
blinking flashing myspace mess but who
knows you may someday live to see that
change that's your tech news update for
more on these stories head to cnet com /
