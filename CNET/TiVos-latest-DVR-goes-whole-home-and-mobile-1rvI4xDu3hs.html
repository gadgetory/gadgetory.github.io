is a look at Tebow's newest DVR the
Romeo yes it's a little hard to say
without a chuckle but for long time TiVo
users this might very well be the box
you've been waiting for for those fed up
with their cable providers DVR the Romeo
is a convincing argument for dumping
them once and for all the Romeo comes in
three versions a standard Romeo and Plus
and pro models this is the pro version
which can record up to six shows at once
to three terabytes of storage or up to
450 hours of HD programming the plus
drops the storage amount holding up to a
hundred and fifty hours of HD while the
base Romeo records up to 75 hours of HD
and has four tuners instead of six
however while the plus and pro are
CableCARD only the standard has support
for cable card and over-the-air TV now
inside all of them is new hardware for
speed ur performance and for the first
time built-in Wi-Fi moving around the
interface which has been updated
slightly is quicker and apps launched
faster the latest versions of Netflix
and YouTube were on here too and thanks
to Romeo's new html5 platform there will
be more apps coming soon
there are other new additions such as
what to watch now which shows you what's
on at the time you're watching but
broken down into categories so if you're
looking for a kids show or sporting
event to watch you can find something
fast on top of all that the Romeo plus
and pro models also have the
capabilities of TiVo's string device
built in so you can use that to
wirelessly view live and recorded TV on
iOS devices currently it requires you to
have the device on the same network as
the Romeo but soon out of the home
streaming to iOS and eventually Android
devices will be available so you can
stream and download shows anywhere
that's just the start of what Romeo can
do and also we have a new
mode that's our F so you can use it just
about anywhere in your room and don't
even have to be line-of-sight with the
device again the Romeo is packed full of
features so check back for a full review
soon
I'm Josh : and that's a look at the
