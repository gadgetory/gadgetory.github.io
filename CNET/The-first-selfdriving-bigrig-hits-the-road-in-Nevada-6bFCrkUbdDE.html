going down the road they're a fairly
common thought you see in everywhere you
go but the two behind me are special
because well they can drive themselves
I'm Antoine Goodwin for CNET and these
are the Freightliner inspiration trucks
I'm about to hop inside and take a quick
spin
on the cluster here you can see highway
pilot is available so I'm going to go
ahead as a driver I have a choice I can
choose to enable it I'm going to do that
and now I'm being able to run hands-free
and feed free the truck is actually
going to do a jog here based on the lane
markings completely on its own to
maintain Lane position now we've got the
forward-looking radar which is looking
at the vehicle in front of us to
maintain safe following distance and
then we have the camera pods up in the
upper windshield that's what's looking
at the lane markings and that's what's
allowing the vehicle to steer itself so
at this point in time I'm completely
hands-free I've got my cruise control
set at 55 and the vehicle is driving
down the road on its own
now what happens if something for
example we get to a stretch of highway
where there are no lane markers they
disappear because of construction so
this is an example of the system telling
you telling me that I need to take
control back essentially it's going to
give me a visual warning followed by an
audible warning and then at that point
in time the driver needs to needs to
take control at any point in time if I
want to override the system I can do so
now this week the Freightliner
information truck became the first
autonomous truck to receive an
autonomous driving license for use in
the state of Nevada which means that it
can actually drive legally on roads
right now but with only four states in
the District Columbia being the only
ones that are fully autonomous legal in
the United States it'll probably be a
while before you see it on a road near
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
