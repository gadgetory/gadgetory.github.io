combine classic carnival midway games
arcades virtual reality an escape room a
place for quiz night a massive event
space a bar and then inject all of it
with a dash of Mad Science you get two
bit circus
ladies and gentlemen step right up and
welcome to two bit circus where you will
find games from across the ages
high-tech low-tech two-player 100 player
fun for everybody we're standing on the
balcony of our micro amusement park
it's a 50,000 square foot entertainment
complex and you know we pick the term
micro amusement park because while small
for Disneyland it's still huge for an
entertainment complex and like an
amusement park broken up to lots of
different zones we have a carnival
midway a hundred seat gameshow theater
what we call Story rooms our version of
escape rooms full restaurant a bar even
a robot bartender
we are really about getting people
together to play MTG live again you know
either creating new memories with with
old friends or making brand new friends
we have an amazing team of game
designers and engineers and scientists
who are coming up with all of this stuff
building it and now we get to showcase
it to the world
also here at two bit circus is club oh
one a 100-seat interactive theater where
anybody can come in and play games
together
and you better be ready to make friends
though because some of these games put
you on teams there are lots of games
around here for two people four people
eight people this room is for a hundred
people to play together elbow to elbow
we want to get people back together
again
and you know and hope that they leave
curious and having any had a great time
fun increases exponentially when it's
shared with others so bring a friend
make a friend or assemble a friend from
the parts outback the production value
inside two bit circus is off the charts
I mean I'm standing inside what two bit
circus calls a story room which is a
little bit like an escape room except
instead of having to get out of a space
it's really about experiencing a
narrative of some of these rooms like
this one have V are available in them
some don't like the starship that you
can pile it with your friends but either
way you are in for an absolute treat
because doing this and playing this is
so much fun
so we're right in the middle of the arts
district in downtown LA we're in the
final few weeks of build on September
5th we are gonna open these doors and
people are gonna stream into this place
and I'm gonna be posted there watching
the looks on their face because everyone
I've brought in here for a tour they see
it they see how much fun they're gonna
have and they just run off in a random
direction I want to see what people go I
want to see what they do I've been to a
lot of pop ups and installations here in
Los Angeles
some of them wacky some of them serious
there's nothing quite like to bit circus
not that I've seen at least it opens on
September 5th I'll see you there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
