cnet.com and I'm here with the I River
Blanc sound donut that's right this is
the Blanc brand and this is a Bluetooth
portable speaker is obviously shaped as
a ring and it's very easy to carry
around with you it has a built-in
rechargeable battery that gives you
about nine hours of streaming audio it
also has a built-in speakerphone
capability and really that is the strong
point of this speaker it does perform
well as a speakerphone you can lay it
down on a desk it looks good on a desk
it has an appealing design it comes in a
few different colors and cost $99.99
it's not as good for music it has a bit
thin sound but you could pair this with
your smartphone Android iOS iPhone or
your tablet whether that be an iPad or
an Android based tablet and it does
augment the sound of those devices it's
just not great for music it's a little
bit thin on the bass as I said so you
probably want to listen this for casual
listening music that use it more as a
speakerphone and also as a potential
movie listening speaker this does play
fairly loud but the good news is it does
have a rubberized bottom so it's not
going to slide around on any slick
surfaces as far as little extras go this
does have an auxilary input for non
bluetooth devices it also has some nice
touch
buttons on the surface those light up
blue give it a kind of cool look
especially in the dark I'm David Carr
know and that's the iRiver Blanc sound
donut bluetooth speaker</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
