inside of Sony's booth and what I have
behind me is a first look at the
PlayStation 3d TV now what makes this
unique this is a 24 inch display it's a
3d TV but it also has a killer multi
player feature what I mean by that is we
have these glasses here and what you can
do is if you're playing a game for
example a racing game and you have two
players playing simultaneously you don't
have to have a split screen image each
player can wear their own pairs of
glasses and just hit a button at the top
to switch the image so for one example
you'll have a racer that's a car and
your other friend that's playing right
next to you
it's a motorcycle but you're still
looking at the same TV with these two
glasses this TV also has three HD and
puts you'll see two HDMI down here and
one component and there's also a
built-in subwoofer on the back now the
3d TV set will be available sometime in
fall there will be a package bundle with
resistance 3 an HDMI cable 1 pair of
glasses which normally retail for $69.99
on their own and the entire package will
be $4.99 that's a TV the glasses the
cable and resistance 3 but this is just
a really killer innovation also kind of
great for that dorm environment where
you're with your buddy you don't have
much space but you both want to game at
the same time but this is your first
look at the PlayStation 3d TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
