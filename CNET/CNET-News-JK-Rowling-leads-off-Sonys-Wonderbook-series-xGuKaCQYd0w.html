book every wizard needs a wand and every
humble a student needs a magical spell
book and this matches perfectly to our
move controller and wonder book open the
book of spells to renew writing from JK
Rowling spell descriptions stories from
the Wizarding iron-making spell and
significantly to learn a bit of the
books conundrum then you can try cast
set of poems unlocked at the end of each
chapter which reveal the values of
accomplished Wizards as you can see the
book of spells is no ordinary book
remember this is no words pictures point
but stories come to life in a way never
seen before discover many different
spells from the world of harry potter
read their history learn to cast them
and try them out digg use a variety of
puzzles and challenges
let's take a look at this dragon in the
bottom corner a previous Hogwarts
students as scribbled a warning message
avoid this drag Adair uses let's see
what I lighting to igniting the
occasional Christmas pudding
my word no of what's happened of course
you haven't learned any water spells yet
so you better find some other way to put
out that fire so the dragon escaped you
set eyes on the bottom we managed to put
the fire out and now we need to clean
off all that suit good as new now it
will take a look at another aspect of
this book including the chief warlock of
the Wiz enger mod till we can see it was
created as paper theater and this really
shows how we can create anything on the
book that July 1544 what you can see is
the discovery of the Wingardium Leviosa
the levitation charm we don't have time
to share this whole story with you today
but please pop by the media area our
boots have a look to see more you and
the book of spells is peppered with
these stories containing some
fascinating and often very funny
histories to the spells you're learning
into midair and the book can create a
safe environment for us to practice our
spells in and that's what's happening
here
this place is full of creatures these
paper pests can be a real nuisance so
make sure you get rid of them all with
your fire-making spell you're going to
use your fire flicking technique to burn
away all the paper creatures
creepy crawlies get rid of a yarmulke
this exercise
well done aim carefully see how many you
can get rid of solid work five pounds
points
ah butterflies remember this is just the
widget paper don't maybe catch you
trying to spell on the real thing nice
one work
for fire-making please try not to hit
classroom objects that sense it to
replace he certainly show them five
points
a fire-breathing
you've done points spectacular you earn
15 house points so well done mang
and as a reward we have a note from the
professor and a Wizarding photo of one
of our finest moments each chapter
teaches a significant value required to
become an accomplished wizard and these
are hidden in the conundrum past the
chapters tests to unlock it and discover
one of a series of beautiful poems each
revealing a unique and witty tale of a
hogwarts student who did not live up to
expectations that captures the
imagination in a way never seen before
and the first of many books to be
released for your wonder book library
this is truly an amazing experience
developed in collaboration with one of
the world's most inspiring authors JK
Rowling
thank you very much everyone
