welcome to tomorrow daily the best beef
taco in the known universe I'm Ashley
together and I'm Jeff ca√±ada
are you ready for today's headlines a
wired reporter got a chance to see
behind the curtain at magic leap and
what they found out has us excited
journalist Kevin Kelly got an exclusive
look at what's been happening at magic
leaves facility and was able to try on
the company's prototype device
he says the transition between using the
device and taking it off was seamless
and says it worked quote amazingly well
close-up unquote magic leap released the
video you're seeing now earlier this
morning with a disclaimer saying it's
all shot directly through their
prototype with no post-production added
which if that's true is pretty awesome
yeah this video is amazing this looks
like what we all want that new mixed
reality you know augmented reality
augmented reality experience to be I
think really in the next five to ten
years we are all gonna abandon our
screens and just have them around us all
the time in virtual space I thought
you're gonna say we're all just gonna
abandon reality because that's that's
really the plan for me I don't know
about anybody else
alright guys Rice University is
currently celebrating after discovering
how to make carbon nanotubes
self-assemble carbon nanotubes are sort
of like graphene in that there are lots
of experiments and testing happening
right now
but nobody's implemented the material
into real-world use cases on a large
scale so the team at Rice figured out a
Tesla coil system caused these carbon
nanotubes to cluster together and align
themselves sort of making a web of
particles on demand what exactly does
that mean well in the future this tech
could evolve into making conductive
wires silicon chips or even biomedical
devices it's beautiful to watch yes it
looks like when you're a kid and you had
like LED shavings or right you know but
I don't I don't think I kind of wrap my
head around why this is so revolutionary
so they were saying that with carbon
nanotubes or you
using this technology they would be able
to maybe make wires that you can conduct
electricity through on-demand so they
would be able to without having to
solder something they could literally
just give instructions via this Tesla
coil and have something come together
which is kind of amazing wild yeah I
think these are both pretty amazing
stories I feel like we have a lot to
talk about magically because there are
still so many questions it's so
secretive and I I just and that piece on
wired I highly recommend you read it it
is huge it's very long yeah but it's a
great read and very interesting so I'll
have to talk about the technology that
they were allowed to reveal wired was
allowed to reveal with magically so I
feel like that's the one we got time all
right you got me convinced I'm ready to
where can i preorder it my are no
delayed shipping yeah and don't ruin
shipping magically that's number one
brightly if you guys want to talk about
magic leap with us or any of the topics
we talked about on the show during the
week you can use the hashtag hay TV yeah
that's what you use on the old Twitter's
to have your comments be integrated into
our discussion on Thursday when we deep
dive we love that yes and we like your
comments or if they're awful and we want
to make fun of them put them on Thursday
so yeah but that being said we should
probably check out our photographer Nick
this photographer of the day is Andrew
who took this panorama on his iPhone
six-plus andrew writes in and says hi
there tomorrow daily Jeff Ashley and
team team being Logan I'm assuming I
give you full permission to use my photo
yeah he's a one-man band that Logan I
took this photo at Mount John University
Observatory here in lake tekapo we
sometimes joke about calling this place
take a poo New Zealand with an iPhone
six-plus can you do a New Zealand accent
and say techhobo
no I'm just assuming it sounds like it
sounds like take a pic I can only do one
word if that accent it's no and it's
because they say no with like twelve
syllables nay so good he also writes the
family along on my girlfriend were
touring around the South Island for
Christmas and was lucky enough to snap
this great panorama on a good sunny day
I love the show and funny enough I sent
this on the day or topic for the show is
about astronomy keep up the great work
and have a great one
also topic of photography right now is
landscapes monuments and points of entry
so I really love we got the they got the
observatory and there's no John
University Observatory it looks like
like a like a painting on the cover of a
sci-fi novel it looks like a beautiful
mural that you would see on well I mean
everywhere in New Zealand is obviously a
tourism ad yeah literally everywhere and
looks as middle-earth so I mean this
just looks like middle-earth after some
time has gone by and they built
observatories really great could be
really good I'm insulting all New
Zealand you really are I guess what all
of New Zealand just shut this show off
they're like no sorry New Zealand or
click I guess I get there's no remote
who's watching well so maybe some of you
watching on TV anyway sending your phone
geography tomorrow at cnet.com yes we
appreciate those photographers you got
to just make sure you tell us what
device you took it on give us how to
pronounce your pronounce your name
hopefully in the correct accent and make
sure you tell us what well I already
said the device you did what I leave out
how did you know give us permission to
use it on the show most important it's
not like I've never done this before
it's alright it's it's you getting a
vibe today I am very sad I want my shirt
and everything yeah I'm like come on
come on focus reality is so so basic
it's so lame and you guys can of course
find us on social media please share the
show if you enjoy it tomorrow daily comm
is the place to send people that is it
for us today will react tomorrow the
brand new Jacques in a weird science
packed meeting science fiction but until
then be good humans so you guys next
time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
