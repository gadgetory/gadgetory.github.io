iPad may look a lot like its predecessor
but it's what's on the inside that
really counts I'm Bill Detweiler head
technology editor at CNET's sister site
tech Republic and I'm going to crack
open the 2012 Apple iPad the 2012 iPads
design and construction are nearly
identical to that of the iPad 2
unfortunately this means the new tablets
case is just as difficult to open and
reseal as the previous models now to
begin
I used a hairdryer to loosen the
adhesive which holds the front panel in
place I then used a series of plastic
and metal tools to gently pry off the
panel next I removed the new Retina
display and disconnected the front panel
from the motherboard
I then detached the visible connectors
from the motherboard and removed the
motherboard and connected cellular board
at this point I decided against removing
any of the other components from the
case most are either held in place with
very strong adhesive or their connector
cables are forcing them loose could
damage them and I want to put this iPad
back together in working order so the
only thing left for me to do is remove
the EMI RFI shields from the motherboard
and with that my teardown was complete
so what did I learn from cracking open
to 2012 iPad well as I said earlier the
new tablet is nearly identical to the
iPad 2 in design and construction it's
the same width and height and thicker by
less than a millimeter this is nice as
it means many iPad 2 accessories such as
the smart cover will fit this year's
model on the inside Apple kept the
overall hardware layout the same but
upgraded many of the components the most
significant of which is the new Retina
display this nine point seven inch
screen offers a resolution of 2048 by
1536 at 264 pixels per inch this is four
times the iPad 2's total number of
pixels and according to Apple you won't
be able to see the pixels when viewing
the new iPad
at a distance of about 15 inches now to
run this new display Apple beefed up the
tablet's GPU and ram from the evidence
I've seen the 2012 iPads a 5x
system-on-a-chip has a 1 gigahertz
dual-core CPU and a 200 megahertz
quad-core GPU now in comparison the iPad
twos a5 system-on-a-chip has a one
gigahertz dual-core CPU and a dual core
GPU the 2012 iPad also has one gig of
ram compared to the iPad 2s 512 Meg
along with the upgraded graphics the new
iPad also has an improved 5 megapixel
iSight camera which can shoot 1080p
video and the unit supports AT&amp;amp;T and
Verizon 4G LTE networks on 4G models now
to power all these new features Apple
gave the 2012 iPad a battery with
significantly more capacity than the
previous version 43 watt hours compared
to 25 watt hours given the new tablets
beefier Hardware battery life though
remains about the same 10 hours under
normal use and nine hours on 4G on the
downside Apple didn't increase the iPad
storage capacity the 2012 model comes in
16 32 and 64 gig versions also the
tablet still has a single speaker
whereas most other 10-inch tablets have
2 lastly like the iPad 2 the new iPad is
frustratingly difficult to work on it
should come as no surprise but Apple
doesn't really want you mucking about
inside your iPad as far as pricing Wi-Fi
only iPads start at $4.99 and go up to
$6.99 Wi-Fi plus 4G models and 130 bucks
to the price while there's nothing
revolutionary about the new iPad it's
definitely a solid incremental update
and the Retina display puts every other
tablet to shame now to see more iPad
