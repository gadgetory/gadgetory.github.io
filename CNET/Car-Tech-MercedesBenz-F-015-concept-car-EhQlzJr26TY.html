one of the things that does is self
drive although that's not so much of a
brand new headline and automotive
anymore
what it's really all about is how it
will change the way we live with the car
once it does do the driving for us one
of the things you can see is a very
different shape and what they call a
volume instead of a traditional
three-box design like most sedans this
is one single volume kind of an arched
roof thing that allows them to push the
wheels way out to the ends very
dramatically and therefore in the middle
is a large passenger space space has
always been equated with luxury that's
why big homes are considered luxurious
and small ones aren't then once you get
inside you can take back your personal
time notice how the seating allows
people to be social and how the whole
car inside is upholstered with screens
whether it's that wide full width
dashboard or the fact that every door
and the rear transom have large screens
on them as well that can connect to your
existing mobile media create augmented
reality views of what's happening
outside the car or let you even change
how the car is operating from any seat
inside the vehicle the autonomy in this
car is not that groundbreaking we have a
number of self-driving prototype cars
out in the world but this car is
interesting in that its front and rear
are using graphics to communicate with
pedestrians cyclists and others out on
the road in a shared manner
acknowledging them so the car can tell
the cyclist that it knows the cyclist is
there even motioning a pedestrian to
walk across the street or tell cars
behind it that it's slowing or stopping
now this car has self-driving assumed as
part of its technology that's a given
but what I find interesting here is that
Mercedes is now asking the next question
once the car self drives a relatively
tactical question what happens next
what's the strategic change in how we
live with personal cars the f o 15 isn't
a vision of any particular future
production car Mercedes like many other
car makers is on track to put largely
self-driving cars into showrooms by 2025
on the outside when you see those cars
arrive and see how they integrate with
the rest of transportation as well as
the newfound time you'll recapture
you'll be seeing the f o 15
