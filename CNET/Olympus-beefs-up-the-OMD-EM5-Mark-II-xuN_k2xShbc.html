interchangeable-lens camera bandwagon
with the OMD a.m. 5 mark - let's take a
first look at some of the features to
this camera offers like a whole bunch of
the OMD cameras before it the m5 is
pretty much weatherproof it's splash
dust and freeze resistant and also now
Olympus is finally decided to put a
rotating LCD screen on the back rather
than the flip down screen from the
cameras of old it's also a touchscreen
as well and there's a whole bunch of
touch AF and touch other features inside
the camera is where things start to get
a bit different there is a totally
re-engineered 5 axis image stabilization
system which Olympus says gives you
around 5 shutter speed stops of
compensation and as a 16 megapixel Four
Thirds sensor in there as well also new
inside is an ultra-high resolution photo
taking mode the sensor is only 16
megapixels but when you put it in this
particular mode the sensor will shift
ever so slightly and take around eight
images then stitching them together in
camera to produce 140 megapixel image
there's Wi-Fi in the camera as well but
one of the biggest improvements comes
for video users now Olympus cameras have
all generally only had one frame rate
animals of selective orbit the m5 mark 2
gives you 24 25 30 50 and 60 P recording
and you can do that in either all.i or
IPB depending on your output and whether
or not you want to edit the footage
there is also a microphone input but
unfortunately no headphone monitoring if
you want to listen to your audio during
recording
and finally the brand new lens that you
can see on the front of the camera is
the 14 to 1 15 mil which was announced
and will be released at the same
that's the m5 month - it is equivalent
to a 28 to 300 mil in 35 mils system and
that's around ten point seven times
optical zone
I'm Lexus Avedis has seen it that's been
a first look at the brand new OMD m5
mark to four heaps more specifications
