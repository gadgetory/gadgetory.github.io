water resistant but how deep can these
phones really go so I have a brand new
iPhone 10 R and an iPhone 10 s now this
is the same iPhone tennis that we
actually use in our previous water test
and we tested it to the rate of depth of
two meters for 30 minutes this is not a
scientific test we're just doing this to
have some fun and see how far we can
take these to the extreme and don't try
this at home or maybe you should but it
will definitely void your warranty to
take the phones to new depths we are
using the Trident an underwater drone
from open ROV this film is going to
counteract the weight of these in the
water so that they don't sink or float
they're what we call neutrally buoyant
they made us a custom mount to hold the
two phones side by side in front of the
drones camera well to move through the
water we have these thrusters that are
basically really rugged and motors like
you'd see in like a quadcopter but they
can handle water these ones in the back
allow it to move forward and backward
and turn and the vertical one allows it
to move up and down the whole design is
made so it can be very hydrodynamic both
for moving horizontally in the water but
also for diving way down into great
depths
okay you ready for the first round we're
taking them to two meters the 10s should
be fine because of its ip68 rating but
the 10r is only rated for ip67 which is
1 meter for up to 30 minutes here we go
3 2 1 in the water let's stop it and
let's pull them out looks like
everything's still working yeah the
touchscreen is fully responsive that
looks good let's look around the back of
the cameras I can't see any evidence of
water ingress or any kind of foking at
all that looks good
so the tennis has already been dunked
and I can tell because the speaker
sounds a little bit distorted while the
10r sounds pretty clear they both
survived the first dunk so we're taking
them down to three meters all right now
we're drying them off after the second
round at 3 meters looking good they both
seem to be responsive on the screens
looking at the cameras I don't see any
evidence of water ingress is no fogging
either that I came to help these phones
are doing so well they've already made
it to 2 &amp;amp; 3 meters I think we should
just go straight to the next level and
go straight to 5 and dunk them for at
least 5 minutes maybe even more I
totally agree I'm really excited to see
what happens
okay let's take these guys off oh wow
hey both ah looking good that was five
and then six meters for around nineteen
minutes
looks like it's still responsive apps
are still opening everything looking as
expected back on the cameras yeah
no water damage I can see I definitely
have noticed the volume has reduced even
at the maximum volume cranked up on both
of the phones they're both still working
so it's time to take them down to the
bottom of the bay
the Trident heads down to the sea floor
about eight meters down around the
3-minute mark something is wrong on the
10r the I think water has started to
come into the SIM card tray I think this
is the beginning of the end for the 10
are the 10 ah died at 6 minutes 50
underwater at around seven point seven
to seven point nine meters the 10s on
the other hand is still going strong
alright let's pull it up all right here
comes now it's time to assess the damage
the 10r is very obviously not working
try and turn the power on nothing's
happening a lot of water just popped out
as soon as I pop the SIM card tray out
okay this well there's definitely water
damage I can see on the SIM card
actually looks a little bit like there
is some buckling here the screen and the
side doesn't sit as flush as it used to
and look what's happening if it tells it
upside down all the water that comes
pouring out of that SIM card tray so
let's take a look at the 10s now this
one we managed to submerge almost four
times the rated depth and it's looking
good
unbelievable like it's still going
everything seems to be functioning okay
the touchscreen is fine yep let's see
turn around and look at the camera can't
see any evidence of water damage there
looks pretty good pretty clear the real
test to see if the iPhone had sustained
any long-term water damage was to check
that liquid contact indicator inside the
phone but it hadn't activated which
meant that no water had made its way
inside the device and a week after the
water test the phone was still going
strong the speaker's just sounded a
little more muffled
thanks so much for watching make sure to
give this video a thumbs up and
subscribe and a big thanks to open ROV
for making this all happen
