bite and there is still more than enough
time to do our prediction show so think
of this as a little bonus extra for you
now really I don't want to make it seem
like 2016 will be the year of gloom and
doom for Apple but it's going to be a
down year
and this is why 2015 Apple released
about 5 all new products with the Apple
watch the new Apple TV the iPad pro
Apple music and you can even throw in
the ultra-thin 12-inch MacBook
I refuse to include that a smart battery
case in the mix now if you saw that list
at the beginning of 2015 you would have
been jumping off the walls but several
of these flagship products were kind of
half-baked and none of them could be
considered true hits the iPad pro did
nothing to change the iPads fortunes
we're not going to see five all-new
products in 2016 we're just going to see
iterations of products the iPhone is
Apple's bread-and-butter and an iPhone 7
with a new design will still be its
bread-and-butter but it won't have
nearly the same growth now the biggest
thing Apple can do in 2016 is to launch
their live TV service at a 30 to 40
dollar price that will give people a
real reason to cut the cord but I don't
think they can do it the problem is
still the same the TV networks are going
to prevent that from happening because
they don't need to do Apple any favors
that leads me to what could be the
sexiest product for Apple in 2016 it's
most likely the rumored MacBook Air 15
inch finally an ultra-thin laptop at 15
inches with a Retina display in these to
be a skylake machine but even at that it
won't feel like the most innovative
laptop out there or just a super slim
macbook pro now that leaves me to their
third product that Apple has high hopes
for the Apple watch 2 if the rumors are
right and it's slimmer and has Wi-Fi and
even a potential camera does it really
make it that much better
what happened to the apps this wasn't
the transformative device that Apple
hoped it would be it just didn't turn
out that way so those are the big three
products that have the best chance to
shine next year so yeah I'm setting my
expectations lower because when I add it
all up 2016 just doesn't look like a
stellar year for Apple it's more like
business as usual
but maybe maybe my friend from the
future could help with my spirits up Wow
did someone say future what hello it's
me it's me Nostradamus Wow hey what's up
Nostradamus I mean what took you so long
unlike you I was partying with the
gypsies in Cabo Wabo and why so down on
the Big Apple did that hair bleach
finally leak into your brain
well then ready set go
all right
I've been rights in with do you think
there will be a dongle for the iPhone 7
that plugs into the Lightning port so
you can charge your phone and listen to
music
always nice to work with a 12 year old
seriously everything points Apple
getting rid of the headphone jack and
once they do that it's a no-brainer that
we'll get some sort of an adapter it
would also make Apple the first company
that decided to take the jack off see
what I did there
nicer Tongass what advice do you have
for someone who wants to follow their
dreams dreams
who needs dreams if you find the magic
lamp just rub it three times you can
also purchase one at North or Tongass
comm for $29.99 shipping and handling
included challenge me challenge me hey
squish yo he knows for Tongass you have
this accent I can't really place what
exactly are you what does that even mean
I'm a little bit of this and a little
bit of that and uh-huh
look kid my mom's a genie my dad's a
genie I was born in the United States
and I was born a genie okay next
question on master Tongass my ex-wife
called him she wants to Netflix and
chill
should I do it uh-huh did you say
ex-wife go with Netflix forget the chill
master Tongass look like you've been
working out
are you on steroids Oh Lucy check this
out
that's what I'm talking about no no no
look it's called
eating right doing a little cardio and a
little midnight blue shots no no it is
that true question heinous or Tongass I
know you're a basketball fan and you
called it right last year but who's
gonna win the NBA title this year oh
he's coming to me yes yes the Cleveland
Cavaliers yes the Cavaliers will once
again lose to the Golden State Warriors
I like my Stefan curry like I like my
dinners</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
