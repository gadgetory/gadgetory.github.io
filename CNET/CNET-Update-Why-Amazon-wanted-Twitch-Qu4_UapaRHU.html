Bridget Carey and this is your scene
that update amazon announced that it is
spending nearly 1 billion dollars to buy
the game streaming service twitch it's
like a YouTube for people who just want
to share footage of themselves playing
video games it's often live streamed
with this acquisition amazon is taking
another step in becoming more like
Google Amazon now owns a video network
with a dedicated and engaged audience
just look at the numbers back in 2013
twitch reported that viewers watched
about an hour and 45 minutes of video on
the site per day it gets 55 million
visitors a month and more than half of
those users spend more than 20 hours a
week on twitch last year it exceeded a
total of six million videos broadcasted
and the number of videos uploaded keeps
growing now that the PlayStation 4 and
the Xbox one make it easy to send your
gameplay to twitch with the push of a
button if this whole trend of watching
others play video games seems odd well
there are a few reasons why it's popular
some watch for the competitive gaming
like tournaments some gamers are very
entertaining with commentary as they
play and some gamers just like to show
off maybe they'll play through a level
really fast and sometimes it's just
weird there's currently a popular stream
called fish place Street Fighter where a
fish tank is rigged with cameras so if a
fish swims to a certain spot it triggers
the character in the street fighter game
to jump or kick the audience is just
what Amazon is looking for the average
age is 21 and many users pay a
subscription to support their favorite
entertaining gamers I'm sure Amazon
hopes to get this demographic interested
in playing games or watching twitch on
the fire TV streaming box and the Amazon
fire phone switching gears to non gaming
videos instagram has a new app for
recording and sharing smooth time-lapse
videos even while you're walking or
driving it's called hyperlapse and
instagram has programmed it so even if
your hand isn't still it stabilizes the
footage so doesn't look too shaky you
said how fast you want the playback and
then share a 15 second clip to Instagram
if you want a video from a different
perspective how about strapping a GoPro
to your doggy GoPro is now selling a
sixty-dollar camera harness for dogs
called the GoPro fetch so you can
capture your best friends perspective
and cat lovers you don't have to feel
left out of the pet tech there's a GPS
tracking collar just for cats it's
called the Paul track the creators in
London are raising money on Kickstarter
and are planning to sell it in November
for 125 dollars with a ten-dollar
monthly tracking fee that your tech news
update you can always find more at cnet
