doubter you almost got the feeling they
kind of grudgingly brought out the
Touareg hybrid and that's where the
price was so ridiculous but now they've
got a hybrid car worth consideration
let's drive this 2013 Jetta Hybrid check
the tech and see if they've got the
religion now spot and Jetta Hybrid
obviously by the badge over here but on
the front you see it revives a little
more arrow the entire body has been
smoothed a little differently and if you
lift the trunk you know it's a hybrid
there's a big old coffin shape thing
back there that's the battery taking up
a pretty good amount of your trunk space
dead giveaway you get into a Jetta
Hybrid even if you don't know it you can
tell quickly by that gauge on the left
Noatak in these cars a big old evie
gauge don't be fooled by the numbers two
four six eight ten those are not rpm
ranges it's just some goofy thing they
put in there to show you how much power
you're tapping from the car it takes up
a lot of real estate it doesn't tell you
a whole lot it's a very traditional
boost or charge gauge the usual crunchy
8-bit monochrome thing in the middle
that hasn't changed in speedo and other
gauges are normal now we get to our head
unit in this car we've seen it many
times before the difference is when you
hit the car button on the hybrid you get
to a bunch of energy or battery state
displays energy flow shows you when
you're charging discharging using gas or
electric power zero emissions
interesting this will give you all the
time slices at which you are giving out
zero emissions from the tailpipe and
then you've got your usual displays of
fuel efficiency over time the key here
is to notice that number we've been
driving this car around for over 550
miles and we're pushing 40 mpg real
world and we are led footed reviewers
living in a hilly area called San
Francisco so that's actually a very
impressive number now the media sources
are here on this little phone dial thing
it's an interface I've never gotten in
love with in fact I hate it Bluetooth
streaming right there we do have a nice
display of metatags MDI refers to this
little portable media interface this
little pigtail here in the glove box
notice they don't yet have an Apple
lightning connector so I've got to use
my little adapter and
is where it starts to get a little bit
nerve-wracking I just know anything is
going to snap right off your aux jack is
right here next to these buttons SD card
slot you're never going to use that
radios on a separate menu if so many
cars do and you can go through your
Sirius satellite stations very quickly
it seeks and locks rapidly am/fm no HD
radio because we have a high trim Jetta
there is a navigation system here within
this postage stamp-sized screen we've
seen this one before it works fine but
again it's kind of burdened by this
overall interface on this car that I'm
not in love with now your one choice
gearbox in the hybrid is a 7-speed
dual-clutch transmission this is a very
interesting combination but it's the
only hybrid car yet that has a hybrid
powertrain and a dual clutch
transmission you normally find a CVT
maybe an automatic you've got your gate
over here for shifting as well no
paddles on the wheel are available
though there's also a sport mode back
here I got to have to VW they didn't get
lazy when they engineered this car
there's a ton of tech in this powertrain
1.4 liter the lady MIDI inline 4 with
direct injection and intercooled turbo
charging Ford calls that EcoBoost it's
the rage in the industry right now
coupled with a electric motor that
delivers 27 horsepower all combined 170
horse 184 foot-pounds of torque it's
this 3,300 pound car to 60 in about
eight six eight seven while delivering
an estimated forty five average mpg as
of our shoot today there's not an
official EPA number but compare that to
the much lower 34 combined on the TDI
Jetta which is no slouch so you got
about a third better mileage on this guy
that's a serious improvement and all
that efficient power goes out through
front-wheel drive only there's no
all-wheel drive in this Jetta up the
hybrid yet and you've also got that one
choice of transmission we saw in the
cabin it's a 7-speed dual-clutch
automated manual now let's get on the
roads even makes a difference or if VW
is just showing off what kooky
combinations they can cook up
when you're on open road it's actually
quite rewarding there's a lot of power a
lot of torque in particular on tap and
it comes on very consistently a nice big
fat flat torque curve as far as I can
detect the problem is when you're not on
the highway or an open country road and
you're kind of going on and off the
power you need to do the usual stop and
go this car is a disaster
it is so unresponsive in typical
nibbling traffic that I just wanted to
get out of it specifically the creep
function when you let off the brake and
the car rolls forward is weirdly
synthetic so first there's none and all
of a sudden the car starts to roll
forward like it's got the idle set at
2,000 the other big problem is applying
the brakes you seem to get one level of
braking and then as you hold the pedal
you get another and it's too much like
throwing up the anchor and the power
comes on in some weird stagey way like
the brakes do so it kind of equates to
the worst turbo lag on earth even though
that's not what's going on I think it's
electric motor lag and then combined
with that this is not the VW suspension
I'm used to
maybe it's the additional almost 300
pounds of the battery and electric gear
it's throwing off the balance I don't
know but this is not my favorite Jetta
by a long stretch and in the middle of
this mess of non-responsiveness it seems
like a waste to plant a 7-speed
dual-clutch automated gearbox in the
middle of all this hit the e mode button
and the car will stay all-electric as
long as it can a little over a mile and
up to about 45 miles an hour now pricing
a Jetta Hybrid is a little annoying to
me the bass car is actually the SE at 27
785 delivered now you got to inch your
way into basic tech by buying chunky
packages you go to SEL for example for
another twenty three hundred dollars
then they throw you a bone in the form
of navigation and a bunch of other
niceties then another eighteen hundred
dollars get you to SEL premium which is
where you got to go to get a backup
camera in other words you got to go
whole hog to get this car done seen that
style just get a Jetta Hybrid SEL
premium that includes everything a bunch
of tech you definitely need
and probably some filigree you don't but
that's how they package it 31 975 hora
