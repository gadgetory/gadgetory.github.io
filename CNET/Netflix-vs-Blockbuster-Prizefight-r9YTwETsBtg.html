I'm Brian Tom and which changes the
Netflix is pricing people are looking
for alternatives so we're bringing you a
Throwdown showdown with two discs in
streaming subscription services it's a
prize five punch-out Netflix and
blockbuster our judges for this fight
are senior editor John Game of Thrones
Falcone executive editor David the
bad-boy car annoy and myself ring-a-ling
and being Tom now we'll take all three
judges blind scores and average them out
to the nearest tenth each round the
final prize five score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system these two services aren't
exactly alike so we'll help break it
down for you but hold on to your butt's
round one is all about the distance
fishing plan Netflix has the largest
physical disk collection with over
100,000 TV shows and movie titles with a
plan that starts at $7.99 now if you
want blu-rays you'll pay two more bucks
a month blockbusters this plan brings
its library of over ninety five thousand
movies and TV shows but you'll also be
able to rent video games from a
collection of more than three thousand
and there's no additional cost for
blu-rays with plans starting at $9.99
throw in the fact that blockbuster gets
many of its new releases 28 days before
Netflix and its blockbuster that takes
round one with a perfect 5 and Netflix
gets a 3.7 next round of streaming
subscription plans neither company has
released specific numbers for their
streaming collections but Netflix is
$7.99 streaming plan is packed with
older movies and it shines when it comes
to catching up with TV series from the
past but when you're done with that
what's left its biggest drawback is its
weak library of new and current content
that we all care about
now blockbuster doesn't offer a monthly
premium plan instead it's an on-demand
service with little to no TV show
content where you can rent new movies
for 399 a pop or purchase them as well
it's advantages that it still brings new
titles 28 days before Netflix but the
cost will add up fast
Netflix takes round two
seven and blockbuster gets a 2.7 dr.
averaging two rounds blockbuster leads
by two ten to the point round three is
the vise support Netflix is supported on
nearly every major connected device from
phones to game consoles to TVs and add
it all up and it's over 200 pieces of
hardware it really feels like it's on
every device blockbuster support is
growing you can access it on laptops
some phones and more but it's still way
behind and when 50% of Netflix viewing
is done on game consoles you probably
want to get in on that action
Netflix takes this round with a perfect
5 and blockbuster gets a 3 next round is
overall convenience Netflix brings a
clean user interface across all its
digital devices that feels familiar and
getting people to trust and mainly diss
because of its ease and reliability was
pretty much created by Netflix now
blockbusters web interface needs a
little streamlining but it's not
horrible it's flexible dissed by male
program is solid but the differentiator
here is the ability to walk into a
physical Blockbuster store and swap out
your rentals now that sounds great if
you're close to one but there aren't
that many left netflix takes another
round with a four and block what we get
at 2.7 dr. averaging four rounds the
tables have turned and Netflix now leave
7/10 of a point the final round that
will decide it all is combined value
things have cooled to a simmer after a
hot boiling period with the new price
changes that split Netflix is streaming
and dis rental plans but let's do the
math even after the split if you add up
both the disk plant and the streaming
plant at $7.99 each you're spending just
under $16 a month now let's look at the
blockbuster plant it starts at $9.99 for
dis rentals and yes that includes
blu-ray and games but if you watch just
two on-demand movies in a month you're
already at $17 now these plans come down
to what kind of content you care about
but Netflix looks like the more
compelling of the two and it takes the
final round with a 4.3 and blockbuster
gets a 3 let's average out all 5 rounds
and enterprise fight where blockbuster
took the lead after two rounds Netflix
fought back and takes this prize fight
for point one two three point three and
is your prize fight winner
we know these services aren't exactly
alike and even though Netflix is king of
the Ring your best bet might be getting
the combination of Netflix is streaming
for $7.99 and blockbusters this rental
plan for $9.99 where you'll really get
the best of both worlds
i'm brian tom thanks for watching catch
you guys next time
on another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
