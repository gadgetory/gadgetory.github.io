and our first annual women in tech panel
which is also open to men I am Hollywood
and I will be your moderator for the
panel I'm looking forward to an amazing
fascinating exciting conversation today
we have an incredible panel of guests
and we've tried to put together a
special introduction to give them really
there do so let's have a look Marissa
Meyer started at Google in 1999 she was
the company's 20th employee and its
first woman engineer these days she's
running location and local services and
in her time at Google she's been
responsible for the look and feel of
Google News gmail google images even
Google search itself she's one of the
most powerful women in Silicon Valley
and she's a big fan of bejeweled blitz
Padma Sri Warrior is the CTO of cisco
systems and she was CTO of Motorola
before that she joined Motorola as one
of very few women in its Arizona
facility and during her time as CTO
motorola won the 2004 US National Medal
of Technology she's been widely
recognized for her creativity influence
and her promotion of science and
technology education especially for
women her role at Cisco is to evangelize
what is possible and she has a team of
ten thousand engineers behind her as she
rides into battle
katarina fake is co-founder of Flickr
and a highly successful serial
entrepreneur her most recent startup
hunch was just purchased by ebay for
reported 80 million dollars at just 37
years old she was included on time
magazine's list of the world's 100 most
influential people she is a founder
partner at the founder collective
venture capital fund she sits on the
board of directors of Creative Commons
she's chairman of the board of Etsy and
she really loves duct tape and whether
we're all fascinated by the weather
thing we're going to ask about that
later joining for us a pot roast region
Katarina on stage is cnet reviews editor
in chief Lindsay Turrentine next year
she's going to have her own video
lindsay has been at cnet for 12 years
she's seen just about every phase of
consumer electronics development by
which I mean she has been through all
the pink gadgets and so if I as a matter
of fact so that that may come up let's
get right to it because I know that
you're here to hear from our amazing
panel you know I was reading an article
there was an article that came out of
November of 2011 in San Francisco
magazine and it was called who's the
next female Mark Zuckerberg and it
really got me thinking about sort of the
state of the industry there seems to be
a lot of attention on this question of
women in tech lately and so I just
wanted to ask the panel generally where
do you think we'll start with your Padma
where do you think we are in the
industry in terms of women in tech right
now you know I think we've come a long
way actually feel pretty good about
where women are in technology I think if
you kind of look at two of the largest
tech companies today IBM and HP they
have women CEOs and a lot of amazing
founders or creating technology
companies that have made a lot of
difference in our lives and so I mean
it's not that progress is ever you know
Don right I mean there's more we can do
and we should do to get more women
actually I was thinking as I was walking
the CES fleurs am I going to be on the
panel just to see some women I would
like to see more women and out out in
on the floor as well and I think that is
that is more we can do but I do feel
like in the last 10 years we've made a
lot of progress that magazine article
that you mentioned San Francisco
magazine ran an article about all of the
new startup founders in the valley which
was a wonderful thing to see there were
dozens and dozens of companies companies
and I hadn't heard of me and it was it
was a think that was a landmark magazine
article for the industry it just showed
all of the all of the different
businesses that are out there some of
them are some of them are highly
technical companies that are coming out
of some of them are social media some of
them are very consumer oriented but it
was it was it was a big variety of
companies it was founders of all
different ages levels of experience and
I was really happy to see that it made
me feel a lot better yeah actually yeah
whole thing we're doing fine yeah yeah I
can't agree more i think it's just a
great time to be a woman in technology
via the founder being an executive i
think it's incredibly exciting time and
technology in general especially with
the rise of mobile and i just think that
it's a really fast moving industry but i
think that's something that makes it
possible for women to move fast catch up
now you can actually come into computer
science late like I didn't really get
into computers and technology until I
was in college but you know because it
is a fast-moving industry it's an easy
place for you to pick things up so that
said the Arctic will also had a lot of
very sobering statistics as well it said
things such as there are only I think
4.3 of venture-backed companies are led
by women now there's only less than
seven percent of women our venture
partners and venture capital firms and
there's there's just as a long way for
us to go still in the industry I mean
yes we should always be celebrating our
successes but we should never rest on
our laurels there's still a long long
way to go and I think that panels such
as this one are great at I think it's
really important for women to know that
there are women
I know that this is a career choice know
that this is a path that you can follow
and you know and then it's doable right
absolutely I have a little bit of a
media perspective and I think that one
of the difficulties for women is that
when we put ourselves out there in the
media representing technology the
response can be wildly varied there are
a lot of and there are women in media
and in the technology media like Molly
who have really a lot of respect and
huge following but i but i find it over
and over and over again we publish about
the industry about technology and we get
public response it says we really wildly
sexist comments and you know comments
about appearance comments about whether
or not we have any authority to say
anything about technology and so I think
there are a lot of successful women in
business but on the way up you read
there are a lot of barriers and there's
a lot of questioning that happens on a
at the public level that we really need
to work on because i think if we
represent then we keep doing this and we
keep having this conversation that'll
save i hope so i mean i think we are
very lucky obviously none of us are
disenfranchised women in the technology
industry we are all smart successful you
know we've gotten to a certain level and
we're able to have this conversation
with other smart successful women but
you're right this I think represents a
big chunk of the women who were at CES
there is never aligned for the ladies
room at the Consumer Electronics Show
and we asked ourselves going into this
panel whether whether one of our
questions was do there need to be more
women at the Consumer Electronics Show
and what what would change about the
industry if we had more women at all
phases of consumer electronics and
product development in general and by
women you don't mean
if I when I did not mean booth babes
yeah and how much longer do we have to
endure yeah I think one of the things
that's happening in in the in the
consumer industry but broadly in the
technology industry which says product
development and product design itself is
changing right you know where is it
previously when I started in the
industry 20 years ago it was very
bifurcated in the sense there was
engineering that was done then there was
product development that was done and
then there was user experience user
design and ease of use and you know how
people and how people use the technology
was a completely different feel and
actually didn't exist about even a
decade ago that's all changing very
rapidly if you kind of look at how any
of us develop technology develop
products and what it takes to bring a
successful product to market you really
have to have skill sets that combine all
this it's not just your engineering it's
not just hardware it's not just software
its user design user experience we
actually have sociologists now that
studying our products are used
especially video and what video means
and how we translate I think this is an
opportunity for women who and I'm
generalizing here and I think I have a
better skill at integrating a lot of
these different domains I think women
are better at integrating across the
domains and I think that's the skill
that will be needed going forward in the
future it's a great opportunity if you
kind of look at it from that perspective
I think there is a show like a consumer
electronics show is absolutely a place
where you would like to see more women
not only just actually designing
products actually even women that are
consuming these products and what it
means do you feel like women are better
evangelist for tech products I feel like
there are certain products that women
can very quickly generate excitement
about in the marketplace and of course
again general I think it's really hard
to have this conversation without
generalizing I kind of started on that
point in some way with yeah you know I
think we're going to adapt to technology
in a different way you know I think it's
early adoption but we also look at
different aspects of technology
gee I think then men do right you know
when I look at a product I look at both
the artistic view of the product as well
as the engineering view of it breaking
an older man engineer and I'm trained as
an engineer I think have a different
bent in how I v.v products and how I
review milestones and so forth then my
male counterparts and I think that I
don't know it's evangelism but we adapt
to technology in a different way I think
if you have a product that you want to
be used by a diverse user group it
really helps to actually have that
diversity represented in the product
design so one idea that I've been
excited about for a while but I just saw
realized when I walked on the floor is
this is amazing three dimensional
cameras that are available now and
someone said to me a few months ago you
know probably someone's going to figure
out how to make a three-dimensional body
you know a three-dimensional model of a
body I figure out how to try on clothes
on your television screen and it's here
it's actually like 200 yards that way
it's called bodymetrix and I was just
talking about that idea I know it's like
your field trip but it's but it's called
bodymetrix it uses the primeSense
technology and it's really amazing but
just yesterday I was talking with
someone about this concept and it turns
out men's clothes and women's clothes
are totally different guys were like why
would you need three millimeter accuracy
you know you just tell them the
measurement of the neck length of the
arm you get a shirt is perfect and I was
like well for women like that it's got
to fit in the ways to counterfeit here
yeah I was like bidding a woman is
completely different than fitting a man
I can imagine I didn't actually get a
chance to top and ask i can imagine the
bodymetrix team hopefully has women on
that team or at least as studying them
really carefully yeah absolutely women
are also very a big social media
participants and if you look at the way
that media is spread around and how
people learn about it from one another
it's often you see these communities
that will will suddenly burst on the
scene
that will flourish suddenly I'm work
with etsy and se is an example of that
etsy etsy was was a company that was
started by a bunch of guys young guys
they're in their 20s and it was largely
a company that appeal to women it was
mostly handmade goods and you look at
something like for example like that
we're like Pinterest and women are
incredibly good at spreading the word
and telling each other about these
things sort of the sort of word-of-mouth
form of marketing is extremely effective
with women's products and I think that
that is very effective in some of the
social software and media stories that
you see out there that are directed
towards women such as such as such as
Pinterest and they really have an
amazing growth pattern I actually wonder
if the the sort of the current hot
technology trends don't lend themselves
perfectly to getting women more involved
in tech and interested in right in the
past we've faced somewhat of an interest
barrier in terms of technology but you
can talk to any woman on the street
about using your cell phone and about
using social to communicate and to
consume products and is that sort of is
that serendipity do you think that's
just going to help or is it or is it
just the you know it's sort of the tidal
wave of women getting as technology just
becomes part of life yeah I think that's
what i was talking earlier i think more
and more technologies become
multidisciplinary right i think it is
it's a combination of hard hardcore
engineering with soft design and
aesthetic appearance and artistic
ability than it is multidisciplinary i'm
even engineering itself is becoming
multi-disciplinary and i think this is
an area where we excel you know I think
the ability to move from one domain to
another somewhat comes naturally to them
and I think that is an opportunity for
us to really get into these fields which
are traditionally more logic and you
know analytics and hard hard domains and
I
that itself is changing so as domains
change in the discipline becomes
multiple disciplines coming together
it's also marketing now right when
you're building technology really are
understanding or trying to understand
how it's going to be used as you're
designing which was not the case 20
years ago or 10 years ago and I think
this is an opportunity for us to really
bring diverse viewpoints into the
product and in fact that's another
question specifically that I think is
really relevant to consumer electronics
show and the marketers hear how the
first part i guess is how do you market
to women the second part of the question
is do you need to market to women
separately if it's not for example a
very female-focused product i personally
think making a good product is the best
way to market to women and I think what
why we're seeing more excitement about
consumer technology from women now or
maybe I'm just more excited but is that
consumer technology is increasingly
about communication and ten years ago it
was about consumption which is consuming
media consuming television or maybe
creating something at a single point but
not sharing that so broadly yeah I don't
know if you specifically i agree i don't
know if you specifically target a
consumer product or technology to women
i think it is if it's a great product
women automatically will consume it and
I think as I think Karina was saying I
think we're better at vitally sharing
information i think it's just something
we do and i think that in a way adds to
both positive and negative right if a
product's not good then I think it gives
you that feedback as a product
manufacturer or designer quicker if
you're if you're marketing to that
population or that segment of the
population but if you don't and you miss
that out you don't get that
feedbacks I think that's a benefit of
perhaps making sure you're including
women in the segment segment that you're
targeting with the products right unlike
my esteemed colleagues on the panel I I
do I did not I was never a programmer I
was never an engineer I did not study CS
and my background is really in is in
design and I came from a kind of web
design and development background I
taught myself a little bit of code I was
never a very good coder in fact after
after a certain amount of time people
say like they look at my code they say
please no stay out of here and and I
think you know the influence of Apple
cannot be underestimated in in the rise
of the product designer I really think
product design you know with all of the
applicata so that you know we know all
of us have in our pockets and and on our
desktops all of them are very design
oriented and so the role of women in
terms of you know the designers and the
sort of the role of the product designer
has sort of risen within the company so
it's no longer as much hardtack and the
you know I think the industry has
evolved in that direction in a very
positive direction for products under i
consider myself and hope to aspire to be
a product designer and designing things
that people love that people need that
people want that people will use and
that if you if you are able to hit that
then you know men women doesn't matter
you could be you know you it doesn't
really matter it has this universal
appeal absolutely one of the other
interesting points in the San Francisco
magazine article was that when it came
to women in sports and women in soccer
and particularly title nine was
introduced in 1972 but women didn't get
very excited about soccer until 1999
with the women's Olympic team that it
takes heroes in some cases do you how
are you on the panel how do you feel
about taking that mantle in some cases
you do how do you think you be a hero to
women who are interested in technology
and do you ever see it as a burden
I am actually very passionate about it i
don't know if i see myself as a hero
maybe some of these guys are my heroes
but i think it's so you should sign in
your room is my dear because it is value
in sharing your experiences and that is
something i really believe it and I
think I often talk to people i canna
share my experiences and it's not that
anybody can translate your experience to
theirs and it's not something you can
extrapolate and say okay this work this
didn't work for me therefore it may or
may not work for you but it's actually
just relating a story of this is how I
dealt with the situation and I think
there's value in that and sometimes you
know it it's also makes you vulnerable
when you share your story and you're
talking to people about when I was
really depressed when this happened know
and somebody criticized me I felt shitty
about this and then you know I had to go
you know absorb that internalize that
and come back the next day to work to be
better it does make you vulnerable as a
leader but I think in a way it there's a
lot of benefit in sharing that
experiences with other women who may be
in that point in that stage in their
career where their doubting whether they
can get to the next level or not and one
thing that in the San Francisco magazine
article that stood out for me when I
read it was there was a pool quote that
said it's very difficult for a 25 year
old woman to call up a 45 year old man
and invite him out for a beer and say
you know I would love to get some advice
on this it's just there's some kind of
social barrier about that happening and
so I think it's important as there are
more and more women in technology to be
available for those kinds of questions
like you know to answer questions to to
read their blogs and sort of share that
experience because there are a lot of
barriers around around younger women and
you know industry you know kind of
industry mentors who are
email it's a slightly awkward social
situation I agree with that I don't
think it's about being heroes I think
it's about being a resource for people
who are getting started and also showing
that there's not a stereotype one of the
salaat of the studies show that women
hesitate to get in technology or
computer science because they think
there's a certain culture right you know
that you know you you know can't dress
night you stay up all night you you know
eat espresso you know means covered you
where Sean 1 so you know I know and I
think it's more about seeing there's all
kinds of different women who can do this
you can wear ruffles right you can be a
jock and you can still be a great
computer scientist or a great
technologist or a great product designer
and by seeing many different people who
can all do it on their own terms you
realize that you can do it on your own
terms that you don't need to conform to
that stereotype into that culture that
you can bring what you have to offer the
table yeah I'm thinking about you know
the 80s era of women in business was
there was a lot of I just remembered all
those all those horrible suits that all
girls are bad we are they love you and I
I they're back to let's all boycott them
together and there's all this research
that was done that women women would
wear really high heels and lower their
voices as they were speaking in sort of
business situations and in many ways
sort of model themselves around the
poster in which they were trying to fit
in and I think more and more you can
just sort you can be yourself you know
we're overdressed very differently I bet
on my cow maybe she's gone on Russell
we're all really kind of individuals and
we have our personalities not we're
conforming to the 80s you know Sigourney
Weaver shoulder pads suit their business
right and is it an acknowledgement maybe
that I think sometimes even now and very
often right when you read about how to
get ahead you still do sometimes see
articles that say that women have to be
more aggressive and that you have to
make sure that your voice is being heard
and I that sometimes to meet creates
this sort of gray area in the
conversation where I think well we don't
have testosterone right so it might not
be in our natures to be aggressive and
do we have to act like men to get there
is it really about having
those mentors and if you could put women
in some key areas in each of your
industries or business what do you think
they would be if you just make sure
there was a woman and you know a few
spots throughout the industry I'll be
honest I think that what we're really
playing is a numbers game right now is a
great time do you want to attack but
there's not enough women intact right
but I worry that a lot of times the
conversation gets really focused on what
percentage of the pie is women right and
the truth is the pie isn't big enough
right we're not producing enough
computer scientist we're not producing
enough product designers we need a lot
more people to keep up with all of these
gadgets all of this technology all these
possibilities the jobs of the future we
really need a lot more people interested
in mobile technology in computers right
we need a lot more people and if we grow
that number the number of women will by
its very nature go up right the
statistics are things like for the
advanced placement exam 200,000 students
a year take cut the calculus exam only
14,000 take the computer science exam so
seven percent of kids who think they're
good at math go take both the math exam
and the computer science exam but if you
talk to Google engineers they'd actually
done studies only two percent of Google
engineers weren't exposed to computer
science in high school which means if
you graduate from high school and you
haven't been exposed to computer science
the odds that you're going to end up
being an engineer somewhere are
incredibly low so we really just need to
get that number up right imagine if we
had 200,000 or 500,000 students
graduating from high school every year
that we're taking computer science as
well as calculus as opposed to just
seven percent so are we setting
ourselves back even farther by falling
behind in science and technology
education across the board I think that
that is probably true at a macro level
but back to your question about what do
we need to do specifically to get women
into the tech industry whether
it's as engineers or marketeers or
whatever right and i would say we need
to kind of have successful role models
at every level and I don't mean just at
the executive level or in a high level
in the organization if you kind of look
at you know Cisco for example one of the
things we find it a lot of him and enter
the workforce but we lose them after
they work for three four years or five
years and I think it is that point where
they're trying to decide do they want to
have a career at all it doesn't matter
whether it in tech or not or do they
want to give up the courier to to raise
a family and I think that's so that
seems to be a point of decision for
women and I think it is at that critical
juncture that they need to see that you
can do both and you know and it isn't
just one or the other and that's why
don't like the word balance at all
because to me it just seems like you're
always striving for perfection you know
you can never be perfected everything I
think it is really at that point in
telling the stories about how did I
raise is you know my child that I was
working through what challenges did I
face how did I have to integrate all
these things that's important and I
think that's important in addition to
what Marissa is saying how do you just
keep women in the technology workforce
and making sure that they're
contributing at whatever level that is
very critical so I would say we should
we should have role models both men and
women that talk to people share because
every parent has this challenge right I
think as parents when you're thinking
about you I want to become a parent or
do I want to just strictly focus on the
career it's important for people to know
you can have both you don't really need
to compromise one
idea that argues for role models for
younger women both male and female yeah
and I know that Sheryl Sandberg has
talked a lot about how choosing not to
get too soft here but choosing it the
right partner is one of the best choices
you can make for your career and I think
you know I have a son and a daughter and
I it's really important really important
for me to model for my son that I can do
both of these things and that he gets to
see a partnership at work at home and
that that model extends to our children
and also maybe to our high schools and I
really appreciate the comment about
getting people involved in engineering
at the high school level because I
suspect that not many high schools have
computer science programs at all and
certainly in them I doubt there are many
female computer science high school
teachers yes that's probably true what
does Sheryl Sandberg kind of quote that
you mentioned earlier Lindsay it was
from her famous now famous TED talk
where she was she was saying and I think
that the crucial thing that she said was
don't don't leave before you leave and
that women who were planning on having a
family she found sometimes they would
they would not take that promotion they
would you know not move for their job
they would not be as assertive and
aggressive in pursuing their career path
anticipating that they were going to be
going on maternity leave and starting a
family and that that being a kind of a
crucial point at crucial juncture and
any young woman's life and she's sort of
studying her career path and I read
another article which was which was
really which is which influenced me a
great deal and this was years ago when I
was younger and it was an interview with
a elder stateswoman in technology and
she said that she had always sits at how
is it possible that you raised four
children by herself her husband had died
when the children were very small and
she was a single mother and so in
addition to being a high
executive she was also single-handedly
raising four children so she she said I
had always taken the promotion i had
always striven for more I had always
taken you know the sort of the the path
that led me to a greater level of
achievement and success and status
within the industry because what ended
up happening is once i was at that level
i was significantly more free with my
time I was an executive I could I could
start work at I could start work at 4am
i could leave it three i had more more
flexibility in terms of making my own
schedule because i was i was the person
in charge and I could make these
determinations and that that actually
influenced me a great deal i thought
that was a very significant thing that
instead of you know sort of setting your
sights lower you set your sights higher
and that was a very it was a very
influential article for me that's very
powerful i love that that distracted me
now i just want to go find it and read
it uh up work-life balance can you do
you have stories that you can share with
us you know we've talked a lot about the
stories and I think that that is
obviously hugely influential a thawed
Ian's would like to hear it how how do
you accomplish it is it by setting your
own schedules yeah how do you ask for
help there for me I know I should have
shared this story before and so kind of
far you know read what I write about the
integration you probably met seen this
before I always tell the story of when
when I had my son and he was really
small I was running a factory a
semiconductor factory and I had to
travel a lot and I was managing a
multiple shift operation so i would i
would be at work at all odd hours and
one of the things that I realized is
it's actually not the decisions I made
that caused stress but it was actually
the guilt associated with whatever
decision I made that caused me stress
you know if my
son was sick and I stayed home and I
wasn't working I felt guilty I was a
network and if I was working then i felt
guilty I wasn't at home and if I I would
bring my work home and stay with him and
work from home then i felt guilty i
wasn't looking like a supermodel because
i wasn't at the gym working out and so I
soon realized it actually doesn't matter
what decision you make because you make
whatever decision based on what is best
that day you know maybe one customer
meeting you miss because your kid is
sick it's okay it's not the end of the
world there's somebody else I can take
that meeting and the customer will still
be there and they'll understand and same
thing if you leave your son that day
care even though he's sick and you had
to be at work it's okay it's not the end
of the world and he'll still love you
because he or his mom and I think I
learned not to be guilty about the
decisions that I was making I was a big
learning for me and the other thing I
would say is actually making your kids
part of you your life right you know you
work as part of my work is part of my
life and actually said this to one of my
bosses once and they said well how do
you balance your work and your life i
said earlier one life you knowing that i
have my word and my battery no i don't
have two lives and I realize this
because I would travel a lot and
whenever I was going on a business trip
I'd be packing and my son at the time
was like two and a half or something and
he'd start crying to see for him the
symbol of me bringing the suitcase was
mom would be gone and it caused a lot of
depression and then I would cry and then
my husband would go running because he
didn't want to see us both crying he'd
be out of the house and there was a very
dysfunctional preparation for a business
trip and then I discovered this game
back then called where in the world is
Carmen Sandiego and I started playing
this with him and you know I was sort of
where in the world is mom going to be
and you know we would go and search that
country and learn
that country so it's actually turning a
painful experience into something that's
fun I think that was the other learning
for me is don't try to shut your family
out of your work try to include them and
I think that makes it easier and also
talk about what goes on at work we have
research so my my daughter was was very
jealous of me going to meetings so she
knew that reason whenever I was going to
be meeting it was something that
excluded her right so she would she
started doing these I'm sorry it's going
to be a little bit cute so she started
doing these sort of meetings with her
stuffed animals and things and as I said
what do you guys talk about in your
meetings and she says balloons and
elephants and so I decided what we would
do is we would we would start having our
own meetings and we would kind of
include her and this feeling of being
involved in work and so we started
having family meetings we have them
every friday morning at 8am and we sit
around the breakfast table and we have a
family meeting we talk about what was
good what was bad we talk about our work
we very specifically talked about our
work with each other and how our meat
went and then you know what we want to
learn in the coming week and so me now
kind of meeting as a kind of I feels
Roger that gets meetings now maybe
actually I mean the really big thing
about the meeting really is the is
having a notepad and a really sharp
pencil and I don't know that's not a
good ended up renting it very well it
sort of including members okay my
philosophy and advice isn't gender
specific it's find your rhythm when you
look at really successful people you
often hear stories of people who just
worked 80 hundred hour weeks for decades
on end like a look at people like
Winston Churchill or Einstein right like
a baby and you're like how did they do
that but I really think that you know a
lot of you think about burnout being
related to not getting eight hours of
sleep a night or not having time with
the family or not getting three meals a
day and I don't think has anything to do
with those things does for some people
but it really is is what causes resent
and what causes burnout is resentment is
that feeling of I worked 80 hours last
week and I
and I but had to blow off my friends or
you know I worked 100 hours last week
and I missed the soccer game right and
then that feeling of resentment kind of
builds on you and makes you feel like
well i won't i won't do that this week
and so i think that one of the exercise
I've done with my team and for myself is
what is it that you need in order to not
be resentful and I've done this exercise
a few times there was a young guy in my
team where I was where he was working
really hard and I said you know take a
month really think about while you're
working what is it that you need in
order to not be resentful and it came
back to me a month later and you said
Tuesday night dinners surely you just
graduate from school and the whole
friendship group would kind of do this
pot luck on Tuesday nights and he
sounded like somebody who's a nativity
said well no too late dinner as we all
do this potluck and if I have to if I
had to you know skip it when it says
someone else's house and not see them or
even worse by have to cancel it when is
that my house because something comes up
on Tuesday night I'm just resentful the
whole rest of me I just feel like you
know I did all this work and I couldn't
even get to Tuesday night dinner I said
okay then let's just never miss another
Tuesday night dinner now it was my job
to help make sure that doesn't happen I
had Katie a soccer mom who was really
worried about her her team on google
finance was in bangalore she kept doing
video conference calls at one in the
morning i was like haiti you've got
three kids two twin like two of them are
twins like you know I'm really worried
all these 1am conference calls she's on
buddy Magnus oh don't worry about the
ham conference calls they really don't
bother me she's like what does bother me
is missing the soccer game or being ten
minutes late for the recital and walking
in in the middle and I said okay well
then my job is to make sure that you
never missed something for your kids and
it was actually really interesting to go
through that process because 30 days
when we be sitting there in that meeting
at like three 35 and I know that Katie
had to be out of there for that four
o'clock game and he would be like well
okay we get up to go and be like oh just
just five more minutes just fine we're
almost there like you know it's just
this just finished lesser power through
and I do have to say no Katie's
to go like we can get this back together
again tomorrow and I think that really
matters and I think it also changes for
people throughout their life I don't
have kids right now for me it's travel
right once ever you say four months six
months I like to go somewhere I've never
been and also have the benefit of being
out of the office for an entire week
missing every standing meeting once
figured you know my team understands I'd
like you know the world doesn't end when
I'm not there I understand the world
doesn't end when I'm not there and it's
just really very it doesn't provides a
lot of sanity and I think that that will
change over time but it's really about
thinking about what is it that you need
so you don't hit that resentful point
for a lot of people that is a good
night's sleep no time with the family a
few good meals a day but you know
sometimes it's something that's just
really personal and really basic and
it's about really tapping into that beer
I think that's a great point and I
talked about this a lot you know for me
it's integration and I think of it as
like four things like you know yourself
and I think what you're saying about how
you how do you do things that actually
energize you that is important yourself
your work your family and your community
and the community can be your your
church for some people for some people
it's their dance or it's their friends
or whatever it is i think if we over
rotate and don't spend right and i don't
think we can we are we can have a goal
that says every week I'm going to spend
equal number of hours on each of those
squadrons and that's never going to
happen but if you overrated where you're
not spending any time at all in one of
those any one of those four then I think
that resentment happens and that's very
true I mean if you're just doing family
and work and you're not doing anything
that interests you then also that that
guilt and resentment starts to build out
so I think that's just something to be
aware off in the back of your head other
thing Marissa you raise them a really
important point which is that you're
saying that you as a manager are aware
of those issues in your workplace and
that seems to be something you know how
do we sort of bubble up a lot of times
we're feeling those resentments but we
don't ask our managers because maybe
it's some of this I feel like is a
conversation about being a human in the
world you know I everybody I think let's
resentment bubble up and they don't ask
what they say about it it's a pill that
you take and you hope the other person
will die
you know you let it bubble up and you're
afraid to ask your manager because
you're afraid that you won't get that
support how do we sort of
institutionalize support for not
balanced but the things that your
employees need in order to keep
themselves saying and keep doing a good
job I think it is a conversation I think
you know usually when somebody is
resentful of something you know to sit
in your team right because they're not
fully there and I think it does affect
and you notice it and as a manager you
can choose to either pro or you know in
a nice way or ignore it right you know I
mean by the Secretary's Lee said okay
fine moment it's just take five minutes
to finish that and that would be the
natural thing that a lot of us would do
but and she didn't do that and I think
it's just kind of noticing that in
keeping that in front it's important
because ultimately you're able to get
more from that person can I think what
that creates is in return a loyalty you
know I think in the relationship there's
a lot royalty now because as a manager
you understood that and you know Katie
now feels like no medicines more
sensitive to that and I think that is
really important what are the things
little things that I do you know I
travel a lot and my assistant schedules
my trips all the time and she's always
like Enya's of all the places I'm going
to and I used to never register for me
and I would take it for granted because
i still think okay Donna is taking care
of everything now wherever I go and
bring her back something that's a small
gift and and so she now feels like I
appreciate the work that she does you
know that's not just another thing and
the reason I'm using that example is
just being aware of things as you said
the human things and letting that be
shown as I think that's what that's how
it's small but I think it makes a
difference to you absolutely do you mind
if we take a few minutes for questions
from our audience I see some eager faces
out there and they look like they're
just dying to ask you a few things I
think we have a microphone in the back
that we can pass around
a little bit we'll just three or four
okay great so they're going to go grab
us some microphone right now and while
we're looking for that actually a one
sort of question you know to life
experience again you've all reached
amazing plateaus and your curtain lat
NHA plateaus amazing points in your
careers and you will only continue to go
up what was one of the what was one of
the biggest challenges you face that was
not related to being a woman and or have
you ever framed those challenges that
way I mean I think that sometimes women
talk about women in tech and think well
I've never thought about it right i'm
just working but what was the biggest
sort of barrier you face to getting
where you are today i think the biggest
barrier I don't know if it's a barrier
but i think if i think back to my career
over two decades in the tech industry
what I would have if I could redo it I
think sometimes we hesitate to take the
next step right you know you're doing
well you're comfortable you have a great
you know great team great company you're
working for an opportunity comes up and
you you just don't want to move there
right or not go there and I think
earlier in my career I've let a lot of
opportunities go by just because I was
comfortable where I was and I think that
in a way I don't think it was a barrier
but I think it is something I would do
differently I think it is okay to be
uncomfortable in your life and in your
crime alien life actually how it forces
us to be uncomfortable right it's not
our choice sometimes we put in
uncomfortable situation whether you lose
somebody in your life that's important
to you I'll use something or you gain
something and that causes a you know you
to be uncomfortable too but where is it
your work it's almost deliberate right
you know and those things are
out of things i would do differently i
don't think i knew what i wanted to do
and so what many people i think these
days would consider very late i was i
was almost 30 before I kind of happened
into technology and I guess I guess
that's not entirely true i had been a
bit of a nerdy child however I I didn't
have a particular career path I look out
there now and I see these kids out there
that are 19 20 years old and there they
know what they want to do they know that
they want to you know do a start-up they
know they want to be a technology and
I'm amazed by that because I I really
did not start out in that in that frame
of mind at all I act i spent a long time
searching i was gonna backpacking around
and traveling and doing odd jobs here
and there and waiting tables and doing
all kinds of ma job and I I do deficit I
know I want to tell the 19 year olds to
do that which actually don't know in the
end I think really you know influenced
me a lot and the work that I do and the
things that I care about so you know I
really think it's important to to have
that time for yourself to figure out
what it is that you want to do I mean I
went down a lot of paths that were you
know clearly the wrong path for me and
then when I when I started working in in
web design and development in you know
the 90s I was you know def point had
already kind of gone through three or
four careers I haven't really thought
about how to categorize challenges
whether or not the related gender
because I always like to say that you
know I'm not a woman at Google and the
geek at Google right that's what I mean
I do think the biggest challenge I've
been at Google now for 12 and a half
years and the biggest challenge
throughout has been scale scale of the
service scale the company the scale of
different processes and you know back to
Padma's point about that moment where
you're uncomfortable like just at the
moment where you're like this is a great
process and it's working perfectly and I
really like it it breaks right i mean
other that kind of scale you know
watching search literally grow ten
thousand times over rising there's 20
employees I mean Google now is
you know grown like you know twenty-five
hundred times over um I really do think
that you know it really is about
thinking about you know when do you say
hey this was a great process or a great
system for last year or this piece of
architecture worked when we had millions
of queries a day and isn't going to work
when we have tens of millions of cruises
they are hundreds of millions of crees a
day and so that notion of trying to
figure out when should you take a step
back and rework the foundation the end
of an internal process or actually as
technology itself is something I just
always a found really challenging
anticipates yeah well I haven't I can't
say that I reached the same career point
perhaps that these wonderful women have
but I will say that I wish that when I
was much younger I had felt more
self-confidence about networking with
people who are going to matter to me
later when i was in college i think it
was so happy to be there but i didn't i
didn't really take the steps that I
needed to take to reach out to
professors and make a relationship you
know to really learn from them I kind of
stood back and let them talk and wrote
took notes and and then turned in my
paper and I i wish i had just had the
self-confidence at that time to say
here's who i am and here's what I think
and can i benefit from a personal
conversation with you that's what i
would do differently that's that still i
think a hard thing to do as an adult all
right we have our microphone out so
we'll do a couple of questions and then
we will free you because i know my
butt's starting to go to sleep about you
guys well firstly thank you so much this
panel it's very refreshing to have this
at CES so my question is around social
media specifically we see in the tech
world that women are driving so much of
social media sharing posting fan pages
is there a way to target women
specifically on social media and if so
I'd love to hear your opinions on that
we can use that's weird I don't know why
you're not sure I have the magic recipe
for that there are you know it's some
essentially made for week before we
started talking Molly asked if oh no it
was a recession Linda you asked if the
majority of users on flickr were women
at the outset that it was the case and
women are frequently the family
archivist so the people who take the
photos they you know connect everybody
and they tend to be very involved in the
federal tax women still dominate in you
know on Flickr or not but there are
certain I mean there are certain certain
places that women tend to congregate
online there are certain products that
they tend to tend to go to there's an
environment that they are attracted to
you know women have never really
penetrated all-male environments there's
some kind of classic examples like
slashdot was not chick friendly they're
like there's a kind of a common common
principle in sort of social media design
that you know if women are there men
will come but it's not the same in the
other direction interestingly it's a
sort of as a sort of a pattern that you
see repeatedly happening on social
social media social networking sites
it's hard to say it's hard to say what
the magic thing is because a lot of this
is really I would say are not clients
it's not something that it can be
formulated it sits in some ways it's
kind of a knack it's sort of a feeling
you get a sense for a product that has
general and broad appeal it is something
that women are drawn to and participate
in they they I can't believe it's
interesting it's interesting because
this is the work that I do but I would
not say that there is any sort of sort
of set way of doing that well that's me
I think from the from the perspective of
designing the product for me I think
what's appealing to me about online
social spaces ISM the idea of a safe
space that's what I like about Google
circle
and that's what I like about Google+
circles and Facebook I like the idea of
creating sort of a place that I know
it's okay to place to post you know I I
would never advocate walling off the
internet but I think there's something
to be said for social experiences that
are shared in a private way and I feel
like that's one of the things that that
I have embraced about using social
networks and using a site like guilt
where it's a sign up for you know it may
not be about the comments there but it's
sort of a it feels smaller I think the
Lana is local a lot of that is actually
how the site itself is developed and
maintained and and how the
administrators and moderators of those
sites take care of them Lindsey
mentioned in the beginning of this
conversation that you will actually go
on too many many texts sites and you
will find women being being written
about in the press and then the comments
will be just like mad sexist comments
just these horrible things that were
written in there and what that means to
me is that the site that site itself has
not given very much consideration to
developing a civilized conversation
space that whoever is maintaining
whoever is maintaining that product
where all this sort of hostile and you
know sexist comments are taking place is
not doing a very good job in terms of
cultivating a community of you know
reasonable voices and people who are
making positive contributions and not
just you know not just your trolling and
heating okay tough one though I have to
admit with mercy ER because YouTube is
where people are made us to me that's a
tough one though because there's a
difference there's a fine line between
creating safe spaces and censoring
speech online and I think it's you would
definitely feel more comfortable if
people are saying that stuff about us on
you but it's but I think it's your all
right it depends on what you're sharing
anything certain things you're willing
to share publicly and
they are not and I think as long as you
have an option to do that I think that
makes sense i think what you're saying
though is I like that and I think give
that the person creating that needs to
take the responsibility almost somewhat
editorially looking at the comments that
are being hosted in how what is being
posted and I also look at things like
Pinterest or even Google+ circles and I
think what's interesting about it is
it's changing the conversation it's
changing why and how people connect to
each other because it's actually based
on interest it's not based on
demographics and I think when you move
the conversation from demographics to
that type of interest based because even
when you look at how people use Google+
Circles it'll be like you know your ski
buddies you know your art bunnies or
fashion buddies like whatever whatever
however your categorizing them a lot of
times those circles are actually based
on interest and I think that kind of
shift with a conversation actually makes
women more comfortable yeah I have a
cussing circle on Google+ a little known
fact I swear like a trekker any other
questions okay but only in my one
cussing circle we have one weird I was
wondering at CES specifically and you
went into a little bit about the booth
babes and the lack of woman attending
but one of one of the things that I've
noticed is in north hall every year
there's not parenting tech but mommy
tech yes so i was wondering if you had
any comments maybe maybe part of the
problem with with the making a choice
between family and and and career is
that once you have a family you're
expected to be a mommy not just a mother
another person who has children that
they are rearing but buddy mommy well I
think that's incredibly unfair to men
yeah it is really like this drives my
husband bananas I mean he will say wait
a minute I take care of our children how
come nobody wants to talk with me about
this that's what I thought wasn't it
mommy and daddy tuck right why isn't it
a parenting thing I thinks you're
finally got a great
yeah it is sort of that it does seem to
be sort of it's just sort of easy to say
that once we're a mom that's all we
become you know that we've that and and
and we I think of all seen that happen
we've all seen colleagues who decided
that being mom was was going to be it
and that so it's partly about identity
and right it's partly about spreading
the wealth in terms of the parenting
responsibilities question there yeah
will do will do years and then one more
okay so i probably work for Padma and
society oh you ever play and right next
to me I have a fresh graduate new hire
from Berkeley some background and
experience design earlier you were
talking about experience plus technology
and how critical that is going forward
so my question is what kind of advice
would you have two new people into the
workforce we're pushing experience
because you know experience often gets
run over by technology and product
management and product deadlines and
things you know how would you advise
someone fresh in the workforce to go
ahead and you know evangelize technology
or experience you know amongst all of
that yeah actually I think Marissa is
probably better qualified to answer that
then i am but i think it is that one of
the things that i was talking about
earlier and welcome by the way into the
workforce but it's it's important not
just to think of products as technology
you know products are something that we
use to make our lives cipal and if you
kind of look at it from that point of
view whatever the product is you know
the value isn't making a life simple
then I think you focus on how do I use
it to make my life simple and that is
all about experience and the technology
really becomes the foundation almost
behind the scenes of making that habit
and you know what we touch and feel is
really the experience how we experience
that product so you have a great very
important role to play yeah I mean I
think experience is what makes
technology compelling and interestingly
it doesn't only do that on the user side
but it actually done studies across the
country of introductory computer science
program
and they have better enrollment across
the board if the curriculum focuses more
on problem solving as opposed to saying
hey write a routine that does get
bonacci numbers or just get the
mechanics down the ones that say use
this technology to solve a problem in
chemistry or use this technology to
solve a problem in organization right
like when you actually think about how
to problem-solve so it's interesting
that not only is experience what makes
technology compelling when you buy a new
gadget but it's also what makes people
compelled to learn about technology is
the experience of being able to solve a
problem I think a scattering I was
saying she started off as a designer and
you know she made it a point to say I'm
not an engineer like beasts so I think
this is a living proof here and what you
can accomplish right and there are more
and more companies that are started by
designers or have design as a very
strong focus and I really do believe
that a well-designed product can
overcome you know a lot of Technology
flaws if the product itself is something
that people want people love and people
would use the technology to support it
will come up to meet it our last
question does somebody off the mic out
there or did you get it back alright
that's it great we're free thank you so
much to our amazing panel you women are
brilliant and beautiful and we're happy
to have you and thank you all for coming
out i hope you enjoyed it this will be
posted online later as seen it so
definitely check that out a full slate
of programming for you it's starting
again tomorrow we will have the best of
CES awards presentation right here on
the stage you don't want to miss that
that is the ten absolute best products
that we've seen it too yes plus of
course the people's voice award and the
best of CES overall title and then after
that a few more podcasts and will be
taping a CBS special so you can come and
spy on that we'll see you guys later
