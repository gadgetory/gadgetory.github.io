guest today a very special guest she is
the managing director of Internet of
Things group at Intel which means she
might have the answer to the question
should everything be smart we're very
excited to welcome Bridgette Karlin here
thank you for being with us thank you
for having me it's a pleasure yeah we're
so excited to talk about the Internet of
Things because this is sort of a very
broad kind of category in a lot of don't
really even maybe know what specifically
the Internet of Things is we should
start there
what is IOT as we'd love to call it so
the Internet of Things is essentially
taking everyday objects and connect them
to the Internet so that they can collect
and share and analyze data so that we
can extract more meaningful information
so in a nutshell it's it's taking things
like your phone's appliances your cars
and connecting them to the internet so
that we can get the data off of them and
then understand a little bit more about
what's happening with the device so that
will what's the end goal there the idea
being that our houses are things our
appliances will all better able to serve
us right right and so the purpose of
connecting these devices and getting
data off of them is so that we can
understand a little bit more about the
environment the conditions around you
these are translating into new types of
experiences new types of business models
and for for many of us better
efficiencies with businesses with our
resources and being able to sustain our
environment so let's talk a little bit
about a smart object because every year
at CES we see amazing things at the
Intel booth it's one of our a lot of
silly things that others all them all
over the place yeah for sure so we've
seen we've seen spider dresses we've
seen yeah I mean we've seen spider
dresses we've seen interactive baby
onesies we've seen great we've seen
laptops with Intel chips in them and we
see a lot of different products
obviously Intel does a lot of different
things so we don't expect you to know
every single process until ever put a
chip into but in terms of
sort of trends that we've been seeing in
iterative things what do you think are
the most popular Internet of Things
products or sort of ideas that we've
really kind of seen bloom in the last
maybe six months or so and going forward
a great question well I think we're in a
very exciting time we're in an era of
computing where customers are choosing
experience over product features and
functions and what we're witnessing are
three basic trends the first one is that
we're becoming a smart and connected
world so all these chips that we're
embedding into things are helping us
make the device itself smart and then
connecting it so that's the first thing
we're seeing the second thing we're
we're experiencing is that the computers
are gaining senses we call this the
sense offical of computing where we used
to see in 2d now we get to see in 3d we
can detect temperature and motion and
things like that so that's you know
we're gaining more senses from art from
our devices and then the third thing is
that the computers are now becoming an
extension of you so you know how we take
our smart phones everywhere we go now we
have our smartwatches and we're seeing
that more and more in devices where
we're now becoming more seamlessly
integrated with our technology and you
mentions that yes that's that it's a
terrific show a lot of really cool
technologies it's a great showcase but
you see things like for sports we now
see what started with smart glasses we
now have we have a partner called Oakley
there are Lukas Annika smart eyewear
brand and they've integrated voice in
and and storage and processing into
glasses so that as your runner and
you've got your sunglasses on it can
start giving you voice-activated
coaching and it's one of the things that
you know start to incorporate new
experiences that we didn't originally
expect out of our glasses right so new
kinds of things like that
yeah don't run too fast you might break
your ankles um that would be me okay
like don't run too fast Ashley you're
gonna hurt yourself so in terms of one
of the things that I have sort of
noticed is cars integrating with
Internet of Things so as you're driving
home you kind of let your car know hey
I'm on my way home or no I know it just
sort of knows you're on your way home
and it says like oh I should probably
bring down the thermostat a couple
degrees and you know like get out I feel
like now we're sort of training our cars
to be our dogs where they bring you the
paper and your slippers and you get home
and it's like all very nice and cozy and
so do you think that when when you are
sort of managing the strategy of
Internet of Things group at Intel what
are the types of questions you sort of
ask yourself in terms of you know is
this something that Intel wants to get
into is how do you kind of make those
decision because obviously as we've
mentioned like until does a lot of
things and so how do you say like this
also is within Intel's vision but but is
pushing the envelope in terms of what
can be done yeah great question I mean
you know when you're thinking about
strategy and what markets you should go
into what technologies are appropriate
for that market you first start with the
customer you start with you know what
problems can we solve what experiences
can we make possible and that really in
a nutshell is how we start approaching
innovation and that sort of thing and I
would say that you know for the Internet
of Things we look at the IOT in sort of
to two basic segments one segment being
consumer where you've got things like
your SmartWatch and you know different
types of wearables and in fact that's a
really exciting area for us because
analysts are telling us that we're going
to have about 780 million wearables by
2018 Wow so and then the second sort of
bucket is the industrial side and that
by far in a way when we think about the
total economic opportunity for IOT which
is about four to eleven trillion dollars
globally about 70% of that is coming
from the industrial side so when you
think about the industrial side what
does that mean well it's transportation
its retail its healthcare it's smart
building you even gonna say you guys
even had at CES this year a smart
hardhat yeah it's really cool that is so
cool that is with a partner called
daiquiri and they took essentially our
intel realsense technology which enables
3d and that sort of thing plus our
processors and they took what used to be
the old hard hat and they made it smart
by putting in these technologies and
they created an augmented reality
situation so
when you have an industrial worker out
on you know the oil rig you know
repairing something and if he's up there
and they say hey this part needs to be
replaced as well they can in real time
send him the schematic so that he can
literally see through augmented reality
in 3d this schematic that he should work
on and exactly where to go fix the part
and and it'll give him the instruction
plus be able to do the real-time
collection of the data so that is the
kind of thing when we think about new
experiences but really new product and
and production level efficiencies we
know it we thought that you know in the
past yeah it's really interesting to
sort of think about the idea of
convenience giving us more time to
create or to to sort of pursue other
interests like I mean obviously in the
Industrial Revolution that was sort of
the start of leisure time for everybody
sort of have leisure time and now with
robotics IOT and all of the different
things that we kind of have coming
together and converging right now we're
starting to see maybe a second age of
that where we're like okay so now we're
increasing productivity in the
industrial market or increasing
convenience in the personal market
you're sort of able to kind of get that
sense of well what do I do with this a
little bit this little tiny bit of like
two minutes of extra time that I have
now well it adds up over time like what
do I do at that time yeah and you
mentioned you know when we think about
the crossover where you can see IOT
taking hold in the industrial side like
let's talk about retail so Levi's is one
of our customers a great partner and
they essentially we're trying to address
one of the big retailer challenges which
is out of stocks I mean the last thing
you want to do as a retailer is not have
the right pair of jeans and the right
spot when you go in and you want to buy
them so we implemented our Intel IOT
platform which also includes a an Intel
retail sensor capability and we worked
with Levi's to read the data off of
their RFID tags that are already sewn
into your jeans and so as the G's
literally move around the store like the
dressing room or on the shelf or
something the store knows exactly where
those jeans are and those that if
they've been sold or if they're you know
stuck somewhere in a corner so when the
shopper comes in they can make sure that
they've got the right pair of jeans in
the right spot for the consumer so I
think
consumer benefits because they get the
product they want and the retailer in
Levi's case you know make sure that
they've got the right product the right
place like that story just for some
reason reminded me of being a kid where
you like take go into clothes into a
round rack and you just laugh now they'd
be able to find those pants much easier
I'm so sorry bollocks
I'm so sorry well what do you think is a
is is a product or a appliance or an
item or an object in our world that is
not smart that should be smart wow
that's a great question I think rather
than trying to answer that I think you
know what should be smart that isn't
it's sort of like I think the question
is what's next yeah because literally
you know things it really it's up to our
imagination in fact Intel sponsors
America's greatest makers it's a new
reality TV show where we have inventors
coming on that have thought of all kinds
of things like you know taking a glove
that will now translate gestures into
speech or helping a kid you know put
some little Curie into a processor in a
toothbrush so that you keep the kid on
track when he's brushing you know on the
wrong attachment in Japan it sinks to an
app and it lets you either watch the
news play a video game or play a song
while you brush your teeth and we're
like do we need this but then that's the
point it's like you got to keep kids on
track sometimes and that's a really good
way to do it and another one is a brain
control joystick so think about you know
when you're gaming or even for the
disabled that have the ability to do
these kinds of controls so the
possibilities are really endless and
when we think about you know what's the
one thing that should be smart or just
sort of think of it more like what's the
next thing that's going to be made smart
pretty much it's an inevitability for
just about anything that you you have
ever used and I'll tell you you
mentioned you touched on you know with
our CES show with the Intel carry module
literally the the little processor the
size of a button
yeah going into things like a toothbrush
or something like that in addition to
that technology we have 5g
communications coming out
that we're investing in and that's
another technology that will make these
not only these devices smart but make
the connectivity and the experience much
more seamless so they're not just smart
isolation they're smart together
together and they'll be able to share
data back and forth with each other so
my glasses when I'm running or like you
forgot to brush just about time but
thank you so much for coming in and
stopping by later we find I Oh tea and I
mean we love future tech here obviously
like everyone at home really loves
future tech so thank you for coming by
and talking to us about this stuff stop
by any time well you know it's my
pleasure on behalf of Intel I think
we're at a time where technology is
being valued not just for the devices
that it makes but for the experiences it
makes possible so they think that's very
exciting for us so thank you so much
that was the very lovely at Bridgette
Karlin stopping and managing director
Internet of Things group at Intel we
will be right back we've got a lot more
delightful things that are gonna happen
on this show that you're probably more
familiar with stick around stick around</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
