littlest engine and just about their
littlest price tag as well but is this
thing big enough to hold the tech that
you want let's drive the 2013 BMW x1 in
the xdrive28i configuration and check
the tech now you might think by the name
x1 this is actually based on the one
series car but it's not it's actually
based on our reduced version of the x3
crossover which is based on the 3-series
car the x1 is nearly eight inches
shorter than an x3 about 7 inches lower
hence the wagon look 386 pounds lighter
that's a lot and $6,500 cheaper also a
lot also a lot of folks aren't sure what
to call it what do you think is it an
SUV or is it a wagon and when you get in
the x1 you're gonna see a lot of
familiar this is not a car that has a
bunch of new design language or new
technology in fact it's got a subset of
BMWs overall very impressive tech the
key things are here they play the hits
you've got a nice wide screen though not
BMWs largest as you can tell but plenty
big certainly in a compact cabin at this
point you recognize I Drive comment
across all their vehicles I've noted
this in every instance clockwise turn on
the knob means down the list they didn't
always do that in every mode I applaud
them that's what makes sense to me basic
on this guy are the sources that are
kind of the hits you've got AM and FM
radio HD radio CD player here though car
makers are starting to ace those
auxilary jack down there and USB 4 thumb
drives an iPod now BMWs apps are looking
pretty dated at this point by getting
the app support and it only works on iOS
devices by the way no Android which is
real dumb in 2013 you get facebook
support Twitter support and web radio
station support but that's nowhere near
the modest galaxy of apps you're
finding on Ford GM and Toyota these days
we've shown you those systems on a lot
of those vehicles lately at even a lower
price point now navigation on BMWs has
always been quite good this one doesn't
have the full package of connected
navigation however if you want to go
enter a destination there's no choice
here to go google searching you can get
a driver assistance package on this
vehicle but before you get all excited
it's actually real simple it sparks
sensors in the bumper and a backup
camera that's kind of a reach to call
that driver assistance Oh check this out
you could have two tablet options for
the rear seat of this car
I put tablet in quotes one of them is an
interesting strategy by BMW to do a DVD
media player tablet it's not an Internet
tablet it's just a media player in kind
of a chunky tablet form factor but for
600 bucks you get a pair of them that'll
play SD card CD or USB media that's
definitely a great price although I
still don't like the technology platform
for 179 bucks you can get an iPad holder
that'll mount your iPad back there and
plug it into power expensive but a
better choice
okay well the technology in the vehicle
is relatively routine for BMW what's
under the hood is not you've got an
inline four with twin-scroll turbo power
behind it this is unusual for BMW and
you can also tell here by this kind of
blank space where they ended up routing
some hoses they could have made the x1
about 10 inches shorter by my estimation
but they wanted to get the proportions
right the numbers on this little engine
are impressive 240 horsepower 260
foot-pounds of torque the vehicle weighs
thirty seven hundred and twenty
something pounds but gets up to 60 in
6.3 seconds while delivering 20 to 33
mpg only transmission this is possibly
hooked up to is that 8-speed automatic
you spotted in the cabin that's it
paddles that you may have seen on the
wheel those are optional with an M Sport
package those are not standard
front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive as
we have here that's an X Drive that
denotes all wheels being driven by the
way if you buy an x3 which is much
larger and heavier but it's a 28 I
variant it's going to have this same
engine within like one or two horsepower
and foot-pounds but big difference in
weight think about that this is actually
a very nice fetching combination
okay I'm at a red light here to start
our drive and the engines off because
the start/stop technology is in place in
a moment I'm going to lift off the brake
and the engines going to start except if
I do this and I move the steering wheel
that also restarts the engine I kind of
understand the logic and I kind of don't
because I frequently kind of you know
nudge the wheel while I'm at a stop and
I don't mean anything by it but there
goes my start/stop efficiency secondly
when BMWs restart I find them to be
about the roughest slowest restart of
any car I've driven that has this
technology it's just not refined in a
car like this it just needs to be now
the next thing you notice in this car is
the elasticity of the powertrain it's a
turbo so you've got some turbo lag /
kind of rubber band eNOS in there
secondly you've got all kinds of
processors that are helping think
8-speed transmission so you can
sometimes be buried under a couple of
extra cogs that the car has got to dig
itself out of all that adds up to what
is not the most sharply responsive BMW
by any means there is no replacement for
displacement let's face it small bore
cars do labor under a lot of sort of
muted power delivery no matter what tech
tricks you apply to them but this car is
just it's not a joy to drive as a sharp
driving tool it's a perfectly nice
vehicle to drive in everyday work and
the handling is not bad
although we don't have any particularly
interesting suspension tricks here the
steering is what is so notable
once you're up around 30 40 miles an
hour or more it's fine around slower
speeds this has to be the heaviest
steering I have ever driven in a modern
car and there is no setting for it in
this vehicle there is a servo tronic
steering option that I believe gives you
some different profiles but this one is
just you know it is what it is and it's
incredibly heavy steering the last note
I want to say about the interior is a
small thing but what the hell is this
that's the cup holder you stick it in a
slot over here on the console you do
have one here you don't want to share
obviously because that's no fun there's
nothing in the console so yeah this is
number two shotgun is this pop-up which
is kind of clunky
all right let's ballpark on X 1 X 28 at
about 33 2 but then you're going to want
that driver assistance package rear
camera and parking sonar especially with
a vehicle that has this kind of sight
lines
that's 9:50 except you can't get that
without also gain the technology package
which is GPS navigation Bluetooth and
voice command I'm not big on tying like
that all in you can do one of these seen
that style and stay comfortably under 40
if you start to add in lots of the
luxury package stuff though you're well
into the mid-40s be careful on that
