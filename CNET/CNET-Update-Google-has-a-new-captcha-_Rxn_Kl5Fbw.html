Bakalar filling in for Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update google has
created a whole new type of CAPTCHA that
prevents you from having to deal with
those distorted puzzles of cryptic
nonsense at the end of an online form
these strings of letters and numbers you
have to decipher and then retype to
prove you're human are known as CAPTCHAs
they're there to protect websites from
spambots and other nefarious robots and
as these robots have gotten more
advanced they've started to been able to
read distorted text Google's new
programming looks at other clues to
check if you're human like your IP
address and your browsing cookies the
new system will just ask you to click on
a box that says you're not a robot now
sometimes you'll still need to copy a
code or solve a quick puzzle but it's
designed to also be easier on mobile
devices where instead of trying to read
a jumbled font you can quickly solve a
mini photo quiz that asks you to pick
which photos are similar to a given clue
snapchat WordPress and humble bundle are
some of the first to use the new method
it's the end of an era for another set
of technology Microsoft has killed off
the clip art library the quirky and
let's be honest mostly lame drawings
that adorned many grade school projects
and office letters are no longer
accessible within office instead
Microsoft programs will point you to use
Bing image search to find photos online
that you can legally use with a Creative
Commons license it's not easy to say
goodbye to the screen beans remember
those guys the clipart dudes with those
gigantic noses especially our personal
favorite guy with a good idea twitch has
a new challenger when it comes to
streaming video games valve steam
platform has edited broadcasting that
will let users watch their friends play
games by clicking watch game on their
friends profile you don't need to own
the game or pay a fee to watch someone
else play and the broadcaster has the
power to block unwanted spectators for
now streams won't be archived so you
can't watch them later and the feature
is available now for users that have
opted in to the steam client beta which
you can find in the settings section
finally the PlayStation turns
20 today and Sony is celebrating with a
playstation 4 that features the original
playstation gray plastic the bundle will
also ship with a grey dualshock 4 and a
PlayStation camera now there's only
12,000 300 of these being made and
they'll be available for pre-order for
just five hundred dollars this Saturday
that is your tech news update you can
always find out more by heading over to
cnet com be sure to follow me on Twitter
from our Studios here in New York I'm
