have some bad news your personal details
may have been hacked
on Tuesday the company revealed hackers
stole data on 57 million drivers and
riders in October 2016 according to a
statement from
ovas new CEO derek oz o shahe the
company discovered the breach in
November 2016
but kasra Shahi said he only learned of
the breach recently hackers didn't
access credit card information or social
security numbers but personal
information like names email addresses
and driver's license numbers were all
compromised
uber says roughly 600,000 drivers were
affected and now it's offering them
identity theft protection and credit
monitoring according to the uber CEO the
data was stored on a cloud service and
then downloaded by two individuals
outside the company uber then paid
$100,000 to have the hackers delete this
data none of this should have happened
and I will not make excuses for it cuz
Raja he said in a statement adding that
the company would learn from its
mistakes but the news tops off a bad
year for uber former CEO Travis kalanick
left the company in June after a string
of scandals
since then new CEO Derek asaf jahi has
had to stare down more issues including
tussles with regulators around the world
and continued allegations of sexual
assault leveled against its drivers so
is the data breach enough for you to
stop using uber let us know your
thoughts in the comments I'm Claire
Riley and you can read more about the
continuing uber saga at Senate calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
