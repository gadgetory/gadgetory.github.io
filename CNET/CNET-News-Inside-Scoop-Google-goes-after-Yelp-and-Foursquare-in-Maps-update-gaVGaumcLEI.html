I'm cnet's Cara tsuboi joined by senior
rider seth rosenblatt and Seth today we
are talking all about the newly updated
google mapping app for android and soon
iOS absolutely so it comes out today for
Android users is that correct yes
android users who have jelly bean 4.1
will be able to begin getting the app
from the Google Play Store what would
you say is the biggest most noticeable
difference between this version and
previous oh boy there's a lot of
differences there's a new look that they
announced at Google i/o there's also
some new features that they also
announced back in May most interestingly
the app is sort of going after
foursquare and Yelp with some of these
new features interesting how's that
going to work like the yelp part for
example the old part is really cool you
tap on a restaurant or bar and the Zagat
review shows up you get that you can see
the Zagat score you can see the Zagat
review other readers reviews and then
you can add your own score and row and
review directly from Google Maps it's
quite cool and what about the Foursquare
portion how does that work that's also
very interesting there's a new explore
feature in google maps so when you tap
on a location you can go through
restaurants bars hotels points of
interest it's really kind of neat and
you can do it all without having to type
anything into your phone you can just
tap and go now what about for those of
us users who just want a good mapping
app that doesn't steer me in the wrong
direction does this beef up those
features or you know give me better
traffic data things like that absolutely
although Google just bought ways which
is known for its crowd-sourced maps none
of those features have filtered into
this version yet but what we do have in
this version is a real-time traffic
rerouting option so if you're if it
detects a traffic jam up ahead it'll
notify you that there's a jam and then
offer an automatic re-route you tap the
phone once it gives you a new way to go
I like that that sounds very useful it's
interesting that's great yeah we're
where do you think Google is really
going with this obviously you know
mapping is a huge
face right now just trying to take more
of a claim against team Apple's own
proprietary maps everyone else in this
me you know I don't know especially with
the with the by of ways I don't know
that Google is really feeling any
pressure from any competition certainly
they want to stay on top of the heap and
some of the features that they've
included such as a new feature where you
can shake the phone and it will
automatically pop up the feedback option
where you can let Google Maps know that
there's a bad photo that there's an
inaccurate placement of something or an
error in even a transportation schedule
that makes it you know one of the more
unique mapping apps out there I would
definitely use that feature no kiddin I
hate it when I find a one-way street
that's going the other way sure when
they get the muni times wrong san
Francisco's the worst absolutely all
right so starting today Android users
can update their app and in iOS users
rolling out soon they don't know when
exactly but it should be I'd be
surprised if it was less than if they
didn't have it within a few weeks great
