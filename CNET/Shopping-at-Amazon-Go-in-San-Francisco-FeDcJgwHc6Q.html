the middle of San Francisco's financial
district standing right outside
Amazon Gauri the company's first cashier
let's talk in this city although it is
store number six across the u.s. we have
other ones in Chicago and Seattle so
this concept is all about cameras and
sensors tracking what you're buying so
essentially all you do when you walk in
the store is scan the app you pick out
what you want and then you just walk
straight out and it's charged
automatically so I'm gonna try it out
you're gonna come with me either up the
app already loaded on my phone so let's
go inside and you're gonna go on a bit
of a shopping spree I think it's gonna
be pretty fun
so this is my first time inside an
Amazon ghost also I don't really know
what's gonna be here I think it's gonna
be I can see like candies chocolates
there a couple mugs click pause gum okay
so I'm gonna grab some off the shelf and
it's gonna keep an eye on what I'm
actually picking up and sir it's gonna
add it to my cut and then if I put it
back it's gonna take it out of my cot
it's like magic but I think I want the
subway chips why not there's a lot to
choose from in here and there are a
couple of I've noticed a couple of local
vendors that are just from San Francisco
like this Mon Cherie
and then over here there are stuff from
der stop so these are all just like San
Francisco local brands that you're
probably not going to get anywhere else
sorry now I have everything I need I
have breakfast lunch and a really
sugar-filled dinner I'm gonna walk
straight out with this and it's gonna
send me an invoice afterwards kind of
weird I don't have to talk to anyone I
don't have to scan my credit card I'm
just gonna please
so I've just left the store and now I'm
going to go into the app and it gives me
an invoice of everything that I bought
yeah went a little bit crazy let's be
honest I bought some stuff put my grand
total down here my invoice and my cards
being charged and that's it
I spent 10 minutes and 13 seconds in the
store I think I'm gonna go back in and
check it out even more because there's
lots of stuff in there this is a big
store so that was Amazon go shopping
