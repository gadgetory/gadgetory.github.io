popular and relevant stories thanks for

before we even start we want to ask you
the viewing audience to submit your
questions your stories anything you want
to talk about to help us start a
conversation because we're going to be
interacting directly with you before we
get out of here alright let's kick
things off with a story about tinder Sam
we found out recently the tinder is
gonna allow group dating so how does
that work what's going on with that yeah
what's group I know group dating well
explain it okay so tender socials coming
out it's Tinder's coming out with
something called tinder social where you
can get together with some buds and be
like oh I'm going to a concert or I'm
you know watching a movie and then match
with other groups who are also doing
that okay so how does that like how do I
set that up not that i'm i'm not i'm
looking forward to doing that
I am NOT may yes a married why well
right now obsolete you can do this is my
person yeah jump into that decision nice
well this is not dating the song yeah
but if you're all just hanging out
together so okay so it's not like people
looking for sound like the group thing
yeah it's not like what you said right
at right I cuz I that's weird cuz you
know I've been married for a while I've
I didn't get to experience tinder did
you do you guys like know so I
downloaded tinder or whole house was
like okay we'll just we'll download it
okay and before I could use it I had a
friend who swiped right that's the right
way right right right yeah it's for 300
people and so yeah thats its casting a
line is what that is yeah so swipe right
and all these people and then she's got
all these ridiculous messages and just
because became too much yeah that's
that's like that's like an awful prank
someone could play yeah so that's my
little story with it however i did bring
some other stories oh that's right ok so
you've got some like horror stories of
people on tinder just having the worst
time having a bad time no i curated
these to make sure they're mostly safe
for work ok i will just go with that
yeah jazz fan 419 said got a tinder
notification on my phone realized i
don't have tender and was holding my was
actually holding my girlfriend's phone
oh that oh that's a double whammy cuz
you know finds out his girlfriend
cheating she well not cheating baby you
know putting stuff out there play on a
field exactly okay what else you so then
he responded to all them for her I was
like sorry I'm in a serious relationship
sorry I know it was a lecture other ways
okay um rear windows said the only tense
an interesting name yeah the only tinder
date i went on the woman told me her
goal was to get pregnant in the next few
months wow I note right out of there yes
I said no hell yeah look if you're going
on tinder you're not looking to get
married yes it's nice don't know then
again yeah I had a friend who dated
someone for
over a year from gender yeah I I know a
couple that's getting married I believe
from a spawned out of tinder yeah there
are lots success stories out there that
you know I'm think this is happening
more and more in this day and age I
think it's absolutely fine that people
are meeting people the internet and it's
fine oh no one's saying it years ago it
sounded a bit bizarre but yeah in this
day and age is absolute you know i think
it's it's a good way of meeting people
sure i think it totally makes sense i
mean it gives you so many more options
of cuz right now what do you do like you
go into a coffee shop and like meet that
way no that's still okay to like yeah
for the record it's okay to meet anybody
anyway anywhere right like that's cool i
don't know i don't like this all sort of
came to be after i met your mom for my
mom so like so while I i I'm still a
little curious she's got weird okay
weird to curate a married person to just
be like yeah I love my wife I love my
family like it's very nice i'm very
happy this little party mitch is like oh
I kind of have a little bit of not
regret but just like I'm a little sad I
didn't get to experience that game um
from my experience yeah which can't do
anymore thanks to the boyfriend right
probably get mad I I was just but i did
download tender social for today Oh see
what it was like and it seems like it
makes sense you know if you're in a new
place sure find some friends go out for
the evening alright yeah so maybe I'll
try it out tonight yeah okay out and
you'll report back next week yeah we'll
talk about it next week right is your
social dateland so we've got Zak here's
access security expert for all things
internet security and beyond let's be
honest yeah I double you dabble another
time so there's a crazy story about
Amazon echo wiretapping so this is one
of the strange things in Amazon were
like one of the Amazon was one of asked
companies to issue a transparency report
to tell you how many data requests that
get from the government okay um but it
only takes into account its cloud
numbers how many people are having their
data temps in its cloud now when the
Amazon echo came about this little
portable speaker it made you saw one or
is it
listening on to everything that you say
right and yet amazon won't say if the
FBI has a will tap wiretap the others
here is a rabbit other thing amazon
won't say gizmodo some months ago filed
a Freedom of Information regret with the
FBI and they glow mod gizmodo what's
that mean it's to neither confirm nor
deny so no one knows like anywhere isn't
yeah amazon echo may or may not be
listening to everything well okay so so
obviously the echoes ears are always
open it's Israel is open right it's
listening to the keyword which is Alexa
LexA yeah but no one is quite sure if
the feds have tapped into the power of
Amazon echo so the question is not I
mean the question is a have they ever
done it be could they do it whenever
they want right I'm the answer is we
have no one to and the word was wide
again they got what again the response
from the FBI don't blow modes they claw
mark as well the glimmer is holly
anything above that nor deny it's
fantastic alright is there anything else
you want to scare us with or is that
that's America that's enough for one
episode right that's that's enough for
now yeah I didn't realize having you
here was gonna actually freak out I'm
curious dan graziano over there is
curating our chat room do you have
anything for us or should we just keep
going okay we'll just keep going here
we're gonna take a break for just a few
minutes we're gonna check in with our
very own Michael Sorrentino who is out
on the floor at san diego comic-con in
san diego he's got to be premiering a
new beer a Star Trek beer that he found
this is ridiculous if you want to keep
the conversation going submit your
comments in the field section below keep
this tab open we'll be right back is
mike sorrentino its see that I'm here
with Dan Curie from schmaltz Brewing
Company and we are here at the gas I'm
tavern in time for san diego comic-con
with this Star Trek 50th anniversary
golden ale yeah humming it out
how the inscriptions of his beer sure so
our 50th anniversary gold now is the
second beer in our line of Star Trek
beers in the spring we launched our
Vulcan red session IPA which was a
beautiful amber kind of really multi red
session IPA for this summer we wanted to
really do something in conjunction with
the 50th anniversary of Star Trek Smeltz
Brewing Company we're celebrating our
20th anniversary this summer so
anniversaries to us are very important
we wanted to really kind of feature the
golden idea of the emblem behind Star
Trek so we figured a golden pal L would
be the perfect beer to match with that
the the recipe behind the actual beer
was created by one of our head Brewers
drew Schmidt shout out to drew one of
his favorite episodes of Star Trek
growing up was the trouble with tribbles
episode so in that episode a lot of Star
Trek fans will be familiar with the fact
they were delivering quadrotriticale on
the enterprise which was supposed to be
a super super grain that could kind of
grow anywhere and it doesn't exist yet
here in our measly 2016 but we do have
triticale that's really been a fun beer
to brew with it's a hybrid grain between
barley and rye gives the beer a really
nice kind of spicy pepperiness on the
back end and then the hops that we've
used for the beer galaxy Aurora Admiral
some comet hops all have kind of a
galactic tie-in and they give it a nice
sweet fruitiness up top which really
really balances well with that peppery
finish and he was from the decoration
you guys have yeah these are our
troubles nibbles are creating a little
noise let's give this beer a quick shot
it's the pale out Cheers I'm
yeah so that's what nice pale ale some
like lights play bears but really really
a little bit sweet I like that a bit of
a pepperiness too yeah so again the
sweetness is going to come from some of
those fruity characteristics of the hot
spring out but like you said on the back
end it evolves into this kind of spicy
pepperiness but all subtle it's a five
percent beer you know the flavors are
subtle super drinkable super sessionable
just really nice smooth american-style
pale ale and where I can do find the
beer all over if you're down here at
Camp comic con man I mean we've got a
whole list that I could read off to you
if you need me to but bars here and in
and out the area will have it on draft
all week so you know if you're down here
at comic-con keep your eye out have a
pint and cheers to Star Trek and
schmaltz brewing company yet and thank
you so much for your time yeah thank you
guys for joining us if you hear a gas
lamp let's give us up thank you hi it's
mike sorrentino at cnet hey welcome back
to cnet's open tab I'm still Jeff
Bakalar and joining us for the second
half of our fine program is our crack
reviews in turn fresh from the lab Jake
crow how you doing man I'm great I'm so
glad you're back right you're having so
it's my bits only my pleasure we got a
lot to get to but before that I want to
talk about a topic that we're you know
sort of following this week it's been a
fun week on social a couple things
happening in Cleveland specifically
could that be yeah what could what could
be going on whatever it is the social
world was following it pretty hawkish
Lee and we kind of love when Twitter
melts down like this acknowledging all
the relevance that might be there or not
they're right the Republican National
Convention had its own share of tweets
this week I just want to go and look at
a few that we kind of thought were funny
using the amazing power of social media
let's go a few through a few of those
right now this was the first one
uh saying it was a live shot of the
Republican National Convention oh wow a
really solid Biff Tannen joke not mad at
that that's pretty good right it's not
bad what do we have next ser Brion
there's the ultimate that's what she
said I mean you gotta admit some of
these are not bad people are really
using this as time to shine for their
jokes i actually just wrote two pieces
this week about RNC and twitter and it's
just dominated like RNC related tweets
have dominated the platform it's amazing
like all this really is is a platform
for people to commentate on right like
that's what it is it's almost like it's
it's like that's not the real world the
real one is like what you know what I
mean I think this weird spectating sort
of psychology and then finally we really
dug some of this awesome comic inspired
Twitter art whatever you want to call it
from a user of the name of Stephen burn
86 giving us that like really solid
Trump comic book villain thing going on
oh that one's said it's pretty good
right what I mean I like the computer
what's that like computer apps like
ultra pick that I like do it for ya I
don't know like it's a really excellent
you know job and hey if the shoe fits
right like come on so Jake you had a
story about Gorilla Glass yes so Gorilla
Glass where people don't know it's the
it's the branded glass that's used on a
lot of smartphones super hard and they
keep doing this thing we're like oh
there's gorilla glass 2 3 4 or 5 s we're
up to five now 95 now and a lot of phone
companies will I'm an apples notorious
they don't say they use it they use the
kind of their own blend of it but
essentially corn grill with us five is
here I can withstand a drop up to 1.6
meters which is around five feets that's
comparable to the galaxy s7 active the
Moto's Saturn shield thus you're saying
so it so any surface it can drop that's
what they're saying again they did a
test it was kind of like a dummy and it
was pretty thick but it dropped out of
like a proprietary testing machine oh
okay I'm 1.6 meters and it slammed on
the ground was like a little kind
sheet of a kind of gravely okay so a
little worse than sand paper but not is
worse is like but not like the street no
one straight down bounced up and down a
few times and it turned out well it was
fine yeah that's like selfie height it
is I said that they're doing it for self
yeah and I was like this new chemical
coating are no selfie height it should
break I got jelly like if you're out of
luck that tips on Melissa right teaches
in the lesson look like maybe you drop
your phone itself bi you don't deserve
to have a phone in you should write
meaning or to take selfies exactly
you've lost the right lost or sorry and
that's not all so so henschel for it to
come unlike the iphone 7 maybe your
Apple is probably gonna do like their
own I on X or sapphire okay there's a
potential that could come probably a
little too late for the note 7 because I
talk a second wow I've got all the dates
he's got all I had on there yeah but
date fri for some new smartphone during
like the new LG they come out like a v10
successor okay small it could buy on
there but it's definitely a cool
technology to see how they continue to
push it to be coming to like a new Ford
car this year as well as even some ATM
displays gotcha so they're definitely
trying to branch out from besides phones
itself so do you know like why this
works so well and why it's such a huge
advancement over the previous generation
from what we had a reporter out there
and they kind of did the interview like
that people be on it it's like this new
chemical coating that they put out in it
just stronger I mean I guess they're
probably working with competitors like
the Moto shield display is nuts like
what the original droid turbo that they
get on last year was able to go straight
down it's found very impressed with all
these facts right now you're just like
yeah how do you so many facts and what
was like just like a blowtorch thing
right yes they did like a blowtorch I
don't that was I'm like making with us
or what up taken with it come with Sam a
good amount of heat that's okay if
someone was trying to like smash mouth
like a screwdriver nothing I'd like an
aluminum ball not like a big one like a
small like a marble sized right down
like in this another proprietary testing
machine uh Jake how would you smash a
glass if you could yeah product oh I
have a plane or something like yeah play
okay the terminal velocities just seen
that budget what's in it see why you
playin and they like will drop something
on it after it can withstand a lot it's
crazy I guess like I'm trying to imagine
a realistic scenario we're like can we
be like if it falls out of a car I'm
like I feel like
did you are moving for you guys how
often you throwing your phone out of it
you'd be sparse a lot my like Sophia of
the window oops the jeep owners do all
the time to try and get cool shots right
something I know what am I found I can
opt out of that hard work your pokemons
go yeah you're just like oh well but my
phone's okay that broke every bone in my
body phone front I can still play
pokemon gone oh nice Oh Dan real quick
checking in nothing no just give it
something else for the record that's all
right just keep going just keep going
cool thanks everyone for sending in your
comments and questions appreciate it um
so is that it with the the gorilla glass
scranton gorilla glass yeah I would drop
it into a volcano I decided that I would
recall melting it though breaking it tho
cuz melting yeah nothing's different
phones not gonna do me any good yeah
i've decided that i get to crack display
you can replace the display but if it's
melted like you lost all your dates girl
everything's got yeah i didn't get
everything that's it that's out that
thing that's cool glass 7 really got 71
stand every class I like my plans like
into space shall we find out oh that's a
big deal Debbie Debbie tired but if they
have the lower the Rings endorsement oh
all right before we get out of here for
the week I want to talk about what
happened to this torrent site called
kickass torrents and I guess what's like
what's the endgame for for torrents in
general obviously the BitTorrent
technology has a stigma of pirated
software lean ozik and all that stuff
but like the technology itself isn't
illegal and I feel like a lot of people
have a tough time understanding the
difference between illegal torrents and
torrent sites like para Pirate Bay
kickass torrents well what is exactly
the difference and explain it to people
so the way that I can sum it up the best
is so bittorrent itself provides a way
to stream stuff so it could be like a
family movie that's hosted right on your
own and that can be shared and they just
launched a new app for the Apple TV as
well as iOS and Android so you can
stream it locally kickass torrents and
pirate be like those it's illegal
content so it could be not all illegal
not always very simple sex soundcloud
users can put stuff on there but i would
say that a majority of what people use
for people
forget too bad name because it has like
copies of finding dory or like some
other sure movie and so they ended up
shutting down kickasstorrents there was
a clone of it created last night I know
but essentially torrenting yeah but like
bid torn itself is not illegal I mean
companies have used in the past you like
to share stuff with them employees they
actually just like the bit toward the
company just launched their own
streaming yourselves from a sort of a
they're working with VEVO as well as
other than some other like european news
channels to broadcast news so it's
definitely a great technology and it's
good to you know like the internet
service to stream stuff back and forth
right similar to how like I'm steam you
can stream like a VR game instead of
downloading it for sure I feel like um
you know it's when you have these
instances like the Pirate Bay or like
kickasstorrents where they become like a
haven for the illegal stuff like a party
um but by itself in tech is the tech is
great it's in a stigma to like art oh
yeah most of stuff on their illegal Oh
most of the stuff on piratebay and kick
ass is like there's some other sites
that are dedicated yes for like write
freelance min Fe land but unlike indie
musicians to say their music is on and
as a donate option so I mean and it's
essentially using the same technology
like Apple pushes apps out that way like
with the app store it's the same pulling
from a server in its getting it back
here it's also using other people
downloaded the content so that way you
can get it faster so it's almost kind of
like a crowdsourced way of downloading
totally yes and again like that's behind
the curtain like that's the what's under
the hood that like eggs BitTorrent such
an amazing sharing technology but again
like it just sort of found its away like
I don't know what I got home from higher
ders were like oh we got to jump on
BitTorrent Lee this is where it's at but
that's sort of the way it is like I know
you guys are probably too old for
Napster but you've heard of it right too
old yeah to jump start to go I'm too old
like you weren't around for that that
was like the Wild West like that was
like this crazy sort of facts and stop
the music industry to say the least yeah
it did and specifically Metallica yeah
yeah all right Sam Jake everyone for
coming in Zach Zach looking at you Zach
big thanks to You Zach you're welcome
that's going to bring things to a close
thank you so much for joining us for
another
edition of open tab have a very safe and
fun weekend keep the conversation going
