experience and three tablet compact late
last year we were wondering why it
hadn't also done a premium 10-inch
tablet but not only more as it's just
taken the wraps off the Xperia z4 tablet
now it's very easy to see the family
resemblance between the said four and
the previous 10-inch is that two tablet
first of all it's extremely slim it's in
fact only 6.1 mil thick and sony says
that this is the slimmest and lightest
10-inch tablet on the market now you
think that that make it quite
susceptible to bending but it does
actually feel fairly sturdy although I
definitely wouldn't want to sit on it
like the tablet before it and in fact
most of Sony's Xperia range the z4
tablet is completely waterproof so that
does mean you can happily read in the
bath or watch Netflix and safely drop it
into water knowing that it's not going
to die the screen has a 2k resolution
and sony in fact says it's the brightest
2k resolution display on the market
certainly to my eyes it does seem very
crisp and very bright as well although
something we will have to test in the
full review inside is running on the
latest Qualcomm 8100 processor which is
a 64-bit octa-core chip which should
provide plenty of power to make
navigating around the lollipop interface
extremely Swift Sony also has a cool
accessory from Zed for a tablet in the
form of a Bluetooth keyboard which can
slot together and fold down allowing you
to use it and carry it exactly as you
would a regular laptop the tablet is due
to go on sale in the spring although we
don't know exactly what day yet sony
hasn't said exactly how much it will
cost either although with high-end specs
and it's skinny waterproof design you
can bet it's not going to be too cheap
make sure to keep your eyes on cnet.com

MWC tech show I'm Andrew Hoyle and this
is a Sony Xperia Zed for tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
