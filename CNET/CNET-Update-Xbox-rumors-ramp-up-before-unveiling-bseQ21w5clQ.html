generation of games I'm Richard Carey
and this is your scene that update soon
we will learn details about the next
Xbox console mark your calendars for
tuesday at cnet brings you live coverage
from the Xbox unveiling event the rumors
so far indicate Microsoft will call this
the Xbox infinity and that it'll have
the ability to play blu-ray discs and
it'll also act as a type of cable box
for recording shows there's also been a
report by the verge that Microsoft will
get rid of xbox points and instead it'll
have people use gift cards and credit
cards for payments to simplify things
we'll see what microsoft says on Tuesday
I'll be co-hosting our cnet live
pre-show which you can tune into at nine
a.m. pacific noon eastern yahoo has been
busy lately trying to revamp its image
and add new features the yahoo news feed
now includes tweets from politicians
celebrities and media outlets and there
are reports that Yahoo is trying to buy
the popular blogging site tumblr the
price tag could be as high as a billion
dollars buying tumblr could help Yahoo
bring back a younger audience if you're
a big pc gamer and you like being the
first with new gadget concepts then
you'll probably be someone who will
pre-order the Nvidia shield pre-orders
have begun for the android-based
portable gaming system you can find it
at newegg gamestop and canada computer
for three hundred and fifty dollars if
that sounds like a lot that's because it
is a lot you can get the new wii u
deluxe edition for that price we first
saw the shield at CES and it's this
controller with a flip-up 5-inch
touchscreen and if you have a high-end
in video based PC it'll stream full pc
games over a Wi-Fi connection so you can
start playing on your pc and then pick
up a game back in another room on your
shield there's a new app to help you
identify products that support the
causes you support it's called buycott
and the idea is that when you're at the
store you can learn more about a company
by scanning the product barcode and then
you vote with your wallet if the company
supports the causes you believe in as an
example let's say you support the idea
of labeling genetic
modified foods when I scan the barcode
of my lunch stouffer's frozen turkey
Tetrazzini classy I know it told me the
parent company Nestle donated more than
a million dollars against the campaign
to require GMO labeling in California so
it's an interesting look into the
products you buy there are all sorts of
campaigns some around human rights the
environment and social responsibility
the app is a little buggy as it
struggles to deal with high traffic but
it is free for iOS and coming soon to
Android that your tech news update you
can find more details at cnet com /
update from our studios in New York I'm
