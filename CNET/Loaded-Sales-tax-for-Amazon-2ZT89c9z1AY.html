Bridget Carey on cnet com and it's time
to get loaded you may be paying taxes
soon on Amazon purchases that is if
lawmakers get their way two Republican
senators are introducing a bill to force
amazon and other out-of-state online
stores to collect sales taxes and it's
being supported by retailers like
walmart and bestbuy but this isn't just
a Republican issue a few months ago some
Democratic lawmakers proposed a similar
action but according to wells fargo
study even if amazon started charging
tax it still would be ten percent
cheaper than buying from walmart so you
know when you get a facebook friend
request from someone you don't really
know but you see you have one front of
commons so you figure maybe i met this
person before you know they kind of look
familiar and then you add them to your
friends yeah well stop doing that there
are fake accounts trying to dupe you
into adding them and it's working a
university was able to do thousands of
users in Tuba friending bots and when
there was just one friend in common
where people were okay with saying yes
to the connection when added as a friend
the fake accounts could access profile
information and collected two hundred
and fifty gigabytes of personal data so
next time you get a friend request from
someone you don't remember don't just
blindly click accept if you're going to
buy a tablet this year perhaps as a gift
you need to be careful not to buy a
knockoff a report found more than 23,000
website listings for clone or
counterfeit tablet computers in a single
day to trick buyers into thinking
they're getting a discounted ipad or
motorola xoom they might blur the brand
name and a photo some tips for spotting
fakes if a strange sight is selling for
one that's more than fifty percent less
than everyone else it's probably too
good to be true and this might go
without saying for the savvy geek but
it's also a fake if there's selling one
that hasn't been released in stores yet
if you didn't think there were enough
daily deal Groupon clones out there
already another one launched today with
a simple name daily deals.com aside from
timing the launch just when groupon is
about to close the books on its IPO
tomorrow daily deals calm markets itself
as the anti groupon it won't do any
local deals just national
online merchants sprint nextel has
formed a Mobile Security Council to
fight the villainy that seeks to infect
our handsets with malware it's a growing
problem especially with Android phones
McAfee found 44 Android malware threats
just in the second quarter compared with
four on blackberry and none on the
iPhone the council consists of Ibn and
cisco systems as well as phone makers
like samsung and motorola but the two
biggest players in mobile Apple and
Google are not on the team that's like
having to justice league without Batman
or Superman those are your headlines for
