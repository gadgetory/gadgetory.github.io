the Kindle paperwhite yeah it's going in
the sand it's going in the Sun and it's
going in the water all those things
let's get it going let you know what I
think I could easily imagine us just
leaving it on the towel in the hot Sun
while we frolic in the cool cool water
mmm
shall we it's put there let's brolic
how about that thing's getting pretty
hot yeah we should probably check it out
yeah all right
1:32 I think it needs to cook a little
longer we should get a shave ice okay
your perceive ice
oh poor Kindle or Kindle do that thing
been hanging out in the Sun it's a
beautiful day it's got a nice tan I hope
so that's like the HUD flipped it over
because it just wasn't heating up enough
when it was face-up 140 you know I'm
saying this thing has been out here
about two hours yeah feel like that's
about as hot as it's gonna get
I agree I mean that's a real-world
situation yeah out of the Sun two hours
oh oh here why don't you take that yeah
that's really hot turn it on still
perfectly responsible problem Wow still
paperwhite II not so bad I mean we were
having a hard time sitting in the Sun
Kindle couldn't handle it no problem
okay Kindle
all right what do you say we drop our
Kindle on the beach it's time for the
Kindle to get it's From Here to Eternity
moment that's right ready yep oh no okay
no that's some dirty water hey let's do
that thing we're not supposed to do turn
around on oh no oh no oh no go oh no no
kiddos bro Oh Mayday Oh No
are we doing here yeah touch screens
freaking out a little bit but I wouldn't
say it's terrible
it's still working it's working upon
further reflection it won't come back to
life will come back to life I think we
may have actually killed her when we did
that thing you're not supposed to do
turn it back on yeah it was working fine
but then when we try to turn it off and
turn it back on didn't it didn't
surprise there good
so we'll dry it out of the Sun for a
little while we're still gonna drop it
but hopefully it'll recover later so
we're at a very windy beat off the Kona
Highway it's kind of post-apocalyptic
it's pretty crazy one of the locals told
me that he calls this Turtle Beach like
I don't see any turtles but I do see a
lot of dangerous looking lava rocks yes
it would be a shame if a Kindle fell on
one of those so anything's I do think
three two one
oh oh I miss the rocks completely how
much you missed the jagged rocks
o3o all right we have some scratching
and the screen held up though wipes your
screen took now but it's sharp to the
touch
scrappy to the tub you think one more
yeah go for it
maybe a little height this time three
two one
Oh beat up plenty but the screen is okay
I mean that's what you get with that
plastic backing it really can handle it
yeah I would say as far as the drop goes
pretty tough you can't really see if
it'll come on okay so the saltwater</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
