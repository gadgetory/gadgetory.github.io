as we all expected it's as beautiful as
it is absurdly expensive fortunately
there are some great SmartWatch options
out there beyond the Apple watch I'm
Donald Bell and this top-5 I'll be
counting down the best non Apple
smartwatches these features align the
closest to the Apple watch starting off
at number five the Moto 360 first
Android weird SmartWatch to really shake
things up with a round screen available
now for $250 the motor nails it on
high-end style and elegance comes with
either a black or brushed steel finish
with a bunch of classy leather wristband
options on the downside the Android wear
OS still needs some work and the battery
life tops out at around 20 L at number 4
Samsung gear 2 neo priced at $199 this
watch can track your heart rate display
phone notifications it can even change
the channel on your TV for better or
worse it runs Samsung's Tizen OS which
isn't half bad but don't expect it to
get the kind of app developer attention
that Google and Apple are getting also
don't expect it to work with any non
Samsung phones which is a pretty big
drawback coming in at number three LG G
watch R is 299 dollars so it's on the
high end but still less than an Apple
watch that said it looks like a nice
expensive watch you get a round face
like that Moto 360 but with a more
attractive more watch like design and
longer battery life the only hitch here
is the Android wear software that
plagued the Moto 360 but knowing Google
will see a significant update pushed out
this year the newest kid on the block
comes in at number two pebble time now
we haven't officially reviewed this one
and thing's not out until May but it
looks like a real contender from a
company that basically started this
whole SmartWatch craze you can get one
for as low as $159 comes with a color
e-ink screen and a mature OS that
already has over 6,000 apps available
work with Android and iOS and it can run
a whole week from a single charge the
only downside I can see here is that the
design looks a little
which brings us to my number one pick
for the best Apple watch alternative the
pebble steel it may be last year's
pebble but still getting the same
updated software as the pebble time and
unlike the time you can go out and buy
this watch right now prices dropped $200
and best of all it looks like a grown-up
watch great battery life lots of apps
and it doesn't care what smartphone you
have so there you go five great
smartwatches that all cost less than an
Apple watch all the latest smart watch
