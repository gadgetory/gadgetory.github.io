hosts that travel to different music
festivals across the country a murder
case in Arkansas is grabbing the
attention of the tech community as law
enforcement involved in the
investigation is requesting a transcript
of all the communication the accused had
with his Amazon echo amazon has pushed
back saying there doesn't seem to be
evidence that the information is crucial
to the case and that any customers
interaction with Alexa is covered under

has voted on a rule that will absorb
internet providers with less than
250,000 subscribers from disclosing
information like network performance
data caps bees and other vital metrics
that ultimately protect consumers this
also opens up a loophole for larger
companies to break up their service
areas to sneak in under that 250,000
mark
