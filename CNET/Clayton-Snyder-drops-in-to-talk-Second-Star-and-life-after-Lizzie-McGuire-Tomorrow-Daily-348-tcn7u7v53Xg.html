green Goblin's favorite new invention
the flyboard air we talk about the
volocopter and its 18 rotor electric
goodness and we also talk about star
shot project and whether or not we can
reach Alpha Centauri with 20 little
spaceships in 20 years
also actor Clayton Snyder stops by to
talk about his new pilot second star we
also do it back at her Hackett would you
or would you not buy a portable DNA lab
we're gonna answer that question some
our daily reader you citizens of the
internet welcome to tomorrow daily the
best eat talk show well we're knowing
we're gonna know more maybe after
today's episode we don't really know
what's out there they if Stephen Hawking
is successful we might find out we are
not in fact the best ki talk show in the
known universe it could be an alpha so
disappointing it's our thing this is
amazing geek talk show over an Elfa
sorry guys are missing out I'm Ashley
schism I'm Geoff kanata let's dip shall
we not even dip was dive deep dive right
in bed driving this is the deep end
headlines
there's not a lot of speculation about
flyboard this is like right up front we
got to talk about fly board air because
some people are saying this is fake do
you think it's fake well here's the
thing if it was just some Rando flying
it around I'd be like this is obviously
super phony as phony as that skier
getting chased by a bear video that's
pretty hilarious by those hilarious but
also super fake yeah but this guy is the
actual it's Franky Zapata this is the
guy who invented the water jetpack thing
they like which I want to do still want
to do haven't done yet you can go to
like a resort in the Caribbean you could
try it out
but yeah so he has this you could see
he's got a little controller in his hand
I was very dramatic but yeah this
controller apparently controls the the
turbine yeah but is rad so some people
on reddit I love I am a longtime lurker
guys on reddit um some people on reddit
were saying like oh I don't believe it
because he's so steady on it but the
thing is is if he's the inventor of it
he obviously probably has the most
flight time out of anybody you know and
it's just like getting on one of the
wheelie boards right where electric
wheelie board because I won't call it a
hover board because this is a hover
board where the more you do it the
better you get at it
right here's why I do think it's real
okay it's over water like it to do it
fake he's probably gonna have to be
hanging from a crane of some kind which
is hard to do over water and by that
there's really no reason to have them be
over water unless it's real if it's real
I want to be over water cuz if I fall
I'm gonna I want to land in water yeah
I'm buying it right now and you know
fool me once of course many times but
still I want it to be real and I want to
try it I want it to be real too a lot of
people have said this is the part that
kind of they're they want to talk about
which is that the takeoff and landing is
not really shown all that well like all
very clearly or in one shot they kind of
cut but I mean listen what's so yeah
watch so here he comes and then all of a
sudden oh like oh it's a second like
yeah that's between those shots so it
sort of feels like well maybe there's
something there that's a little fishy
but you're right he's an inventor of a
thing that's an actual thing so why what
motivation would he have
to do a fake thing right it's not like
lexis faking us out with them for the
thing don't you understand what the
experiment that I just don't understand
what the motivation would be here other
than gotcha right but who knows I mean
it looks litter it is a Green Goblin
flight plan yeah I mean I'm really a
hoverboard is like a flying board that's
like kind of yeah this is not even a
hundred oh you're right this is really a
board like the name implies the flyboard
air it's pretty good so we got a we
gotta get a hold these guys and make
sure that we can try it cuz I want yeah
fly board try it call Frankie we know
you're big fan of the show call us up
just like you on uh okay so going from
one form of aerial transportation to
another let's assess the volocopter
which is very real yes and has been real
for years and years and years this has
been a development for I believe six
years and so this is in Germany and it
took them forever to get all the proper
permits to be able to do this yeah they
finally did a manned flight so it's a
human sized drones drum it's a it's a
big giant drone with a cockpit for a
person yeah which is the best I think
this is awesome and it allows them to
fly in a much more agile way than you
could with a regular helicopter indeed
and that is pretty exciting the idea of
being able to have this be you know who
knows it could be like a search and
rescue vehicle well it could be an uber
that I would love an uber and be like oh
I'll just super Volo like uber bolo get
it game over you know they actually do
have Ober helicopters I know they had a
chopper where you can take a little tour
but I like this is like personal
transfer like oh I got to get from the
west side to to the valley to Burbank
and in 20 minute please Oh call me a
chopper but okay so let's discuss what
this volocopter is all about because I
thought there were some really
interesting advancements in technology
here that we didn't get to talk about
because one you weren't here but also I
was and I was all alone so it would be
really weird if I was talking about it
to myself they designed this with
electric motors so it's much quieter
than a standard motor it's they said
it's ecologically sound they're really
big on making sure this is
environmentally friendly they said
the vulva copter is acoustically much
more pleasant due to its design and it's
much quieter than conventional
helicopters they also are they talk a
lot about battery technology development
as they've gone through this and they
also said it's very simple to fly so
apparently well helicopters are
notoriously not right a helicopter is
trying to flip you over all the time and
your job as the pilot is to not let it
is to not let it but because this has 18
rotors it's a lot more stable and on top
of that it automatically adjusts for
turbulence which is really handy and
then it's controlled by a single
joystick that's it it's it's a simple
single joystick that you control your
flight for for stalling pitch adjustment
glide angle those things that are sort
of really difficult to master in a
helicopter this they want to make that
much easier which I thought was great
this thing go very fast
um not tear not terribly yet um but they
I think now that they have had a man
flight go I think that they're they're
probably gonna ramp that up pretty
pretty well and I would imagine the
flight time is not a long time yeah and
it you know obviously looks like very
small amount of cargo to passengers tops
backpack yeah so it's not you know it's
not gonna replace any kind of vehicles
we have know at the moment but it does
have a hold a lot of promise for the
future as far as these kinds of multi
multi rotor electric vehicle yeah it's
pretty cool
and as we get further and further into
self-driving and autonomous vehicles
that also will apply to aerial vehicles
as well so instead of you know like some
people will still fly single-engine
cessnas for fun but if you want to get
from point A to point B I'm sure being
able to just hire an autonomous robot to
take you from you know LA to Palm
Springs for the weekend would be a lot
cheaper than hiring a pilot to do a Z
pretty cool I want to say I wouldn't say
they're just cut to the guy like with
his cell phone controlling it like I
know just like think the joystick does
stuff but it's the guy on the side with
okay so our last headline story we have
talked about a star shot project which
you talked about yesterday
this is pretty exciting stuff this is
this to me is so much science fiction
become
reality it blows my mind yeah the idea
that we could we could explore that far
out and go that close to the speed of
light you see it's 20% but that's still
a hundred million miles an hour
ridiculous really fast really really
really really I'm the key here is that
it's because these are very small
spacecraft yeah these are nano they're
calling them nano crafts and they're
they're teeny tiny rockets and they
believe that by using light sail
technology which we've talked about
before on the show by using light sail
technology they can increase the speed
at which these nano crafts travel up to
20% of the speed of light the idea here
is that you have a solar sail which
actually catches a sail photons and uses
that to propel it and the only reason
that can do that is because the thing is
propelling is so ridiculously light
small and light that it actually can use
light waves to propel it through and
it's great it's a cumulative process
it's not that it continually needs the
same it's like you know some photons
give it some give it some thrust there
and that continues because it's in space
yeah so as they get more and more and
more it goes faster faster faster faster
my question is like what are they gonna
do once they get into Alpha Centauri
like what are they they're went oh no
moving so fast at some point like well I
guess I would imagine a part of that has
to do with the light the ground-based
light beam er that they're saying that
would help get it you know start the
journey but the thing is is like this is
pretty incredible stuff really heady
ideas from Stephen Hawking and Co
there Yuri Milner has invested a whole
boatload of money into this I don't
understand I same thing I brought up
yesterday is how are you how are we
going to get any information back from
this thing because the information is
not going to travel at the speeds that
the device is traveling so in order to
have any kind of even information that
it got to where we sent it it's gonna
take a ridiculously long time to find
out right so I think it would not take a
ridiculously long amount of time but
obviously I mean when you think about
like Mars which is far but not nearly as
far as the nearest star system our
neighboring star system it takes what
how long is it is it 20
one minute sir like that so so for me
it's I think it'll take a while to get
that information back but if you're
sending back something like an image and
in light to be a light it might not be
that bad or if it's like a laser like I
don't know I think I think this is
actually part of the part of the process
with projects with starship project is
they want to work out exactly how they
could get this data back they also had
said one of the big things they felt
confident about was that all of the
technology to accomplish this already
exists or is very close to being created
or is in you know in development
basically right now so that that to me
is super impressive I think they're just
these little nano BOTS is just gonna
have a little teeny tiny rolled-up piece
of paper in them that has a Stephen
Hawking phone number just call me just
whoever finds it just give us a call you
know and then all of a sudden tomorrow
what would it be like it wouldn't even
be tomorrow daily it would be some other
show name some aliens hosting a parallel
sort of a star system version of our
show and they're like who's this guy
Stephen Hawking was the best gig talk
show in the universe in the entire
universe that's like that maybe we
should have some sort of best geek talk
show off with them and we find out who
truly is I like it yeah I'm willing to
fight for the right to that title we're
not gonna just be honest go down without
a fight why do you think gangs is
actually a weapon I don't know if
anybody knows he's ready and yeah Jeff
will wield lightsaber we'll be fine um
bring it on
last thing last thing I will say about
starship project is they say because of
the economies of scale and computer
components of the price and everything
they said eventually they'll be able to
send these Rockets out in a space for
just a few hundred thousand dollars Oh
chump change yeah I got that in my couch
a problem we're gonna take a quick break
we'll be back with Clayton Schneider is
it oh you're not gonna want to miss this
it's a fun interview he's a really great
guy super delightful and you might also
see Logan in a in a dancing ninjas video
maybe oh is it that thing so stick
around it's tomorrow Daly
our guest this week you might know from
Lizzie McGuire he played the beautifully
quaffed
ethan yes and now he is starring in a
beautiful little pilot that you should
see online called second star we're very
excited to welcome Clayton Snyder here
Thank You Clayton for coming thank you
guys for having so polite you are thank
you yeah so you first of all we I kind
of want to just put it out there that
you have known producer Logan for a
while I have known producer Logan for
some time since a guy he is a guy and hi
Logan we can't hear him on this show
kitchen no we don't we don't like to
give him microphone we take make sense
I'm doing yeah we've been doing in fact
video stuff since since back in high
school we we had we had a few called
classics I was in the dancing in this
video Logan can you pull we don't show
it now people will be very upset yeah
well I think we'll put that it will put
it in post okay all right what you're
doing you're doing more video stuff now
you you you've been on television and
you are all the video stuff you're back
with a kind of an interesting new way to
get on television right yeah at least
the latest thing that's been going on
so the Lizzie McGuire soap quaffed what
does that mean nice haircut
okay feel like quaff is one of those
words that like you know what it means
but you can't really define it anyway I
think in general I didn't mean like I
was insulted okay what's cool is that
the quad also in the dictionary next to
quaffed yeah you just clicked on
Wikipedia and that's what came up yes so
second star Disney large company
different branches including Disney XD
and maker studios start of this
initiative where maker studios would
reach out to creatives who were
producing content
that might be good people to ask if they
wanted to pitch ideas for a show and if
they liked it give you a little bit of
money
give us a proof-of-concept and see where
we go from there pretty much this is a
way to sort of reach out to people that
maybe didn't have an avenue to make
stuff already and allow sort of influx
of new blood new ideas right exactly
yeah so you guys or was it you or you
just know sue uh my good friend richard
allen is now executive producer so
Disney XD through this owns the project
technically then it's like we own this
if we decide to take it exactly but the
contract is actually signed under Disney
as a whole so it could still be brought
to different branches within the Walt
Disney Company yeah so what is the idea
that he had that got them to say hey
let's make a proof-of-concept well you
know there's that tone dick you can have
with the Disney shows very light bubbly
kind of fun controlled family but what
was cool about second star one that it
is musically oriented show people loved
that and also that it can deal with
slightly darker issues that aren't
really talked about or put up on TV
they're much like you're dealing with
three orphans essentially and an older
brother that's trying to you know
support his family
keep it together yeah under the shadow
of their grandfather who is this
fantastic music producer and you know
his father like had dreams excuse me my
character Lucas's father had dreams to
kind of step into the music scene
himself and there was a tragic accident
and all sudden weirdest kind of left
where we are so in the shadow of a
legacy but also not being attached from
it and detached from it and trying to
figure out where we fit in all this you
know can I still pursue my dreams as
musician while still trying to support
my younger brother and sisters so it's
like oh that's a Disney show yeah may be
fun with the like you said with the
inclusion of music you have this
opportunity to really make something not
light-hearted but something really
enjoyable something people feel good
about after they're done watching it
like yeah feel like wow that was a real
I don't feel like I just watched the
walk
yeah but not necessarily like oh my dad
is dead but let's play music it's it's
it's it's not like ignoring these facts
anyway but it's just kind of like that's
still that Avenue of expression and how
you can still overcome your
circumstances by following a certain
passion things that give you life it's
cool because this idea isn't something
that necessarily would have been pitched
within Disney you guys have the
opportunity to bring it from it outside
and have this quite outside the box yeah
yes sort of you know almost like a
Kickstarter of being able to give it a
shot that's a good analogy yeah so uh so
we kind of talked about how this is sort
of a really non-traditional way of kind
of moving this towards television yeah
and how you kind of started with you
know with Lizzie McGuire and everything
that you were doing when you were
younger this is kind of a really
interesting sort of change of pace for
you like could you want to talk a little
bit about the differences between what
it was like to be on a show like Lizzie
McGuire which is obviously a very big
very you know well-funded production and
then doing something much more indie you
know what are obviously there's there
are the money differences the big
difference but for you as an actor you
know what's the thing that you really
love about working with an indie as
opposed to a big production company or
vice-versa
yeah it's almost like I like what I'm
doing now was what I should have had to
been doing then almost but when I was
just starting out you know I was one of
the lucky ones I was only acting
professionally like going out on
auditions for like a year and a half
before Liz McGuire came around and boom
that was kind of the first thing that I
really bought it's not happens for
everybody yeah that's just like let's
make your budget yeah you know like
figure self like kick out about what
like well it's around that range exactly
super easy happy stories that's awesome
yeah so it was a really cool opportunity
it almost seemed kind of surreal they
weren't even sure they're gonna use my
character and at that time it's just
like there is a Disney show that they're
making cold liz mcguire it had
thing behind the name whatsoever and for
it to have become what it became was
pretty amazing and especially for the
kind of show that it was because looking
back on it it was so successful I think
because it dealt with a lot of very real
issues that kids in middle school were
dealing with but never really had a an
outlet to talk about right you know but
to answer your question what it's like
going from this perspective so I took a
good time away from acting to live life
to be with my friends that I grew up
with that's why your normal go to school
to play water polo and you know live
that life for a little bit but I knew I
wanted to come back so go ahead but to
answer your question
getting on Liz McGuire I was only acting
professionally for like a year and a
half like going on auditions meaning and
then got the part but back then it was
just like there's this new show that's
gonna be made for Disney and it didn't
have anything behind that then it's a
penis
pretty big thing yeah yeah yeah because
I talked about a lot of you know real
issues that kids in middle school dealt
with and which is pretty cool and then
took some time off to be with friends
and go to school and do water polo
things and I've been back in it for the
past two three years and just kind of
it's it's good to have that on your
resume you had the experience and you
might have some following with that and
then just building that network is
essentially because with acting you are
this product that you're selling and I
can't exactly say hey look at what I did
because that's a very different product
Clayton at 15 then he is at 22 6 7 8 so
they're like ok but who are you now so
haven't you know been doing a lot of
student films a lot of indie films a lot
of sketches a lot of Shore it's been a
lot of live improv live musical stuff
and so many features now and now this is
kind of one of the latest things that's
come
with second star that's cool so you have
experience building something into which
is super cool and super fun yeah yeah so
what's just as an actor what's the
what's the dream gig what's the what's
the thing that you want to do most oh
man if you could be cast in the like the
biggest movie you'll ever be in or the
biggest TV show like what would it be
what would what would that be you could
make like an Indiana Jones Jurassic Park
Star Wars hybrid somewhere in there into
that night yeah so you know like Chris
Pratt and we'll work together great he
does in fact watch the show okay
fantastic
I'm sorry guys like I mean like that's
like his role on Parks and Rec which is
fantastic
that was like like the Ethan craft of
that show sure and then for him to go
off and all sudden be like voice-over
for lego movie and star-lord come on
pretty pretty good yeah so all this is
fun nice and everything but I want to
hear about is that water polo stuff you
want to hear about a professional water
polo player yeah former and still still
get in the water yeah but I mean this is
this is a thing we don't so much have
here in the States but you had actually
go overseas to be a professional right
yeah so I was I've been playing since I
was eight years old and gone from
various clubs and four high school team
and played for Pepperdine and college
hail waves and was about to I did film
studies at Pat and then was about to get
into acting directing after that didn't
have an actual game plan at all it was
like yeah let's jump in and because
that's what I did before I can do it
again like a year and a half and I'm
like great going again and then Terry
Schroeder you know various time Olympian
former Olympic head coach he has like
three silver medals and that time
current national team head coach is like
late now like the we play um you know if
you keep improving we got a shot at
making the national team it's very
soft-spoken gentlemen I'm Harry and I
was like okay well I need to either
gotta go for that opportunity so I was
from there you can't really stay in the
States we
you you can certainly train like with
the national team but if you really want
to improve you got to play up as you can
imagine guys been part of sports teams
like that's how you get better and play
against people who are better than you
right and hopefully in like a
competitive setting like games so we
don't have that for that when you're
outside of college you know you're just
plain against college guys in Europe is
there is there is it televised live it's
a big it's a thing I got some amazing
stadiums over there we had some like
over here too but it's not as regular as
it is over there because if you think
about it this way they're just different
avenues like the Eastern Europe its kind
of words its strongest so your Serbia
your Montenegro Croatia Italy's you play
in this place I played in Italy Hungary
and Montenegro cool yeah experience yeah
it was amazing experience they're very
good it's very difficult it's rough
right underneath the water people are
punching in yes crap what the right
doesn't see kind of goes water polo it
trained you for Hollywood yes I can I
can make it in this town below sea level
beatings okay so with second star you
guys are it's it's 15 minutes you're
incorporating music into this pilot you
can see it on second star TV right watch
it um so in the in court with
incorporating music you also sing
apparently people like it okay I've been
I've been reading the cotton like
comments and people are just say
positive things they say nice things how
what is it like potentially I mean let's
say let's say Disney picks it up to go
to series I mean you you are gonna
you're gonna be singing a lot I'm all
what I was saving for this interview is
actually my debut album coming out
nicely I'm totally kidding there's not a
drop no musics always been actually like
a very big part of my life I was in
choir when I was a kid and had voice
lessons this never really pursued it
professionally I was kind of thrown into
a lot of stuff and arts and athletics
growing up and you know play guitar here
and there played out the saxophone
briefly little bass guitar and it's
always been a sobbing no it's it's it's
it's fun and was able to just keep music
incorporated through out my life somehow
and so it's cool to have an avenue to
kind of do that yeah that's sweet
so he's saying guys he sings he acts he
plays water polo I feel like I'm like
selling you to that I don't know so this
15 minute proof of concept is is out now
yeah what does it need to be more what
do you need to have happen for it's a
great question what they should do much
bigger so this is a proof of concept and
you may have heard of the term pilot so
you know it's like the first episode
kind of like is this gonna be a thing
we'll see people like it so proof of
concept is a smaller version of that at
a smaller budget so that's essentially
what this video is proof of concept so
it's like not even a pilot and it's
being broadcasted out there to see hey
like people do a sim and
just one so there are various methods to
track the hits of people watching the
show or going into the website a website
and checking it in or going to the
Facebook page and there are eyes on that
and there's no quota of like okay soon
as it gets X amount of use for X amount
of lags or X amount of shares we're
gonna take it to network it's just time
will tell gets more views check it out
essentially the right interest right the
right interest from the right amount of
people then you're right and also like
the demographic will also dependent like
will decide what networking gets picked
up on she has a pretty vast network
exactly whether it's actual joining your
ABC or Disney XD network so dependent
age range or which gender is more kin to
it for whatever reason so I'm gonna do
two things
wrap this up do I'm gonna go watch that
show watch that show and I'm also going
to check out and see if I can find any
streams of European water polo there's a
lot because now I'm very important I
want to become where Bo ah I want to be
a fan I want to become a fan shower
response amazing thank you so much for
coming on the show really appreciate
second star TV that's where you can find
it go do that thing go watch that thing
you must do it let's watch that thing it
is imminent is an imperative that you
watch it thank you so much again for
being with us and thank you come back
back when your album drops okay all
right we'll be right back guys but stick
around tomorrow daily
welcome back everybody
ah he's so fun Michael just in case
you're wondering we don't just like
switch clothes for the interview
pre-taped it but i switch clothes every
time yeah I've costume changes during
every show I'm a prima donna um yeah no
he was great so thank you again to
Clayton for coming out and chillin with
us as he was super fun he's so nice um
also dancing ninjas video A+ are you
ready to talk about into it let's do it
so I saw civil war this week I know I'm
so jealous but I'm not gonna talk about
that I'm gonna talk about something else
I don't want to give it all away my
reviews up on Sina comm by the way if
anyone wants to read it uh I'm super
into Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank oh it's so great me
too I'm into that the remake of the ps4
is it's on ps4 now it is so pretty one
like the graphics are unbeliev do you
remember when the ps2 was coming out and
they were like you're gonna have toys
story level you've never seen graphics
like this well guess what guys you've
never seen graphics like this this is
and it's they they are pulling from this
is like a game wait it's like a game
based on the movie that's based on the
game right so it is insomniac games
that's that is game play that is live
gameplay when you saw him running that
that's real that is live laughing like a
Pixar movie it's it's that good looking
at its delightful it is so funny it's
it's just as pithy and snarky and
ridiculous and funny as it has ever been
mr. zerkin is my favorite ever like I
mean do you not understand how to die
mr. zerkin will teach you anything you
know it's the same week the Dark Souls 3
comes out and I you know those games are
cool and everything but remember when
games would just pure fun yeah that's
what this game is guys there's a gun
that turns your enemies into 8-bit
characters yeah the pixel later and
gotta get it there are moments when
you'll kill so many things on screen and
they
all turn into little bits little nuts
and bolts everywhere yeah and you're
just getting like this cascade this is
bolt City because you're it's magnetic
and it's just the best thing ever and
seriously you guys if you're not playing
Ratchet and Clank go get it if you have
a ps4 it's worth your what's worth your
time
boy I certainly certainly second that
you're so right on my into it has a
little darker tone guys oh my god I feel
a Jeff rant coming on I feel the heat
flames
here's the problem Ashley you know you
know we are both super excited about VR
yeah you watch this show we talk about
VR constantly we're ready for the VR
future oh my gosh 2016 it's VR time Jeff
excited he pre-ordered both VR heads
both oh my god March 28th that's coming
out April whatever you don't know yeah
oh it's awesome then you're gonna get
ready for the guess what guess how many
of my two VR headsets have been
delivered to me
none of them zero of them and I got an
email this week from oculus saying by
the way my oculus order can't win in 12
minutes after was it just a picture of
lucky yeah it's just like double middle
fingers they're like you're not looking
second can I'm not lucky you never ever
get yeah uh telling me that even though
I got my order in 12 minutes after it
went on sale by by the way I tried to
get an even early I was clicking
clicking clicking that's as fast as I
could do it I'm sure
two months after launch is when I should
now expect my oculus to arrive which I
heard there's some component problems
like which is the most vague weird
explanation do you think that maybe if
you take a pre-order two months before
your your thing is supposed to launch
that maybe you should check to see if
the components are available isn't the
whole point of pre-orders to actually
know how many people you're going to
have to deliver these things to that's
the whole point of pre-ordering right
Ashley i pre-ordered a car two years in
advance yes that is the point and and
Andy Lama said oh we got a rethink
production cuz cuz Wow did a lot of you
guys ordered cars and now we know we
know we
this cool lead time because it's a
pre-order CVS we have now information as
to how many we have to deliver now I
will freely admit this is the epitome of
first word problems and the mean getting
upset about not being able to have my
new toy is I understand it's petulant
and and whatever but still any company
the thing is I believe in VR and I want
it to succeed and these companies are
screwing it up they're not helping you
think you make your case right these are
already very expensive things and the
fact that you can't even deliver us any
number of them and guess what guys vive
is no better at least at least oculus
now has told me when to expect my
shipment vive is still like april-ish we
think we hope I don't know I you know
pre-ordered that the moment it went on
sale - it is the fact that both of these
companies are having these problems
it really is marring what should be a
completely transcendent moment in the
computer history of computers because
these are I was talking to somebody this
weekend about it VR is the most magical
technological experience I've had since
the first moment of using the very first
Apple phone like it really is that thing
that you always crave with technology
we're like oh my gosh this feels like
the future and the fact that they're
screwing it up this much and making
people cancel their pre-orders and and
you know losing you know messing up
credit card transactions all this stuff
it's so messy and disappointing on every
level and that's why I'm into this week
I'm into staring at my screen refreshing
to hope that they'll be an email saying
that things should be arriving and I'm
getting the oculars email it's killing
me your ended disappointment that's what
you're into hey do you know we forgot to
do a whole segment of the show what we
should do back at our hackett let's do
that maybe make me feel better
I don't know if there's gonna make you
feel better cuz I might start ranting
this time so we're gonna talk about
bento lab it's got about a week left in
their campaign they're on Kickstarter
this is a portable DNA lab yeah so we
can have DNA tests on the go on the go
which is you know I know that when I am
out and about there is nothing I want
more so many times during the day I'm
like god I wish I had a portable DNA lab
with me right now
and ya know nobody says that nobody says
that one of the use cases that they
suggest on this this website let's let's
discuss here they're like here's what
you can do with it you can extract DNA
so they got the centrifuge right there
they're like you can copy DNA clone
stuff on the go oh yeah sure why not and
then you can also visualize DNA so
they're like really into that too I like
that so I never have to eat alone again
I can just clone myself and have a lunch
buddy who needs children when you could
just raise another you I'm saying uh so
huh they're already uh okay I'll get to
the price in a minute um here's here's
of course the number one question is
what can I do with a bento lab and
they've answered this on their
Kickstarter page which I've been
terribly fascinating and also
ridiculous they said for example you can
explore your genetic makeup see if your
taste buds detect bitter flavors by
testing your variation of the PTC gene
like that's fun okay that's kind of like
a fun feels like giving a kid like a
home microscope to play with sure but
for adults uh check if you're built for
endurance by testing your variation of
the athlete's gene actn three which I
clearly do not possess well I've never
heard of the athlete gene I'm not built
for endurance I played volleyball it's a
sprint not a marathon thank you test if
you're likely be lactose intolerant
explore how blood group genotyping works
Wow you know how you can also test if
you're lactose intolerant drink some
milk have a bite of ice get some cheese
there's so many options no but I think I
think you know the idea that it's
encouraging people to learn more about
their genetic makeup maybe it's a good
thing fair enough and I think that there
are companies
you know like 23andme and stuff that
have made sort of DNA DNA information
really popular it's really hot right now
but here's here's where it gets weird
guys here's what gets weird gets a
little weird you can examine your food
at a molecular level test a hamburger to
see if it contains horse meat Oh
investigate your beer for bacteria that
spoil it identify GMOs and learn about
genetic engineering then then they talk
about X this is where it gets scary I
like the idea that you could put a
hamburger in there and then the screen
it just says horse is 100% ours mate you
can characterize biodiversity it says
extract ancient DNA from fossils oh
sweet all those fossils that I have now
finally are useful all the fossils I've
laying around yeah test the gender of
birds from a feather or spot of blood
identify species with DNA barcoding you
can also get research done so they asked
for over 500 people how they would use
Vento lab which I'm assuming these
people who made been to lab know a bunch
of scientists right like this you would
think you would think those I hope they
are sighs no I want to ask they go like
a soccer mom how are you gonna use a DNA
lab right but they said field scientists
looking for easy to carry equipment
citizen scientist solving social
problems mycologist foragers farmers
veterinary students designers artists
brewers chefs interested in molecular
gastronomy bioscience students teachers
sharing hands-on practicals that I get
and curious folk with an interest in DNA
oh that's us we're curious spoke with an
interest in DNA that is me are you ready
to buy are you in how much how much
here's what I will pay for this here's
what I will pay you tell me if this is
in my price range I would pay a hundred
and fifty dollars for this no that can
happen how much how what percentage of
one will I get about $200 200 $15 you
can get an add-on for the kit oh but if
you would like a bento lab yeah
right now there's classroom bento but if
you want the launch special which has
already sold out it's $800 woof
that's a VR I can't get um hey but you
know what they might actually ship this
to you before your headsets sad but true
these are
reusable you can use them as are they or
do you use them up like the $800 how
many DNA tests do I get for $800 well
they have like they have the essential
accessories like I loved it I feel like
I'm trying to sell something on an
infomercial but we see this as an
infomercial is be amazing yeah
so they're saying it have you always
wondered if your hamburger is horse meat
horses
it has the Bentall lab accessories so
power gel they have this gel box at a
user handbook but there are also add-on
stuff so it's like you can add on
classroom bento it's like you can add on
a starter kit it has like that has like
ten little experiments that you can do
inside the centrifuge like okay so hey
guys you're spending about $1,000 just
to see if your hamburgers made of course
me you know what I say spend that money
on better hamburgers spend that money on
VR that you're never gonna get shipped
to your house yeah that's adjusted yeah
that's why I can't afford a bento box
anymore cuz I bought two VRS that didn't
arrive um
I'm of two minds about this okay one I
totally see the application like a
microscope or some sort of science kit
that you would get to to promote
learning and curiosity among kids our
students last term science lab that be I
think that's cool the other side of this
is I bet this thing does not work as its
limited results yeah very limited sort
of like when you get an easy-bake oven
right and you're like I'm gonna bake a
cake and then you bake this thing and
it's not even close to what it looks
like on the box much less actually taste
or look like a cake yeah and then you're
just living with disappointment in your
stomach it's that week it's that except
DNA but with DNA and the other idea the
other thing is like if you're gonna use
this as a kid you have to like pick
yourself and get blood I don't know I
don't like to ask those as asswipe
anyway interesting interesting it seems
pretty pricey for what it offers
it really does so I'm gonna pass on it
but hey if you're really into DNA pick
up a bento lab you got about a week left
if any of you are actually getting the
bento lab email please let us know
because we want to know if this thing
works maybe the classrooms that watch us
will get it for their science labs okay
you're ready to talk about phone talking
with you and wrap this up do it alright
Nick sent us an email and I've been
writing back and forth with Nick for
about a couple days and Nick wrote us
and sent us this picture and said for
your Landmark Monument theme I thought
it only appropriate to take this
gorgeous picture the Eiffel Tower on my
iPhone six-plus
while picnicking with my brother I've
been an international business student
in Paris for the past three years
originally from Chicago and graduating
in three weeks you of course have my
permission to use this photo and then he
sent me another email and said I just
wanted to tell you a quick story as we
were looking at this beautiful picture

best friend my brother father do a
gorgeous two-year-old girl Julianne died
in a car crash due to snowy conditions
and he's he flew in from his study
abroad in Paris to come to the funeral
services and he said I know this might
be asking too much but I wanted to try
anyways to honor his memory I hoped you
could mention something even all the way
at the end of the show just to say a
little something for him he started
GoFundMe for his his I guess it would be
his niece his nieces college fund and
funeral expenses for his parents but he
says and I thought this was really sweet
I wanted to read exactly in his words
how much his brother meant to him and
and for a fan of the show will do
anything for you guys
he says Julian Paris was a loving son a
mischievous brother loyal friend caring
husband and an exemplary father he said
just two years ago we went skydiving
together and that was one of the only
times I've ever seen a mattress actually
petrified of doing something crazy I'm
gonna miss him and thank you for giving
someone as great as him the time to be
appreciated so Julian you you will be
missed and you are clearly loved by
everybody who knew you and thank you

us permission use on the show yes and if
you want to find us on social media or
share the show just head over to
tomorrow daily comm and we will be back
next week yes we will brand-new docket
of weird science fact meeting science
fiction of making us so happy you guys
it's so good um thank you again to
everybody involved with making of this
week's show of the long show it was
really good one we have so much fun
Clayton Snyder thank you for coming on
the show Nick thank you for sending in
