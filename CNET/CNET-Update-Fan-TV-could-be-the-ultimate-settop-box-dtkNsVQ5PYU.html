I'm Bridget Carey and this is just seen
that update the company behind the app
Manhattan has announced the launch of
fan TV it's a small box you hook up to
your TV that will streaming video from
services like Netflix and Hulu but it
will also integrate with your cable TV
service and DVR recordings all in one
interface it includes this button list
touch remote that has users swipe to
navigate this isn't available yet but
the company showed off some screenshots
of the interface which looks very
polished and get this fan TV says it can
replace the need for a separate cable
box and DVR so it would work with cable
providers to just be the one box you
need to handle everything that sounds
like a dream to have everything in one
but fan TV has not said which cable
providers it is working with so who
knows if it'll actually work out or if
the cable providers will want to work
with fan TV the company says it will
launch sometime later this year and
there's no pricing announced yet so I
guess we'll have to wait and see Twitter
made a strange change to its list
feature by increasing how many lists you
can make on Twitter a list is a way to
organize users by different topics such
as creating a list just for people who
talk about tech before you could create
20 lists each with 500 accounts in them
now users can make up to 1,000 lists and
each of those lists can have 5,000
accounts I mean more than 20 I guess is
nice but who needs a thousand lists
ain't nobody got time for that android
fans have been eagerly waiting for news
about the mysterious Moto X phone and we
finally have confirmation that it will
arrive sometime between now and October
ever since google purchased motorola
mobility we've been waiting with that
next generation of Motorola phones would
look like motorola CEO dennis woodside
gave hints about the Moto X during an
interview at the all things digital
conference he said he had the Moto X in
his pocket but he wouldn't take it out
to show the audience however he said
this phone is able to know what's going
on around it and he could fire up the
camera just by taking it out of his
pocket and that it would act differently
when you're in a car driving and he said
the phone can pull all this off without
joining the battery faster than other
phones hmm interesting and for those who
don't want to wait until October for a
new phone google announced it will sell
an unlocked pure android version of the
HTC one on jun 26th which means you'll
be paying six hundred dollars up front
since it's not subsidized by a carrier
contract that's your tech news update
