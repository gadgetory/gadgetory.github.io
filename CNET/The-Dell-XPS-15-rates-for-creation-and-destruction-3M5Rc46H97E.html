15 inch notebook and made it even better
the XPS 15 retains the lines terrific
screen premium builds felt design and
full feature set then it boosts it for
2017 with the latest processors from
Intel and NVIDIA and I think the result
blows the MacBook Pro out of the water
for photo and graphics work as well as
gaming the system is one of the first
laptops to incorporate in videos newest
notebook graphics processor the GTX 1050
the 1050 is the lowest end model in
invidious new notebook line to
incorporate its current Pascal
architecture in addition to giving the
system pretty solid gaming performance
it's also improved battery optimization
you'll probably want to play at HD
rather than 4k for faster on-the-fly
rendering and performance though games
really look good in 4k the system's
traditional WorkFirst design isn't great
for dedicated gamers and laptops with
the 1060 TI will deliver better
performance but it's a great
general-purpose system that should also
satisfy you if you occasionally feel the
need to kill demons battery life at
least with the 97 watt hour cell is
pretty good at seven plus hours
streaming video if you're like me and
run it full throttle even on battery for
games and design work
you'll probably get closer to four hours
well there's tons I like about the
system the one serious design flaw
remains the webcam is at the bottom left
of the display that's the trade-off for
the attractively thin bezel but it's a
real pain and it's probably why Dell
incorporated a fingerprint sensor for
Windows hello
instead of facial recognition the system
also vents out the bottom so it can get
kind of hot where there isn't a lot of
airflow such as sitting on a desk and
the intermittent fan spin up is kind of
loud too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
