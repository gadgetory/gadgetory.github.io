the apple byte it's all the good of bad
inside the world of Apple so let's get
to the show and talk about the next big
apple product we can expect to see next
now a geek bench test was spotted by
macrumors recently that appears to be
the next gen 15-inch macbook pro with 16
gigs of ram running OS 10.9 mavericks
the benchmark score of 12,000 497 is
comparable to current gen MacBook Pros
and with the next-gen Haswell processors
it's really an improvement in battery
life instead of horsepower that we're
expecting to see that's been the case
with our recent test of the 14 plus our
macbook air 13-inch now the benchmark
also revealed an intel core i7 processor
featuring iris 5200 graphics which is
Intel's top-of-the-line GPU option and
the timing of this benchmark combined
with the back-to-school season makes us
a prime candidate for apples next
product release in the very near future
now there's plenty of developments on
the iOS 7 front the Cupertino kids
released our third beta for iOS 7
earlier in the week that brought more
visual improvements including indicator
dots on the calendar app if you had
events or appointments some changes to
the icons and the fonts have been made
easier to read across the board for
multiple apps as well we've also talked
about how all signs point to an improved
camera and slow motion capture for the
next iPhone but 9to5 mac has been able
to get more details for the new camera
feature called mogul discovered by hamza
suit it's not the final name but mogul
as in media mogul would allow the iphone
camera to record at 120 frames per
second there's no confirmation at what
resolution it will record at but here's
an example of a non-iphone video shot at
120 frames and slowed down you'll just
have to trust me if you've never seen a
butterfly in real life their wings move
faster than this plus butterflies are
kind of magical now in other iOS beta
findings it looks like Apple's iOS car
integration feature will be compatible
with specific cars over Wi-Fi instead of
having to be connected by a physical
cable
Phyllis signed up automakers like Honda
Mercedes Nissan Ferrari and more and at
WWDC they said integration could start
as soon as 2014 as long as it works with
my car that and letting you all see
right now well then I'm good with this
feature all rise sticking with cars the
big a was recently granted a patent for
touchscreen controls in a car that also
include tactile feedback so drivers can
keep their eyes on the road it's an
extension of the very basic multi-touch
invention that's been adapted to
automotive uses for telematics and
communication via a mobile phone you
would be able to control things like
your AC our windshield wipers and the
screen itself could have raised areas or
ridges to offer tactile feel like potato
chips now i'm still waiting for cars to
fly so you guys can let me know when you
get that one lock down all right in
iphone rumors and news a chinese
business news report says Foxconn is
reportedly hiring workers to build the
next-gen iphone Foxconn has begun a
large-scale recruitment of workers and a
firm reports they currently have two
hundred and ten thousand workers
compared to their peak of 300,000 in
2012 that's a lot of numbers plus you
want to see more pictures of the rumored
low-cost iPhone in different colors you
have two seconds to say yes or no ok ok
I heard you through the screen in there
they are
techny even made this mock-up video what
the next budget iPhone might look like
people have a lot of time on their hands
and I'm okay with that so I can put this
video on the show all right
congratulations are in order for the App
Store's fifth anniversary and to
celebrate apple is giving these apps and
games away for free for a limited time
to celebrate so go on and get them I
would recommend tiny wings really cool
game and how to cook everything because
I learned how to scramble an egg in it
could be very very difficult but
everything it's not all happy an apple
and US Department of Justice ruled that
Apple violated federal law by playing a
central role in conspiring with
publishers to raise e-book prices amazon
is still the dominant player in ebooks
but apple's actions caused some ebook
prices to raise to 12 99 for 1499 from
the 999 prices than amazon had charged
and established early on and i'm asian
so I like cheaper thanks now the big
five publishers including CBS's own
Simon &amp;amp; Schuster paid more than one
hundred and sixty six million dollars in
a settlement but it was only Apple that
went to trial apple said they will
appeal the ruling but this smells like
remnants from SJ and apples brash nature
of the past and we're throwing out the
bad happens
now we also wanted to address a
correction of our own the last week's
show I gave Apple a bad apple for only
giving consumers an app store gift card
but I stand corrected Apple is still
offering the full educational discounts
on max on top of giving you the app
store card in that's a bad apple on me
we've also made sure the appropriate
disciplinary action has been taken my
booty still hurts alright guys we told
you we'd read some of what you the Apple
biters want to see in the upcoming
iPhone and by far the number one request
was longer battery life like us on
Farooqi who sent us this picture of
himself and he looks kind of weird Isaac
Christensen wants the rumored
fingerprint scanner built into the home
button Earl at well on Twitter wants a
better color scheme in iOS 7 because he
thinks it looks a little too girly on
hello Kate Dale like how I said that he
hangs out with monkeys and wants one of
the Siri voices to be mine okay well as
long as you don't ask any dirty
questions like what is they're made of
and Rex wants my face blown up on the
back glass panel of the next iPhone
unfortunately apple rejected our idea
for the limited exclusive bry phone fine
alright thanks for all your entries and
everyone that I mentioned you guys are
getting an awesome truefitt artist
collection iphone case where they
partnered with some of my favorite
artists and to anti-glare film from True
Fit as well for their iphone 5 and I
told you guys we'd hook you up Plus true
protection is also giving the apple byte
nation twenty-five percent off
everything on their online store with
the promo code seen at 25 so check out
their stuff and how your purchases will
also benefit organizations that help
preserve our planet see if we do good
things here alright that's going to do
it for this week's show send us your
email to the apple byte at cnet com i'm
