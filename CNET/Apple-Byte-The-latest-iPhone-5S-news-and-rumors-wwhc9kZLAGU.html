the Apple bite it's all the good bad
inside the world of Apple so let's get
to the show and talk about the next big
Apple product we can expect to see next
now a beef bench test was spotted by Mac
rumors recently that appears to be the
next-gen 15-inch MacBook Pro with 16
gigs of RAM running OS 10.9 Mavericks
the benchmark score of 12,000 497 is
comparable to current gen MacBook Pros
and with the next-gen Haswell processors
it's really an improvement in battery
life instead of horsepower that we're
expecting to see that's been the case
with our recent tests of the 14 plus
hour MacBook Air 13-inch now the
benchmark also revealed an Intel Core i7
processor featuring iris 5200 graphics
which is Intel's top-of-the-line GPU
option and the timing of this benchmark
combined with the back-to-school season
makes us a prime candidate for Apple's
next product release in the very near
future now there's plenty of
developments on the iOS 7 front the
Cupertino Kids released our third beta
for iOS 7 earlier in the week that
brought more visual improvements
including indicator dots on the calendar
app if you had events or appointments
some changes to the icons and the fonts
have been made easier to read across the
board for multiple apps as well we've
also talked about how all signs point to
an approved camera and slow motion
capture for the next iPhone but 9 to 5
Mac has been able to get more details
for the new camera feature called mogul
discovered by Hamza soon it's not the
final name but mogul as in the media
mogul would allow the iPhone camera to
record at 120 frames per second there's
no confirmation at what resolution it
will record at but here's an example of
an on I phone video shot at 120 frames
and slowed down you'll just have to
trust me if you've never seen a
butterfly in real life their wings move
faster than this
Plus butterflies are kind of magical now
in other iOS beta findings it looks like
Apple's iOS car integration feature will
be compatible with specific cars over
Wi-Fi instead of having to be connected
by a physical cable
we'll assigned up automakers like Honda
Mercedes Nissan Ferrari and more and at
WWDC they said integration could start
as soon as 2014 as long as it works with
my car that I'm letting you all see
right now
well then I'm good with this feature are
I sticking with cars the big a was
recently granted a patent for
touchscreen controls in a car that also
include tactile feedback so drivers can
keep their eyes on the road it's an
extension of the very basic multi-touch
invention that's been adapted to
automotive uses for telematics and
communication via a mobile phone you
would be able to control things like
your a/c
our windshield wipers and the screen
itself could have raised areas or ridges
to offer tactile feel like potato chips
now I'm still waiting for cars to fly so
you guys can let me know when you get
that one lock down all right in iPhone
rumors and news a Chinese business news
report says Foxconn is reportedly hiring
workers to build the next gen iPhone
Foxconn has begun a large-scale
recruitment of workers and affirm
reports they currently have 210 thousand
workers compared to their peak of 300
thousand in 2012 that's a lot of numbers
Plus do you want to see more pictures of
the rumored low-cost iPhone in different
colors you have two seconds to say yes
or no okay I heard you through the
screen in there they are
Tec D even made this mock-up video of
what the next budget iPhone might look
like people have a lot of time on their
hands and I'm ok with that so I can put
this video on the show alright
congratulations are in order for the App
Store's fifth anniversary and to
celebrate Apple is giving these apps and
games away for free for a limited time
to celebrate
so go on and get them I would recommend
tiny wings really cool game and how to
cook everything because I learned how to
scramble an egg and it can be very very
difficult but everything it's not all
happy in Apple land the US Department of
Justice ruled that Apple violated
federal law by playing a central role in
conspiring with publishers to raise
ebook prices Amazon is still the
dominant player in ebooks but Apple's
actions caused some ebook prices to
raise to $12.99 for $14.99 from the
$9.99 prices that Amazon had charged and
established early on and I'm Asian so I
like cheaper things now the big five
publishers including CBS's own Simon &amp;amp;
Schuster paid more than 166 million
dollars in a settlement but it was only
Apple that went to trial Apple said they
will appeal the ruling but this smells
like remnants from SJ and Apple's brash
nature of the past and we're throwing
out the bad apple
now we also wanted to address a
correction of our own the last week's
show
I gave Apple a bad apple for only giving
consumers an app store gift card but I
stand corrected Apple is still offering
the full educational discounts on Macs
on top of giving you the app store card
in that's a bad apple on me we've also
made sure the appropriate disciplinary
action has been taken my booty still
hurts all right guys we told you we'd
read some of what you the Apple fighters
want to see in the upcoming iPhone and
by far the number one request was longer
battery life like us on for uki who sent
us this picture of himself and
it's kind of weird Isaac Christiansen
wants the rumored fingerprint scanner
built-in to the home button Earl at well
on Twitter wants a better color scheme
in iOS 7 because he thinks it looks a
little too girly on hello kid Dale like
how I said that he hangs out with
monkeys and wants one of the Siri voices
to be mine okay well as long as you
don't ask any dirty questions like what
is derp made of and Rex wants my face
blown up on the back glass panel of the
next iPhone
unfortunately Apple rejected our idea
for the limited exclusive Bry phone five
all right
thanks for all your entries and everyone
that I mentioned you guys are getting an
awesome true fit artist collection i
phone case where they partnered with
some of my favorite artists and to
anti-glare films from True Fit as well
for their iPhone 5 and I told you guys
we'd hook you up plus true protection is
also giving the Apple byte nation 25%
off everything on their online store
with the promo code seen at 25 so check
out their stuff and how your purchases
will also benefit organizations that
help preserve our planet so if we do
good things here all right that's gonna
do it for this week's show
send us your email to the Apple by Ted
cnet.com I'm Brian Tong thanks for
watching and we'll catch you guys next
time for another bite of the Apple did
you say harder</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
