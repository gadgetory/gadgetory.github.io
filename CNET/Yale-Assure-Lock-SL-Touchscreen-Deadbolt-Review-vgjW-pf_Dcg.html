the sleekest and slimness Yale lock yet
for $169 she'll get a stylish secure
deadbolt pay $50 for a network module
and you'll be able to integrate this
lock in your smart home platform you'll
really improve the exterior look of the
touchscreen deadbolt with this lock the
interior side is still a clunky box that
houses for double-a batteries a thumb
latch and optional network module
installing the lock was easy enough as
Yale offers instructions in print and
through an audio guided third-party app
called built the touchscreen keypad has
sound and voice guidance it's a nice
feature that's made even nicer by the
fact that you can turn it off completely
if you prefer a silent lock the Ashura
cell has other helpful features like
privacy lockout mode OneTouch locking
and auto reebok with networked modules
enabled you can lock and unlock the door
remotely via your respective app there's
no twist and go unlocking like we saw in
other assure locks and frankly I don't
think it'll be missed for homekit users
asher SL works with the yale secure app
to connect the lock to home kit and
adjust settings
ZigBee and z-wave don't get an app so
all your lock settings will be adjusted
either via your smart home platforms app
or the keypad itself there aren't
options to schedule temporary keys with
this lock with the network module
installed you'll get 250 pin codes with
no module you'll only get 25 to set them
up or revoke them you'll need to go
through a menu on the keypad itself
yells assure SL lock is an improvement
stylistically over prior models and it's
a solid grade to certified deadbolt but
there aren't any groundbreaking new
features here if you're looking for
something like August or cents or remote
code scheduling look elsewhere if you
just want a slim touchscreen keypad with
easy smart home integration Yale's got
you covered with the asure SL</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
