improve the speed of your external
storage system stop I have something
here that is much cheaper I'm down low
and this is the distinction DDR from
Buffalo now this is a desktop external
hard drive and it looks like one and the
back here has one USB 3.0 port and a
power port on the front it has two
indicator light one for the power and
the other for the data activities and
that's it very conventional but what
different is on the inside apart from
the hard drive
you also come with one gigabyte of ddr3
system memory for caching now this is
the same type of system memory used in
computer and when the caching is turned
on this Drive you offer amazingly fast
speed in fact is faster than many
advanced funnybone storage systems now
to demonstrate how facet II let me tell
you this I'm a very hard to impress
person in fact I've never been impressed
before I think but today I had to look
at myself in the mirror and admit it to
myself that oh god I was totally
impressed that's how fast it is now
using system memory as cast is one catch
and that is if the power goes out
unexpectedly you will lose some data but
hey a lot of things can go wrong if the
power goes out and expectedly for
example you have to stop watching this
video right now and that would be
devastating
now the good news is the buffalo drive
here is quite affordable costing just
hundred forty dollars for two terabyte
or $180 for three terabytes about the
same price as other regular drive of the
same capacity so if you're on the market
for a new drive and your desktop support
used to be a 3.0 this is a drive to get
in fact get to for backup purposes for
more details with number on how fast
this drive is check out the full review
a SATCOM
and to find out how are you to impress
me follow me on Twitter Facebook or
Google+ once again my name is Dongo and
I look like this when I'm impressed
and this has been the first look at the
distinction DDR from Buffalo now you get
ready to be blown away
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
