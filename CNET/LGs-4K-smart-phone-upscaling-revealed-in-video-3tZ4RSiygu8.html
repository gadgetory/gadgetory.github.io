World Congress 2013 where LG stand
taking a look at some poor case dreaming
from the phone now this is some very
interesting technology what is happening
here is you've got a game running on
this smart phone it's running on an lg
optimus G which is a quad-core device so
it's got quite a powerful processor and
it's running a HD game but the phone
itself is upscaling that to 4k or Ultra
High Definition as it's sometimes called
and then mirroring that to the
television behind me as you can see the
result is really impressive all the
detail on the television is incredibly
crisp this is a graphically intensive
game demo that we're running but
everything up there looks really good
and there's not very much latency or lag
that's all between actions you perform
on the phone and what happens on the big
screen so this is all happening via LG's
proprietary mirroring technology it is
putting a lot of strain on the phone so
I can feel it's getting very very warm
by does seem to be able to handle it so
why is this technology useful well 4k
televisions are becoming a bigger deal
in the next few years you're going to be
able to buy one for the price that you
can get a full HD television for now
unfortunately though it's going to be a
bit longer before we find much 4k
content to actually watch it's good
technology in theory at least but it
will take a hefty toll on your phone's
battery life so here's hoping
smartphones become a little bit more
battery capable before this technology
becomes widespread we may not be waiting
very long however because LG says that
in the first part of next year or
possibly even late this year we're going
to see smartphones coming to market that
have LG's mirroring upscaling technology
built into them on the Westway vecinos
here at LG standard mobile congress and
this is some 4k phone streaming</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
