to land a reusable rocket in the middle
of the ocean and MIT shows off a
touchscreen that fits on your thumbnail
and some kids are getting to use future
tech to learn in new incredible ways
it's tmrw daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley skeleton amis always the best the
one the only kill anonymous hey how's it
going it's pretty great yeah you had a
you had a Star Wars weekend I had an
action-packed weekend can I do you want
me to do the thing now okay so so real
quick she went to star wars celebration
on friday she got a chance to experience
it she said she was gonna buy me teach i
promised i'd buy you a t-shirt and i did
this oh are you sure that says here is
to go to my camera it says visit the
death star it's no it's no moon haha
sure there's no awesome i said i didn't
want one that was like stoic celebration
a celebration i want to get something
cool and stylish and that's a good one
and i hope it gives you thank you yeah
so there's your sure i'll ruin the mics
are already at fancy about it okay cool
alright with that being said let's hit
the headlines so you're gonna see a
video of us it you're gonna be a little
bit freaked out but it's pretty cool so
MIT Media Lab just unveiled what they're
calling nailo nailo like bingo but nayo
low and it's a nail mounted gesture
input surface which really translates
you it's a little tiny track pad for
your thumb goes out right on your
thumbnail check the ciliate hmm weird
right so weird so you're seeing if
you're just listening you're seeing a
person making a square on their thumb
with this like crazy device on it and
they're making little designs that are
showing up on a nexus cellphone so it'll
transmit data via bluetooth to a smart
phone or pc and they're saying you can
top it with nail art so they were saying
it won't be as obvious so yeah hide it
you can hide it a little bit can make it
kind of cool so won't totally be weird
looking they said the commercial version
they would have like maybe switchable
like top surfaces so that you could
match it with your outfit or race ya
cool uh and then they gave a couple of
different examples of when you would
sort of need to use this and I because
at first I'm like why do we need this
what is this but then they mentioned how
people would sort of use this and I
thought to myself okay that actually
makes a lot of sense so engineers who
are sort of soldering something and
using both hands if they need it if they
do something really quick like a swipe
gesture that would sort of either help
them maybe zoom in on printed circuit
board designs like while they're
soldering like that might be a really
good use for it they also offered up a
mobile typing app for punctuation zor
emoticons without switching keyboard so
you know on all of your phones you have
to switch to like an emoji keyboard or
your punctuation it's like a different
space on your keyboard that was one of
the other examples I will come to your
house do not use this remote jeez and
then also they did tests involving five
different gestures and they actually had
over ninety two percent accuracy in
their test results which is pretty good
that is incredible for a new technology
I I didn't hear them say AR cuz that
would be pretty cool if you're like
you're wearing your goggles when you're
seeing like you're seeing a list you're
like cooking or something explain the
ban list and you're kind of scrolling
scrolling through your list that would
be a really good use of like if you were
to make it work via bluetooth with a
hollow lens or or with uh you know gear
VR you're not going to pull the
controller you're gonna want it to be
intuitive so you're gonna like you have
a little thing on your fingers you can
buy groceries move around and and you
don't have to have like a controller or
Glover can you imagine flipping through
your email that way just like 11 111 and
it's very inconspicuous obviously so if
there was a situation in which you
wanted to be a little bit more subtle
maybe you were at a meeting or something
and you flipped through email and they
said three years out approximately for a
commercial release that's not fast
enough I'm not fast enough but you know
maybe the technology will get better and
they'll be able to do it quicker but
they said they think right now about
three years out and also my biggest
question was what about accidental
presses like what if you accidentally
touch your thumb because I do that all
the time like I'm always fiddling around
with my thumbnails and my fingernails
and stuff check your phone I do every
day before I go to bed and um and so
siri-like to activate Siri or something
they said it would be like Syrian which
you'd have like maybe a two second
intentional press to like activate the
touch screen okay the touchpad so there
you go it's called mail oh how weird is
that but hashtag of the a today TD nail
and my question is what kind of tech
would you want on your thumbnail like
aside from a touchpad
like what's what's something a piece of
technology that is that you would want
made so small that it can fit on your
thumbnail aside from Paul retta's
ant-man just keep him on your thumb just
kerry Marie yeah yeah fight crime for
you um how about like look a little it's
like it gives you like a burst of energy
so like an energy boost thing so I'm
just like man I am real tired whoa I'm
wired you know what I mean like that
that's all you do is you just do that
that's quick it's easy giving a cup of
coffee alright you're on the job yeah
you need some media boost I like about
you I think for me it would be I would
like to like right after I wake up I
would like for some way to like record
my dreams like to be able to wake up and
like I'd like to record that and then
like you like tap your thumb so you not
to move or like start up anything that's
crazy yeah like it's like I like oh I
want to record that and re-watch it and
you just like hit like to you know tap
your thumb a couple times or something
and then it like sends that to some
device of course that you're hooked up
to wirelessly because you're half cyborg
that's my future that I would like us
all to live in so there you go nice yeah
i'm moving forward in the future guys
I'm just like combining it with other
stuff okay all right tell me about this
fabulous school okay so one of the best
things that you can use tech for is for
teaching I think true and what this
company called z space has decided to
help kids learn in the way that I
learned the best which is learning by
doing and that is through AR and VR well
less VR and more AR what they have
created is this giant screen that works
with three of these 3d glasses that the
kids put on and the screen tracks where
they're looking and because of that they
can create almost an interactive digital
space for them to work that is amazing
so they they want to teach them to throw
all different things science and nature
and all these different types of things
so one of the examples they gave was you
can see the human heart you can pick it
up you use a stylus you can pick up the
heart peel back layers on the way it
works you'll see this keeps using like
yeah he's interacting with robotics so
it's not just putting on a VR headset
then disappearing to this world and not
interacting you have kids learning
through interaction and learning through
doing another one
the ones that they have on here is I
don't know if you did this when you were
in in grade school but you can die you
dissect an owl pellet so like owl
droppings and you dissect it and you
find like a mouse head and you find like
you know like my feet and stuff like
that but you see how like the digestive
system and stuff work so you can
digitally do the you know we read and
find all your rat droppings take
throughout boom virtually so yeah so
they're hoping to use science evolution
history and all that kind of stuff I
also I really like how collaborative
this is like cuz if we if we had virtual
reality headsets and we were learning
like you were saying we would just put
on a headset and then we never interact
with anybody around us but this seems
like see they're all like talking to
each other and they're both looking at
the same thing and kind of you know what
getting into it together yeah and that's
the whole goal of see space is to not
have these kids disappear off into this
world but to interact and that it be
yeah you know they've got their their
phones yeah so yeah there you go they're
hoping to bring this to more classes
right now it's kind of just touring and
going to specific schools oh cool yeah
oh maybe there's one locally we should
go see if maybe they have a local just
just go to an elementary school just
show up just show me like hey guys we're
tomorrow daily and of course all the
kids will know us because we're so
popular hey grandma and grandpa get out
of here we gotta finish watching our
vine videos these old people I'll get
him out of here uh that's awesome I
really like that that's super cool iie
again i like one we're some when we're
starting to use the AR in the VR notch
is just like look I recreated Zelda but
like to actually teach me cuz one of the
things that they brought up was um what
is it so we're object in motion stays in
motion yeah new like a news news long
yeah yeah sure um but they said that it
was hard for kids to kind of grasp what
that what that meant because we don't
have zero gravity in which to you know
show that as an example okay so they
were able to show it in this virtual
reality space of an object continuously
going without having any instructions so
yeah it's able to show you things that
you can't learn in our own universe yeah
I don't want so I like that a lot yeah I
love it good job zSpace super cool okay
I'm gonna tell you a little bit about
sexo we were super star wars wasted last
Thursday so we kind of forgot to go to a
stroke you we were drunk on Star Wars
and we're sorry everybody of a SpaceX
last Wednesday attempted a third round
of to try to land the ride one of the
Rockets the sack and 9 rocket on a barge
of the mill the ocean here it goes it
solved it's so close look at weight and
you think oh my gosh did they do it I
think they did it I think they did it
and then all of a sudden as the smoke is
about to clear oh it falls over that
rocket falls over in a date with SpaceX
no oh no terrible spring said that's why
i love this GoPro footage from the
actual barge like check this out so here
it is it's like boom and then not so
good so they were really close this time
so the first time there was it was too
fast it just literally exploded it was
not good the second time it missed the
platform entirely went right into the
drink this didn't even hit the barge
just went right in the water and then
the third time I was was this time so
okay what have they said when they sent
a response to this because they usually
have all like well we know that it was
just one time but science takes multiple
tries wait you're very true so Elon Musk
said it failed due to a quote
slower-than-expected throttle valve
response so they're getting closer and I
think that every time that they kind of
do this they learn a little more about
you know what exactly needs to be done I
know that they delayed this launch this
Falcon 9 launch for I think one or two
times because of weather so I think that
they sort of know that for now like they
really can't do this unless it's under
like the most optimal of circumstances
but it wasn't a total failure they
actually sent up a supplies and cargo
scientific cargo to the International
Space Station which there was a really
great picture of one of the astronauts
up there taking a picture with it in the
background like out the window then
there's like earth behind it it was so
weird and she'd rested I think she was
dressed up in like a Star Trek outfit
was great so fantastic so um so yeah
didn't it tipped over on the platform
didn't quite hit the target perfectly
they they they're saying it's two months
until the next attempt so we have
another about eight weeks or so until
they try it again
I like that they're not stopping they're
not going to be like that you know third
time's forget it we yeah i mean--is
guess it just can't be done they're
determined well I hope they don't give
up like hey I'd love to yeah I'd love
for this thing to work out for them I
mean there's some more of this stuff
like the morph I just get this the
internet and that sort of mentalities
way of like every time it fails are like
sheets not gonna work instead of
realizing that science takes multiple
tries to like get stuff right someone
failure is just part of science I mean
that's and life and life in general I
mean it's just that's nobody ever
accomplished something without some kind
of failure behind it so I like I think
that they're very well aware of this and
you know it could really revolutionize
um not only commercial spaceflight in in
the way that you know maybe we would be
able to get things back and forth but
it's just make space space like so much
cheaper so or even just getting things
to and from you know this International
Space Station in general just make it so
much yeah so cut him a break cross your
fingers ah give him some encouragement
ear space God's radius is sorry whatever
whatever it is that you do do those
things and yeah so maybe fourth time
will be a charm it wasn't the third time
I was hoping it wasn't they were so
close and I got so excited when I was
watching it and I was just like come on
come on come on it's they're gonna do it
there are you calling on your screen and
then it just tipped over and I was like
oh no and then it exploded and I was
like oh my gosh is the most depressing
like as terrible but you know the price
is right that but I know bro um yeah so
that's that's what happened with SpaceX
we just want to keep you posted because
I know we follow this pretty closely
like we're really excited to see what
happens so we're gonna take a quick
break we'll be right back with a
backorder haggett that I know you will
be super interested in and and and I
think you're gonna be excited and then
we have your user feedback about Star
Wars which is really good whoo and we
have our phone target for the day so it
all goes away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show it's Monday
which means it's time to talk about a
crowdfunding effort that we are maybe a
little bit excited about or maybe not
this is back of the Hackett all right
this week we're talking about a virtual
reality headset it's called where ality
sky where Alan where reality where ality
sky it's portable you can fold it up and
put in your pocket that I like it's a
headset right cool uses your smartphone
five to six inch smartphone here it is
um so you're going to see a little bit
of this video of people using it and it
is basically a VR optics headset with a
150 degree field of view which is
impressive compared to other VR headsets
they were they said on on their
kick-started that most other headsets
are between 90 and 100 degrees so it's
quite a bit more the field of view is
quite a bit bigger which is good they
are using a very interesting piece of
technology for the lens on this so what
they're using is they're using what is
called a double Fresnel lens and its
technology that was developed by
Lockheed Martin for defense and
aerospace in issue ok so it's serious
like this is really serious the lens is
really thick and it looks like mr. Magoo
glasses like they're really weird I
think we have another video like showing
the actual classes yes like Professor
Barnes rather than via drama it's
exactly like that so they're saying that
the open design of these dislike heads
is foldable headset and the expanded
field of vision is going to eliminate a
lot of the motion and simulation
sickness that people report when they
use things like the oculus rift dk2 yeah
um and they also are saying that it will
because of the field of vision they will
also eliminate a lot of eye strain so
there's a lot of eye strain involved in
VR that might not be there ok with this
particular type of headset there's also
removable blinders on the side so if you
want to like close off the world around
you you can like put the blinders on
it's kind of weird so okay so they have
this video it shows you like ok here's
all the different degrees of field of
vision so here's tablets 25 degrees you
got a laptop also 45 degrees fill the
vision and then oh here's their flat
screen TV 60 degrees so you're thinking
like how many degrees wide you can see
so flat screen TV 60 degrees movie
theater 75 degrees which is pretty good
75 degrees with theatre and then 110
degrees field of vision I max screen and
then there it's you know their headsets
150 so they're saying it's a pretty big
field of vision it's almost entirely
like from one side to the other which is
kind of crazy so yeah 150 degrees we're
all in esky um hopefully they have an
actual image of like there it is so
there's the device um the lenses you can
see look how thick they are like they're
shaped like actual glasses they're
really they're super thick okay so it's
it's a Kickstarter so how much are they
trying to raise and how much does it
cost okay so they want uh well let me
tell you how much it costs first you die
okay to back it it's gonna cost you $69
not bad and you get and you get a pair
hmm ok sorry $69 is a pre-order yeah and
um let me see actually Logan can we get
this shot really quick i just want to
show everybody so that's the that's the
image right there that's what it looks
like it's like a really weird like head
headset kind of thing that's like so see
that yeah kind of us are sixty nine
bucks pretty good don't not counting the
cost of your phone good they want a
hundred thousand dollars um which isn't
a huge goal no it's not and they have
about half that and they've got 15 days
left so they're about halfway there yeah
maybe they'll make it maybe they want
and it flattens down it goes in your
pocket moldable puts you could put it
right in your pocket what do you think
yep back in you in yeah because Google
cardboard I've always said is amazing
and incredible X and this is just taking
it from the non crappy version of that
for a little bit more and you know that
sort of VR experience I i was telling I
think producer Logan that you your
camera has that ability where you can
take a picture and do like that thing
where you you look around and you get
here you get a 360-degree look at where
you are well you just pop that in one of
these and you can show somebody look I
went to Disney World look at this 360 or
we could show you this studio with a
very true 56 degrees so I mean we're
moving towards that sort of photo
experience
oh yeah definitely what is it 60 bucks
yeah yeah once you try out google
cardboard you'll get exactly why this
sort of like portable super fund is
super cool so yeah 669 bucks to bakit
ships in October this year so it's this
year pretty good um I guess that's the
targeted ship date we always we never
know about delays guys we take no
responsibility for delays but yeah
that's sort of somewhere where ality sky
is the name of it so um I like it I'll
back it too I say I'm in under 100 bucks
ok very cool ankle all right guys it's
time to talk about what you think of the
show and we're pretty excited cuz it's
all about Star Wars so here's your user
feedback you realize I'm never gonna
have a good segue for that it's just
like oh hey guys it's time to talk about
what you think so you guys are you guys
exist let's see what you guys have to
say hey wait a minute there's people
watching um ok so Frank wrote in to us
as TD Star Wars is the hashtag we're
said what are you excited about who you
excited about seeing who your favorite
character from the new trailer could be
an old character it's all good uh and
Frank said I'm excited to see the new
villain or villains new droids New Jedi
solo chewy yeah sours I love that I love
how they can just show us one nuke like
cuz there's gonna be more trailers they
like this next one we're gonna show
laughs well this next one we're gonna
show I know and they could just stretch
it out but I stretch it out on and Han
and Chewie a good start I was a good
moment i'll get the moment uh oddest
wrote in and said i'ma kill anonymous on
this one I want to see the villain and
what he's capable yeah August he's scary
he was scary for the five seconds he was
in the trailers like yeah it was like oh
you win okay alright I give up a bro
Daniel wrote in and said I grew thatch
Leah bout having the trilogy be from my
generation I just want to see the older
characters be part of the movie totally
agree I think they're an integral part
you have to have him as part of you just
say it did I do that too is like yeah
yeah he said he's right he said that
yeah we both work way he's got the
generation thank you my this feels like
it's gonna be my generation star see it
that theater in one
yeah yeah and it's not gonna be made for
kids like I felt like the prequels were
made for kids and I was already an adult
by then I feel like I missed out i feel
like this is the trilogy it's gonna be
made for me um and then lastly I go too
deep we got an email from Jim eh and he
says I was 11 when I saw Star Wars in
the theater my dad took me and I loved
it so when I saw the latest trailer I
got so choked up no other Star Wars got
me so emotional I was thinking to myself
yes they did it the whole feeling I had
nearly 40 years ago came back I'm so
happy at what they did they captured all
the elements of the original series I
always wanted to see the later films
made not the prequels for me that newest
trailer is perfect I'm so happy to get
to experience a film that needed to be
made um I feel we needed another series
of films to close the Star Wars saga
then he says I like Boba Fett I think
he's a great character I don't know much
about the Expanded Universe but from the
movie he is a complex character and hope
will hopefully play a big role in the
new movies I asked like Jango Fett and
the prequels so a lot of history to be
played out that's our gym eh said it
depends on whether or not JJ Abrams
believes that both that's dead or not I
know it's gonna that's gonna wreck on
all those books so then such a big they
may be dead oh man actually we want to
be dead he just be digesting the second
JJ like if JJ puts Boba Fett in there
people once you really great like that's
the one that's the one he's gonna get
super smug about when people like you're
like oh my god both thud smack you be
like yep yeah you love me yeah I say I
pulled him out I'll be the biggest hero
of all time if he brings back both that
JJ Abrams Moby will be though construct
monuments to him he's being digested by
Sarlacc currently so I can find a way to
get him out of there I will be more rare
few human beings that couldn't give a
crap about Bubba Fett I don't know he's
that guy are we good okay okay none what
not positive or negative but I know that
people will make mom people's is there
to jab Rome's first yes jam drums uh so
of course that was your Star Wars
feedback and now it is time for a very
special phone tog refer the day
so we have some folks who write into the
show who are kind of like i would
consider them super fans like they're
right in every day they're always part
of user feedback they love the show i'm
one of those people is Gayle and Gayle
rights in today or last week and he says
any chance this would be a phone time
for choice my wife and I are expecting
our first oh my god taken with a Lumia
520 that is your wife is you and your
wife congratulations are you a
congratulations gales whoa what a
squirrel I don't know it looks may it
could be a baby is this a shot from
space stop from space oh yeah that was
taken from the ISS oh this is this is
amazing yes news ever congratulations
Gail and Neil gil by he's got like a
whole thing on Twitter it's like a long
name so what camera did he is a Lumia
520 to take that picture that they have
that app where you can see pregnancy oh
yeah tell you just hold the phone nobody
knows that windows easy great super cool
thank you for sharing them yeah congrats
awesome Mazel Tov whatever other
congratulate Tory phrases we can throw
out confetti all that stuff gangis is
really excited for you very cool can
register so yeah that was I thought that
was a really good phone terrible yeah if
you guys want to share your phone tog
raphy feel free to send it to tomorrow
at cnet com include what phone you took
it with give us a little story about it
was like hearing stories and of course
you can send in show ideas you can send
in story story ideas whatever you want
and the babies send in your baby that's
fine you can do that i mean i don't know
how you do it via email that's kind of
weird but if you can figure that out
attachment pretty oh yeah send it in an
attachment don't give in a dropbox and
we'll get your dropbox it to us yeah
