for everyone
the last major update to your iPhone or
iPad before the big iOS 11 reveal in
June so what new features can you expect
from this version of the operating
system you'll notice this first one as
soon as you open your settings menu at
the top you now have a new Apple ID
profile section with information about
all your Apple accounts iCloud iTunes
and family sharing scroll down to see a
list of all the Apple devices associated
to this account
you still need to log into Find My
iPhone to locate them all but it's a
good shortcut
you'll find another much-needed update
right here in the settings menu click on
iCloud to see a breakdown of how your
cloud storage is being used up this is
useful especially if you pay for added
iCloud storage click on the graph then
manage storage for a program and device
specific breakdown of where the storage
hogs are coming from it's not perfect
but it's a step in the right direction
in trying to understand the black hole
that is iCloud if you haven't activated
the two-factor authentication on the
account which you should you'll notice a
new suggestion at the bottom of your
profile now it's not clear what other
suggestions Apple may have appeared down
here but to make it disappear you'll
have to follow directions this will put
an added layer of security on your
account now let's get out of the
settings menu and make our way to maps
if you happen to use Apple's own map
system you will now see a small weather
bug at the bottom right-hand side of the
screen that shows you the weather in
that specific location which if you're
familiar with San Francisco's
microclimates
can be incredibly helpful 3d touch your
long press for an hourly breakdown for
that area this one will be a lifesaver
if you bought the tiny little ear pods
because it's a given that you may have
misplaced them at least once this
feature pings the last location of where
they were paired to your device and
makes them ring just make sure you're
not wearing them when you ping them if
you want to keep your hearing intact now
remember there's always a risk involved
in updating your phone so make sure to
back it up before you take the plunge
and make sure to check out see Netcom
for the full list of iOS 10.3 features</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
