another episode of the 359 podcast is
episode 181 on Thursday februari 16 and
we have a packed house with Ben Fox
Rubin Roger Cheng and I is Akhtar good
morning guys morning calling all trolls
calling all trolls yeah we knew you guys
couldn't resist that headline like will
accept all your one word answers and
obscenities the comment section but one
word obscenities extra points yeah let
care to elaborate on what we're talking
about so yeah we'll be talking about our
cnet's inside story of on the Google
pixel what sort of work that went into
building this phone you know their very
first their own phone as opposed to the
the Nexus partnership we'll also be
talking about the merits of verizon by
yahoo seems like the deal is still on
renegotiated though so it's a they got a
bit of a haircut of 300 million to a 250
or 300 250 to 300 as much as 300 million
discount to a four point that people
point eight billion dollar deal what
point is right so you know that's that's
pretty cheap not that's not a money I
thought I'd no no that's not as big a
discount as I thought it would get and
what will go to a bit more and then
lastly we'll talk with ban about his Q&amp;amp;A
with CEO of ebay and who actually still
uses eBay yes mostly us yelling it been
yeah Ben what spice wait the way we read
about that the podcast is for yes that's
why we created the virus in the first
place as always if you have any
questions about any of these topics
leave them in the comments section Brian
will pick out the best will answer them
in about three minutes 59 seconds all
right hanging out for four minutes of
yelling at ben's starting in three yes
21
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tecna's of the day you don't
have a crap we want to throw in I'm
Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin &amp;amp; I'm I as
the wolf akhtar whoo are you an android
fan it's our chances you've been
coveting the Google pixel or you own the
Google pixel our own Lynn law has the
inside story behind them making the
phone and it's interesting to see the
details i won the device but granted
let's face it it's it's basically
another iphone but I have to ask is the
pixel better than the iphone is the best
android out there it's a what better yes
it's better than the iphone simply
because it kept the headphone jack there
some reason I think it's better than an
iphone 6 is running Android and actually
it's much better version of Android than
any other Android have used because it's
really really clean I like Samsung
phones yeah but they skinned it way too
heavily I I spent a considerable amount
of time with a pixel I own an iPhone
I've Sam I'm really liking pixel I'm not
an android fan and I really like using
the pixel I've gone back to my my
samsung phone recently and it's like uh
it's so close why all the settings all
wrong no it's so laggy this is another
thing I like about the pixel that would
make it better than the iphone it's it's
minor but it's so they did this clever
little thing with the design where they
actually made it slightly wet shaped to
avoid having the camera I didn't even
realize his wedge shaped like a dry go
back and look my phone like oh all right
so you just barely notice i paid for a
pixel my own money so i knew had a wedge
shape and i did they didn't want that
little camera bumping like it's a neat
little feature it's that's a really good
yeah it's the smart way to get rid of
that bump which admittedly is one of the
more annoying aspects of that iphone
right now just having like cut Clank on
your table back and forth rocking your
table Steve Jobs would have never agreed
i've accepted to us this is just that he
would have described it as Holy
ridiculous okay jobs and iphones have
been over since the for let that go let
it go alright there's a song about it
let it all right all right you know next
up verizon's reportedly agreed to a
renegotiated deal to buy yahoo now the
discount of potentially up to three
hundred million dollars what you think I
mean why is verizon so eager to buy
yahoo which is the victim of the two
largest acts in history and really at
this point is kind of a a tainted asset
right
god that's a that's a good question
we've wondered that many times on the
podcast and I'm still wondering that
they get a lot of traffic on yahoo but
it's pretty cheap traffic so maybe a
verizon compiles it with AOL they could
make it into something a little bit
stronger but it's still a little bit
hard on I'm saying there look looking at
from the verizon point of view their
eager to find a new revenue stream right
there have been trying to find you
business they're looking at the wireless
business it's not doing that great
t-mobile Sprint eating their lunch at
this point so I thought with Yahoo
though the point was louder advertising
technology was decent and that's what
they were going to use with their
properties including where I was a
combination of the advertising
technology yes which would be merged
with AOL but also the billion eyeballs
that they would get from buying the
young properties which yahoo still has
my argument has always been like the
yahoo users are not the Millennials that
verizon wants i know they're definitely
older legacy users so i think i'm
locking people to locking people better
we're talking about the discounted works
out to be about five percent five
percent is a minor thing you get back
like an Amazon her surprise me kudos to
Yahoo's negotiating team for like
getting that deal because like they must
be high-fiving each other all happy
percent goes alright lastly been you
talked with the CEO of ebay Devin wenig
at the future of Commerce what juicy
tidbits did he drop yeah he said that
ebay does not have Tom Brady's missing
Jersey which I was pretty sad to hear
about no and he also mentioned he's not
personally looking for Tom Brady's
Jersey which I was shocked I know he
should be that she should be priority
super I told him to his face that's
super important and the CEO of ebay
should be looking into it and so you
might we do not kidding this is in the
article I thought he was kidding around
like no way he really did ask about
tumblr and we joked we joked about who
uses ebay apparently he uses ebay for
everything yes he buys his toothpaste
garbage bags everything on ebay and he
says he gets amazing service which
granted he admitted the CEO of ebay
would say something like that and lastly
what is what was one aspect of ebay like
you're most excited about from your QA
from my Q&amp;amp;A oh so one of the one of the
things that i thought was really
exciting about it was you could
basically just take a picture of
anything and ebay could immediately tell
you how much it could be worth this is a
feature that might be coming you know
three years from now
not now all right more of these stories
check us out at cnet I'm Roger Cheng I'm
bed Fox Rubin I is the wolf actor thank
you for listening all right that was
fairly impressive how much you just
crammed into four minutes yeah great so
you went a little over through me before
sir I don't sorry sorry you're right i
wanted i didn't see the clock it was
like oh why do I want to get something
else in there about AI and that's that
stuff yeah I thought those interesting
it is cool you just basically could take
a picture he said that like you go into
your garage you could just take a
picture of everything in your garage and
ebay will tell you how much it's priced
because one of the fun things about ebay
he claims is that literally everything
in the world has been sold on eBay yeah
Ezra Sonny may either once or multiple
choice and they'll be able to tell it
about when I've market organs black
market organs have definitely been sold
on ebay along with Souls and what else I
thought the idea was that camels I've
been sold how much was just kidding no
absolutely not i would be such a Souls
disclaimer those were jokes ebay camera
app like Rogers worth $85 yeah like that
we live that's why it's actually more
than I think my god yeah so that was
that was one interesting thing as far as
like what they're doing on image
recognition the other thing that he also
said was like using a I to like target
things so that you could have like a
more personalized experience on ebay
ebay is not the only one doing this
amazon and you know plenty of other
e-commerce guys three years work i'm
actually surprised when the timing i
figured that would be coming sooner than
he said it was it was a vague timeline
but magic amazon will have something
like this in the works yes by next year
well like a drone will fly in take off
like she would tell you like yes by the
way it's worth so much so money mmm hey
guys we have some really surprising
results in the chat today it's super
polarized way here shocked sleigh hero
says the iphone 7 plus is the best phone
release in recent history and shall not
be questioned wow i love i love the
definitive answers all right baby cakes
and probably about 37 others say the
iphone is garbage alright that's that
what's expected um it says pixel is son
of iphone well yeah so you make that
point the pixel looks a lot
like the iphone I mean write down a
little antenna line that kind of their
sessions there's their success is you
know based on you know basically
standing on the iphone shoulders i would
i would say it's comma hybrid of of an
iphone and also some HTC's on legacy
little bug icons right well so well know
if you can argue the reverse actually
the one m8 that was a design that the
ipad took exactly and then popularized
yeah they're like now like it won't
forgot about that right yeah so i think
what's the pixel gets a larger screen
and the small it's the bezels on those
things that really make it that big chin
as you have like a button and there's a
for the earpiece another big bezel once
that gets smaller that that comparison
to go away but then again the iphone
could look like who knows what right end
of the year well yeah like that yeah one
thing that i'm kind of curious about
with the pixel and I think maybe some
other android phones have this why is
the headphone jack on the top as opposed
to the bottom of the phone you know it
was on the top because they used to be
hi what different okay yes what
difference does it make yes and I've got
it like over the phone behind like isn't
it easy it's about the pocket pull yeah
it's about the pocket pull thank you
very much cuz you're gonna explain to
this and then you're not gonna rotate in
your hand and shove bagging you're gonna
turn the thing with an iphone i rotate
my phone and put it I got it you answer
my question that's a lot of sense for
the package for the pocket but the 3 4
and 5 i'll head on the top yes still
right yeah they had basically turned
around us out i think is there to make
room for the camera yeah it might have
found it annoying but what you just
explained with the pocket makes a lot of
said there was rehired I don't yes well
I had to today cuz my battery ran out of
my headphones I carried two pairs of
Bluetooth and a wired headset just in
case I need it Oh what my 20-minute
commute right I try to gain something to
light oh no I'm actually I know I had
the worst can because my iphone was dead
my galaxy s edge or s6 edge died in
about 30 minutes cuz it only lasts about
three mins now yeah I hate that phone so
much actually whatever okay so what's
everybody running right now what does
everybody got their pocket at this
moment just so we can clear that Kleenex
what that's it i forgot hit brie my
phone i want to focus all my attention
rhetorically speaking rhetorically i got
iphone 6 i'm still on the iphone 7
iphone 7 plus I've got a regular pixel
not the Excel and I've got the galaxy s6
edge which I hate so high roller nice my
daily driver is the pixel that's what I
use all the time how much do you like it
I really loves it it's this why i use
the thing i don't i'm pixel launcher I
really don't care for I like that yeah i
use nova launcher instead by like google
assistant that thing i use far too often
and it's gotten dumber in the past two
months and i'm not sure why I'm like
when is this thing and it's like here's
a results that you're supposed to tell
me when that's the point that's supposed
to point to of like this machine
learning an AI stuff is supposed to get
smarter with dime I'm not sure that is
it's got amazing it's basically just
gone the movie maybe got drunk or
something during the weekend and I'm
like why are you not this is not right
anymore so I'd like I took a screenshot
i will say that that's tab to the left
that once I page it's super handy yeah
you basically swipe to one side you get
like all the data you need the thing
that drives me crazy at the pics and
launcher is that when you make a folder
the circular folder is slightly larger
than other icons and you can't do a damn
thing about it huh I won't want it
you're getting specific what is if you
don't taking if you come at design and
also room and you have like a couple you
know well that will have Lynn go back
and ask Google about a couple icons
going across when you have this one
Balbus icon and just staring at you
after a while you're like that can't be
or you can make them all circles um no
you can't now that pic some laundry
can't customize anything on the fix and
launcher you gotta get a different
launcher to do that that's why I'm using
nova launcher because I couldn't stand
staring at this overly large circle
horrible are you listening Google yeah
everyone the poor little boy that's a
good thing wow they really like they not
have wheels really intro we've really
touched a nerve here this is easy man if
you're gonna do it do it right you're
gonna be big on design be good on design
so another gripe out to pixel however is
a Matthew in the chat says he's still
running a nexus 5x he's dreading its
eventual demise the only thing that
prevents him from getting a pixel right
away it's the price tag yeah yeah is
that I see phone I mean they really
wanted to compete against the other
super phones you know that no Lynn
mentioned that they kind of wanted to
find this Goldilocks type they were you
know kind of perfect in terms of be a
premium foam but also kind of be able to
kill bears
well no bears were killed in that story
that's what you think all right and also
appeal to their longtime fans I think
they kind of rubbed some their longtime
fans the wrong way because yeah there
you they were used to the Nexus being
kind of affordable but awesome phone
this was an awesome phone but also much
more expensive than before that's fine
they dis annoyed the really hardcore
base where they wanted to get everybody
else right that's essentially what they
did so they pissed off them well they
didn't get everyone else they only got
most super Eisen customer right to the
tryna stick that's also they were saying
they were verizon exclusive but not
really which is a weird thing with it
yeah as you can get in verizon stores
but you weren't on any anyone to get it
on on-site but let's face it most people
don't do that most people don't buy
unless they're a hard core android user
they're not buying their phone directly
from google hard droid aunt hardcore
android user sharif in the chess all
about the freedom of android that's
great but unfortunately for most people
they don't understand or even want that
freedom they go to their store they go
to their carrier stores they want their
advice on what phone to get they like
listen to the salespeople yep so my
question we were talking about this
before the podcast what are your
expectations as far as like how much
market share pixel is going to get
especially because of what's happened
with Samsung I mean I think they
definitely benefited from Samsung was
note 7 debacle well I mean it was kinda
this kind of vacuum there for that
high-profile a competitive android phone
the pixel definitely filled it I don't
mean I can't wonder whether the verizon
deal bolstered their prospects by kind
of raising his profile but limited the
but also limited the market because most
people thought because of all that
advertising well I can't buy cuz I'm on
t-mobile or sprint or eet so I kind of
go back and forth on that I mean
obviously it's done well it's I think
it's so very well at verizon like it's
been sold out i think the blue the large
blue phone has been out of stock for a
long time oh honey just came back on
rogers the canadian wireless carriers so
not yours not not my carrier
unfortunately he has a side business yes
i really i really have to that was my
side business i would not be talking to
you I really have to appreciate foo lose
comment in the chat he says if you have
to compare every phone with the iphone i
think you answered what phone is supreme
really oh I know I like that works I
like to comment but dont troll are I
like your comment said it's the matter
really it's like you know you can
compare like 0 to 60 times on cars all
the time and you can have the best one
that doesn't mean that that one is the
one for everyone okay the iphones really
good for lots of people though i calling
it the benchmark phones pretty good it's
true the combat insult when the company
does the software makes the hardware
apples been doing that for a long time
that Google's doing the same thing right
Microsoft does it with the with the
computers with actual computers at this
point so yeah you have to compare this
we have been doing this too long yeah
yeah but that's the false argument
because if we were talking about the
samsung phone on LG phone we'd still be
stacking it next guy phone and they
don't control the software here we go
ryan in the chat wants to know if
anybody's experienced the dnd issues
with the pixel no oh whoa do not disturb
issues either what is that in reference
to I'm assuming doesn't work i mean
we're Oh everything works fine for me
yeah I haven't had it like my calls
going through during the do not disturb
her Ryan elaborate or elaborate like no
issues with this phone other than like
yeah you turn up the volume way too much
and it's gonna distort to like that
terrible it's a defect I'm like it's
just a crappy speaker ooh like I my own
issue and it's really just it's a total
first world problems because I've
multiple phones they all three different
charges for that micro USB USB see and
lightning so I like the first ride
constantly looking for the wrong charges
without looking for that actually it's
multi-headed to charge me I don't buy
that I want to spend money okay then
cheap I as is there a fatal flaw well
okay maybe not fatal but like is there a
specific flaw that you see with the
pixel that you'd like to see them
improve in the next one design yes the
design it's so pedestrian and so boring
they need to really do something about
that well the other side is it won't
really take a huge market share until
it's on every carrier in every store and
they can market it the same way kind of
like Samsung had to do the same thing I
think we're like it was the galaxy
something or other different names
different carriers when google's behind
the marketing they say it's available on
all four carriers basically available
everywhere right as soon as they could
save that once accessing and the design
is cuz i think this one is almost like a
like a little tester like okay look at
it not that great does it design but as
hard works really good it's
fast it's speedy it's light there's a
lot of things about it that make it a
better phone than a lot of other phones
but it's when they decide to turn on the
the actual design choptank we're really
gonna try for something crazy that
Robbie felt maybe pixel to pixel three
ya know you can see they definitely got
to play it safe there speaking of design
Christian vouches for the screen as he
has says that he has many friends who
have had iphones with cracked screens
he's been running android his entire
smartphone career has not correct a
screen yet is he not I was just lucky
yeah so that might just be pure luck
probably just jinx yourself not my
android s3 broke twice yeah I've never
cracked any screens so I'm maybe I'm
just really dan I just kicked myself
same same but I've also maxtor says he's
running the note 7 wait do I smell smoke
ah yes I can't resist come on you were
actually I mean if you actually had note
7 like kudos to you for keeping it at
this point isn't it bricked it's
completely yeah yeah like you can't use
that phone anymore like that but i would
i would feel bad that I couldn't keep a
phone like a note 7 just cuz to have it
as a as a sort of a speaking of yay not
to turn on ibly I wouldn't use it i
wouldn't power it on you know it's a
collector's item it's a collector's item
like a decade from now you can wait is
it illegal to sell that phone yes
because it's recalled officially
recalled all right oh my god i didn't i
have you recalled it it's like you can
you shouldn't yeah you could actually
get in trouble selling imitation 17 as
long as you say that all your invitation
it quick I had a dummy units counterfeit
notes Evan do we know when the pixels
coming to Sweden no II don't know sorry
nope hey google google meister
announcements kind of ran hazard lee in
terms of market launch true though but
it's it is a good point that like I
think the pixel has had at least enough
momentum that maybe it is going to find
its way into more markets definitely I
think it was initially it was a supply
supply we're gonna get enough phone to
the key markets and I think they're
slowly expanding yeah uh Kim all is
asking is anyone seen or heard about the
nokia 3310 come back oh I've heard I've
heard um part of it yeah I'm back I mean
we don't know we don't confirmation
Mobile World Congress is coming up in a
little bit more than a week
so Matt wait Mac says I hope they make
snake but in 3d oh dude that's it he's
joking about that but I kind of want
that I would be awesome I would play it
ya know that there are heavy rumors of
you know alongside the throw typical
android smartphones nokia android
smartphones we're gonna get like a
classic throwback retro feature phone
which is awesome i love that yeah
they're keeping the same but it wasn't
it no i don't know i don't get a dumb
version of android on there like a
really stripped-down version they should
at least upgrade the software for God's
eggs all right Ryan got back to us he
says android we're putting the device in
to do not disturb also device goes into
dnd during phone calls once off the call
and dnd does not turn off i have not
heard about it that sounds like a pain
in the ass sounds like a pretty isolated
yeah haven't you specifically for
another I don't have an Android wear
device well yes that means you have an
Android away or watch which is yeah like
nobody and then you got it like be on a
phone call which is like who's on a
phone call ever I'm group so I was on
the phone this morning Josh you don't
we're like a cell no like a reporter you
don't count yeah but i also have trial
regular people no i don't talk to my kid
of the phone that but you have to do
some family stuff true yes you can find
your kids you drop your nest cam you can
i do spy on like you don't even call
anybody it's very unusual thing I talk
to other people besides my family
manages I'm just sounds kind of crappy
those you're actually flowing like oh
yeah by the way I didn't call back
because it was a dnd but now you have a
good excuse no no I think the dnd turned
doesn't turn back on the deal or turns
off and it just it doesn't turn back off
the dnd does not turn off oh oh that's
yeah that's worse that's way worse get
that checked out I'm probably time to
trade in yeah it sounds like a
mechanical flaw in an isolated incident
they should probably just cover that on
warranty on if you raised have you
raised the issue up with the
manufacturer or anything it's kind of
the problem with google I've definitely
not heard about that with anybody buying
pixel phone directly from Google like
your customer service options are like
not not good well I mean I mean yeah you
can call Google but it's not like you
can go to a store Billy well I just
fixed right but they should cover this
directly like a software how long have
you had it sounds like yeah does sound
like a software issue oh yeah blacktop
studios has got a good one what about
app availability has andrew
would close the gap with that in recent
years or will the popularity of the
pixel fuel it Greg that is a good
question i think that apple still has an
edge when it comes to the app market
like in terms of sheer number no one but
the numbers don't matter anymore they're
like it's got a million versus like
900,000 or whatever the numbers out
there huge the problem is getting those
marquee apps they show up on iphone
first still super mario run like pokemon
go they all showed up on iphone first
and then they went to android and that's
still that's still initiate a lot of
developers they see like more money is
being made on App Store versus Android
or google play right there for people
willing to spend money the more affluent
generally so and that's because a wider
base of Android phones ranges from super
high-end to really really really low in
and so that's it's a it's much more
crazy up and down market than iphone
which has more of a consistent you know
they're they're more consistently they
have more disposable income right
despite the fact that in the US i think
it's a 50-50 split between iOS and
Android right uh no I think iOS is it's
ahead significantly more so yeah but if
you again if you look at sort of the the
base of users who are willing to spend
money on absolute and what about it's
like much it's much higher percentage on
iphone oh yeah totally ash wants to know
which android would you each recommend
for the ultimate customizable experience
which what as far as android being the
more customizable OS iOS not sorry no
iOS operating system what's the best
android phone to get to obtain that not
a samsung me i would that'd modular say
the picky at the lego phone it's a might
be the easiest way takes hold yeah cuz
it's like the cleanest version event
it's pure still play versions of those
things were called as long as it doesn't
have a giant skin on it that's really or
you could put make clockworkmod is done
no isn't it they're gone I don't even
know idea it is ok nevermind I signage
it might sorry oh yes okay cyanogen uh
why I have the oneplus phones actually
yeah but that's even that's a little
different so yeah but they get home some
of those phones come with you know the
whole
bootloader unlocked right so yes if you
find one of those you can put on a basic
stock version of Android then you put
the stock apps on yourself which is a
little bit more difficult they're not
asking about stock apps let us about
customizing so I might be able to
customize it you can you can do that
yeah as long as you can root the phone
right go for it Ryan that got back to us
he says google says they know about the
issue and they're working on a solution
according to the tech services
department yeah that's about you know
more about it than we do at this point
so sorry yeah I've never encountered
that problem it's a it is a highly
unusual one ya Shah has a quick iphone
question how many minutes can the iphone
7 plus stand under water I think was 30
ready I think but that's it how deep it
was like five meters yeah was that
asteroid you know so i probably wouldn't
press my luck I wouldn't like wait till
30 minutes like all right up dud like
it's really better if you like if it
water splashes on it if you drop in you
know you don't have to immediately have
a mild aneurysm right you just pull it
out but like I wouldn't keep the I
wouldn't keep it submerged for that long
like it's just that's still risky yeah I
wouldn't go down that road yeah by
choice if you're going going swimming
you don't need your phone now enjoy the
experience leave it at home what would
you do if you had a phone with you while
you swim what photos but just get a
GoPro just can't predict Oh Pro right
the waterproof house and get a GoPro
will be better anyway you're gonna miss
your important slack updates going
underwater to watch knit I actually go
under water to avoid place like oh
