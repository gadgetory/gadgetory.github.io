tong and this is a blockbuster battle
between the top two android phones on
the market it's a prize fight throwdown
showdown between the HTC Droid
Incredible and the HTC EVO 4G our judges
for this fight our senior editor Bonnie
boom boom cha senior editor Kent kg
German and Bryant spirit fingers Tom
we'll take all three judges scores and
average them out to the nearest tenth
each round the final prize fight score
will be an average of all rounds using
the same decimal system
HTC produces both of these phones so
which one makes you want to get you
freaked gone round one is sexiness and
durability the Droid Incredible has a
sleek and slender profile it's
rubberized surface can definitely take a
beating but I'm still turned off by its
backside Bonnie doesn't mind but Kent
isn't a fan either the evo 4G brings a
smoothed out design with its gorgeous
4.3 inch screen and a durable slim
figure to match people with larger hands
might like it but it's a bigger phone
and you might find it to be a little too
big we all stored this differently the
round one ends in a tie at four point
three points a piece next round is
controls and user interface both phones
are running Android 2.1 and HTC Sense UI
that is the prettiest Android interface
to date both phones have the same row of
four touch screen buttons for navigation
but the incredible also has an optical
joystick that works well if you're not a
full time touchscreen type of person you
can set multiple profiles depending on
how you use your phone you can quickly
jump to any menu screen with a press of
a button and customization with widgets
is king on the Android platform the main
difference between these two phones is
the size and how comfortable they feel
while you use them the evo 4G just gets
an edge with the 4.3 and the incredible
gets a 4 so after averaging 2 rattles
the evo 4G leads by
one-tenth of a point round three is
features both phones are packed with
Wi-Fi GPS and Bluetooth and an 8
megapixel camera with a dual LED flash
you'll get Android 2.1 unmatched voice
search in commands directions to Pizza
Hut turn-by-turn directions multitasking
and it's notifications pull down plus
how can you not love animated wallpapers
I do but the main difference is the
incredible is running on Verizon's 3G
network and the evo 4G is running on
Sprint's 4G network and limited cities
or on 3G it's the first 4G phone in the
US throw in a front facing camera for
video chatting plus it has its touted
kickstand and an HDMI port this is the
most feature packed phone on the market
the evo 4G gets a perfect 5 and the
incredible gets a 4 next round is web
browsing and multimedia you probably see
a theme here both phones share the same
web browser that runs smoothly with
multi-touch and both phones use the same
improved media player thanks to the
Sense UI but the larger screen on the
Evo 4G enhances every experience feeling
less cramped for web browsing and
viewing photos and videos on its display
are taken to another level
the Evo scores another perfect round
with a 5 and the incredible gets a 4 so
after averaging 4 rounds the Evo 4G
stretches its lead out to 6 tenths of a
point there's still one round left and
this isn't over the final round that
decides it all is called quality and
performance
both phones have a one gigahertz
Snapdragon processor and they are
responsive and snappy phones the
incredible on Verizon has solid call
quality but we all heard the
conversation cut out at times during our
test now the Evo 4G had superior call
quality that was extremely clear and
loud on both sides of the call but this
isn't just about call quality this is a
4G phone and on 4G you'll be lucky to
make it through a day without charging
it and even if you're running it on 3G
it's a large screen is a battery hog as
well the incredible takes around five
with the four and the Evo 4G gets a
three point three so let's average out
all five rounds and in a prizefight
where the evo 4G jumped ahead early and
kept extending its lead it holds on and
takes the title as the top smartphone
winning four point for the four point
one and is your prize buy it winner both
of these phones are top notch but the
Evo 4G is cutting-edge technology and
amazing screen made the difference
i'm brian tom thanks for watching we'll
catch you guys next time on another
prize fight
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
