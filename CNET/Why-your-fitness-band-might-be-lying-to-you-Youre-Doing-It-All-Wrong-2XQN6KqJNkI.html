hasn't been calibrated you're doing it
all wrong I have some bad news for you
whatever mileage you track today well
you might have walked more or less than
what your fitness trackers actually
shown you that's because by default
trackers calculate the distance by
multiplying your walking steps and
walking stride lengths and stride length
is set by using your height and gender
so if your track our guests your stride
length wrong then your distance is wrong
too the good news is that if all you
care about is how much you're walking
relative to yesterday or tomorrow then
your tracker isn't really letting you
down but if you're like me and you want
your fitness data to be exact then
you'll have to calibrate your device the
way you do this depends on what tracker
you're using but here's how to do it for
Fitbit head over to a place where you
know the exact distance like a track now
walk that distance and count your steps
now you can figure out your stride
length by dividing the total distance in
feet by the number of steps you took
when you have that number head to your
Fitbit dashboard and update your new
stride length if you have an Apple watch
check out Dan Graziano's how-to on
calibrating it and now you're doing it
right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
