plod now what is this particular machine
so this is an injection molding machine
this is primarily the way we make green
toys products we start with these little
pellets that are recycled milk jugs
these are literally chopped up and
washed recycled milk jugs and those sit
in this hopper here then we add to that
this second pellet pellets which is the
colorant so these two are mixed together
and they're pushed into this long piston
which is called a screw so what happens
is the heat and the rotation mixes the
plastic together and gets pushed down
this long distance
under hundreds of tons of pressure and
that's the mechanism that pushes the
plastic into the mole to create the part
and then once that's made you'll notice
the robot will take the part out and
bring it down for a secondary assembly
now the human intervention comes in
right when the pot drums
what if gentlemen keep doing so there's
one of a couple of ways that we can put
together a green toy we can either have
an operator trim the parts and put it
together or we can just take the parts
and move them to a secondary assembly
stage where they're either put together
by hand or many times we have a press
where they can automate the assembly
process
that's right one of the things you'll
notice that this particular one is
dropping a lot of parts some molds carry
big part to output one or two pieces
this is a twelve cavity ball and the
efficiency is that we're charged by the
time that machine operated so when we
can build a bigger bowl
and more parts drop out the each part is
less expensive so the trick is to build
a legal mold a attendant
as many parts repeats with each shot now
we have all of the component grout toys
what's the people together practice
reply so this is a fixture that does the
secondary assembly one of the things
you'll notice especially for a product
like this is that we want to make sure
the wheels go on but the fixture will
also check that the wheels are on and
securely on so that they won't come off
after assembling this particular fixture
think have to make a big boy and this
coil oh that's right yeah none of these
are one-size-fits-all every single
fixture is custom-made for every product
and this is the completed product ready
to be booked that the green toys mini
vehicle we sell millions of these every
year and you'll notice there's no metal
axles there's no screw there's no glue
it's 100% recyclable and this is it the
finished product is now bucked up in
these fully recycled cardboard packaging
Signori plastic sides all this made out
of Kabul to secure it properly and then
the product is shipped out to over 80
countries worldwide today green toys has
recycled over 40 million plastic bottles
here in California</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
