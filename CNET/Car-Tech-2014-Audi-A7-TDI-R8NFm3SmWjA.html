standoffish relationship with Diesel's
sticking the engines in almost every
model but this one's the most stylish
let's drive the 2014 a 70 di and check
the tech and the status at the front
lines
now the a7 is a very popular car in
terms of Halo 4 Audi then the sell a lot
it's about 9 percent of their sales not
bad but it's a premium model but it
accounts for two or three times that
much of the company is sort of hype
right now and its rep everyone knows and
loves this car but it's thought of as a
sporty four-door coupe when you put a
diesel in there at least in the American
market that tends to fight the sporty
sleek sort of mentality and that's gonna
be an interesting question to see how
well it pulls off those two sets of DNA
not much different on the outside you
won't have the TDI graphics you'll find
on our press car so you'll have to spot
one of these guys buy the TDI badge on
its rump now inside the 70 di is no
different substantially from any other 7
so I'm not gonna do a huge deep dive
into the cabin tech to find out about
that go look at our previous reviews on
the a7 and the s7 at cars cnet.com only
a few things tip you off you're in a
diesel the tachometer is the main one
there's your red line at what 4800 rpm
that would be what about 2000 lower than
in the supercharged gas engine car and
on a really cold morning like our shoot
day today there's a moment or two pause
when you first start the car that
reminds you it's a diesel as well and
this is interesting and energy consumers
screen that shows you what parasitic
operations are dragging down the engines
efficiency and with a rough estimation
by how many gallons of fuel per hour
they're burning and in keeping with the
efficient diesel theme a couple of other
things here you've got an auto
start/stop defeat normally this car will
auto start-stop at lights or in traffic
the stop-and-go luckily that defeat is
sticky defeat it once and it stays that
way and that's how I like it I'll show
you why in a moment now under the hood
you know it's a diesel even if you
didn't look at it
you can hear it turbocharged v6 three
liter there's your turbo right there
slightly smaller for the US than Europe
so it has better low rpm spool up at the
sacrifice of I believe a little bit of
top speed not that it matters its
academic your numbers on this guy are
240 horsepower kind of small for a 4,300
pound car but 428 foot-pounds of torque
that's a stunning Delta between
horsepower and torque zero to sixty is
five and a half seconds what really
matters is the mpg twenty four city
thirty eight highway 29 average one
drivetrain 8-speed automatic Tiptronic
and of course Quattro all-wheel drive
let's go see how it works okay on the
road the first thing I noticed in this a
70 di is I'm hearing more diesel noise
than I do in some other Diesel's that
we've driven lately that don't even cost
as much I'm kind of surprised by that at
idle and in cine conditions I hear it
come through rather notably that's not
what I expected here once you're out on
the road there is such great torque from
this car it feels like you can get into
any sort of situation you need to hit
it's always got the beat the thing is
though it needs to get schooled up a
little I know how to tune the turbo in
this American version to spool up faster
but it still gets buried under a little
turbo lag and it's to overdrive gears
unless you've got it in one of the
dynamic modes or your self shifting or
it's in sport mode you had all these
different modes to wake it up it's kind
of a laggard until it gets fooled up
compared to the supercharged v6 gas
version of the same car zero to sixty is
just two tenths slower in the diesel
while average mpg is 28% better the
steering on this car was very odd for me
it's an electromechanical steering rack
but when the lane-departure tech is
turned on which is active by the way
it'll
- from drifting out of a lane by using
the steering rack it gets in the way a
whole bunch of times
I was driving once down the road
straight line and it corrected me I
wasn't doing anything that even
corrected
sometimes it will let you go all the way
onto the line and then it corrects other
times it's very conservative pulls you
back when you're nowhere near the line
and other times this little icon on the
dash indicates it just can't find the
lines when it goes yellow so this system
seems to be somewhere between a
work-in-progress and a mess I wasn't
impressed by it I'm going to assume it's
this car because Audi doesn't normally
get those things wrong but I'll tell you
infinity and accurate tend to get them
more right okay this price this guy
about $68,000 delivered for an a7 TDI
they have two trim levels that's the
basic one on top of that you can add a
driver assistance package for twenty
eight hundred bucks
that's the lane departure stuff we
talked about and also adaptive cruise
and some stop and go and city traffic
8050 mortgage of Bose audio all in about
seventy one five done up see that style
okay if you drive one of these here's
how you should check the tech note the
power delivery and if it's sensitive
enough for you and everyday driving at
the same time listen in for the diesel
noise I found that kind of intrusive you
may not lane departure warning seems a
little nibbly and weird to me and very
conservative let's just kind of get to
the dotted line before it does anything
finally check the math this car cost
about twenty four hundred dollars all
things being equal just for the diesel
option my back of the envelope penciling
out tells me it's about a six point two
year earn back at current prices it
doesn't really make sense to be honest I
doubt you'll have this car that long so
you've got to also factor in the fact
that you love diesel torque and the fact
that it's got nineteen percent lower co2
emissions</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
