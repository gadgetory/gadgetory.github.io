mug may look like your typical coffee
mug but it's got special super heating
powers that allow you to control the
exact temperature of whatever liquid you
put inside it the mug comes with a
saucer charging dock and has a built-in
rechargeable battery as well as
Bluetooth connectivity
you're probably wondering whether this
thing has an on/off switch and the
answer is no it's on all the time and
automatically detects when you put
liquid in it and works best when you
start with the liquid already very hot
with the included AB you create a
default temperature you want the mug to
maintain you can set the temperature
once and never look at the app again or
you can adjust the temperature via the
app as you're drinking I can say that
it's a little odd at first when you get
toward the bottom of your cup of coffee
and take a sip to discover the coffee
still hot
it does taste better though as a little
bonus you can customize the color of the
LED on the mug which allows you to tell
it apart from another ember mug in the
office or at home keeping your coffee or
tea hot does require a good amount of
energy and I found that if I drank a cup
over the course of about 45 minutes it
drained the battery by around 40 to 50
percent so you can basically drink a
couple of cups of coffee before you have
to recharge the mug may survive a wash
in the dishwasher but amber warns you to
hand wash it and you do not want to put
this mug in the microwave that's a big
no-no there are other cheaper and lower
tech solutions to keep your coffee hot a
good insulated mug will run you around
$20 while this guy costs $80 which is
pretty darn steep but it is less
expensive and embers a $150 travel mug
and it will change the way you think
about drinking your coffee or tea I'm
