technologies that have arrived in cars
over the last decade or so and several
more arrived every year but which ones
do you really care about
I'm Brian Cooley with the top five JD
Power asked consumers about fifty nine
car tech features ranging from those
involved in energy efficiency to in
cabin entertainment we've ranked the top
five responses based on how many people
selected the technology for their short
list number five self-healing paint 25%
there's really no such thing as
self-healing paint there is Nissan's
scratch shield but that only smoothes
out very minor scrapes in the clear coat
only not the paint but we so hate the
expensive time-consuming results of a
dent or scratch that we keep on dreaming
number four a rear camera with the
display in the mirror 30% not just a
mere cam but one that has a little tiny
display at least it's up where you
should be looking when backing instead
of looking down number three collision
mitigating braking 30% this is one of
the most gettable of the early
self-driving technologies the one that
will jump on the brakes when you forget
to any of you think this might be driven
by the guilt people feel about staring
down at their phones in traffic number
two is night vision technology 33%
here's an odd one since so few people
have ever tried it apparently not enough
to know that my experience it often
sucks but we love anything with the
phrase night vision in it before I get
you to the number one technology we want
in cars here are the ones we want the
least like health and wellness
technology gesture control and haptic
feedback screens bless your hearts
you're right on the money there
interestingly missing from the top ranks
of what we do want our hybrid technology
and the latest smartphone integration
like apple carplay and android auto
maybe they just need some time the
number one technology you say you want
in a car is blind spots at 40% the
automotive blind spot back
there is one we know we need help with
and they're only getting worse because
cars keep bulking up more and more like
fortresses on wheels
who says you got to join the army to
drive a tank or top five lists to wait
the car lover go to see net on cars comm
