that doesn't run Android I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your CNET update
wearable technology is all the rage
these days especially smartwatches but
there's one very unique SmartWatch that
you may not have heard of it's the
Android SmartWatch yes Android
SmartWatch is its name because it's made
by a company called Android and that
company has been making high-end
traditional watches since 1991 years
before Google existed what's amusing is
that this Android SmartWatch does not
run Google's operating system it's the
time keepers own special software but it
does pair with iPhones and Android
phones and it has the features that most
folks would want like text message and
call alerts
it also can answer calls with a built-in
speaker it costs $200 and there are more
than a dozen fashionable band designs
and colors to choose from the Android
SmartWatch was on display at the luxury
Technology Show in New York and although
the watch was a practical purchase many
other products at this show were a bit
more lavish here's a taste of high tech
for the upper class how would you like
to go to work in a space pod this is the
Emperor LX it's designed for folks who
need multiple monitors like programmers
or evil masterminds plotting world
domination the chair is heated and it
vibrates there are built-in speakers and
air filtration system and light therapy
because you haven't seen the Sun in a
while it costs $21,000 and when it's
time for your steak lunch you can pull
out the I wallet it will only open with
your fingerprint or by smacking it open
with a hammer this carbon fiber case can
be broken into but as someone from the
company explains it it's more for the
friendly thief like a spouse that is
stealing your credit card so if you
think this wallet will solve the trust
issues in your marriage you can spend
$400 to feel more in control for your
workout there's the peloton bike it
streams video of live cycling classes
it's $2,000 for the bike and another 40
dollars a month to watch the classes for
a night out with friends ladies can
bring more
style to the party with a wireless
bluetooth speaker disguised as a clutch
purse it's three hundred and fifty
dollars and it comes in many styles and
you don't need to go out to the movie
theater when you can bring new releases
to your home with prima cinema $35,000
pays for the system that accesses the
movies and to watch a movie you just
swipe your fingerprint and pay another
$500 for each film and it's only a
24-hour rental that's your tech news
update you can find more details at
