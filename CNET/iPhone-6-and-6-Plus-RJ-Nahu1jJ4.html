the new iPhones the iPhone 6 has split
into two different types the iPhone 6
and the iPhone 6 plus but both going to
be available September 19th and two
different prices starting a $1.99 for
the 6 and $2.99 for the 6 plus so what's
the difference they both have larger
screens a 6 is a 4.7 inch screen
compared to the 4 inch on the iPhone 5
1334 by 750 it's about 38% more pixels
and this has a 1920 by 1080 p display
5.5 inch screen now this is the
territory of a phablet or a phone tablet
but it feels pretty good in the hand and
Apple has actually come out with a quick
double tap to access your apps with one
hand in case you feel a little too
intimidating they both have revamp
cameras one has optical image
stabilization that's the six plus that
keeps your phone shots more stable and
it uses technology as normalling cameras
but it is making its way into more and
more smart phones these both run iOS 8
of course and the design has been
revamped to be curved more like the iPod
Touch or even the iPad very sleek and
still space for a gold and silver you
can get a little more storage for your
money to 16 gigabytes for $1.99 and the
6 or $2.99 year but then the next bump
up is 64 gigabytes and the top-end is
128 so that's pretty nice and did I
mention these are the only two phones
that will work with Apple pay apples new
payment system that's going to be
deploying working like a mobile wallet
to enable you to pay at various stores
that have contactless wireless systems
now what about battery life these both
have a little bit of battery life game
anywhere from one to two hours or a
little bit more depending on what
youth's according to Apple for video or
web browsing you're gonna get a little
more battery life juice out of the
iPhone 6 plus but stay tuned for our
seed testing and CNET which one do I
like I mean I still like a more discreet
phone but I got a save for 5.5 inch this
does feel pretty portable compared to
others I've seen I'm Scott
taking a look at the new iPhones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
