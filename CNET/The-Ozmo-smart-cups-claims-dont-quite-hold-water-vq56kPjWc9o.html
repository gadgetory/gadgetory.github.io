little different it is a
bluetooth-enabled cup called Osmo it
started out on Kickstarter it was fully
funded and now it's available for
purchase it costs 80 bucks but is
currently on sale for 60 so it's it's
pretty pricey even with a discount but
the idea is that it's supposed to be
able to know the difference between
water and coffee and it has a related
app that's this thing right here and it
tracks both your water intake and your
caffeine intake to make sure you're
getting enough water and not drinking
too much coffee so I have put some water
in here and I'm gonna try it out right
now just to see how well it does okay so
actually I just took a big sip of water
and it thought it was coffee so that's
not a great result from this thing I had
tried it earlier and it was doing pretty
well so I haven't actually run into this
yet
so by now I have spent all day with Osmo
and I would definitely consider it an
anomaly that it confused the water for
the coffee at this point it did a pretty
good job overall throughout the day even
though I tried to confuse it by using
warm water and iced coffee it still did
a pretty good job that said for 60 bucks
and that's the sale price I'm not sure
that pretty good is good enough I'd also
like to see a lot more features I'd like
to see it be able to pick up on other
caffeinated beverages like tea and soda
because most people don't just drink one
thing so if they manage to do those
things I think this would be easier to
recommend but right now I would hold off
on buying</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
