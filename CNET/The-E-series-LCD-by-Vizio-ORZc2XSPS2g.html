to videos II four to zero I a 1 this is
one of the companies eseries televisions
there's a few of the screen sizes in
this series including a 39 a 47 and a
50-inch this review will apply to all of
them the e series comprises Vizio 's mid
to entry-level TVs for 2013 this set
right here does have Smart TV along with
built in Wi-Fi one of the things you'll
notice right off the bat though is it's
pretty sleek styling along the edge of
the screen there's a nice thin frame
here that makes it look similar to a lot
of the other Samsung and LG TVs out
there turn it to the side though you can
see it's a direct LED TV meaning that
it's a lot thicker than the edge of the
LED TVs we've seen before just think of
this TV is a standard LCD you don't
worry about the LED backlight because it
really doesn't bring much to the table
in terms of picture quality Vizio Smart
TV suite brings an excellent selection
of content including Amazon Netflix Vudu
and a host of other lesser services
there's also quite a few audio services
including Pandora and Rhapsody as well
as Skype if you buy the optional camera
vizio also throws in built-in Wi-Fi of
course you can also connect an ethernet
cable usually do get better performance
if you do decide to run the cable unlike
a lot of the other vizio smart tvs
however this one does not include a flip
side QWERTY keyboard on the remote
control vizio throws and plenty of
picture presets a lot of them named
after sports all of this set doesn't
have quite the selection of advanced
picture modes such as gamma control and
color management systems seen on some of
its competitors in the settings menu you
will find something called smart dimming
which controls this TVs local dimming
functionality and I don't get too
excited as I was when I first heard this
TVs local dimming when I tested in the
lab that didn't work all that well in
fact made the picture too dark a crushed
a lot of this shadow detail so I ended
up turning it off another disappointment
on the TV is its builds a 120 Hertz set
but if you go into the menu you won't
find any controls for smoothing and the
set does have the same motion resolution
as a 60 Hertz television so all told I'm
calling the 60 Hertz TV despite videos
120 Hertz claim so I from those issues
that picture quality TV was pretty good
for the price point black levels are
relatively deep but color accuracy
wasn't quite as good as some Vizio as
we've seen but again pretty decent I
also appreciated the picture uniformity
on this set there aren't too many
glaring bright spots and there's also
pretty good performance for bright rooms
thanks to that matte screen the e-series
input selection is modest you get three
HDMI in one component video there's no
PC input however unless use an HDMI slot
with a digital outlook from your
computer it's a quick look at vizio z0i
a one series I'm David Katz my Lucina</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
