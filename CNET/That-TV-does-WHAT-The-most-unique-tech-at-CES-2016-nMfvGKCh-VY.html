as far out as you may think I'm Bridget
Carey this is your scene at update it's
been a busy few days here at CES also
known as the consumer electronics show
we've seen interesting developments and
smart home appliances car tech health
trackers and virtual reality but now
that the show is winding down were able
to step back and think about the
products that stood out and we're really
just so different and dare I say could
change the future when it comes to
televisions you expect to see things
that are bigger brighter and thinner but
LG let us touch an old television that
you could roll up like a piece of paper
and slip into your bag we're still a few
years away from making this a realistic
portable TV because you need to power it
wirelessly and somehow have inputs for
all of your cable or streaming things
the future of TV could also be made up
of a bunch of smaller displays that
seamlessly fit together to form one
giant image Samsung showed a concept
screen that snaps together in different
aspect ratios and that lets you build a
larger TV than what's possible with
current tech because you know the bigger
you go the harder it is to make and
we've all seen plenty of drones and quad
copters on the show floor but what about
a drone for you to write in yeah you as
a person you can sit inside of it my
colleague ashley Esqueda checked out the
e hang 184 which wasn't giving demo
rides because of regulations but the
company says the 8 rotors can carry you
at 11,000 feet in the air at 65 miles an
hour you just sit in and tap the place
on the map where you want to go so
you're not actually doing the driving
and you're not going to go too far
because it has about 23 minutes of
battery life apparently has accomplished
100 successful man test flights so far
if you rather not actually be inside of
a drone there are other ways to feel
like you're flying the company parrot
has a drone that you compile it while
wearing a virtual reality headset so you
see the point of view of the drone while
you fly it like a real-life video game
and what if a hoverboard could also be
your home assistant into a partnered
with Segway which created a personal
transportation device that transforms
into a robot
and with Intel's real sense technology
it can quickly identify your face and
answer the door recognizing if your
friends are at the door or if it's
someone you don't know it also reads the
area instantly to not run into walls it
was one example of what can be done with
Intel's fast processing chips and they
are testing out arms for this thing so
it could carry stuff for you I just
wanted to do some chores but we're not
the Rosie level yet maybe next to yes
thanks for watching you can catch up on
all the highlights from the show at cnet
com / CES from the scene at stage at the
Las Vegas Convention Center I'm Bridget
