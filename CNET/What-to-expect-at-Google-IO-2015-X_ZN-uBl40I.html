that Google Isha's for everything google
that we can pack inside of a show now
we're just a day away from google i/o
2015 so let's jump into everything we
expect to see from the big G at the
event now it's a no-brainer that will
see plenty of the next android OS
Android M currently codenamed macadamia
nut cookie yummy now the official build
most likely won't be available until the
fall but a report from Android Police
says this version will take on a renewed
focus on battery life and RAM usage it's
not the sexiest features but still super
important for users and we expect Google
to release a def preview of Android M at
the event reports also claimed that
Android M will finally include native
fingerprint authentication users will be
able to log into all of the supported
applications on their android devices
without entering a password now if you
remember the Nexus 6 was widely expected
to release with a fingerprint scanner
but it was scrapped before the phone
actually launched who will now is also
expected to get beefed up they open up
their API to work with about 40
different apps earlier in the year and
we expect that to open up even more and
right now these aren't the flashes
updates but improvements that will
really make an impact now macadamia nut
cookie won't be the official name see
you remember when key lime pie turned
into KitKat or lemon meringue pie turned
into lollipop most people think it's
going to be Android marshmallow that's
softer fluffier and even yummier but we
won't know until it's official release
now we haven't seen a new piece of
chromecast hardware for two years and
google has let it just do its thing on
the side Google claimed in January they
have casted over 1 billion pieces of
content at i/o this year there are
several sessions focusing on bringing
games to the big screen with chromecast
and you have to think that new and more
powerful hardware will be part of that
solution so I'm guessing we'll see a new
chromecast this year now smartwatches
are still two cats meow to manufacturers
and yes the Apple watch is getting a lot
of the buzz still but Android wear will
get its time to shine Google knows that
fitness is one air
they are trailing behind with Android
wear and we expect to potentially see
more of a focus on the Google fit
platform that was previewed last year
but again it's all about the apps even
if they are super lightweight ones now
the smart home is still the next
platform that tech companies are
planting seeds for we aren't there yet
but according to the information google
is planning on releasing a build of
android capable of running on devices
with as little as 32 megabytes of ram
codenamed brillo the previous minimum
Android requirement was 512 megabytes of
RAM which was meant for smartphones and
wearables but this is clearly a new
version of Android made to power other
less demanding devices the report also
says brillo is targeting connected home
devices instead of the whole internet of
things we don't know how it will work
with Google's nest product yet but if
it's ready to unveil we should see it at
i/o this year and the star of the show
might not be any of this it might just
come down to photos we know that Google
is breaking up Google+ and taking its
top services like photos and hangouts
and working on them as standalone
products now Android police got an
exclusive early look at the new Photos
app and it's completely free of Google+
the app will still let you search for
people animals or objects and back up
your photos automatically you'll now
have different views to choose to look
at your collection you can interact by
pinching and swiping on photos to open
them you'll also be able to do this cool
drag to select multiple photos move and
there's a whole new bunch of editing
features all right on the hardware side
android police reports that there will
be no new Nexus tablet in 2015 and the
Nexus 9 will remain the flagship but
instead two new phones will be released
by Google one built by LG with a 5.2
inch screen codenamed angler and a 5.2
inch screen phone built by Huawei
codenamed bullhead it will be the first
time google has released two Nexus
phones in one year and according to the
report this is the plan now no specs
were given for the phones and before we
go I had to include this totally
unrelated to Google I but the best thing
I've seen on the internet today Samsung
has finally released an official
unboxing of the Iron Man theme samsung
galaxy s6 engine I just wet myself see
it comes in this
packaging with a clear cover and a
wireless charger that looks like an arc
reactor goodness now the phone is
launching in Korea pretty much today it
will be available in China and Hong Kong
sometime next month but no word on the
US and I'm just saying I need a wireless
charger that looks like a freaking arc
reactor alright that's going to do it
for this week's show you can always
email us at Google issues at cnet com or
tweet me at brian Tong and just a
reminder starting at nine thirty AM will
