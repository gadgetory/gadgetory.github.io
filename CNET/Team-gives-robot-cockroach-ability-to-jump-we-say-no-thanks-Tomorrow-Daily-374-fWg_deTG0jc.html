welcome to tomorrow daily noveske talk
show in the known universe I'm Ashley
together and i'm jeff cannata and it's
time to get you up to date with some
headlines researchers I can only assume
who've watched the Simpsons a bunch of
times are now teaching robots to feel
pain why why was I programmed to feel
pain johannes kuhn and sami Hadean
presented their system at the I Triple E
international conference on robotics and
automation recently here's how it works
they took a biotech fingertip sensor
attached it to a robotic arm and created
a reflex response for the sensor that is
able to feel varying degrees of pain
light pain causes the robot to slowly
retract but severe pain pushes the arm
into a passive mode to minimize damage
kind of like human shock kuhn and had a
dean hope their work helps future robots
avoid unnecessary damage is this a good
idea I mean I thought robots the point
of robots was so because they don't yeah
that's like there's a huge advantage
over us hey let's send them into
hazardous situations and all of a sudden
they're gonna be like I have radiation
poisoning out me I think maybe you're
gonna feel very terrible I think maybe
it's more a semantics thing of like we
can call it pain but it's just avoid
damaging yourself right which is what is
that pain was really doing for human
beings I guess avoid damaging why are
you hitting yourself why you hitting
yourself don't hit yourself right and
don't let other things hit you let's
write you another research presentation
at that I Triple E conference featured a
leaping cockroach robot or as I like to
call it nope ah Seoul National
University in South Korea collaborated
with UC Berkeley to create this robot
which is called jump Roach not jump rope
this little roaches body is the dash
robot which we've seen before but now
it's got a mechanism underneath that
enables it to hop jump and leap up on to
higher surfaces making it more appealing
for subtle exploration or maybe even
search and rescue in rubble it can
adjust how high it jumps and can
itself if it gets turned over the only
thing missing at this point is working
wings which yeah maybe we just maybe
just skip the wings hey we just don't
maybe we just don't let robotic have
jaws or teeth or fangs or claws I think
we can't we're all right right I'm are
I'm a little worried that just for
effect they're gonna add the hissing
sound that those Madagascar and hissing
cockroaches make just to freak me out
even more but I don't like the way you
move jump Roach need a matching you
didn't make this this brooch feel pain
that's a woman yeah so that when I smash
it with a newspaper it can feel it
that's what I want to do which we talk
about I mean I think we got to talk
about robots feeling pain yeah I think
robots feeling pain is a fascinating
topic good bad is it necessary does it
help things or is it the other step path
to disaster a boy which sometimes you
know it might be science science uh make
sure use hashtag hate ed on Twitter to
talk to us about robots feeling pain do
you like it are you for or against it
and if we like your tweets we will put
them in the Thursday long show when we
talk about this again we love
incorporating your feedback into those
shows so be sure to do that hey is it
time for photographer the day it is
let's check out our first selfie
as I mentioned our theme this month is
selfies the month of june the theme
photogra for selfies and jason took this
wonderful picture with his nexus 6p
jason rides my name is jason i went
camping this weekend with some friends
at hickory run state park pennsylvania i
went hiking and took these pictures on
my Nexus 6p we had a great time camping
and had some good food although while I
was sleeping a bear ate my cheese it
ripped apart some neighbors campers
cooler yikes I'm not sure what the
current theme is spring selfies or if
you came up with a different option but
hopefully one of these might make the
cut you have my permission to use these
photos be good human hosts of the best
tech talk show in the known universe ah
thanks buddy super nice this is great
although uh Barry is cheese yeah uh I
would have preferred a bear selfie but
no no no don't do that it's dangerous
actually yeah please not no more bear
people have actually died trying to do
thou it's not a good idea why I'm just a
bear taking a selfie with it like leave
your phone out next time and maybe the
bear will take a selfie I don't know
just just to suggest I'm sorry that
Barrett your cheese though I'm done you
should not have picnic basket Vanessa
marks because I watched a lot of yogi
Berra's good if you guys want to send in
