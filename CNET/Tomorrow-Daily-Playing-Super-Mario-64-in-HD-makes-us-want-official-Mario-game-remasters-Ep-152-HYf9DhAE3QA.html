give the moon a small little tiny moon a
classic Nintendo game gets an
much-deserved HD remake and you can play
it for free and some enterprising and
brilliant students find a way to create
a fire extinguisher that uses sound to
extinguish the flames that's how it get
out tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best speak
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley SCANA join me as always
kaylynn honest how are you doing I'm
great and I'd like to start off this
show and every show this week with a
disclaimer that April Fool's Day is this
Wednesday meaning that if any of these
stories turn out to be false I would
like to have plausible deniability and
let you know that I tried okay like I
tried to verify each of these stories so
if any of them turn out to be not real I
didn't in fact make an effort you're
covering your buttocks on this one
usually people don't give people a clue
in that April 1st is coming up I might
hate April Fool's Day because my
birthday is the day before April Fool's
Day and so when I was a kid everybody
and their brother thought it was just so
hilarious ha ha ha ha
to wrap up boxes that were empty and be
like I got you a birthday present and
then they were empty and then I was just
like wow nice nice job I got to return
all those empty boxes I'm back yeah you
better but do we have an April Fool's
episode planned to meet you maybe maybe
we do maybe we don't you'll have to tune
in and find out I pitched you an idea I
hope we go with it I don't know I think
we all kind of like had ideas going some
ideas maybe you have any ideas
hashtag TD Fool's yeah two equals and if
you just I just made that up
we're idiots hashtag to you yeah else
you have picture pictures of clowns
hashtag 284 jesters and anything how
about some news all right hit the
headlines
all this show is out of here that's all
right I took great start all right so we
got to talk about this moon for the moon
this is a weird thing but it is true
because NASA posted this video on their
website so NASA has this mission that is
called the asteroid redirect mission
it's called arm an arm the point of arm
is to figure out ways to sort of not
have a catastrophic asteroid impact on
earth which seems pretty important and
so they have this plan this is a concept
where a robotic spacecraft this is the
video they released that they explain
how the entire mission will work a
robotic spacecraft would fly to an
asteroid grab a boulder off of it and
then bring it back to the moon and then
put it in the moon's orbit what yeah so
they would make this little Boulder off
of an asteroid a little moon for the
moon kind of okay okay so that seems
super weird I know because you're like
how is that going to protect us from
asteroids this seems crazy
this seems totally crazy but it actually
makes a little bit of sense because this
robotic spacecraft is going to take
about six years to go and get get the
craft back to place the rock in orbit at
the moon and during that time NASA will
be learning how the rock moves through
space and so they might potentially
figure out how to sort of steer
asteroids headed to earth away from us
so they're gonna have to get the rock
over here which means they're gonna have
to figure out how it moves through space
okay okay so that's an important part of
learning sort of like well how can we
sort of move these larger asteroids like
if there was something that could really
cause damage to earth and it was heading
for us how could we sort of figure out
you know maybe we could send a
spacecraft out there to sort of steer it
away from us things like that and then
the other part of that is they'll be
examining and studying the boulder as it
comes back not just the way it moves
through space but also what it's
composed of what you know a lot of
things about it they want to learn about
it and then there's a second part of the
mission which is pretty cool it's a
manned mission on the Orion spacecraft
and they're gonna send astronauts up to
this robotic spacecraft are gonna dock
with it and they would inspect the
boulder before they put it in that orbit
so when the robotic craft arrives
near the moon then they would also
collect hard samples that they would
then bring back down earth to be tested
in the lab so there it's not only like
learning more about asteroids and how
they're composed and what they're made
of and all this other stuff but also
trying to figure out kind of if there
was sort of a catastrophic asteroid
headed for us and it looked pretty bad
you know maybe this is kind of a way
that we might be able to avoid that and
they're hoping I think 2020 is the goal
on this so it's a few years out but
they're already I mean they have to work
on it now it's not a little bizarre to
you super weird okay I just want to make
sure that I was mental but it's like
there's a lot of asteroids yeah I like
and then the whole like man mission like
everything is just like okay but I mean
it does get that knowledge to me it
makes sense that they would say we want
to see how this robotic spacecraft would
move this Boulder through space in the
event that we would need to sort of
guide one away from Earth like we want
to make sure there's not any surprises
so I think that that's a pretty good
idea and to do something on a smaller
scale and then say okay now we know this
works we can try it on a bigger scale
something like that all right pretty
phat I got a lot to think about on that
one fascinating weird weird it's great
that they interviewer just listening
it's great that they had all the visuals
thing yeah every step of the way they
not only have the robotic mission video
they have the man dimension video too so
you can watch simulations of bones we
didn't see that yeah they played they
have both on the on NASA's YouTube page
which I thought was fantastic so um so
yeah that's what they want to do with
with asteroid an arm that's the the
mission which is pretty awesome all
right yeah so tell me about tell me
about hey this HD remake rather than
tell you I want to show you and tell you
I went ahead I went ahead and tried the
demo out and I made a little video so
take it away kale thanks Ashley
and kale today we have a really cool mod
to show off and some really cool text so
let's get started because it is a mod of
a super mario 64 and upper mind anyway
so as you can see super mario 64 in HD
it looks very beautiful everything's
fluffy the grass is green and mowed
freshly this is obviously the first
level from Mario 64 but let's talk about
the tech being used here this is built
from the ground up in the Unity engine
but this is to show off there's a demo
to show off the super character creator
created by a guy named Roy Stan Ross now
the super character creator is a program
that he he built that is supposed to
it's supposed to detect ground ground
detection where's the detection pushback
anything you'd expect from a video game
character let's watch me get completely
destroyed here let me get ragged boom
anyway so you can play this if you have
a Mac a PC or Linux it's available
through the if you have the unity engine
which you can download if you just go to
the browser it's available on rice and
Ross's WordPress if you look that up he
only has the first level
you're not gonna build the whole thing
he said you've got better things to do
he's building freaking engines over here
so you can go and check that on his
website play the demo I'm gonna try and
make it to the bomb King up here if I
can in the meantime but yeah it's
available and he leaves kind of the the
coding up there so you can try and build
one of your own or maybe finish this
game we're hoping that somebody finishes
making Mario 6000 making mario 64 so
much somebody at home is watching this
and being like kill pillows new Bishnu
but yeah like I said he hasn't completed
the whole thing there are some things
missing but it's a really cool
impressive look at what can be done with
the super character creator go ahead and
check it out on rice and Ross's website
thanks again and back to you Cale and
Ashley thanks kale thank you kale thank
you past present future kale but you
should go check it out you should give
it a shot that's pretty cool
so bringing us to our hashtag of the day
TD 64 whoo I'm great you can't stop can
you you just can't stop my sorry you
actually have a good Mario impression
it's pretty good is it yeah yeah I'm
enjoying it so basically because
Super Mario 64 kind of ruined my life at
the time when it was out like I just I
wanted to play it non-stop I thought it
would be fun to do the hashtag of the
day TV 64 what game would ruin your life
if you could play it in browser because
you can play that in browser yeah like
straight up right in your browser so
what game would ruin your life if you
could play it in a browser like you just
forget it I'm done well I think for some
of us it would it would help if it like
had multiplayer to a co-op so yeah cuz I
put in some hours you know what Smash
Brothers you're gonna say smash bros i'm
gonna say Smash Brothers I'm sticking
with the Nintendo thing just because
yeah you got in my head but I'm saying
Smash Brothers because if I could just
play with somebody there's on I love
like another computer like in the same
building even if it was mobile oh it's
over what about you I would say gosh
there's so many good choices but I would
say staying with Nintendo I would say I
would probably play a whole lot of I
think I would play like Super Mario 3d
World if you could connect to like if it
wasn't just local multiplayer like I
feel like I'd play that game a lot like
and like play with other people and just
play levels of people over and over
again like already the world we're
spoiled we want that that connection now
it doesn't matter if it's in the browser
we want to be able to still connect
that's like we can't play without it
anymore it's just the way we are I love
the idea of being able to just like
randomly connect to a group of three
other people that wait and like a little
like Lobby or whatever and then it's
just okay you're all gonna play this
random level or you can pick what level
or you can randomize like this would be
an issue because we no one would get any
work done that's my answer was Goldeneye
but we got a city you can see you don't
have to say Nintendo stuff it's TV 64 or
you can say anything you want see was
the city before they got it in there I
know another good one I would say Diablo
like if I could just play that oh yeah
my life would end Diablo 3 it would just
be over um yeah I don't want to think
about that future it's terrible alright
so tell us about this fire extinguisher
this audio pretty cool so there is an
electrical engineering student his name
is Seth Robertson and there is a
computer engineering major named Viet
Tran and they work together at George
Mason George Mason George Mason
versity in Virginia and they made this
really cool fire extinguisher that
actually uses low-frequency sound waves
to put out fires
so check this out so they're lighting
this alcohol accelerant induced fire
inside a pan and they're going to use
what kind of looks like a really cobbled
together Ghostbusters pack like but it
but not quite like they're gonna use
that on the fire to put it out and so
there you go see they just put out the
fire with sound with sound there's no
any know kind of like extinguishing foam
or anything like that they did it was
sound so here's how it works
the idea is if you keep oxygen from the
flames long enough the fire would get
suffocated right so you need oxygen from
one of the three things you need to make
fire direct so this uses low frequency
sound waves to displace the oxygen in
that area so it's between I think it was
like minus 20 minus 40 DB or something
like that I don't have the exact decibel
levels but they basically use that
cannister thing to focus the sound waves
at the area where the fire is and then
it it displaces the oxygen long enough
to where there's no oxygen fire
suffocates itself and it dies you never
run out of infinite infinite
extinguishing yeah so this this
prototype that they made is portable
which we've seen it looked pretty bulky
but yeah pretty bulky but here's the
thing like we've seen something like
this before a fire extinguisher with
that uses sound from DARPA but it was
huge and it was definitely not portable
and these guys kind of took it upon
themselves to sort of take it to the
next level so there's a sound frequency
generator on it an amplifier and then
there's the the collimator which is the
thing that they're pointing at the fire
it's like the Lowell sort of cylinder to
that focus as the sound waves so they're
saying you can put off small fires with
alcohol accelerants which is what you're
seeing in the video but they said the
real challenge is kind of developing
this further to battle different types
of fires so of course you have like
brush fires you have grease fires
there's different kinds of fires and
they don't really know like exactly how
they might make that work because
another challenge would be keeping the
fire from reigniting so when you have
things like forest fires you have you
have hotspots that need to be cooled
down with water and so these guys are
like we're trying to figure out ways to
sort of kind of develop it freaking
bigger make it bigger or battle
that'll larger fires and that's kind of
that's their goal so but it's still
really cool that they that they made
this sort of portable pack and they're
saying this could the idea of this could
really revolutionize home fire
extinguishers so you would have
something like this I like for a small
fire you I I liked your angle with the
forest fire thing because you get out
there and there's not water all the time
you're out there and you can't you
cannot that's why they have to go and
get the plane a lot of stuff and they
have to go into people's pools and that
takes time yeah and that's just time for
the fire to grow
so it's which is never good and then of
course you have the idea of like putting
firefighters lives in danger you have
them in these forest fires where they
have these situations where the fire can
come back into that area and overcome
them and it's just it's incredibly
dangerous and we have California has an
amazing the CDF the California
Department of Forestry they're
incredible at firefighting this is
literally one of our seasons we don't
actually have a fall it's just fire like
that's that's our season here it's just
there's like fire and then there's
drought there's a drought fire mudslides
like these are our seasons and traffic
your traffic all year round so um so
yeah I mean it's really dangerous so so
to think that maybe they would be safer
for not only firefighters but even just
people in their houses like this is
pretty cool yeah that is cool I like the
idea that off on a kale tangent that
they would be playing a song you have to
pick a song drop like which one puts out
fires the best yeah just Avicii put out
better fires so funny they tried music
but but they said it didn't displace the
accident and nothing no there was too
much chaos in the variation of the sound
waves and I said we couldn't use musica
has to be a set like low frequency range
that would be able to displace the
oxidant I'm gonna create my own TD here
no I'm sorry to TD dubs and then tell me
which song you used to put out fires
perfect yeah sorry pardon sorry uh so
we're gonna take a quick break and we
will be right back with a backer Hackett
it's pretty fun it's a robot okay just
straight up full disclosure is this a
one that you think free if you have an
idea whatever that's pretty cool I mean
it could be really fun and
we have your user feedback from last
week and then of course we have our
phone tired for the day but before we go
check out this break video of a CD
basically exploding in and of itself it
gets rotated so fast that it warps and
then explodes at a hundred and seventy
thousand frames per second that is
amazing welcome back to the show it is
it is Monday which means it's time to
discuss a crowdfund effort that we are
interested in and but we're not quite
sure if we're gonna give it a go or
maybe just not so much so it is time as
always we're Beckett or hack it okay so
today I'm back at her Hackett we have
plenty plenty is a robot okay I love me
some robot yeah we both like some robots
on our robot babies knives our Robo
babies plenty they claim to be the
world's first printable open-source
humanoid robot printable how adorable
plan to is that oh my god it was mere
robot so it's so what this comes with is
it's a robot kit with an Arduino control
board got some servos in it accessories
that people can assemble so here's the
cool part about plenty - is that you
don't actually need special tools or
technical knowledge to assemble this
fantastic so anybody just need a
screwdriver you get the kit you can
assemble your little robot it's about
seven point eight inches tall when it's
when it's finished okay bringing each
other coffee it's adorable
they also give you the 3d printing data
so you can actually make your own custom
parts and/or like make your own custom
like shells so this is the basic and
then you can make it whatever you want
the dev Edition I love this one I use on
the treadmill the developer editions
gonna have the Intel Edison chip on
board so really like good for developers
be able to kind of expand what it does
we saw the spider dress was Intel power
to Intel Edison chip powered it is fully
open source it will be iOS and Android
compatible they want to deliver it and
they want to deliver it by November 2015
and they're saying like as you can see
in this video they're giving all sorts
of reasons why you could use this robot
you could do it for rehab you could
rehabilitation you could do it for fun
you could have it for different uses
like mes yeah it's ridiculous like we
have all these like coal Ares this video
if you're just listening is the best
robot video I've ever the most adorable
adorable
it makes robots look like they're not
going to take over the world but they're
going to take over our eyes hearts
they're gonna they're gonna take them
over I love it so yeah this is end this
so there's somebody assembling it right
there it looks pretty straightforward I
mean there's all kinds of stuff you can
do with this robot they're saying like
it is extremely open-ended what you can
accomplish with it and they have this
sort of interface that sure you can help
teach you what to do there's one where
yeah you have connect you're teaching
you how to move and stuff oh he's
reading his faces so it looks like that
you can it can read your motions there's
that arm band thing that we uh that we
showed earlier on the head there's a
headband so you can you send over like
your brain waves to like have it do
activity and three facial features very
opening phone very opening okay so looks
adorable looks adorable
no Genghis it ain't she is here Angus
the robot Angus has no movement at all
but what about the price it's a little
it's a little pricey it's a little
pricey it's not gonna be $1.99 like you
would you know walk into and walk into
an Apple store and buy some accessory
for 200 bucks it's uh right now the
early over 350 the the lowest priced
early bird kit which only has one spot
left last I checked is $6.99
good lord and that's almost sold out
then they have one an early bird thing
that has 11 spots left and that's $7.99
and then the regular kickstart
Kickstarter price is $8.99 so it's not
cheap but it does look like it has a
pretty wide range of programming
abilities right so if your developer or
you're into robotics if you want to
teach robotics this seems like a pretty
open-ended project that you would be
able to sort of you maybe you every
semester you'd reset it I think schools
yeah that'd be cool yeah so um
apparently they've already met their
goal they have over 40,000 so plenty
well we'll hopefully go into production
at some point they've got 35 days ago so
they met their goal pretty fast but yeah
that's that's plenty and they have all
kinds of like developer special
developer editions and like all sorts of
stuff so and they even have cheaper
tiers if you want to print out the robot
shell yourself so let say you have a 3d
printer at home you just need the boards
like the the circuit boards and stuff
that you can get them for cheaper but
the fully like the assembly kit where
you get the robot all the 3d printed
parts everything to put it together is
six starts at $6.99 so bad so if you a
3d printer if you know someone who dies
you could do that yeah Tom I'm coming
your house and using your 3d printer
yeah yeah so what do you think back at
her away to why should I answer first
yeah I think you should answer first I
said back it I love that sort of open
source and all the potential they showed
hopefully it's actually you know you can
actually do all that but yeah I would
love to see that schools like I wish I
had a class where I got to learn sort of
like that programming aspect I mean it's
gonna come into play more and more angry
so yeah definitely back it I looks like
I don't have to so I just get to wait
for plenty to come to a home near me
yeah yeah my my recommendation on this
would be if you have the money back it
and you're into it if not wait and then
find a friend who got one find somebody
who backed it look through the comment
section and make friends with them on
the internet so that you can hang out
with plenty yeah that seems like a nice
or you can steal it from them or you
teach it to love me and no but see it's
gonna steal your heart you want to be
the person who owns its friends so you
can hang out it's all positive so we're
both back in on it I see yeah ok yeah no
this is awesome cool yeah it's one of my
favorite robots super cute yeah kind of
reminds me of like a tiny baymax yeah a
little bit ups and there's not a
squishing oh cute really blend to plan -
Oh plenty - okay guys we got to talk
about your user feedback for TV joke
last week we talked about the Chinese
guy and his son who's bill who are
building transformers in China that's
right junk transformers super super cool
and we asked you guys to use hashtag tt
junk to tell us what you would want to
build up junk if you could build
anything and you guys gave us some
pretty good answers Frank wrote and said
I always wanted to build a life-size
bender with some Boston Dynamics tech oh
my god you're gonna get in the pit man
Tech and yes Megaton I'm back baby
see my Mario impression is better than
my vendor impression but yeah that's a
great one bender questioning bender Rick
Rhoden said I want to create a life-size
Megas XLR ironically coupe finds Megas
in a junkyard nice Matt wrote in and
said TD junk I would like to see a
machine that turns scrap pieces flat and
then use those for buildings oh wow he
actually wants to use yeah I can save
the world
yep using your noodle there that's smart
uh Gail wrote in and said Simon Cowell
already took some junk and made a boy
made a boy band called 1d oh oh he'll be
here all week be sure to tip your
waitress there's one less piece there's
one less junk in one direction you know
one of them quit I saw saw the news and
then Charles wrote in and said a 200
foot tall Galactus to eat space junk no
he is planets
he eats planets you'd build him and then
he would eat earth which I guess if you
are his owner and you get too cool like
travel around but he's kind of a jerk
fare okay fine and then finally we got
an email from Rob saying dear Ashley I
thought that was a funny idea that you
came up with about making Jupiter
Earth's landfill now the only problem is
now the planet is filled with space junk
how do we get rid of the junk we burn it
or find a way to repurpose the junk okay
here's my plan we wait for asteroids big
earth-shattering asteroids to go by
Jupiter gravitational pull sucks the
asteroids in asteroid impact destroys
all space junk we start over it's a
clean slate we just keep it
self-sustaining problem solved actually
for space president you wrote them
everybody 28 28 16 thank you feeling
pretty good about it I thought about it
a lot today
and then it came to me but yeah the
answer was right in from my face the
whole time that's right there Jupiter is
the answer they will solve their own
Jupiter can solve its own problems okay
cool yeah great so uh all right guys it
is time for our very last piece to user
feedback which is always our photogra
for the day alright so this comes from
Mars own lot of fun Marton nice
pronounciation thank you muchas gracias
he writes in and he says dear TD I am
Martin from Hungary and I have taken
this photo of the main building of the
University of Debrecen in Hungary with a
samsung galaxy trend plus I've never
heard of this yeah I've never heard of
it either but it's a nice picture the
structure which is much more tremendous
than it looks in the picture was built
more than 80 years ago the fountains in
front of it will be turned on soon
anyway I'm learning English and I tea
here and I absolutely love this
university I like your show very much
best wishes Martin what a nice picture
I've never heard of that phone before
but it looks like it takes like amazing
photos better than my phone my phone I'm
dying to know what the what the fountain
looks like like when it's turned on
Martin's got his work cut out for him
he's got sent us some more photos what
fountain there's so much space here for
a photo shop I mean what could we add to
this picture I mean it's pretty good but
I feel like somebody getting some book
learnin done feels like maybe maybe like
a Bruce Banner reading a book in front
of the Bruce Banner
Mark Ruffalo Bruce Banner I want George
Clooney playing basketball oh good I
like it you can find those pictures on
the inner line Oh play basketball I want
him playing basketball at this
University I wish we know what Marth on
look like we could put him playing
against Marth on Martin put if you have
a picture just Photoshop yourself
playing basketball against George
Clooney and send that in yeah this is
getting weird but yeah it's getting
super specific but I I dig it all right
um so that is that is Martin's picture
and like I said at the samsung galaxy
trend plus very introverted that phone
before so pretty cool if you guys want
to send in your phone tog Rafi send us
your picture a little bit about it and
what device you took the picture with
and you can email it to tomorrow at
cnet.com we'll also take other stuff old
family recipes tips tricks story ideas
no April Fool's story ideas I will not
accept them I'll yell at you over email
but if you absolutely hate
you want to use social media you can do
that too snapchat tumblr twitter
facebook instagram for tomorrow daily on
all those things and tomorrow daily to
be over a moveable us have your YouTube
watcher and you're watching this on
youtube don't forget to subscribe leave
