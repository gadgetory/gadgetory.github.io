taking a first look at the sixth
generation Apple iPod Nano comes in
seven colors and two capacities an 8
gigabyte model for $149 and a 16 gig
version for 179 compared to the previous
model they've chopped off the click
wheel shrunk the screen and oddly
they've ditched the video camera that
they made such a big deal about last
year they've also put a clip on the back
similar to the iPod shuffle and on the
top er buttons for volume and a screen
lock now to make up for the missing
click wheel Apple is using a tiny
touchscreen that measures about one inch
square you get little icons similar to
the iPhone that control music playback
photos radio a pedometer and even a
clock the screen lets you browse your
music collection by flicking up and down
and you can also back out of menus by
flicking back you can even reorient the
screen by pinching two fingers together
and twisting it around it's fun to play
around with such a unique in small
touchscreen but I got to say for all its
novelty the new interface isn't much
better than the click wheel in any
practical way if anything is more
difficult to operate by feel which is
kind of important if you're actually
using this while driving or exercising
I'll hand it to Apple though for finding
a way to make the smallest Nano yet but
I also have a hard time believing that
anyone really thought the last version
of the Nano was too big plus at half the
size you're also getting half the
features there's no video playback no
camcorder games calendar notes contacts
or alarm clock that said I have to admit
the features you do get are fairly
incredible for such a small size the
main focus here is music and you should
get around 24 hours of music playback
from a single charge you get icons for
your music library playlists genius
mixes as well as shortcuts for artists
album songs genres composers audiobooks
and podcasts you can customize the
arrangement by pressing and holding any
icon and shifting it around there's also
a shake to shuffle feature that you can
turn on or off in the settings menu that
can play a random selection of songs
when you give the player a shake beyond
that you also get a built-in radio which
has the unique ability of pausing live
broadcasts for up to 15 minutes
you can also rewind anything you hear on
the radio which is pretty cool photos on
such a small screen are really just for
fun and you can't set your own image as
a wallpaper under settings though you
can go back and swap out the wallpaper
for one of Apple's own designs there's a
fitness app that includes a pedometer
and there's also support for the Nike
Plus fitness system but you'll need to
plug in the Nike receiver into the
30-pin dock connection or to make that
work another hidden feature is voice
memos which you'll only see if you plug
in a compatible headset with a
microphone the same goes for Apple's
voiceover feature which will announce
track information for you if you have a
pair of headphones with a compatible
remote control the headphone is bundled
with the Nano or just your plain old
Apple earbuds which we strongly
recommend upgrading from for the sake of
sound quality but also for the sake of
extra features a remote also gives you
the ability to skip and pause songs
without looking at the screen which is
really useful if you're using this for
exercising last but not least there's
the clock it's an analog clock face and
we have to believe that manufacturers
are going to find some creative way to
turn this thing into a watch by flicking
on the screen you also get access to a
stopwatch and a timer so that's the
sixth generation Apple iPod Nano the
smallest Nano yet but definitely a step
backwards in terms of iPod features if
you're not sold on the small size the
cool little touch screen or the
unmistakable Apple design you can
stretch your dollar a lot further with
an older model or going with an iPod
