around here in the short time i've been
doing top 5 i've managed alienate
android fans gamers windows users Apple
fanboys and of course the extremely
vocal Brian Cooley fan club but with
Thanksgiving in the air I think I'll
take this opportunity to spread some
love some geek gratitude Donnell Bell
and in this episode of top 5 i'm
counting down the technology we should
all be thankful for the unsung heroes
that we all take for granted starting
off at number 5 4g LTE i think we can
finally say that true 4G wireless is
available in the united states we've
been clawing our way towards this
benchmark for years trying to convince
ourselves that 3g isn't so bad
desperately waiting for instagram photos
to upload no more pretty soon we'll be
talking about 3g the way we talk about
dial up at number 4 good cheap tablets
emphasis on the good right now we have
no fewer than four great 7-inch tablets
priced at one hundred ninety nine
dollars or less a year ago we had one
now it's the norm an entire generation
of kids have been permanently scarred by
the angry birds theme song ah number
three connected TVs you've got apps
built into a new TV or you're working
with a Roku or xbox or Apple TV it's
never been easier to get your favorite
web content on the big screen now I'm
not just talking about Netflix we're
talking about itunes amazon Hulu YouTube
and Google Play the cable companies are
finally facing some competition and
you're getting to watch more cool stuff
at number two cell phone cameras ever
since the iphone 4s hung its had on
camera quality every smartphone
competitor is raised their bar unless
you're serious snob about your pictures
the point and shoot is dead you've got
one less thing to carry around throwing
the 4g LTE from the top of this list and
now you can / share your thanksgiving
family photos at breakneck speed now
before we get to the number one tech we
should all be thankful for I can't help
it I just have to complain about
something if there is one technology I
could just kick in the shins I would
hand out honor to inkjet printers
ah how is it that these things still
require a billion different drivers and
eat up ink cartridges and more than
twenty dollars a pop it's like I'm
feeding money into some manic-depressive
robot that lives in my home I swear I
can I could hear laughing at me when I'm
sleeping all right to make up for it
here's my number one tech we should all
be thankful for search marty mcfly
showed up from 1985 he wouldn't find
hoverboards or flying cards but I still
think we could blow his mind with a
basic Google search we really really
take this for granted but when you think
about siri google now yelp wikipedia and
all the information that's instantly at
our fingertips anywhere in the world
it's humbling so there you have it five
technologies that i am thankful for and
make me proud to be a nerd more top 5s
