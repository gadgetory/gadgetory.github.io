sell for software developers especially
for operating systems unless they can
noticeably increase performance of
stability that makes High Sierra a bit
of a hard sell for Apple since there's
very little going on here to obviously
change your experience there's a lot
going on to lay the groundwork for
future enhancements and some tweaks to
applications such as photos in Safari
plus you might see better speed and
stability from Apple file system if you
have an SSD Safari 11 improves your
browsing experience thanks to blocking
autoplay videos with sound by default
you can install that separately from the
operating system though photos is a
streamlined interface with more ways to
filter your content an apple basically
overhauled the editor it's now much
easier to get to the advanced tools and
you can turn adjustments on or off with
a click to experiment you can also edit
live photos to add looping bounce and
long exposure photos also has a new
interface for developers to write
extensions to and out of the gate there
are a handful of integrations with
printing services for instance you can
create photo books from places like
Shutterfly the integration makes them
nicer to use than going to the website
separately but it's pretty much the
standard creation experience with high
sierra apple expands iCloud's role is
the hub of your Apple world the family
plan is better tools for managing and
allocating storage and of course makes
it dead easy to pay for more Apple also
rolls out its iCloud file sharing for
working on documents collaboratively
sharing links instead of files syncing
shared files and controlling shared
access there are also a handful of touch
bar enhancements such as flicking to
change brightness and volume and an
increased number of choices and controls
for the system color picker so as you
can see there's not a lot here to get
excited about but eventually there
probably will be
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
