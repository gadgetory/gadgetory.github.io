here with interactive voices IV sleep so
IV sleek's design is unassuming but it
is actually a Wi-Fi enabled
voice-activated smart home device it
looks like an alarm clock but it can
actually do a whole lot more so using
voice commands and questions that are
pre-programmed into IV sleek you can
start with the phrase hello IV and ask
it a question like what time is it
31 p.m. so while this worked pretty well
overall there were some really
infuriating glitches that made it kind
of a pain to use you're supposed to be
able to ask it basic things you can set
the time and temperature the weather and
the day you can set an alarm
you can set sleep sounds to help you
fall asleep at night and you can also
pair it to third-party devices like the
Nest Learning Thermostat and Belkin Wemo
products so it has a whole bunch of
different features but when it comes
down to it the voice activation just
isn't quite there especially when you're
asking it something simple directly from
the command sheet like what time is it
in Berlin it is now 1:30 7 p.m. in
Burleson I think voice control in
general is just not quite there yet if
you're patient this might be okay but on
the other hand it's $200 it's an awful
lot to spend for something that's so
glitchy I really don't think the voice
control technology is there yet to
justify the purchase
I guess the beauty of this product is
that it's hands-free its app free which
makes it unique but a little gimmicky
for seen at a Megan Wharton
