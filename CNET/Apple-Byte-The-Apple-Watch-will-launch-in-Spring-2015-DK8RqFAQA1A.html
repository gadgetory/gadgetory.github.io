welcome to the apple pie for everything
and I mean everything good and bad
inside the world of Apple and yes last
week's episode was running at 60 frames
per second on YouTube and I looked good
all right let's get to the show in the
latest report from reputable French
website I Jen claims the pricing for the
iWatch could balloon as high as five
thousand dollars now we already know the
entry-level apple watch will start at
three hundred and fifty dollars IGN
reports the stainless steel model will
start at five hundred bucks while the
gold Apple watch price point could start
between 4000 to five thousand dollars is
the ultimate bling bling Apple fashion
statement that still needs to be
connected to your phone and will only
last about a day now other than people
that poop out money is anyone else going
to drop that kind of cheddar for a first
gen watch now it makes sense for Apple
to make a high-priced relatively
unattainable watch if they're really
trying to target high fashion why not
but friends don't let friends buy a
five-thousand-dollar first gen apple
watch unless they're getting it for you
and what about that rumor of launched
target in February of next year or early
2015 from Apple a report from nine to
five max says Apple Retail senior VP
Angela Ahrendts told retail employees in
a video message that they'll need to
conserve their energy going into the
holiday season then chinese new years
and then we've got a new watch launch
coming in spring now I check the
calendar and the first day of spring in
2015 is all marks the 20th that's
nowhere near februari and you know it's
going to be releasing the way after that
so I'm sorry if I just let you down but
here's a hug for you from me oh it's
warm huh alright a new report from
Chinese economic daily news newspaper
says Apple is working on a 3d phone
display that doesn't require the use of
special glasses and they're actively
developing 3d software ecosystems the
report claims Apple's iPhones will be
moving from the current ncell display
technology that won't be compatible with
the 3d tech to new displays supplied by
tpk now this is really a stretch
even if Apple has filed patents as far
back as 2012 showing off 3d iOS
interfaces with motion gesture
capability we also saw how adding that
feature worked out for the Amazon fire
phone and honestly have you even seen
anyone using a fire phone that doesn't
work for Amazon anyone still waiting
yeah that's what I thought all right a
new report from new field Wireless finds
that US carriers have experienced a huge
surge in voice over LTE use with the
iphone 6 and 6 plus if your carrier has
flipped on that switch with 3g voice
calling dropping by 150 normal amount
now AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon followed that up
with an announcement that they will work
together to allow their customers to
make voice over LTE calls to each other
across the networks in 2015 really a
rare instance where carriers appear to
be working together for the consumer and
in more new Starwood Hotels has
officially launched its SPG kila service
allowing guests to use their iPhones and
future Apple watches to unlock their
hotel room doors now I always get to the
room just like this
but we know most people really get to
the rooms and need keyless entry like
this
alright if you haven't been following
the activity around the next Steve Jobs
biopic the latest is that Christian Bale
is bailing on the Steve Jobs job and
that was the best headline ever now Bale
withdrew his name from the project with
a little curious timing after news
leaked that Seth Rogen may be slotted to
play was reports now say producers are
now in talks with Michael Fassbender to
take on the job of jobs so magneto and
the Green Hornet for the first time
together on the big screen and if any of
you were watching television recently
you know it was election day here in the
US cNN has a regular coverage flanked
with their team of experts and this time
flanked with microsoft surface Pro's for
product placement the problem they
weren't being used to cover the event
they were being used as stands for the
commentators who are using iPads whoops
yeah maybe Microsoft should add that
somewhere into the recent apple bashing
ad campaigns all right that's going to
do for this we show email me at the
apple byte at cnet com or tweet me a
brian Tong and i'll respond after i
finish detailing my crocs thanks so much
for watching and we'll catch you all
next time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
