of the 404 show on this Tuesday December
16th my name is Jeff Bakalar joined
obviously by I as Akhtar and Arielle
Nunez and a control room from last video
appearance I thought it would be most
fitting to have the lovely Shannon cook
on the program how are you Shannon and
for me to be very shiny how about that
I'm glad you took advantage of your last
video opportunity on the 404 I thought
we're going out with some dazzling it's
really like a shimmering effect you
could sit me on top of a Christmas tree
alright please don't do at the end of
the show yeah really you say it seems
uncomfortable it does sound a little
uncomfortable that's quite all right
so how have you been I've been great
thank you yeah fantastic family doing
well everything's doing great kids are
great husbands great great everyone's
great and how about you mr. family man
you know I'm feeling it like you know I
was talking before I don't think I'm
really gonna start freaking out to like
February right that's all let me hang
out for like two more months there's no
need to freak out it's all gonna be
great
yeah sure it's it's quite the miracle
don't scare me because you freaked out
no leave you can't change your nose you
know it's one of those things that once
you stop going down that road there is
no turning back right especially at this
point like where to where dupont
committed here to turn back you were
talking before like about lying like
when the kids lie to you a lot when
they're like 3-4 right they my sister
lying just started lying or a half when
can I start to talk to him like I talked
to other people pretty much straight
away very highly recommend you didn't do
the baby talk thing that like seems like
every mom does it go hi it's so cute
it's like I didn't do that you know I
didn't do that I just spoke like me and
I think it served as well you think so
yeah she's four and she's ready to enter
college
no I I mean I I each to their own when
you have a little baby you can't help
sometimes kind of time sure but but when
they start conversing themselves and I I
drop the baby talk straight away yeah
you're like get it together
Yeah right you know stop drooling and
let's get down to business
like what are that wha mean just tell me
right tell me what that means your words
you're six and a half months old all
right fYI they don't speak at six months
old oh that's right they talk when
they're 15 babble a lot they but when do
they start talking it's amazing how
quickly is it what oh no they walk when
they're one yes God there was they can
put them down and take a break because
once they start moving around on their
own you're like where did it go right
where did it go I'm just gonna attach a
key where did he go where did she go
yeah helium did you like this monster
for a while it doesn't smile for a
couple of months he just kind of looks
at you and you're like I just you back
you know what am i anticipating for the
first like you know first day till like
six months it's just like me being like
yeah like this glob of bones and meat do
you know you are gonna be so in love
with that little blob yeah that little
sack of uselessness yeah and you know in
love with it alright I think the jury's
still out on that one it's like it's I
always thought a bit like oh it's very
powerful I'm sure when it comes out and
it's all disgusting and we're gonna be
like this life meter that you get like a
video game but like when this kid shows
up it grows and you're like I didn't
know I could care yeah about something
until then myself yeah keep hearing that
I'm a pretty selfish dude tiny bit
nothing to feel worried for this no it's
it's all gonna be lovely space that's
justice most of that is joking I know
most of it we hope 10% of it I did for
you I think it's gonna be fantastic I
really push to me a little little baby
boy it'll definitely happen and thank
you very much and your book really
helped my wife I want to
on the air so thank you um so thank you
for doing you can read it too it might
help you I might I got a couple like
dude you're gonna be dead bro bye like
books you know Jeff Spicoli but we'll
see how that works before we wrap up the
year that was 2014 in music I want to
show everyone this ridiculous video that
I just came across this morning it's
called headus it's a German sport that
combines ping pong with soccer oh my god
so if you're not watching the video
which you won't be forever
starting tomorrow these guys are heading
the ball like like a ping pong ball and
they're using a small soccer ball on the
thing can you maximize that is gonna
give you a Z so yeah this is insane it's
a German sport where men and women
compete and they just use their heads to
knock a small soccer ball across a ping
pong case so it is a suckable it's not a
lightweight and she's really really
amazing these people are amazing and
they like seem it's the same
ferociousness as you get in a ping pong
game like that same speed and they're
jumping belly-first on to the table to
like slam it which is crazy how many
brain cells are they killing off do you
think I don't know but like look at
these guys are no you just like frog
dives onto the anything whiplashed and
necks gonna hear like yeah like I want
to see like the first permanent
paralysis like like whoo someone's done
that before there's a lot of edges to a
ping-pong table this is a game that
you'd see between seals not not human
yeah these guys are putting backspin and
topspin on it anyway I can safely say I
will never play that no ping pongs great
never soccers great maybe they don't I
will never play that ok ever ever ever
never all right I agree and I want to
hear if anyone to SHINee for that sport
shiny made it currently in your current
wardrobe now everything is shiny now
second you give birth everything shiny
happy person from here on out doesn't
matter if you've only slept for two
hours you're shiny now you're fun yeah
first-first five six months cabbage all
right who sleeps for the dead anyway
all right exactly let's wrap up the year
in music yeah
Spotify had a very obviously massive
year we did we can you two make
ridiculous amounts of money with
subscriptions and stuff like that right
absolutely and we we strained 7 billion
hours of music in 2014
which is a lot you say that number and
you can it doesn't it doesn't even do it
justice because you can't wrap your head
around how I tried when I was in the
shower I tried doing some mathematical
equations and I was trying to break it
down like how many songs is that I was
just getting silly right it's it's a
massive massive number a massive massive
amount of streaming massive massive
amount of listening and I think a list
creation was also really impressive more
than seven hundred and thirty million
playlists were created by all that
listeners I'm learning I'm learning that
I think that for Spotify I think
playlists were very big year because
this was the first year where you know
not that I noticed they were a thing I
kind of realized that early on but the
fact that people something changed maybe
in the software where was that much more
accessible and people sort of got it and
I think that clicked in 2014 I think
also what we saw this year was a sort of
trend emerging where instead of
gravitating towards say one playlist one
day on a given day or listening to say
one or two different albums on a day
particular date we're finding that
people are matching music to various
moments right the day so they have a
playlist for their morning commute they
have a playlist for their workout sure
before work they have a playlist for
some focus time
maybe some classical music when they're
at work and it's my shower playlist and
when it's like sing along - yeah really
I like to sing in the shower so like I'm
gonna make sure that the songs they know
the lyrics to because I also use the app
I think it's music match or something I
could see the lyrics before and go you
know the lyrics sing in the shower we
allowed my neighbors don't so you
rehearse the songs before you oh yeah my
cubicle I'm not constantly singing I
don't I don't sit near you but I could
I've heard loud opera tales of your of
your karaoke have troubles we do have a
lot of singing what playlist on Spotify
songs to sing in the shower and what we
find is they're usually guilty guilty
pleasure songs so what I want to know is
when you and maybe you don't know the
answer to this I wouldn't blame you if
you did go on to like this the playlists
or whatever it is there's like moods you
know when you open up Spotify there's
like a billion moods like you know chill
mode and party mode who curates that we
have a team of curators and Spotify
who-who work day and night right on
those playlist think I could get a gig
doing that it sounds like a fun gig
don't know like I was like the punk rock
one I'll send some emails you scroll all
the way down like Wade has everything
there's like metal and punk rock
and let me get that but we did we did
find this year that the this I mean
users love creating their own playlists
for sure you know and that's the
personal nature of music these days you
want to feel like your own DJ but we did
find that all the Spotify curated
playlists we're really really popular
like the most popular in each sort of
broken down genre like work out
playlists we have some work out
playlists for cardio for running that
are very specific and that that's
streamed really really in high numbers
right yeah it's pretty cool it would be
a good job that way I think so right I
feel like you wouldn't get away with
just doing that though like you'd also
have the link
like they would just be like alright you
do the pop and now you got the three
hours of Nickelback duty oh that poor
soul must get triple overtime pay do you
know what I just learnt recently though
somebody asked me how many playlists you
can actually create like is there a
limit and I wasn't sure so I checked
with with some some people at work and
and sure enough you can make as many
playlist as you like there's absolutely
no limit however there is a song limit
per playlist
oh really yeah do you know do you want
to know what the song limit is I do now
that you've teased it like that fifty
thousand songs you cannot have more than
fifty thousand so that's why is he so
limited I'm so disappointed in my
billion just for the year
well summons some people make their
playlists very very long I'm a fan of
like 20 songs okay which is about an
hour and a half an hour and a half of
listening and that's that's a good
amount of time for me but some people go
for like five hours 12 hours sure and I
just feel like you probably never get to
the bottom half you're probably really
because when you go back to real isint
to a playlist you usually start from the
beginning so probably playing the first
10 songs a lot not really getting to the
bottom 400 are you guys like shuffle
people like me no I'm not a shuffling
that tells a lot about something oh
really well what does that tell you
about I know I don't know but my wife is
the same way so in my car maybe that I'm
a control freak I mean that's probably
like 70% of it where is your more go
with the flow maybe but you're a shuffle
guy see in my car I have a little USB
stick or or well as in a Spotify and I
have a little USB with
32 gigs of music on it I pop it in and I
just go random right like I want to hear
that a couple thousand songs right and
she like freaks out she's like what are
you doing with that order there's chaos
we need to listen to you know maybe it's
a sex sex thing small sample size I
wonder I wonder if there is something to
that women prefer to not shuffle guys
prefer to like a bit of spontaneity sure
with their experience it's you know
maybe it's just that I'm such a badass
living on the edge that must be it could
be absolutely right before we get into
the most streamed artists of the year
you have a list I did want to talk about
a bit of controversy that hit Spotify
this year in the vein of Taylor Swift
right so number one who is she and
number two he's a rather popular see I
don't
maybe I'm just I don't want to save the
O word like I'm getting old but I just
don't really understand who she is
okay so a who is she
she's a very very popular musician right
he's had a really amazing year right she
started out in Nashville mm-hmm
writing she writes her songs she the
girl that Kanye West like yes yeah was
it to belittle that what was it MTV yeah
that's right not cool Obama called him a
jerk or something yeah it was yeah yeah
because that been America's Sweetheart
right for a while all right and she's
like the the New York ambassador for for
nothing right somewhere else with this
and she's like famous for like breaking
up with lots of guys nope
well not where I was going to famous for
that too learning maybe Oreo can shine
some light on yeah yeah she's she's
ambassador and coined the terms like
bodega and she coined not coined it but
you know she was defining it for yeah
it's it's stupid she she started out in
country she was cut she was kind of a
country pop crossover and then the album
she released this year called
1989 is that her birth year when she was
born
that um that was her first straight-up
pop album okay she's kind of abandoned
the whole country element and she's just
going all out I wonder why she did that
why'd she turn her back on country I
don't know but as you know she also
turned her back on Spotify which I
assume is why we're not talking about
Taylor Swift and yeah she did in fact um
remove all her music from from Spotify
which which was really disappointing and
um we love her we love her music and a
lot of our listeners loved her too so it
was very disappointing for them they
woke up one Monday morning and all their
Taylor Swift songs were yet vanished
from their playlists um so we hope that
we're hopeful that one day she'll come
back and she'll embrace streaming music
it's interesting just how like and it's
not just her there's other artists that
have done this mm-hmm where I think it's
just a lot of like uncharted territory
and people don't exactly know what the
right thing to do is even if whether or
not there is a right thing to do well
the I mean the music business is always
evolving when you think about it it's
been in a state of transition pretty
much since it came to be and and we
understand that when something's
changing dramatically and and the music
business has changed particularly
dramatically over the last few years
totally there are going to be people who
are resistant we're the new new cool
thing which at the moment we believe is
streaming totally but you know for every
artist who is perhaps a little resistant
there are a hundred who have embraced it
and we love it and we have a lot of
artists who actually come into our New
York headquarters and they perform for
us they they're thrilled to be on
Spotify and emerging artists are
particularly into it because they see
that it's a great way to break
absolutely to get it out there yeah like
last year Lord who sound like a broken
record I mean I personally did not but
all definitely helped I didn't know
about her
then you came on the show and well it
was all really spotify listeners there
were very early adopters of her song
Royals and shared it a lot amongst their
friends and so we started paying
attention and bubbled up that way
another example of an artist who had
enjoyed that kind of a year was hodja
hodja hodja or ho za he's he seems to
have a few different ways of pronouncing
his name depending on the country of the
person you're talking to but he this
time last year I was sitting here
although the desk was on the other side
of this whole room yes I said here and I
was talking about this guy he's an Irish
singer with a massive booming voice
which kind of fills every corner of the
room when he sings and I was talking
about him as someone that we had our
eyes on and we felt like he was going to
be a big deal in 2014 and lo and behold
our listeners started sharing his his
lead single like gangbusters and this
week it took nearly a whole year but
this week he is the most streamed artist
in the world on Spotify so you're
welcome a lot to give thanks - okay
let's get to specifics of the most
streamed people this year the end a year
sort of stuck let's get into it well
first of all the most streamed track of
the year this is where I get upset but
you will get upset you're already upset
I can tell I'm not gonna make you happy
this song is happy just like Pharrell
like I like him I don't like his hat but
I like that oh yeah yeah it's ridiculous
because every pop star they dress
normally but like everything the rows
got like great styling everything REO I
mean I need like a second opinion on the
Hat yeah I dig that you anything that's
pushing my boundaries I'm weighted man
what but it's a cowboy hat it's not
really liking her
the thing that the guide was yogi bear
would win it's like if Lord showed up
the next concert wearing an eyepatch
right it seems glove it look like your
shirt and it worked no but he was the
King of Pop okay you don't mess with
Michael Jackson okay so real is pretty
important for sure he's behind pretty
much every major pop zone but this song
okay I think this song's popularity
didn't have anything to do with the Hat
no no I'm just if you if you'll cast
your minds back to the very beginning of
the year which is so hard to do isn't it
as we're especially happy was
inescapable for the first three to four
months of the year it was just
absolutely surreal and it spawned all
those music videos
copycat video put that song up with the
frozen song though where it's just like
oh my god
stick needles in my ears I cannot listen
to this goddamn song anymore well you're
lucky you're having a boy it just
because you would that song would be
very much in your but that song just
felt very like it's it's a catchy song
but it's not for us it's it felt like it
was a kids song I would pull up to a
traffic light and like look across and
there's like some tough dude like some
rough dude and he's listening happy
Despicable Me 2 that's where I heard the
first time that's pretty catchy song and
then it blew up and I was like oh oh
yeah you you knew it back well yeah I
did way back because my sounds like
let's watch this with the minions and oh
cool and the song got bigger it's a song
that resonated with so many people from
kids from toddlers like your your your
kid my kid parents loved it older people
loved it it everybody liked I know it
was the greatest thing it was so
uplifting and positive Wonder Bread of
pop music we're gonna move on now
real quick well you know what upset me
about that song but not up how popular
it got not how catchy or like your were
me that song it was that you weren't
invited to dance on the video no not at
all because I would have gladly declined
but listen my whole thing was like even
after all that popularity it like and
after you thought it was over you're
like okay finally we can get back to
business
it shows up in like 35 commercials in a
row you get away with that quick I'm
sorry anyway
what's next Katy Perry was the world's
most dreamed female different and she um
she is catchy she unseated Rihanna she's
out all right she doesn't write her own
stuff does she writing going on just
saying but I think what's been key to
her success on Spotify particularly is
um she had two big songs yeah one of
them was Dark Horse and Dark Horse was
massive on Spotify and I think because
it has a dance beat anything you can
dance to right tends to do well these
days doesn't matter if you're a rap
artist doesn't matter if you're a rock
artist or a pop artist throw in a bit of
an electronic dance music beat with the
chorus and every dorm in America will be
playing your song shimmying inertia look
you've almost completely missed out my
little shimmy all right let's move on
there cuz I know you're not a huge Katy
Perry fan Coldplay go on haha Coldplay
was our most streamed band or a group of
2014 they had a they released their
sixth album a sky full of stars was
their big song and again that song had a
really strong dance beat through the
chorus which it's a great song as it go
dananana dananana is that the one I'm
not gonna sing it is that the one that
sounds like the u2 song well that's what
he sounds like he's always like haha
okay yeah
good that was that was impressive clocks
is the only song I think they made that
was okay box is pretty already bangin
I liked yellow yellow had that one go
that one was like what they wrong yellow
Chris man Chris man has been quoted as
suggesting that Coldplay are going to
retire that there they're making their
current there currently no play they're
currently working on their next album
and there were they've been a couple of
reports that it may be their last I
don't believe it
awesome well we'll just have to and I'll
just have to wait if they have many
sleepless nights
Eminem the most streamed artist in the
u.s. really yeah of anybody yep Eminem
Eminem in the u.s. I find that
surprising I think do you yeah I find it
surprising for one reason you know a
core demographic I guess you could say
on Spotify is very young right you're
talking about sort of 25 under 25 yeah
and here's a dude who's been making
music for almost 20 years now he's in
his forties I think he's about 41 I tell
and he is even though a lot of these our
listeners and Spotify didn't grow up
with him you can tell well no you know
him a little bit he's no worse for the
wear like Marshall Mathers LP is a great
record man that's that's like it brings
me back to high school
can't believe us 20 years now it's
almost when doing this right yeah for
sure some amazing record yeah yeah yeah
what was he had that one song about
mushrooms yeah a bunch of songs I was
just really good stuff well what's
interesting what's interesting too about
the fact that he's a most streamed
artist this year is he didn't actually
have an album come out this year oh wow
that's why his album came out at the end
of last year but he had some big songs
he had monster which features Rihanna
mm-hm
everyone loves Rihanna yeah this huge
back catalogue to go back a little bit
yeah well I mean lyrically it he's like
an acrobat totally he's a lyrical
acrobat you listen to to what he does
and it blows your mind right you can
forget about it you
sort of forget about him if he hasn't
been in the news or he hasn't released
it's been a while since he's released
something but then you go back and you
listen and you're like how the hell does
he do that it's amazing it's really
impressive does it make sense how fast
these beings know yeah it's pretty okay
do you want to know the most popular
most streamed song in the US it's not an
Eminem song I thought it was happy no
that was in the world Oh
planet Earth Katy Perry song no it's no
one we've mentioned yet it's a fancy
song Iggy Azalea
yeah sweet hint Shannon because I'm like
what is it because I don't remember what
should i my hint have been I don't know
I really don't know she comes from a
place where we all talk like this yeah
that would've been I would have been
better you could is that how you really
talk because I think that's awesome I
know we're always fixated on your accent
it comes back it comes back if I'm
surrounded by Aussies I bet if you have
a couple drinks it comes out more no no
really no all right well that's for next
show when on video having fun when did
that that song came out at the end of
the spring and it blew up over the
summer it was it was one of the songs of
the summer we really didn't have a
standout song of the summer this year
look people are waving to us we didn't
have a song of the summer was we dead
this that every every impersonation he
does sound like Kermit the Frog yeah yes
Calvin Harris had the most streamed song
of the summer which was the song called
summer however when you really look at
what song you heard songs you heard when
you went shopping at all just mushes
into the same kind of guard to me there
wasn't really a standout yeah but Iggy
azalea's song was definitely I like ho
definitely up there might be I don't
love the song but I like how it starts
it starts as if there's like something
funny just happen you know like like oh
you dropped the glasses like boom boom
boom and you're it's almost like
interlude to Seinfeld
you know you're just like up here we go
people love it and I think I think one
of the things that really drove this
song though was the hook which yeah
interestingly enough isn't actually sung
by Iggy it's sung by the UK performer
Charli XCX she sings it and she sounds a
little bit like she does she's pretty
rough she's cool well so here's some
boom clap she was on Saturday Night Live
yeah and I present to watch that wasn't
why I liked her mm-hmm
I didn't mute it I I thought it was a
band and I was diggin the band right and
the all-female band I was really digging
but you're saying she's a solo yeah
she's also written it's kind of like
she's got like a little like poppy kind
of Punk thing going on yeah no she's
she's tough which is why she's like 22
right he's very young which is why she
she she sang in a much the same way as
she sort of guessed it on Iggy song
fancy she's saying on Icona pop song I
don't care I don't
wait you don't boom clap I really like
and for some reason and this is really
dorky and embarrassing for a while I
kept saying boom clap at the end of
everything
Oh like I hold it like Danny would say
Daniel would say Oh sky just said her
first word and I'd go boom clap right so
ridiculous it certainly sounds like it
what I'm joking very nice today cranky
no no I'm totally getting excited can't
you feel I'm acting excited about the
happy song okay so okay this is really
really a reach V alright let's talk
about kind of blown away that the
Charlie sang the fancy chorus hook right
no it was he does all the rapping I'm
yet to hear it really sing actually um
but let's talk about the most streamed
artist in the world on 2014 because we
haven't even gotten to him yet ed
Sheeran
no idea
oh that's the the the redhead kid yeah
with the tattoos yes a guy from the
Victoria Secrets thing he's very do feel
like he's would remember Dashboard
Confessional
yes like Chris Carrabba I feel like he's
what Chris Carrabba wanted to ultimately
be well he's pretty much nailing it he's
essentially like a redhead emo kind of
dude
acoustic right most of his stuff so he's
he's a really impressive performer in if
you ask me in that he is a soloist in
the true sense of soloist he he gets up
on a stage and he can fill an arena yeah
and he loses stuff right yeah and it's
just him and his guitar there's no
backup band there's no one else and if
you really think about it that's hard
that's total to command that audience
and to have every single eyeball looking
straight at you right you know even
there's what you can't go over to the
drummer and be like Annie
yeah it's all him in 40,000 people for a
whole show what's the man and he and he
his performances are just he just gives
it he's absolute all and every song is
is beautiful and rich and I I don't know
why I'm impressed I'm really thrilled
that he had a good year
I wouldn't necessarily see his stuff out
it's not my cup of tea really but I
totally respect what he's doing more so
for the fact that he does this amazing
like looping yeah yeah where he'll play
basically stand how musicians do that it
yeah I mean like Reggie Watts does it a
lot too we're like you just take you
know you basically record stuff and then
play it back ah really knows most about
that stuff then we do but it's amazing
have you ever seen this Ed Sheeran guy
do that's not haven't yeah it's pretty
impressive
and we actually predicted that this up
he released an album earlier this year I
think it was in August actually and it
was called multiply hmm and we predicted
this would be the album that brought him
a wider audience and and it really did
it resonated on both sides of the
Atlantic and he had a hit song a sort of
an unexpected surprise hit song I guess
he could say a couple of years ago
called the a-team was an acoustic
sounding song and it did surprisingly
well in the charts and I think he
thought well I know he thought because
he has said that he thought right that
okay we'll leave if I could do that well
in the US with sort of that song let's
really blow the doors off this thing and
see what we can do and he actually for
the lead single on this new album he
brought in Pharrell who was wearing the
Hat sorry to say he's always wearing
that hat and he he had a song that's a
little bit more playful than than we
were used to with with him he's kind of
always been a bit sensitive
yeah wears his heart on his sleeve the
ladies really like him even result he's
just like an emo evolution night when
you say emo though I think of sort of
thrashing me well
bit more thrashing I wouldn't it's
different like when I grew up emo was
like it was definitely hard rock but it
was like basically dudes crying about
their girl
and that's definitely engineering yeah I
mean that's really like the cure would
have been labeled email yeah you know or
the Smiths Morrissey oh that all would
have been email if there was such a
thing
well I urge you to check him out and
last week was interesting you mentioned
that was it last week that the
Victoria's Secret fashion thing was at
the week before the police ago in London
you know you've really made it when
you're invited to perform oh yeah and
edge ed Sheeran was there performing
doing his thing with his guitar and so
was hozier the Irish singer who I told
you about a year ago but you didn't
believe me would um would make it you
accompany me under the bus we're like
whatever Shannon nothing right but you
were right and we were wrong once again
so weird where's is he British sure and
Ed Sheeran's from the UK yep he's 23 god
they're so young yeah and a lot of
actually this year we saw a lot of
success from UK artists right a lot of
them crossing the pond and doing really
really well here and there's one artist
who I want to mention who we think is
this time next year everyone's gonna
know who he is I mean you have the data
you're probably right he's well there's
not a whole lot of data to go on by now
okay at this point but if I can can
predict we can predict the future
baseball runs who is it who's gonna be
this time it is a gentleman named James
Bay
James bed James Bay he's from the UK and
you will love him do you know why
because he doesn't he has a great song
he does have a hat and that picture he
does you see he has a great song and
guess what this song is called
uh just the man let it go no come up
with better it's possibly an unfortunate
name no one knows about it
not too late but it's a beautiful song
he's kind of uh has a really soulful
voice I did that and he won the British
I always get the name of this award on
the British Critic Choice Awards he was
given that prize and that is a very
coveted prize
and oddest who got that Olli in their
careers went on to have phenomenal
success like Adele and this time last
year Sam Smith was the recipient of that
work that award that's all
where is it Dell Adele when she go to
see me you know I haven't seen her we
haven't chatted lately sheen around the
office there are rumors that she's
actually working on an album and it was
some believe that it was going to come
out by the end of this year but it looks
like it might be next year okay we'll
see cool
great great singer you like Adele I
think I do I think he does ask yourself
this I love that voice her songs are so
cosmically sad but but amazing at the
same time what's the one what's the one
that whenever I play at my husband's
like Ted Turner it's just it's
I mean when you really listen to the
lyrics you it's hard to fill out you you
have to play Pharrell's happy
immediately after if you want too much
of a it's too silly
absolutely is there like a playlist for
you getting out your ear worms like that
there must be one right yeah there's a
playlist for everything you can search
to WA
there are playlists that people to play
through chihuahuas
have you heard about the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame inductees Green Day yeah
Green Day you read yeah great great that
Lou Reed's going in a min it's a shame
he's not it's not around and I didn't
realize Green Day was like eligible I
thought you had a like what are the
requirements though you have to have
been making music for what's the number
of years is it ten it's got to be at
least I mean I know Green Day I think
the record was nine B okay so it could
eighty nine maybe maybe it's twenty
years
yeah that's crazy maybes 25 25 years
after the release of their first fret
right
they are eligible they all now are early
40s okay well you know good for them I
mean you spell the end of knowing - not
I just I guess I'm kind of proud of them
in a weird way as you did you know given
the first big break and no because I
just yeah you know Green Day like we've
had a lot of discussions I miss them
when Justin used to be on the show he
talked a lot of about Green Day why
just you know I don't know you just
didn't like them for whatever reason and
I was just like I don't know they kind
of changed a lot of things for me when I
was a kid and just to see them like grow
up and be this popular and in the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame which I can tell
is like that if it's a big achievement
or not it wasn't the Beastie Boys didn't
the Beastie Boys get inducted was it
last year I think so yeah yeah I mean
did you feel the same way totally yeah
for sure it's it's weird red hot chili
peppers that all think - all right do
you have any more artists for us or is
that it well it's up to you do you have
any more time I think you're promoting
one more all right let me talk about one
more that's rounded all up there's a guy
I really like called bones but he's got
that funny oh with the line through it I
don't know what you call that
Osmo Oswalt oh no that's loud thank you
özil motley is what I'm thinking of
remember özil motley announce that I've
always seen that one a lot no no no the
two dots right but yeah the stripe and
Dawson why would she cool that I'm gonna
call it like it was like a zero yeah it
does but you guys got a line through
zero D what is that what what language
it's tricky marketing that's what it is
he's this young guy from Michigan
originally he's now based in LA he has a
bit of a synth pop vibe really really
cool songs which are he released an EP
about a month ago called candy and a few
of those songs are already popping with
our listeners and that they've been
shared a lot and right as we've talked
about pop we views return we views
sharing as a Shannon family a shimmer
Shan
as we've talked about surely Cher's
isn't is an indicator to us as a
potential so we've got our eyes on
Garrett borns and but James Bay James
Bay that you came from
yep so this is bright it down this time
next year James Bay borns Lord again no
shoes Lord did have a massive year she
did but she's got to follow it up now
now she's got a this is the hardest time
in her career to do it I think she's
gonna do it she's autistic enough and
she's sophisticated it's not gonna I
don't recall that I don't know yeah I
mean like Adele kind of like you know
follow that up man make it happen she
did I thought didn't bill had a
different Adele second record that like
match was great yeah yes alright maybe
inspire what give it a listen
who else had a tough time following up
with a sophomore record nice people
yeah it's toss people very tough very
tough but I have a feeling Lord might
actually she might pull through so James
Bay borns at Rory I wonder we've Arielle
thiz has heard of Rory he's an
eighteen-year-old rap artist from
Atlanta and he's interesting because he
sings and raps and he sings as well as
arrests he has a really nice singing
