the apple byte for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple now we're
just a couple weeks out from apple's
keynote after they officially confirmed
the event will take place on sep tember
9th in San Francisco with the invitation
featuring the quote hey Siri give us a
hint so if you try it on your phone all
really serious doing is taunting us and
talkin that ish hey Siri give me a hint
the only hint i can give you right now
is a hint of linemen that there's a big
announcement on sep tember 9th look deep
within yourself and you will find the
answer especially on sep tember ninth
well I hear there's something big
happening on September ninth can you get
a hint no you may however get it would
want and you know what maybe they'll
surprise us but we pretty much know what
to expect with all the iphone 6s least
we've seen including this new one for
mac rumors now it shows the display
booting to the gear icon and internal
logic board as well i gotta say those
black gloves and the shaky camerawork do
give it a more top secret feel and look
all right now let's just make sure they
get all the kinks figured out with that
especially after Apple discovered that a
limited number of iPhone 6 plus phones
sold between September 2014 to January
2015 have a defect that causes photos
taken with the rear isight camera to
come out blurry so if you thought this
whole time it was just you that had bad
eyesight it wasn't you it was actually a
bad eyesight camera that ladies and
gentlemen I'll be here all show now
Apple will replace your phone based on
its serial number if you qualify and you
can go to their support page to handle
that we also still expect the new Apple
TV and now would be a good time to do it
after data collected by research firm
parks associates found the Apple TV was
the fourth most popular streaming device
in the US and 2014 Apple didn't even get
the bronze medal y'all they trailed the
leader in the space Roku then Google's
chromecast and the Amazon fire TV
and fire TV stick so now would probably
be a good time for their new refreshed
UI app store siri based redesigned touch
control next gen apple TV i'll write a
new check the Telegraph reports that a
British company called intelligent
energy has built an iphone 6 prototype
with a built-in cell that supports
hydrogen cartridges and can deliver up
to a week's worth of battery is this too
good to be true now the patented system
will be deployed in cell towers across
India in a few weeks and it produces
electricity from the chemical reaction
between hydrogen and oxygen now small
amounts of water and heat are the result
of the reaction and the only difference
in the iphone 6 prototype our rear vents
that allow imperceptible amounts of
water vapor to escape the report says
the company is believed to be working
with apple as well and i love everything
about this story so i get this tech here
ASAP ok patently Apple has also found a
new patent application from the Bay gay
that reveals they're working on a
next-generation voice over LTE headset
that works with the iphone but even
better the renderings show it might also
bring cellular voice capabilities to the
iPad other tablets have had this before
and currently the iPad can only take
calls if it's on the same Wi-Fi network
as your phone this headset will make it
completely independent you can see the
patent image where item 220 is described
as either a cell phone smartphone PDA
tablet computer or laptop computer but
in that picture it's an iPad and finally
in the Department of not so subtle
things to do it was revealed that Swiss
watchmaker swatch filed for two
trademarks in november of last year the
trademarks one more thing popularized by
steve jobs at apple keynotes and swatch
one more thing a saying no one has ever
used in their entire life trademarking
that phrase alone deserves a bad apple
now the trademark ice watch that
swatches own for years reportedly
prevented apple from using the name
iWatch initially and the Swiss company
also holds the exclusive rights to using
liquid metal and watches from an
agreement with liquid metal technologies
in 2011
so clearly the beef is real and let's be
honest watch you're acting like a child
and speaking of children it's time to
bring back the feedback of the week and
all of you Apple biters were in rare
form after last week's episode Brian
Kendrick says Brian deserves a bad apple
for being a d for a boss hey Brian it's
okay to spell out the word dark it's not
racist more feedback nick is kind of
cute just saying I n44 yeah i'll make
sure i relay the message for you to him
I in and my favorite scene it is the
king of reuploads I know that can be
true but we have to make sure it's right
okay but nothing nothing beats this
submission from yasser king on twitter
who took our skit to the next level and
added a little WWE flavor to it
look at this amazing for realz an RKO
now that was awesome all right that's
going to do it for this week you can
always email me at the apple byte at
cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong and
i'll answer when i'm back from band camp
thanks so much for watching it will
catch you all next time for another bite
