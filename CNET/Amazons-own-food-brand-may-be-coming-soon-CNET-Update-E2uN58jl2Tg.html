online commerce giant is working on
launching its own food and grocery
product brands in the coming weeks
that's according to a report from the
wall street journal but this is not the
first we've heard of amazon launching
its own line of products there was the
Amazon elements line of baby diapers and
baby wipes but that became a messy
situation early last year the diapers
were pulled for a stinky design but that
hasn't stopped Amazon from trying again
this time along with household items
like diapers and laundry detergent
amazon is said to also be selling food
like nuts coffee baby food and vitamins
and these would be sold under names like
happy belly wickedly Prime and Mama Bear
because how could a name like mama bear
be wrong for your baby these grocery
products could be another perk to entice
you to get prime that's the
hundred-dollar yearly subscription
service a source told the journal that
only Prime members may be able to buy
these discounted Amazon branded items
amazon does already have its own line of
electronic accessories under the name of
amazon basics it sells things like hdmi
cables and batteries amazon also has its
own clothing line called lark and row
for dresses in North 11-4 scarves
meanwhile there's another amazon product
that's getting the new twist amazon dash
buttons can now do more than just order
you more toilet paper these branded
internet-connected buttons are designed
to be stuck around the home so when you
need more of something you just press
them for instant reordering and delivery
now there's a programmable button that
can trigger all sorts of demands it
doesn't have to be related to amazon
orders with one press or combo of
presses you could have a turn on the
lights have a kid press it to send you a
text message to let you know at their
home safe from school or you can even
tie it to a nap such as having a button
call a cab for you these buttons cost
twenty dollars a pop but they quickly
went out of stock that's it for this
tech news update I'm Bridget Carey you
can stay on top of the biggest stories
