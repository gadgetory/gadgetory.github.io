company wants to build a floating city
that can go underwater Mystery Science
Theater just got a whole lot easier to
watch Thank good oh yeah and Microsoft's
newest security guards are robots no
don't tase me bro bot tomorrow daily
I gotta bring back Batman thank you yes
thank you appreciate that thank you hi
everybody welcome to tomorrow daily the
best geek talk show in the known
universe I'm your host Ashley ask Emma
joning me as always kill anonymous hello
my favorite robot Oh in the universe
thanks bro chest bump just don't don't
tase me bro bot that's I want a shirt
that says that don't take me this robot
robot that's the new version of that I'm
bringing that taking it back you can
have it all right good uh what's up
let's just jump right into it see it's a
holiday weekend so we got a lot to talk
about and they don't let you go time
family yeah go hang out with your family
let's spend time with us first yes
unless then the family and listen to
these headlines so this the shimmy zoo
shimizu I'm gonna say it's shimizu
shimizu corporation in Japan is a very
interesting company this is a company
that has brought us proposals for things
like a floating botanical city and an
elevator to space and also moonbase a
Sperry specific kind of moonbase okay
okay dreamers other dreamers they're
back in the news and they propose
something equally is awesome and weird
and cool as they have done previously
they have proposed this sort of floating
water city just pretty awesome so
there's some concept art here's how it
works this right here would be actually
what's underneath the city so it's this
spiral sort of anchor that would lock
the city into the ocean floor and these
spirals would be mining the city's
energy to make it self-sustaining so get
like gases from the ocean like in
crevices and stuff very cool all right
it would technically be a
self-sustaining city it would be in a
glass dome like giant glass dome that's
where people would live 5,000 people
could live in it and in emergencies the
city could retract underwater so
basically I think they were talking
about in big storms you'd be able to
sink this giant dome into the water all
right um it's not gonna be cheap whoa
look at that all right that's a cool
angle listen it's not gonna be cheap
let's all be real here building an
underwater city probably pretty
expensive they're estimating it would
cost about 25 billion dollars
about right according to them and also
would take about five years to build now
here's the catch though there's a
question now is there's a catch Chris I
think there's a lot of catch yeah here's
the catch the technology doesn't
actually exist to build this yet and but
but they are very optimistic and they
think that for sure the technology to
build this underwater city is going to
exist in about 15 years and I think my
favorite part of this story was the
quote from the spokesperson of shimizu
who said the astro boy cartoon character
had a mobile phone long before they were
actually invented in the same way the
technology and know-how we need for this
project will become available very like
matter of fact just kind of like don't
worry guys this technology is gonna
exist Marler they were flying space
vehicles in the movies just surely
they're gonna come to him for 15 years
yeah I promise I saw this in the Jetsons
that's gonna happen like no big deal but
yeah that's pretty optimistic about it I
think they're overly optimistic would be
in the term but that that is it's very
cool or listen nicely done nothing wrong
with dreaming big yeah doesn't have been
wrong would you would you would you you
and you would you live in one of those
would you like rent out an apartment I
think I would stay there if it was a
resort I was like a hotel or something
right I go on vacation and underwear to
stay there that and you this is just for
you too so for you how much rent would
you be willing to pay well ok wait it
was it a resort or an apartment that is
now an apartment it's the department I'm
just saying that if I I was really into
it and I was like gosh I just have to
live in the underwater city the dome
underwater city and they had all my
amenities I didn't have to like take a
boat to the shore to go to the grocery
store or something look on the boat
playing the other yeah i work in there
somehow it would work at a retail store
or shop or something or host the show
right from inside the dome fine but I'm
have some fish behind us that'd be great
uh i would i would probably pay will it
see like what's the cost of like an
expensive apartment in like Manhattan
it's like you know three grand like two
bedroom or something sounds about right
ok so I'd say I pay like three grand ok
that's not about right ok pay the same
is like is like a very I know it's
overly expensive you guys but that's how
much apartments are there I think I
wouldn't do it I
wouldn't just there was a dollar I
wouldn't do it that yeah that thing
looks like it's begging for something to
a death trap just like some little brat
is gonna like accidentally break a piece
of glass combination Bing Bing Bing
shatter everyone is now well I mean
dolphins will save us cuz dr. Martha
there are so intelligent they're way way
smarter than us but let's let's say this
next article the article that I have for
us today I'm very it taps into i would
say any nerd or geek that has it baked
into their DNA that they are a nerd or
geek they have seen mystery science
theater 3000 show of course this is uh
this is a three guys well one guy hey I
cheese and two robots yeah that wouldn't
watch old movies and make a fun
hilarious commentary over it well before
was on TV and up to date it's been
pretty hard to like why it can be tough
to find certain episodes i would say
today's news story is about that it's
bad made all that much easier because
there is now a website dedicated to it
thank you thank you too to vimeo and
shout factory you can now go online you
can watch them rent them yeah rent them
or buy all of them yeah it's download
mst3k done downloaded really nicely done
website it's a really well-done website
so no there's 80 website web there's
eight episodes where the episodes that
you can download or rent and it's it's
300 300 dollars if you want to buy all
of them oh wow that's actually I mean if
you've got three hundred bucks kicking
around in your if your mystery science
theater 3000 Reena dollars is not a lot
different unlimited viewings and you get
80 plus episode that's pretty these are
really good if you haven't watched it
these are really good if you just have
your friends over analyze through don't
wanna like really dedicate your entire
brain to it just kind of like watch it
my favorite one is when they did eage
which is widely considered to be one of
the worst movies ever made it's it's so
brilliant it's so funny like highly
recommend and I know you can get like
there are some VHS rips on YouTube but
this is an officially sanctioned like
you can either download or rent them and
actually you know watch them in feel
good about yourself yeah dream is alive
and for the launch they've have three
episodes on there too so well you gotta
go wrong so I mean give it give it a
shot if you haven't seen it and if you
have it's pretty cheap to know and if
you if you've never seen Mystery Science
Theater 3000 watch it and then tell us
in the comments what you thought of it
because I'm really curious to see what
younger people who maybe haven't been
exposed to it yet think about mystery
sighs the thing is that if you're one of
the younger people that haven't seen it
a lot of the people that you watch these
days have been inspired by mr. Issa very
true very true promise you this is very
true anybody that's doing like anybody
that watches video game let's plays
where somebody play's a gas pretty much
is common fired by that commentary but
my comedian thank ya by people that are
actually funny a lot of professional
lets players cuz I've done it a couple
of times I'm terrible good all right
well that I was gonna say that brings us
to our hashtag of the day this is the
thing I'm curious about the hashtag of
the day is TD fans oh and I want to know
what series deserves an entire website
dedicated to it and what features would
it have so like what's show or a series
of films or whatever it is needs to have
its own it websites all like the
Simpsons website where's the simpsons
world like it would be like that where
would have the whole world and then what
features you watch any episodes you want
it'll have like special features just
just the weeks the weeks ok so what's
yours i would say for me well I mean I
see other thing is is like I'm not a
huge fan of I would say like loss would
be a good one mm-hmm because a lot of
people love that show like I essa Sara
Lee not the person who would like go by
like a three hundred bucks set for loss
but people are really into that show and
I think there's so many little pieces of
that show that would be really
interesting the kind of deep dive into
on a website so you got all these like
little morsels you like put together
things and have it sort of be like this
kind of a RPG like alternate reality I'm
with you on that and you get it you
could have like because the show is over
now you could have them film like some
of the answers right it's like answer
chosen you not like all crazy like how
everything she did like I really like
that idea of having this sort of very
full inside like out like a living
encyclopedia the shove that show mine
would be the twilight zone oh I love the
twilight zone and I know that people now
make audio plays of those two yeah they
could pop those on the website too so
yeah and then there's all kinds of
Tanner really broad sailing and yeah
it'd be really cool great way to ice
okay so hashtag TD fans that's it that's
the hashtag that it's quite you're gonna
have much better answers than us they
well I don't know twilight zone is
pretty good um okay so let's talk about
Robo security guards because this is the
thing that's happening and it's kind of
exciting Microsoft of all companies this
is not a company you've never heard of
this is Microsoft yeah they have taken
the first step toward full robot
integration on one of their campuses
this is really interesting this is from
a company actually these robots are from
a company called night scope and here
they are they're kind of like gold
they're really cool looking they're only
very r2d2 esque you can see here's some
of the here are some of the things they
have biological chemical radiation
detecting monitoring security mapping I
mean they do all kinds of stuff they can
check out if there's you know I there
there about five feet tall they weigh
about 300 pounds they can scan license
plates to see if their stolen cars looks
like a heat detector type thing it's
very secure they have HD cameras they
have crazy sensors um you there's no
weapons on face recognition no way yeah
good thing thankfully yeah but I'm here
yeah so they're gonna they're thinking
maybe in the future they would equip
them with tasers they're saying that at
some point they'd like to have these the
company that provided these robots would
like to have them working alongside
police officers like on beat like beat
cops it will go down the street and
stuff so they go around with cops who
are walking something good isn't that
like that Fox show that got canceled
that sounds like a Turner and hooch
situation for me I don't to see that
movie of course I oh it's a buddy cop
movie where the guy gets paired up with
a robot and he hates robots cuff them I
don't have hands Oh or snot you're a
robot like and it's all it's hilarious
asshole yeah it's very it's already
cancelled you guys I'm sorry was coming
this fall to NBC and now they've
canceled it already I wonder if anybody
watching this is what is against the the
whole Taser robot thing I know Elon Musk
is he said that we're probably gonna
have said to get we're gonna have a
Skynet for sure he's like very scared
about that but thats it for our
headlines we're going to be afraid of
robots with tasers for a little bit for
a quick break and then we'll be back we
have it into it I'm around them into it
before we go on Thanksgiving holiday and
then of course we have a not quite your
user feedback will explain
our phone Jagran for the day so don't
click away tomorrow daily welcome back
to the show we're back we haven't been
tased by robot security guard yet they
should get him here in this building I
co some security or your alignment for
punishment no it's really scary um so
every week kalyan i like to talk about
the thing we are crazy about and we got
some good ones this week so finally we
have to talk about ourselves yeah so
let's get into it kales favorite part of
the week I think every segment I'll be
like this is Kayla's favorite is my
favorite part yeah this is the part
where kill it takes a bathroom break no
no he can't you're not allowed you're
tethered to that chair all right so what
are you into well I am into a little
podcast called Sawbones it is really
cool it's really fun it is the tag
length this is a marital tour of
misguided medicine and this is dr.
Sidney McIlroy so she's an actual
medical doctor and then her husband
Justin McElroy who i believe if I'm not
mistaken is a writer for he's a video
game journalist which is pretty cool oh
cool they do this show and it's it's
super awesome they talk about all these
things in history about medicine and all
of the dumb ways that we've tried to fix
people so this is it's crazy so they
talk about one of their very first
episodes was trepanation which is
drilling a hole in your head and people
used to do that because they thought it
was good for you like really weird and
so because it will allow your brain to
like it was just aeration groceries but
they cover really awesome topics they
they've covered hysteria which of course
is not a real thing but hysteria people
thought it was a real thing I've got
that yeah okay stereo yeah I've got the
vapors that the vapor I've got the thing
oh we got the vapors opium I like uses
of opium like crazy they did patent
medicine so those are the ones were like
it's like dr. flibble floor it's like
ultra elixir and they explained like how
they worked and why they why they got so
popular for a while was because there
was no they didn't have to provide the
ingredient list yeah
so they because it was for like
medicines they didn't have to provide it
and then it was like they didn't have to
provide what was in it so people just
automatically assumed like okay and then
they won't this is AK would include
something like that would affect your
body for sure like alcohol cocaine
morphine or whatever it was like they're
having an affair having an effect like
it's really interesting it's a it's
funny like it's so so funny because the
two of them are just like super charming
together justin is you know the comedies
kind of the he's the wacky one and then
Sydney's the straight the straight man
is she's looks like no that's not how it
works like no they joke around and stuff
but it's it's really really funny and I
really really enjoy it so and there
about 40 minutes each I love that good
for a commute I'll of it I love that you
picked one of those informational type
things if you listen to like stuff you
should know where you read websites like
that I love weird little tidbits of
information which is why this show
exists it's that it's basically that
it's like our show but podcast form and
with medicine and they pick one topic
every week so every Friday they have a
new episode it's super good I love it
what's up the great work Sawbones good
job son my commute was in LA really
really good and informational yes please
shoes shoes summation wish yo super
informational and fun and then you get
to like it's a good party trick you tell
people about like oh there used to be
people who drilled holes in their heads
for fun like they thought it was good
fun of a partier chip yeah i'm really
i'm a really weirdo at a party don't
don't talk to me swinging parties
speaking of my interest is my into it
this week is super smash brothers it
just came out this last tuesday and it's
been on last friday last Friday oh yeah
in all weekend and it's been it's been
all that's been going on in my house and
the reason I bring it up is because it's
like the biggest Nintendo thing right
now people so I'm almost half a million
copies yes 710 oh great everyone thought
Nintendo was down and out like a year
ago I never did nope it's it was just on
a break and I believed so I want to I
wanted to bring this up because you know
if you're looking to give somebody has a
wii u and your family and I think this
is an essential game to have it's a it's
a fun little party games by to play with
you it's an absolute must by Phil we
yeah then they have those little of me
bows that you can buy I have a vivos but
I use them in mario kart more than I do
you're not even gonna buy super smash
brothers it's like the best you know
Jane I just have been okay listen guys I
got really obsessed with using the
amoebas in Mario Kart because i like the
costumes and so I have a Samus costume
and I'm racing in that it looks awesome
and again I've just been crushing
everybody because I'm so good at mario
kart so there you go you know you bring
that up like every other episode I know
it's and I will continue to do so
because I am well although I will say
this producer Logan is is coming up he's
a true challenger in Mario Kart you guys
haven't even seen me erase I don't need
you I don't know but I think I figured
you out think I've heard you out anyway
so smash brothers at least give it give
it a try it's it's actually it's come
around to be one of the most solid games
franchises and yeah it's a lot of fun I
play as zero suit your character you
play zero suit samus cuz she's quick
samus is probably one of my favorite
Nintendo characters yeah time didn't
know she was a girl for the longest time
well at the end of metroid turkish it
off now yeah but people didn't even like
it didn't even register people never
actually finish the game I would eat
their words too much for them so that's
what we're into let us know if you're if
you do either of those things who do you
play as in smash smash brothers and are
you any good I am NOT and I'll at least
admit it kill a minute there you go i'm
not i'm not gonna smash rather gentle
yeah that's why you're terrible cuz we
should play can be terrible at it I jump
off the edge on purpose not on purpose
sometimes on purpose uh so this would
normally be the time we did user
feedback so let's do it no because uh
I'll just get it sorry no just go to go
with it okay so I know because here's
the thing we are not going to use your

think because they want to expand their
minds and so I am very thankful to now
