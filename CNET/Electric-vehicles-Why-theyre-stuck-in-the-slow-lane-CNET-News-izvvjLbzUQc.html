in his new all-electric Tesla Model S I
think it's symbolic of the future it
represents the way all cars will be at
one time it's a vision his venture
capital firm draper fisher jurvetson is
banking on the firm was an early
investor in tesla motors and Jurvetson
was actually the first customer to get a
model s not everyone can afford Tesla's
new sedan the basic model runs 50 grand
and a souped-up version costs a hundred
grand while Tesla may not be producing
electric vehicles or v's for the masses
it is pushing the market forward what
they've done is they've catalyzed every
major automotive manufacturer to get on
the ball and get serious about electric
vehicles so just how much does an EV
cost most land in the forty thousand
dollar range but a well equipped to
nissan leaf has a friendlier price tag

couple grand from your state so let's

and maintenance costs are relatively
minimal electric cars don't require
things like oil changes they don't
require things like transmission service
but as gas engine cars become more
reliable and warranties improve paying
the mechanic less isn't a strong selling
point what is likely to draw customers
batteries that charge faster and readily
available charging stations your move EV
