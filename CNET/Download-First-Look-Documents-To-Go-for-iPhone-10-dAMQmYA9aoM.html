fairly good but it's no business tool
since you can't edit I'm jessica's all
court with Cena download com here's the
first look at documents to go for iphone
and ipod touch version 1 point 0 this
viewer and sometimes editor comes in two
flavors there's the basic which costs
499 at the time of the recording and the
more advanced documents to go with
exchange attachments that one costs 999
about ten dollars we'll take a look at
both in this video documents to go reads
Microsoft Word Excel and PowerPoint
documents PDFs and I work documents to
it can also create and edit Microsoft
Word files with support for Excel coming
next it remains a viewer for the other
file types but a faithful one it
beautifully renders images and charts in
both models you're able to create edit
and email Word documents you can also
save cut and paste and format the text
and paragraphs with color keep sliding
the toolbar to see more options like
finding a word in the page and clicking
and do with a more basic app you can
transfer files through USB connection or
by creating a Wi-Fi network between your
desktop and the iphone if you upgrade to
the version supporting Microsoft
Exchange you can also view attachments
from your inbox but first you'll have to
create a new inbox within documents to
go and specify how far back you'd like
to scan your email two weeks for example
then you can just tap the message and
the document to view and save while all
the features worked really well in our
tests were anxious to see broader
editing capabilities on par with
documents to go for other mobile
platforms like editing and creating a
wider variety of documents also the work
around with exchange can be frustrating
for some to set up in addition we'd love
to grab attachments for other web mail
in boxes like Gmail still it's a way in
for business users and it's a little
cheaper than the Quick Office mobile
office suite which can also to its
credit edit and create Excel documents
I'm Jessica doll court in this has been
version 1 point 0 of documents to go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
