podcast I'm Veronica Belmont and welcome
to my lovely cubicle anyway on the crave
blog we cover a lot of stuff it's really
cool and interesting say for example
this t-shirt from flash where calm now
this is really cool you would wear it to
a club or a rave and the the music would
show up on this meter here which is all
well and good but what about the
practical aspect what if you wore this
shirt to work
Veronica where's that prizefight script
and last week Sprave didn't have any
pirate gadgets in it you need to step up
and where's my James Blunt CD
alright so as you can see we have new
demographic data on the number of
pirates in the Cena TV audience our goal
is still farther behind what we wanted
to have was farther up as you can you
can see the lines are crossing guys this
is cute Veronica it's really distracting
could you have to wear that shirt yeah
I'm gonna turn this thing off now it may
not be the best outfit to wear in an
office type of environment but that
still doesn't mean that it's not fun for
a club or something like that anyway
that's it for this edition of crave if
you want to send in your own crave stuff
you can do so at krave at cnet com don't
forget to check out the blog at crave
dot sina com stay tuned next week where
Tim one hand and I judge the parallel
park golf see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
