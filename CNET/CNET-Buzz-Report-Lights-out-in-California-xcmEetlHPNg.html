Cooley in for Molly Wood first the
gadget of the week is this tomorrow's PC
or this these are a couple of the I
poppers that came out of a pc design
contest sponsored by Intel and Samsung
just happened last week this model has a
lamp cord you pull to turn it on that'll
be a new one at the repair counter now
we need buddy a new hard drive no string
replacement please this one looks like
an antique Eskridge wah you can almost
see Marie Antoinette sitting there
muttering mad as she tries to master
Vista as with most design contest
there's only a shred of usefulness in
most of this but you know you're in a
tough room when the stuff on display
makes the iphone look practical you got
to love a new site called by your friend
a drink com what a buzz this week you go
to the site you buy someone a drink they
receive a drink code on their cell phone
which they show to the bartender at any
participating watering hole and voila
the cocktail arrives up to that value
only works in a few dozen bars in the
New York area for now so what's the
point well I'm glad you asked time for
my top five reasons for a website that
lets you buy someone a drink number five
makes it easy for you to be a cheapskate
you sent him a five dollar drink that's
the cap if they order something actually
good like a Louie the 13th you're not
there to feel bad for not chipping in to
pay for it number four helps you keep
your distance from friends who order
stuff like chocolate martinis number
three eliminates having to drink with
someone who's not real good at it we've
all been there
number two it's so much less work than
joining them and hoisting that heavy
glass over and over and number one it
lets you pay up anonymously on that dumb
bar bet you made that you would never
own a zune in brown like mine hmm here's
the latest chapter of our national
descent into a socially inept non-verbal
culture LG's national texting
championship mall rats from across the
country competed to text impossibly
warranty messages the fastest and
without errors in the end it was a text
off between the East Coast and the West
Coast champs the $25,000 winner 13 year
old Morgan pose are from claysburg
Pennsylvania but the real winner you and
me cuz we get to savor the way bitchy
reaction from the West Coast runner-up
check it out either way I was in a bad
situation if I beat a 13 year old she
probably cries whoa let's put that hate
on vibrate there Missy and the state of
California now on its way to becoming
the first one to ban light bulbs at
least the incandescent type if this
proposed ban flies it would criminalize
incandescent bulbs between 25 watts and
150 watts by the year 2012 the idea is
to force us all to use compact
fluorescent bulbs which feature lower
energy consumption longer life between
replacements and that really nice tone
of light I'm Brian Cooley this has been
the buzz report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
