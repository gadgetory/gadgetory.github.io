humanity' is added again with another
bizarre holiday marketing stunt that
captures the curiosity and imagination
of the Internet and this time it's
political as the company promises to
save America how you ask
well the card maker launched a website
and video that says it purchased a plot
of land on the us-mexico border to
prevent President Trump from building
his promised wall and the game maker
said it has retained a law firm to make
it time-consuming and expensive for the
government to try and build anything on
it cards against humanity' is famous for
being a naughty party game it's born
from a highly successful 2010
Kickstarter campaign so naturally an
edgy card game built on internet fame
likes to do crazy attention-seeking
stunts last year for Black Friday
it took a giant hole to nowhere and
live-streamed the digging after 52 hours
the hole which was located about 90
minutes west of Chicago was later filled
back in but as for this year's promotion
the first 150,000 people who paid $15
will get an illustrated map of the
protected land at the border a promise
to fight the wall some new cards for the
game and a few other surprises the
promotion sold out in less than a day
the company says the surprises will be
quote fun weird and if you voted for
Trump you might want to sit this one out
and if you're wondering what they will
save America from while the FAQ page
says quote and justice lies racism the
whole enchilada share your thoughts in
the comments I'm Bridget Carey and we'll
keep covering all the weirdness of Black
Friday promotions at cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
