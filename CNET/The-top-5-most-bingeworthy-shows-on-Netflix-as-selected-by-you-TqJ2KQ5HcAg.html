shells on Netflix
the only problem was I didn't define bin
jabal for this top five so let's define
it as the shows you suggested with the
highest Metacritic scores okay if you
didn't suggest it it's not on this list
let's do this at number five is stranger
things it's one of Netflix's newest
shows and it has a Metacritic score of
75 this show is clearly influenced by
the works of Steven Spielberg John
Carpenter and Stephen King it centers
around a bunch of kids searching for
their friend there are only eight
episodes so you can probably watch them
all in one day the fourth-most bin jabal
show on Netflix is house of cards with
an average Metacritic score of 77 in its
four seasons the show is stacked with
stars like Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright
if you're into politics and underhanded
dealings you'll probably love house of
cards the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt
average Metacritic score is 80 with the
first season rated at 78 the second at
82 compared to stranger things in house
of cards Kimmy Schmidt it's a lot more
lighthearted that makes sense since it's
from 30 Rock's Tina Fey and Robert
Carlock
Plus the episodes are in the 30 minute
range so running through all of them
shouldn't take too long with a
Metacritic score of 81 is Marvel's
Jessica Jones this show accomplishes a
lot it's dark it's funny it has strong
characters and a pretty good plot
Krysten Ritter and David Tennant are
excellent as adversaries oh and if you
think of the shows for kids because it's
based on a comic book it's not it really
is not binge this show without the kids
and the number one most bendable show on
Netflix is Hemlock Grove now that show
is awful it's got a Metacritic score of
45 number one is master of none with a
score of 91 that's more than double that
of Hemlock Grove master of none is a
great take on being a first generation
American it's a fun look at show
business and it has some drama that
seems completely natural to the show go
watch it I personally don't agree with
the rankings I'd put stranger things at
number one but I don't control
Metacritic yet for more top 5 check out
top 5 cnet.com I'm I as actor and I'll
see you online
