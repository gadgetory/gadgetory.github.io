forcing it appliances here with the why
things home DIY camera this $200 camera
has to weigh talk night-vision 1080p
motion and sound sensors a whole bunch
of good stuff so those are all fairly
common features for a DIY camera
nowadays but this one also adds
something very interesting it actually
will detect the volatile organic
compounds in your home in parts per
million and tell you if your air quality
is safe or unsafe it also has a built-in
lullaby and nightlight feature so this
is kind of a webcam security cam and
baby monitor all wrapped into one so
it's really refreshing to see some new
features tacked on to DIY cameras but
there are some fundamental things
clearly missing from this camera there's
currently no Android app no web app and
there's no way to save your footage to
either the cloud or local storage it
will save time lapse photos of the
motion or sound that it detects but it
won't actually save any recording so you
can see what's happening but it's not
the most elegant solution I've seen the
motion sensor is also much too sensitive
so a small shift in lighting or shadows
will send it into a frenzy even if
nothing is actually happening in your
home and while why things was listed as
a home kit compatible company and it has
its own if channel this specific device
isn't really integrated into any of
those platforms currently I was also
disappointed by the video quality it
definitely didn't look like 1080p even
though that's what why things claims so
why things says that an Android app and
cloud storage are on the way but right
now this really doesn't function as a
security camera to me it's much more
useful as a webcam or as a baby monitor
it does pretty well at those things but
still isn't great at anything I do like
the addition of the air quality I think
that's an interesting add-on but it
isn't quite enough to justify the over
thanks for watching this review of the
why thanks home be sure to check out the
