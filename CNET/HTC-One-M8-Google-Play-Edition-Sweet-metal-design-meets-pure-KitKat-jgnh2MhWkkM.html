the deliciously seductive design charm
you'll find in HTC's current mobile
flagship it's the HTC One m8 google play
edition smartphone I'm Brian Bennett for
cnet this stunning device has an
aluminum chassis a super thin profile
and gently curved edges it also has a
rounded back which feels oh so
comfortable to hold keep in mind the One
m8 gpe comes in only one color what HTC
calls glacial silver I have to say I
prefer this finish since it's matte
texture is less slippery than the
brushed metal skin of the standard
gunmetal grey m8 it's on the inside of
this phone though where things take an
unexpected turn instead of HTC Sense
user interface which the company usually
layers over its Android devices the One
m8 GPE is special it's Google all the
way aside from a few welcome
enhancements courtesy of HTC this hybrid
provides the mobile phone experience as
envisioned by androids creator as a
result the One m8 gpe not only runs
pristine android 4.4 kitkat the handset
also uses an almost identical software
layout as the Nexus 5 yes that means you
get the Google now launcher complete
with tight ties to the company's
advanced search swiping left to right on
the homescreen activates the google now
card style interface just like how it
does on the Nexus 5 likewise the phone
can also respond to your verbal commands
to perform fancy voice recognition
tricks such as launching searches
setting reminders and calendar
appointments HTC's revamped blinkfeed
news and social media hub however isn't
on board that said the One m8 GPE does
retain other skills which sets the
company's super phone apart for instance
you can wake the handset simply by
tapping the screen twice another slick
way to fire up the device from slumber
is to pick it up then swipe upwards from
the bottom of the display both gesture
methods are vital since reaching the
power button on the top edge of the very
tall phone is pretty much impossible
using one hand and just because the MA
gpe lacks sense UI doesn't
the phone can't make use of its dual
lens main camera after you snap photos
you can refocus them apply plenty of
interesting filters and manually tweak
brightness contrast sharpness you name
it now I completely understand that the
one m8 GPE is a serious upfront
investment it's 699 sticker price is
especially steep considering you can buy
the non gpe phone heavily subsidized
from numerous US wireless carriers for
example both verizon and AT&amp;amp;T offer of
the device for 199 though this does
require signing a two-year service
contract t-mobile sells the One m8 for
zero dollars down but you're on the hook
for 24 monthly payments of 2650 but this
is no run-of-the-mill smartphone it's
the current pinnacle of physical handset
design melded with the ultimate
evolution of Google Android to date it's
also unlocked perfectly devoid of
carrier bloatware and connects to AT&amp;amp;T
and t mobile's flavor of 4G LTE in the
u.s. I'm Brian Bennett for cnet and
you've just taken a first look at the
HTC One m8 Google Play edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
