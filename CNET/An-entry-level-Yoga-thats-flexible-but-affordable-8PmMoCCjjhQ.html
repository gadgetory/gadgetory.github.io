hinge in front of you for even less I've
been actin and this is the Lenovo yoga 2
11 and 11 inch version of the yoga 2
line now that is the less expensive
version of lenovo's hybrid the yoga two
pros the more expensive version
obviously originally there was just the
yoga so with the yoga to you get bodies
that are a little bit thicker have a
little bit more plastic the screens are
just regular screens not super high res
screens like in the yoga 2 pro models
this version the 11 inch is a regular
1366 x 768 screen pretty nice bright
screen especially compared to the
similar HP Pavilion x360 which was a
little bit less expensive but really did
not have a good screen at all you're
still going to find the same pentium cpu
from intel in here the same standard 500
gig hard drive you can actually get some
upgrades to this guy even up to a
regular course eerie CPU but that makes
it very expensive seven hundred dollars
or more it starts out at a bit under
five hundred dollars which makes it very
competitive with other budget ultra
portable laptops but you get all those
special yoga features in this case it's
that hinge that let you go like this and
bend it around like this like it's a
kiosk mode or to the table tent mode
like this or to fold the entire thing
down into a tablet and of course you've
always got that keyboard still sticking
out there but at least it's deactivated
in tablet mode I was interesting looking
at this roughly 500 our model versus the
HP version which starts at one hundred
dollars less they have very similar
specs but the screen on this Lenovo
version was just much brighter than the
HP model I would definitely consider
spending a little bit more and getting
the better screen on the 10 vote which
is also a little bit thinner and a
little bit lighter i'm dan ackerman and
that's the Lenovo yoga 2 11</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
