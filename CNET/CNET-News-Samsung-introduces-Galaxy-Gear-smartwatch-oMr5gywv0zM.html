Samsung Galaxy gear
you
welcome to the future a gentle swipe
takes you from one feature to another
and you can you can tap anywhere to go a
label deep going back is as simple as
swiping down from the top resin to top
of the voice capabilities of gear we
added s voice so now you can simply use
voice commands to call your friends send
them text messages or sim set an alarm
or simply ask your gear is it going to
rain tonight when I receive a phone call
all I have to do is raise my hand to my
ear and I am ready to talk yes that
simple that natural we have uniquely
positioned the speakers and microphones
so that you can talk as you will talk on
a regular phone these are some great
engineering innovations be completely
rethought where we put an imaging sensor
on gear even a simple point-and-shoot
camera point-and-shoot camera requires
multiple steps before you take a picture
you take it out from the pocket turn it
on and then click the moment is gone
with gear we are changing everything
just one quick swipe down and click I
just took a picture now for every a
moment's you don't have to take out the
smartphone anymore and because sharing
is built in so I can take a picture and
send to my friends in seconds gear can
run its own apps gear supports all your
favorites Pat banjo why goal live 360
all of them this apps are specifically
designed for gear and as I speak more
apps are being added to the list
you can download all this have some gear
at store let me sum up by showing you
what makes the galaxy gear peak of
course the most visible is that
beautiful one point 63 inch 320 x 320
pixel Super AMOLED display gear is
powered by a custom 800 megahertz single
core cpu we also added gyroscope and
accelerometer so gear can respond to
your gestures and movements this also
enables gear and built-in pedometer of
the gear to track your workouts and I'm
sure because you will want your gear to
be with you all the time we design it to
last more than a day on a single charge
now gear is compatible of course with
note 3 note 10.1 2014 edition and with
software upgrade with galaxy s4 for all
galaxy s3 and note to users your
upgrades are also coming soon in October
with gear we have opened a new chapter a
new direction to an exciting world of
possibilities with gear today Samsung
reinvents a centuries-old object I can
proudly say galaxy gear is a design
statement an engineering marvel and
something that redefines tomorrow once
again welcome to the future thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
