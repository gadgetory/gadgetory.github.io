fit too this week it's the latest smart
fitness tracker from Samsung overall
it's pretty similar to the original
model from 2014 so it can track daily
activities and display notifications
from your smartphone although the new
model adds a more ergonomic design and a
few new features like GPS for example it
also isn't limited to only Samsung
devices and will now work with any
Android phone running KitKat or higher
but iPhones still aren't supported the
coolest feature though has to be the
onboard music storage there's four
gigabytes of space so you can load songs
right to the device and stream them to a
pair of bluetooth headphones which
pretty much means the fit too has
everything you need to just go out for a
run since there's also a heart rate
sensor on the back and built-in GPS for
measuring pace and distance this is of
course in addition to normal fitness
tracking features things like measuring
steps distance calories burned floors
climbed and your sleep at night it can
also automatically recognize and record
various activities like rowing or when
you're on an elliptical sort of like
what Fitbit does in its new devices
Samsung has said that with normal usage
you will get between three to four hours
of battery life and up to nine hours
with an active GPS signal which is
pretty good but unfortunately the
tracker isn't fully waterproof so you
can submerge in up to three feet of
water and it will do just fine out in
the rain and during workouts but it's
not recommended that you shower with it
or swim with it the gear fit - will be
available for $179 On June 10th for more
information check out my write-up on
cnet.com and be on the lookout for my
full review in the coming weeks
