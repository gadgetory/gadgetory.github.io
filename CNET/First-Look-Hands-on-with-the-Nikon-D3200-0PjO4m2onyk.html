very good photo quality the Nikon d3200
delivers what you expect from a DSLR
while the cameras lackluster feature set
some underwhelming design changes and
photos that don't necessarily surpass
its predecessor might disappoint some
people it still delivers enough that it
should please most folks who are looking
for an upgrade from their point and
shoots it still has a lot of the same or
similar components to the D 3100
including the same viewfinder and
autofocus system the latter is bolstered
by Nikon's newer scene recognition
technology though it also has a newer
higher resolution sensor coupled with
Nikon's updated X speed 3 imaging engine
it's got a higher resolution LCD and
1080 30p video with a supporting
microphone jack an HDMI connector the G
3200 essentially has the same body as
the D 3100 it's still relatively small
in light though it also still feels a
little plasticky while it remains a
pretty streamlined camera to shoot with
Nikon has changed a few of the control
types and locations in ways I don't
particularly like it keeps the same
viewfinder it's small and dim which is
pretty typical for this class but I also
hate the tiny focus points which only
illuminate and only briefly when you
half press the shutter they're
impossible to see and moderate to dim
light so if you shoot on anything other
than full auto you first have to press
the shutter to find the appropriate
focus point before you can even begin to
frame the scene Nikon has also moved the
record button to it I think is an
awkward location on the D 3100 there's a
combination live view of record switch
that falls under your right thumb and
that's really nice now we're back to the
separate live View button on the back
which you have to invoke first before
you can record and a record button on
top that you've got a stretch to reach
the D 3200 does keep the nice guide mode
that provides various levels of
step-by-step help for a limited number
of common shooting scenarios a nikon
laudably puts the D 30 to hundreds SD
card slot in the more accessible grip
side location
unfortunately it retains the bare-bones
feature set of the D 30
hundred right down to the lack of
something as basic as bracketing
compared to its competitors the Definity
200 matches their photo quality but
doesn't really surpass them in fact I
think the d30 100 has better photos out
overall and by the numbers it has a
better noise profile in general the
JPEGs look clean up through ISO 400 you
don't gain any unambiguous advantages
shooting raw until about ISO 1600 it
still gives you some Headroom for image
manipulation but you can't easily
produce a cleaner image without some
trade-offs in other respects color
exposure sharpness tonal range the
camera fares very well I wasn't terribly
impressed with the video quality though
it's OK for personal vacation type use
but even in good light it's fairly soft
and there are a variety of annoying edge
based artefacts and dim light it gets
very noisy the performance is definitely
better than its predecessor though still
no rocket ship compared with models like
the SLT 8:37 this is typical for its
class LiveView autofocus is slow and
cumbersome and the full time autofocus
and video performs about the same as
other DSLRs it can focus but it doesn't
stick and it pulses on unmoving objects
there's nothing about this camera that
screams by me or don't by me it's faster
has a better LCD and better video than
the D 3100 but the higher resolution
sensor doesn't deliver better photo
quality its bare-bones feature set can't
match that of the cheaper a 37 and you
can probably find the older but more
feature-rich D 5100 for less than the
cost of the new D 3200 still I think
most entry-level shooters would be
perfectly satisfied with the Nikon d3200</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
