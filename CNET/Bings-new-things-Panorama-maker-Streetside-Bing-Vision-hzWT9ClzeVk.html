I'm talking to blaze the are you the
architect of Bangkok something great and
we are taking a look at the new iphone
app forbidden coming out when is it oh
very soon very soon but so you it'll be
in your hands soon and one of the new
things it does is panorama it's right so
let's have a look at aroma creation so I
tap on the panorama button that's
actually not necessarily the way we're
going to expose that okay maybe other
ways too but what we're looking at right
now is a viewfinder and if we start
recording so we could go now it's
tracking visually so this is this is not
just using the the gyro or the compass
it's really it's really using using
sorry for rotating this around but I'm
gonna do it right it's using real visual
tracking to figure out so now you can
schedule a time moving this around yeah
it's figuring out right we're in the
panorama I was so that that visual
tracking is relating all those
individuals to each other and now when
you hit go it will fuse them all so
process and what what that what that can
then do is either create a panorama just
for yourself
baseball trip through social circle or
you can share it with everybody which
which is my something with courage to
thing about this is we have
crowdsourcing experiences and places all
over the world let's do a search for
capital grill in Seattle which is why I
used to demo with just now and so here's
the here's the business page there are a
lot of cool things on here so for
example we have at a reminder for geo
fencing you can even geophys the
neighborhood or that just a couple of
streets so that when you when you go
anywhere nearby you'll you'll be able to
sense your notification that kind of fun
you can check in you can plan and share
that plan socially I didn't actually
shut it off now but this is this is the
this is the eye candy so sweet side is
is a very different experience on the
mobile device than on the desktop
because you see you have this kind of
ability to swipe to strafe down the
street which is pretty cool so you see
that they're showing up the names of
businesses over here so you can see what
you know what businesses are on that
block but what's nice about this is that
it's very very bad with efficient and it
allows you to see pretty far away I like
the pie top on a cross street like forth
and I can turn onto the cross street and
strafe down there if i zoom in then we
do this transition to to an immersive
panorama so if you know this is the kind
of stuff that you can imagine being
being crowdsource so now when I now when
I swipe you see I'm rotating around yes
this is a panoramic experience but it
also it's effectively what that what
that strip with that slide experience
lets you do is zoom out a lot further
than you'll be able to otherwise this is
help you get a kind of better feel for a
neighborhood when you've never actually
been there that's right that's right i
mean if you've ever tried using your gps
in a city you know that it's you know 40
meters off at least when it's reflecting
off the building
and so on so being able to see the to
see the whole block and to see where the
businesses and to locate yourself on it
is we think is a pretty important
function of a MOBA that's why we did
this is this going to be everywhere
where streetside currently is on maps
that's right right right here in the
search box microphone and camera are
first-class citizens so if I tap on
camera I'm now basically using the
camera as my as my visual ability to
search so of course we are we've been
able to do barcodes for for a long time
and so recognizes a barcode and you
don't have to type anything right it
just text right away and so super sad
true love so it's very nice kind of
real-time behavior for barcodes but one
of the new features that we haven't
really done before is so here I just got
a got a magazine and if we snap a
picture of say the beginning of this
article I just I just took I just took a
shot and you notice it says searching
for text because it detected text in
that frame so notice okay here we go so
notice that notice that there are white
boxes around all of the words over here
and so you can just start tapping you
know John Waters live this San Francisco
saying right so I just entered a long
search just by tapping kind of fridge
poetry style on these words and I could
go it's just going to do that search so
this is a way of doing searches from
images in there we go so there's there's
via web results for that for that thing
proven that obviously that OCR
capability has a lot of legs are many
things we can do with this but first go
is use it as a fast way of doing search
when you have textin phone so when is
this update come out to iphone users
only uppal can tell us that but if it's
in submitting it's got it what about
other platforms are some of these
features coming there soon or later many
of these features are coming to other
devices as well so beautiful so sexy
railroads great all right well thanks so
much thanks so much</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
