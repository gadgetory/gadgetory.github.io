few months with one scandal after
another now ubers founder and CEO Travis
kalanick
is out for an unknown period of time his
duties may be reviewed and possibly
reallocated by the board they're saying
he needs to grow up he needs to become
more professional more businesslike
kalanick announced his leave of absence
as 47 recommendations from former US
Attorney General Eric Holder were made
public Holder oversaw an internal
investigation into sexual harassment
accusations and the company's party
culture the report recommends
implementing processes to improve
leadership and accountability creating a
more professional environment increasing
diversity and adding training courses
it says uber needs to reformulate its
company values and quote it is vital
that they reflect more inclusive and
positive behaviors ubers recent problems
began in February when former employees
Susan Fowler blogged about alleged
sexual harassment
a few weeks after kalanick was caught on
camera yelling at an uber driver the
company is also being sued over claims
it stole self-driving car technology
from Google Cal an acknowledged the
ongoing problems quote I also need to
work on Travis 2.0 to become the leader
that this company needs
he also said he would use time away to
grieve the recent death of his mother
and he's he's really the face of the
business his brains behind the business
it's unclear if uber could be over
without him uber already fired more than
20 employees last week senior vice
president of business Emile Michael also
resigned the changes are unlikely to
affect Hoover drivers and customers
though ubers rivals like lyft could reap
the benefits in San Francisco Lexus
