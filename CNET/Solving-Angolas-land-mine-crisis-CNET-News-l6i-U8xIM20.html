signs with the skull on them but you'll
be walking you know within one foot of a
landmine they would say you know this
thing goes off everybody dies
everyone has been affected by landmines
in Angola it's ever-present
Angola is one of the most heavily mined
areas still in the world so he went to
Angola to take a look at the technology
behind landmine removal they were picked
up in an armored Land Rover by halo
trust we've been here but since 1994
whilst the war was going on and people
were suffering right the way through to
the present day when people are still
suffering our focus is to get the mines
out the ground
and Golan's refer to as the end of the
earth because my bow is a place of huge
importance to angolans as a major battle
that was fought the height of the Cold
War Angolans confronted apartheid in
South Africa at that time mine laying
was a normal method of warfare we call
the mind town in Africa a lot of the
really high-tech stuff is in the
surveying process a big tool is Google
Earth the way it works is first they'll
send out a team of surveyors still talk
to townspeople about where these mines
are go clock in GPS points to create a
map this map of cuido kind of all shows
how the whole town is surrounded by
gigantic minefields they're still nearby
like a big l-shaped minefield it's 30
kilometers long that is just sitting
there to take out a land mine is really
grueling and tense
work people are kneeling on the ground
they have a bucket of tools there on
their hands and knees with a handheld
metal detector kind of slowly moving
across this piece of wood
it's literally inch by inch they hear
any sounds of metal they start
excavating what we do now is excavate a
trench this shape 20 centimeters wide
down to 15 centimeters and when I get to
15 centimeters then I'll move forwards
scraping this front wall of my trench
the approach is to try to get to the
mine from the side because if you touch
the top it'll explode the scraping very
carefully okay metal on metal okay
making me suspicious
okay section commander think of an
amount when a mine is excavated before
it's detonated they're marked with
little sticks that are painted red on
top and they'll blend minefields we
visited there's this red sticks you know
every few feet and just one wrong step
could be catastrophic in the second
minefield there were a bunch of IEDs the
people we were with were kind of just
like looking down at the mines and like
scraping them to see what was on there
and that's one of the steak mines and
underneath we've got some blocks of TNT
this is this a suffocated tank device in
this direction to what quit one of our
top there was a dense man line around
here so they got stuck here take you see
this has been absolutely devastated like
the totally my wrecked off tracks is
being totally torn off we also visited a
landmine field that has been completely
defined and the city called blombo and
that is where Princess Diana walked 20
years ago this year if you look at old
pictures of her walking in the field you
can see those typical red painted sticks
along the side of the road showing where
there's land mines and today there's a
school there
there's homes there's kids playing in
the street it's completely different at
the halo compound in Huambo they have
like basically their office room it's a
mapping room and their computers are the
countrywide map has has red and green
dots all over it showing all the known
minefields and the green ones have been
cleared of Mines and turned back over to
the communities they've done a ton of
work but there's still like a lot of
work to do currently there's no robots
or giant machines that can go within
there and just take out all the land
mines there's really no silver bullet
the main thing is boots on the ground
they need people in there doing this
exacting slow work
today's the last day of the mining in
Quetta carnival and unfortunately we're
having to close the program after this
due to a lack of funding that means that
we have to walk away from this minefield
which still has many more mines to be
cleared and which still presents a risk
to the safety of people living in this
area</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
