episode 226 of the 359 podcast on BVG
and in the house with me today I've got
Joanie soles Minh and Alfred hing
Goodway what's up how's it going great
thanks for joining us today
all right what are we talking about on
the show today well if you've paid
attention to any financial news
yesterday very exciting
snapchat finally released their
first-ever quarterly earnings and things
are not looking good for them I don't
know they lost 2.2 billion dollars now a
lot of that is like stock payout options
but 750 million dollars out of that went
straight to their CEO so we'll be
talking about what's going on at
snapchat and you know and then Joan was
at the Tribeca Film Festival and she
checked out this really cool VR like
program though yeah where they touch you
with so that's that's awesome
not inappropriately and there's a
proposed DHS ban
basically their electronics ban that
they had for eight middle eastern
countries but they're now proposing it
for some parts of flights coming from
Europe so if you have a laptop and
you're planning on taking a flight
somewhere to or from Europe to the US
maybe think twice about that
all right everybody hang out we're going
to cover these in detail over the next
three minutes and 59 seconds and then
we'll come back and hang out with y'all
on the chat so feel free to submit
questions comments let's uh do this week
closeout right and here we go in three
two
welcome to the 359 I'm Alfred Inge I'm
Joanie sauceman so snapchat released its
first ever quarterly earnings report
yesterday and it turns out the emperor
has no clothes before went public
snapchat was always really secretive
about its finances and projects so it
went public with a crazy amount of hype
and Wednesday was the first day that we
really got to see how the company runs
so they lost 2.2 billion dollars to
billion the majority of which was in
stock payout and the thing that stood
out to me the most was how poorly the
spectacle so do you remember the
spectacles so with with like they sold
about 12
point five million dollars totals worth
of these these like camera sunglasses
and if you look at it $130 a pop that
means that basically like less than
point zero five percent of snapchat
users actually own spectacles that's not
so great for a company that bills itself
as a camera yeah the when they released
it they're like oh we're a camera
company now except less than 1% of our
users are actually like actually own our
cameras I mean it seems like it was part
of their like marketing strategy to make
it rare at first but now it's just like
okay well now no one has it yeah and
then CEO Evan Spiegel also said he
wasn't afraid of Facebook despite
Instagram copying snapchat and in my
mind doing it better said was focused on
making more creative products like
adding more filters people be able to
draw anymore more of those options do
you really think that these like puppy
filters are going to be able to save the
company well I think that the network
effect has a big influence on it's easy
to compare Instagram and how quickly
stories increase to snapchat and how
many people are using their stories but
Instagram is coming off of the benefit
of having just like lots and lots
millions and millions millions more
users to begin with so if a small
segment of them start using that feature
which they already know is pretty cool
because snapchat people like it then a
lot of people are gonna use it but do
you think that people are defecting from
snapchat to use Instagram I don't think
so I mean I do this oh you do yeah maybe
um so Joan you were at the Tribeca Film
Festival and you saw a lot of virtual
reality that had a real nice touch to it
get it because you saw they Tribeca
immersive program where they use more
than just the headset for the experience
they they had somebody like come and hug
you or they had like a landscape while
it was happening in like VR this sounds
a lot like those like forty movie
theaters were like the seat shake and
like something crazy happens right well
what did you think of it it's cool it's
definitely something that makes more
sense for a festival setting or a museum
setting or a theater setting that I
would Furby for home it's not something
you can you know you can't send an actor
or actress into your home to be there
with a motion capture so you can give
you a hug at the right moment but it's a
great way to kind of drum up some
interest in what VR can do if you're
experimental with it and it works well
on a festival
so did it feel were you like expecting
the touch to come like happen when you
tried it out Scott Scott's died and our
colleagues last night he was the one
that did that one we kind of divvied out
who would do which things because there
were so many experiences to do and in
that one
the idea is that this person in a motion
capture suit you know you see a virtual
version of them so you know when she
like reaches out to hold your hand and
you reach out to hold her hand you
actually touch your hand same as they
have built their rooms so that there's a
door where in the virtual room there's
also doors when you reach out for the
knob it's actually there I mean that's
kind of cool I I don't see that like
scaling like you're like you were saying
like I see there's more than like
museums and things like that yeah it's a
cool way to drum up interest in VR and
to see what you can do if you think
about it a little outside the box
and finally there's reports at the
Department of Homeland Security's
looking to extend its onboard
electronics ban from eight Middle
Eastern countries to several parts of
Europe so the original plan was to block
devices larger than your phone from
being carried on flight so like laptops
tablets you know DSLR cameras which
stemmed originally from a an alleged
bombing plot that with an iPad so you
know air travel is like probably going
to be really annoying this year between
all the different kinds of things you
can and cannot bring and the places you
can and cannot go or return from yeah
yep also just a quick shout out to our
team covering the Microsoft build
Developers Conference it's a day two of
their keynote so be sure to check us out
and seeing that for more on that as
always thanks for listening I'm Alfred
Inge
I'm Jonny Salzman and let's jump right
into the chat Danny Green are loyal
tried and true Danny Green he says
really who wants to wear camera glasses
all the time or even half the time and
Alfred I'm gonna defect to you thought
that one I feel really stupid for buying
a pair I was one of the few people that
bought a pair and I'm part of the point
zero five percent now it was a fun
novelty for half a second can't believe
I spent $130 on that was it your money
or company with my money oh you fool
well the I I look at it on it just
collects dust on my dust
on my desk that's why I said tusks um
I'm like I really should have just sold
this on eBay cuz the day that I bought
it it was selling for like a thousand
dollars on eBay like
you know this will probably go up in
value so just Oh God um I mean I thought
that would be really cool like when I
got it I was like riding my bike I was
like skateboarding I was like cooking
like doing it on like spectacles and
then your phone died yes that was the
problem that like I I did a podcast with
respect to those you remember that one
yeah um but the problem is that it kills
your battery life um it doesn't matter
what phone you're using because it's
transferring video over Bluetooth from
like the glasses into your phone and
snapchat already like takes up like a
crazy amount of your phone's battery
life so like I could send like four or
five videos and I look at my phone oh
c'mon like 25% after like 30 minutes you
just think about it and maybe like 20
years or so you'll be able to uh donate
those to an electronics museum probably
not I'll be telling the great failure
section Oh God um yeah but like when it
first came out everyone's saying like oh
this is gonna succeed we're like Google
Glasses failed or Google glass sorry
we're you know they managed to make like
the camera glasses look cool which they
did um but like I feel like they were it
was like a lot of technical faults at it
here we're which to be fair like that's
what snapchat is like focusing on right
now they spent about eighty million
dollars on research and design now
granted a lot of that went to
researching and designing how to make a
better Android app but I mean I see a
lot of potential for them to make this
better and like refine it um again
though I feel really stupid for happy
alright so expanding on this Matthew
doctor asks or states no one could
really get spectacles and then he asks
has that changed or snapchat pulling a
Nintendo on us no no well yeah it has
changed because like I think around like
January or like February they were they
basically yeah they made it available on
their website where anybody can buy it
but the thing is is that they're like
they did not do a really good job of
letting people know that so it's
available on their website now but
because of their original marketing
campaign where which everyone knew about
we're basically all we like parachuted
this vending machine and like the bottom
of the Grand Canyon right um go find it
like kind of thing yeah
like now's like it's available guys
please please buy this like kind of
thing so it's it's it completely
backfired on them I think as imagine
sake points out by the time they were
available no one cared anymore that was
really that was the other thing too like
the reason why I'd like people really
wanted was because it wasn't like that
available
um the prices on eBay like really
started going down once they open up
their New York City like store where um
they were it was like open like every
day for like three weeks like pretty
much from like the middle of December
until like New Year's Day I was very
annoyed by hat to wear um so I was there
the first day and I waited like six
hours in line for that for us for a
story but then I just bought one for
myself anyway um and then I went back
like I was around the area like three
weeks later or so um because like
something related to Trump Towers and
the tech summit that was there but it's
like the snapchat stores like two blocks
away so I walk past and there's like no
lines completely empty yeah but it was
open so anyone could just walk in and
buy one and I just thought like you fool
I waited six hours in the cold for this
guy haha and there are better there are
better glasses cameras situations they
find them all over Amazon and eBay but
they're not connected to snapchat
so imagine soggy wants to know as far as
the faults go if the battery life did
improve like if it stopped murdering
your phone battery life would you come
back um I would use it more often um but
I still think there's like a cultural
line lapsed its novelty what do you mean
is it is it fun anymore
whistling it's fun like I like using it
um my friend had like a really cool
thing where like he just put it on like
the dashboard of his car and then like
he just pressed it like it was like a
like a short term like dashcam kind of
thing like I didn't use it officially as
one but like it was way that with the
GoPro - it was a way of like snapping
without like Drive like you know getting
your attention off like driving or
anything like that
um yeah you can do a GoPro but the thing
is like it doesn't go directly to
snapchat that might be the issue - like
no one's using like snapchat as often as
they used to so let's speculate on
spectacles do we think that there are
possibly other hardware type situations
that snapchat could get like foray into
that would possibly work
than these Bluetooth glasses did
definitely GoPro like if they were smart
they would just allow like third party
cameras to be able to thin yeah it's a
Bluetooth into snapchat but they're
they're like so insular with it where
it's like no only our glasses can do
this so that snapchat is a lifestyle
it's a fashion statement I'm pretty sure
that's what their ad was when they came
out with it uh Joan I'd like to hear you
expand on this incredibly uncomfortable
sounding virtual reality situation just
out of my own morbid curiosity because I
don't like being hugged so that's one
experience so that one was called draw
me close um Scott Stein did that one but
I know enough about it I can kind of
give you a rough idea the premise of it
is um it was done by a theatre company a
Canadian theatre company and the premise
is the playwright / director it kind of
uh chronicles not chronicles but it's
like vignettes like like not literal
feeling but like motional vignettes
given that his mom had a cancer
diagnosis and so it's kind of like
diving into his memories of his mother
so you're in this room and the virtual
thing that you see in the headset and
mirrors the physical objects in the room
so if you bend down and you touch the
carpet you can feel carpet underneath
you there's a bed in the corner if you
walk over the bed you can sit down in it
the mom can tuck you into the bed and at
the end of it um she reaches out she
gives you a hug um so I think that your
heebie-jeebies are not going to be I
don't know the virtual element of it's
going to give you more heebie-jeebies or
less if you already don't like getting
hug my jimmies are less rustled after
hearing this but I don't know I like to
be stabbed in virtual reality well it
kind of reminds your life I for for
Christmas this year I got my mother this
gift it was I can remember from the
Kickstarter GoFundMe project but it was
this lamp and it's not virtual reality
but so I kind of see a parallels in the
sentiment and it's literally a lamp
that's just connected to your Wi-Fi and
it says kind of little decorative table
glowy lamp thing and she touches it her
like there's two of them you get there
and then you can actually extend that
into a network of I don't know how many
a think it's like up to 26 or something
crazy like that yeah and so this lamp
sitting at her desk at her home and I
got one sitting in my desk
my home and you know she says I'm
thinking of she touches a lamp and mine
lights up and then I come over and I
touch it in a changes color and it'll
reflect back and tell her like I'm
thinking of you too kind of thing oh
they have that for sex toys I don't want
to ruin the sentimental moment here but
right moving on we're just about out of
time but to talk about this problematic
travel situation our boy Danny Green
says if I can't take my DSLR then I'm
not going
pictures is my thing when I travel
always looking for interesting things to
take pictures of you can take all of
these technologies with you it's not
saying that you can't bring it on your
flight and you can't bring it on board
you can like still like pack it in like
you carry it Jack sure yeah but most
people won't trust there that's the
freshest electronics in the cargo bay I
know for a fact I mean even when we did
our RC net annual trip to CES I did not
want to put my laptop in my toe my
tablet cracked on a flight to Nashville
that I had like a few weeks ago but it
was like a small like hairline crack
yeah whatever but but is that right
that's something to think about they're
gonna force you to start checking
portable devices things are meant to be
kept on your person like a like a tablet
like the whole idea is like I'm bringing
this on the flight and I'm gonna watch
movies the whole time oh wait yeah
that's yeah um my loophole I feel is
that they should just start making
phones like way bigger because their
their policy right now is it can't be
bigger than a phone so if they just make
a phone like like this big then that's
so getting a call hold on it's like flip
phone that's so bizarre though I mean
how many people try to work on the plane
I mean I don't know I don't fly that
much but I'd imagine a lot right there's
tons of people who have to commute for
the job
jet sitting all over the place and they
have to get something done while they're
in the air they can't be stagnant hmm
well my sometimes they'd probably be
traveling like within the u.s. for that
though that can still be a significant
light yeah yeah I don't know that sounds
really sour to me how much is this
developed how much do we know what's
coming into members were that they were
gonna announce it today but the DHS has
like commented on the record that they
would be like announcing something
within like the next few weeks and
they're still planning it
um marnik is all up in the area up in
the air it's three puns on this show yes
perfect place to wrap it up for the week
