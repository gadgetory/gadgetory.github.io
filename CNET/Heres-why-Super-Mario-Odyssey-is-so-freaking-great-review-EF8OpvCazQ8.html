they don't come out very often usually
only once a console generation the
latest one is called Super Mario Odyssey
and it's easily one of my favorite Mario
games of all times so let me show you
why and yes that's how I say Mario I
don't know what to tell you so the
backstory in Odyssey is mostly familiar
stuff basically all you need to know is
that mario has to stop an arranged
marriage between princess and Bowser to
do this you jump from Kingdom to Kingdom
collecting para moons to fly your hat
ship thing that you're in very quickly
you're given the power to capture items
and creatures with your new friend a
sentient hat so you can take over their
bodies and play as them this feature
makes Odyssey the strangest Mario game
yet and that's what's awesome about it
you can dig the form of chain chomps -
frogs goombas and even a freaking t-rex
then there's the old-school 2d 8-bit
parts of the game which happened more
often than I thought they would usually
plastered on the side of the wall or
some other clever fashion they're
integrated really smartly and give the
game a satisfying amount of variation
along the way Mario will acquire
currency exclusive to each Kingdom as
well as the regular old gold coins now
you can spend those at shops to buy new
hats outfits souvenirs etc from the
world now if there was one complaint I
had with the game it's the motion
control options that it really wants you
to use about 95 percent of the game can
still be played without the gestures but
I found the pro controller or using the
joy con grip the best way to play plus
when you're in tablet mode it's really
kind of tough to pull off some of those
motions Super Mario Odyssey is the most
explorable an open world style Mario
game ever packed with a seemingly
endless amount of Secrets and after game
collecting to take on well maybe what I
like best about this Mario game is that
it's just different it takes chances
deviates from the path taken it's funny
touching and it's really weird and
that's great
suffice it to say yeah if you have a
switch this is a no-brainer as much as
Zelda juez go play it and if I didn't
own one I'd probably buy a switch just
to play this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
