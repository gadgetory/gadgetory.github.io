one of the stranger looking in your
headphones available but it's also one
of the best sounding I've ever heard
the reason the headphones look a little
like a Star Wars TIE fighter that they
use the companies 30 millimeter planner
magnetic drivers which tend to sound
very coherent and spacious low
distortion and until now I've only been
found in models that have full-sized ear
cups the eye sign 10 which cost $400 has
an open back design so it doesn't cut
you off from the outside world but that
also means it doesn't hush external
noise and also leak sound so this isn't
the best headphone to use in an open
office environment the headphone comes
with two cables a standard one fitted
with a 3.5 millimeter plug and an apple
certified cypher lightning cable that
takes digital audio directly from your
iOS device and uses the cables built-in
digital converter and headphone
amplifier using the cypher cable the
headphone plays significantly louder and
does sound better overall the only
problem is the inline remote is heavy
and not great to walk around with in the
not-so-distant future we expect that a
second-generation cypher cable with a
smaller inline remote will become
available but this is what you get for
the time being while the I sign looks a
little funky I did manage to get a tight
seal using the largest of the buds
included with the headphone and I got
the headphone to sit securely in place
using one of the detachable ear hooks
that's also included except for the
weight of the inline remote tugging
downward the headphones fit me
comfortably though they may not fit
everyone as well as they did me there's
an Aussie DSP app that features a 10-man
equalizer that changes EQ in real time
but you don't have to use that app to
get great sound this is a very clear
sounding headphone that goes deep
delivering clear articulated bass
natural mid-range and very finely tuned
trouble it's also a very open spacious
sounding headphone it's worth noting
that ozzie sells a step up I sign 20 for
$600 that is a longer voice coil and
other improvements that allow for even
more transparent detailed sound in the
end this headphones design isn't for
everybody it's obviously pretty pricey
but the I sign 10 does deliver
exceptionally good sound it's well worth
listening to if you get a chance to hear
it I'm
