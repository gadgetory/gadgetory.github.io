experiencing an unexpected and
potentially major roadblock the US
Department of Justice is reportedly
demanding the telecom giant sell-off the
CNN portion of Time Warner in order for
the deal to be approved according to
sources close to the talks the Justice
Department believes the sale would
satisfy antitrust concerns regarding the
mega merger
other television properties and DirecTV
are also part of the demand according to
a series of tweets from NPR shares of
both Time Warner and AT&amp;amp;T were down
slightly as news of the demand leaked
and AT&amp;amp;T now says it's uncertain whether
the deal can be closed even though it
previously hoped the acquisition would
be done by the end of 2017 this is an
eighty five point four billion dollar
deal which is probably why sources are
saying AT&amp;amp;T is likely not going to go
down without a fight
so where did this seemingly unexpected
demand come from America the calls are
coming from inside the house and by
house I mean White House US President
Donald Trump has frequently criticized
CNN in the past and also pledged to
block the deal during his 2016
presidential campaign it remains to be
seen how AT&amp;amp;T will officially respond to
this Department of Justice divestment
demand but we'll be keeping a close eye
on this story as it develops
what do you think AT&amp;amp;T should do or
maybe you think this deal shouldn't go
through at all leave your opinions down
in the comments and stay tuned to see
Netcom for more I'm ashley Esqueda see
