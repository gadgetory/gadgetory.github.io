video that meant if you tried to record
a movie off the TV you'd find it cutting
out halfway through Sony's first robot
dog was the ers 110 which came out in
1999 I both looked cool but it was
stupidly expensive with limited features
and none of the charm of a real dog
inefficient I'm oh well not catch it
wasn't long before Apple brought down a
reign of legal fire upon Samsung Steve
Jobs and pals accused the company of
slavish ly copying the iphone and ipad
pointing to similarities in design icons
and even packaging CNET's has advised me
to have a lawyer present for this next
bit but let's be honest Apple had a
point these phones were blatant galaxy
s3 crammed in all these bizarre apps
that are so weird you'd have to be the
kind of person who eats breakfast with
their toaster to use them all you know
I've never loved you it's processing
power wasn't noteworthy it only had a
few buttons and its tiny monochrome
screen could only handle four shades of
grey which sounds like some very
lackluster erotic fiction and then she
kissed his hair or something but he
didn't like it Tetris got us all hooked
on the famous type a music which is
actually a Russian folk tune and is the
source of a mental phenomena called
Tetris syndrome which can cause hardcore
players to see falling shapes while
drifting off to sleep or in the corner
of their eyes Luke hey I just got off
the phone with cape from finance
this plugin is not very weird porn with
your with your expense report is it true
you actually commissioned on the tyorins
work statue of you for the office this
made the iphone 4 particularly
impractical for left-handed folks but
hey maybe lefties don't really feature
in apple's vision of the future geniuses
reason Apple wall cast your mind back to
two thousand four when it was predicted
that apple would soon be crushed by
increasingly sophisticated low price
ipod rivals like the dell DJ though I
think we can all be glad that that never
happened I wanted to explore the science
behind smartphone passion why do online
discussions about android or iOS so
frequently turn aggressive but as it
turns out grasping the intricacies of
the human mind is harder than we thought
you come across a tortoise lying
face-down in the desert during a desert
subject uncooperative Sega had basically
invented the concept behind the wii u
years before nintendo something that
sega and i have in common sager on the
other hand was losing money slashing
prices in an increasingly desperate bid
to make the Dreamcast to success but
shoppers just weren't interested welcome
back to our 500 of Sega's everything
must go dreamcast price crash we still
have 150,000 units left and I've just
been told that if you order now you will
get me thrown in I've been told that
illegal so why not pick up the phone it
dawned on them that by removing the key
feature of their product they could
create something much more exciting an
ingenious moment of discovery that we've
been unable to replicate
boosting the gadgets popularity by
hiring young couples to walk around
Tokyo listening to the Walkman and
presumably looking dead trendy a nice
idea that I suspect would work less well
in cold unfriendly London
oh this called the phony war of yeah
sure sorry me
Tech was adored by businesses who saw a
way to be in touch with employees 24-7
yes Hans boobie yes let's talk business
like Bri is famous for one feature that
big businesses are absolutely crazy for
security Sorry mate you're not getting
in look seriously Luke
yes Luke yeah he's doing it again but
then it clicked samsung had made sure
that no matter where you are in the
world or how much cash you had to spend
there was a galaxy gadget for you it did
raise questions though about how exactly
Samsung comes up with new phones 5.3 is
size on the screen but what is the clock
speed 2 gigahertz and we'll call it the
samsung galaxy legs s say there are so
many Galaxy devices that animating them
all has killed my video producer yes I
need a new one because it's all look
just someone quickly all right Oh see if
you've got one in blue because it will
match my eyes sense also featured HTC's
famous clock widget which tells you what
the weather's like where you are I've
never really understood the appeal of
that one hey excuse me I'm sorry ah
joong what the weather's like
forgot my phone oh no that's one I'm
sorry I guess 10 G's boy have you seen
my family in short the s3 broke the One
X like Carthaginian general Hannibal
shattered the Roman legions at the
battle of the trivia look we can do it
if we green screen the river and the
Numidian cavalry we have the Romans
played by extras about a thousand lots
of catering then on my signal the animal
handlers released the war elephants
across the river for the big climax and
scene be careful yeah it was more secure
than windows 98 though could be thrown
to the odd virus and certainly wasn't
above occasionally crashing causing you
to lose all your prep
and featured security pop-ups so
annoying that they could hobble even the
most futuristic operating system the
project took off with a shorter name and
a few years later we got our first look
at the xbox which was shown off looking
like a massive silver X it's a good job
they changed it because that design
would have made for a problematic sequel
sequel to the xbox
and leaving Sony scrambling to think up
a blockbuster shooter of its own
that's why Siri doesn't always handle
accent well and can make major mistakes
in noisy chaotic environments return
fire Siri get me yeoman feels okay I'll
lower the shields hey sorry but what if
it also used your phone's camera to
monitor your lips and gather extra
speech data this could filter out
background noise or maybe even help
Syria understand us when we've had one
too many white wine spritzers zero so I
need you know everything you could tell
me about monkeys I need fully I
seriously cannot wait for the robot
uprising suddenly we could Shazam songs
read kindle books or chug a virtual
pints of beer in fact it felt like there
was an app for just about anything no
there do you know where your monarch is
how do you know they're safe what if
they need your help every Englishman
should install where's my Monica always
know where your monarch is with the
where's my mana camp and never be
accused of treason again when the minds
predicted the world would end in 2012 I
wonder if they'd been looking at Apple
maps
number of these would be iPads were
staggering presumably they all ended up
in some landfill in the desert for
future archaeologists to find and use to
make assumptions on how we list the dig
taught as much about life from the
primitive 21st century experts now
believe the fine was intended as an
offering to a great and terrible God
known only as and if the iPad was a
lumbering Tyrannosaurus the Nexus 7 was
the Velociraptor smaller but just as
lethal oh cool a nexus 7 with iOS
becoming more open and interconnected it
feels like Apple is suddenly much more
relaxed which is weird this iphone is
terrible it doesn't make calls a battery
stopped charging I don't know how
but wider its ecosystem the more money
Apple can make and the more valuable
data it collects though we do hope it
doesn't use this irresponsibly in the
future luke westaway your home tells us
you spent the weekend in your underwear
eating cereal straight from the box it's
time for you to invest in a bowl and
trousers get out of Barry's trouser
warehouse 5,000 square feet of trousers
trouser international game has bemoaned
the comparatively high price of Sony's
machine especially in the UK he'll might
think this was cheating but what beats
did was spotted gap in the market
products for people who would never have
considered spending three hundred
dollars on headphones plus it gave me
the courage to launch my own line of
endorse technology
of course knowing they're being
forbidden just made beat scene even
cooler some people are just born to
break the rules
as well as a battling Lee simple its
galaxy note slogan that got the name
stuck in shoppers minds wonder how they
came up with that one it's not a fun
it's not a tablet its Galaxy Note II
right is dancing on yes its Galaxy Note
popularity in the Asian market boosted
sales of big screen phones while
shoppers found themselves unable to go
back to a smaller screen having had a
taste of something larger who would be
like going back to sterlet caviar after
Beluga in other words it was hideously
unequipped for any serious feats of
computing prowess I have the shutdown
codes how do i upload them to the
satellite mainframe don't worry ah okay
there's a small chance these things were
terrible the netbook dream was just that
and I had woken up no oh I just weird
dream about this horrible little lap dog
had these tiny little buttons and these
Tony Fadell who led the ipod's
development was brought in by Apple
having shot the concept of a better mp3
player around to other tech companies
you wouldn't want to be the CEO that
passed on that one well use this ipod
business looks familiar you turned it
down sir separately better off investing
in a clone army oh yes the grand clone
army
in 2002 sales hit 10 million then 42
million in 2005 adjusting for inflation
that should have made apple a grand
total of two thousand dollars in fact
that can't be right two thousand and
then at that point yeah 10 by free I did
the point one but you haven't you know
not know a lot of money access to late
and will never know what kind of
wonderful devices could have been
created had it embrace Android earlier
unless we change history by building a
time machine this is experiment 1 i'm
going back to find out what would have
happened to nokia i'm going
no I'm you from the nightmare android
future you're about to create don't go
back just make this episode using your
imagination instead oh okay yeah cool
as would that famous nokia ringtone
which incidentally comes from a 1902
composition for solo guitar so horrible
and sorted out the mac lineup pairing
strategy down to a simple grid of four
computers for at home or on the go for
personal or business use cus so simple
we should do that for more stuff as a
majority of delegates agree there are
simply too many animals the UN proposes
a new taxonomy it hopes will be less
confusing almost as well as deploying a
giant video feed of Bill Gates looming
over everyone an on-stage gap that
called to mind a futuristic dystopia in
which Microsoft rules the world
gamers worried that having two things to
look at would prove distracting or that
prodding with the stylus would take all
the challenge out of tougher games oh
can I use that you go to use the
joystick like everyone else that's just
cheating
meanwhile the d/s is two screens
microphone and touch interface birth to
slew of excellent adventure games while
non-game software turned the d/s into a
cookbook and a portable library it
seemed like there was nothing it
couldn't do a Nobel Peace Prize a papal
knighthood OBE Oscars Tony's and the
first games console on Mars tell me des
what's next silence is the sleep that
nourishes wisdom I think we can all
learn a lot from D s worth invented the
image dissector tube and was the first
to demonstrate an all-electronic way of
transmitting moving images allegedly
drawing inspiration from the lines left
on a plowed field
television sets were expensive some
countries had only a few hundred viewers
and loads of programs were weird variety
shows full of juggling marionettes and
dancing so I can't we try like a sitcom
or a nature documentary or a Carter heyo
like dancing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
