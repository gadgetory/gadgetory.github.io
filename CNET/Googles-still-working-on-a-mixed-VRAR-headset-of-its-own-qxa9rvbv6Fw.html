Google issues for everything google we
can pack inside of a show now we're all
curious how Google's Android powered a
dream the virtual reality headset will
come together but a report from recode
claims google had been working on an
internal project for a high-end
standalone vr headset that would have
been similar to the oculus rift and HTC
vive the headset reportedly came from
the Google X research lab that was also
working on a separate non android based
operating system for the device now the
report claims the project was axed to
focus on the mobile VR space and their
daydream platform but a follow-up report
from a gadget says that Google is still
working on their own standalone headset
describing it as one that blurs the line
between virtual reality and augmented
reality now engadget reports it will
offer features that are more in line
with what augmented reality systems have
and will not require a computer or phone
to power it now let's be real just put
Minecraft and Pokemon go as launch day
apps and you're good to go you can even
put some of the pieces of the past
together to see where this is going the
Google glass project Google's 300
million dollar investment in the super
secretive and mind-boggling company
magic leap and their recently scrapped
standalone virtual reality headset now
there is no reported release date for
this headset insight and gadget also
suggest that this headset could be the
VR one reported on earlier and it
remains an important part of Google's
future plans all right Android seven
point 0 is officially nougat we know
that and the Developer Preview 5 is the
final one before the official release
becomes available again this is a dev
preview so I suggest you don't use it on
your primary phone factory images can be
found at the Android developers site or
you can enroll in the android beta
program to get the update over-the-air
Android nougat brings split-screen
multitasking a redesigned notifications
pull down with new functionality quick
access to your previous apps and a
customizable night mode and more all
right Android wear two point oh also
gets its second developer preview
release with the biggest addition now
allowing third-party developers to add
risk gestures to their apps the Android
wear preview can only be installed on
the Huawei watch and the
LG watch urbane edition second edition
right now and the alphabet own nest
launched its newest product with the
nest cam outdoor for 199 it's a
weatherproof security camera with 1080p
video and a 130 degree field of view it
also taps into Google's machine learning
and algorithms by being able to
distinguish between a person versus a
dog or a car but no word if it can
distinguish between a Wolverine and a
honey badger the honey badger has been
referred to by the Guinness Book of
World Records as the most fearless
animal in all the animal kingdom it
really doesn't give it and Samsung has
officially announced its unpacked event
will happen on August a second just like
we expected and their invite alludes to
the rumored galaxy note 7 with a 7 in
blue right next to unpack 2016 we
already know way too much about it but
we're finally getting the best look at
the rumored iris scanner with a few
pictures showing the iris scanning
feature set up in action on a note 7 now
the note 7 is expected to feature a 5.7
inch qhd curve Super AMOLED display a 12
megapixel primary camera 5 megapixel
secondary one the latest snapdragon or
Exynos processor six gigs of ram 64 gigs
of internal storage a microSD and an IP
68 dust and water resistance rating so
you don't have to watch the keynote now
and Samsung really has a lot of momentum
going into this keynote and we might
look back at 2016 as samsung's year
after a report by kantar worldpanel says
the combined sales of the galaxy s7 and
s7 edge have surpassed the iphone 6s and
6s plus in the u.s. believe it now in
the second quarter of this year Samsung
made up thirty-seven percent of
smartphone sales with Apple reaching
twenty-nine percent in the US now part
of that is because the two companies
upgrade cycles are now six months apart
but it's still an indicator that Apple's
days of explosive growth have ended
alright that's going to do for this week
you can email us at google issues at
cnet com or tweet me at brian Tong
thanks so much for watching we'll catch
y'all next time for some more of that
