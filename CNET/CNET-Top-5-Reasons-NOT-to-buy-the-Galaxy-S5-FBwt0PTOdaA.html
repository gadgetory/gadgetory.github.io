smartphone from Samsung a manufacturer
who's at the top of their game and a
source of acid reflux for every Apple
employee but just because the s5 the
Samsung's latest and greatest doesn't
mean you should line up to buy one i'm
donald bell and today's top 5 i'm doing
what i do best
poking at the hornet's nest of fanboys
and exploiting it for every penny so
here you go here are five reasons not to
buy the samsung galaxy s5
starting off at number five battery life
the s5 promises 10 hours of web browsing
or 12 hours of video playback and that's
fine but there are already Android
phones out there that blaze past that
our video playback tests of the LG G
flex popped out over 17 hours plus it's
curved which has got to be useful for
something probably at number four the
iPhone 6 oh yes I can already hear you
booing through your screen but seriously
aren't you at least a little bit curious
to see what Apple will do with the
iPhone 6 before making a big phone
purchase by all accounts this is Apple's
ear to make a dramatic design refresh
the iPhone which means it will be months
before Samsung can sell you a cheap
knockoff coming in at number three
Android 5.0 we expect a new version of
Android out of Google i/o this year and
maybe a leaf 5.0 or just 4.5 maybe will
be the rumoured 64-bit version of
Android whatever it is that will be the
thing that Android fans are going to be
salivating for and it remains to be seen
if it will run on the s5 or when an
update will be available really an
updated version of TouchWiz is no
substitute for the latest flavor of
Android at number two the Samsung Galaxy
s4 seriously if you can spot the
difference between the s4 and the s5 you
need to log off the XDA Developers forum
for a minute and admit you have a
problem the s4 is a killer phone you
know it's about to go on sale and the
screen is only smaller by a fraction of
an inch plus the back of this phone
doesn't look like it iridescent band-aid
now before we get to the number one
reason not to buy the Samsung Galaxy s5
let's take a minute to consider some of
the positive
not only begets the fingerprint sensor
of the iPhone 5s but you can actually
use it to buy stuff you get a download
feature that can harness both Wi-Fi and
LTE simultaneously it's dust and water
resistant and it has a built-in heart
rate monitor okay I'm not sure if that
last one is really going to move phones
off the shelf but there's a certain
poetry knowing that the gadget that's
constantly blasting you with radiation
can now tell when your heart stops
beating alright and now the number one
reason not to buy a Samsung Galaxy s5
the Samsung Galaxy Note 4 rumored to
come out this fall this could be the
year you step up to a phablet I mean now
that normal phones are all gigantic the
note isn't the fashion statement it used
to be you get a bigger screen better
battery life and a post Google i/o
release that means it will probably ship
with a significantly updated version of
Android maybe even a 64-bit version
running on a 64-bit processor now that's
a possibility worth waiting for
so there you go five reasons to hold off
on the Samsung Galaxy s5 at least for
now and for more s5 coverage all the
latest smartphone news head over phones
