cnet.com and welcome to road warrior
where we take a look at the hottest
gadgets for life on the go coming up we
have a three pack bluetooth headset
bluetooth car USB car stereo you're
gonna love it first though we have to
take a peek at the Cohen d to music and
video player it has a touchscreen but
Jasmine's not that impressed but you
know I'm not sure how I feel about not
having really any buttons to control it
makes blind control almost impossible
and of course you're going to get a lot
of fingerprints and marks on the screen
there's also concern that you might
damage the screen although this has a
pretty good coating on it probably like
most smart phones and pdas would have it
comes with four gigabytes of storage and
you can add two gigs more with an SD
card okay let's begin our three pack
three pack first Nicole Lee has the LG
hbm 550 bluetooth headset on the front
here is the multifunction button on top
on the top here is the power charger
jack and on site here is the volume
rocker you know very easy to press on
the side here on the back here is
flexible your loop here he also has a
very simple curved speaker here the rest
very comfortably in the year Nicole
mentions it matches well with the LG
chocolate phone but it could also go
with this car the Audi a3 a3 has
multiple options for your cell phone
actually now getting our phone connected
to our Audi a3 is an interesting mix we
have the technology package on this car
which includes bluetooth but there's
also back here in the console evidence
of a dockable connector and sure enough
Audi has a doc solution like Mercedes
you've got a two-headed thing here
Bluetooth and or doc the doc of course
performs better but has to be specific
to your phone it also has a CD player
and the nav systems DVD player plays
mp3s but that's not very convenient you
got to open that compartment up so if
you want more options try the Sony car
stereo that plays music in some ways you
might not expect it's the first that we
have seen that allows users to play
music from generic USB mass storage
devices
as well as its USB functionality this
unit is what sony calls made for ipod
and that means it has one of these an
intelligence ipod dock connector kevin
said the intelligent part means it
transfers the ipods controls right to
the front of the car stereo nifty that's
it for this edition of road warrior I'm
Tom Merritt check back next time for
more gadgets that keep you armed and
dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
