the Zeiss cinemas our oled 3d glasses
earlier this year I reviewed a set of 3d
glasses called the Sony HM zt1 and
thought they were kind of fun but they
lacked portability even though on the
video I cheated a bit and pretended to
get on the subway with them on but these
glasses do fix that problem the Zeiss
cinemas are OLED is a 3d headset that
comes with a battery pack and it comes
without the massive bulk you get a
choice of adapters an HDMI port and an
optional 30 pin iPhone port there is a
volume control and a separate headphone
jack which only works with the iPhone
attachment the headset does come with a
set of detachable earbuds as well the
lenses are individually adjustable which
is great if you don't wear glasses and
the fit is quite comfortable battery
life is also very good with almost 7
hours of use when playing video from an
iPod touch the problem though is this
the performance isn't very good at all
the headphones outright suck with a very
tinny sound and the picture is also
pretty lousy contrasting images bleed
out into blue and red and the 3d effect
when you're watching 3d movies is almost
non-existent the size of the screen is
also equivalent to holding a phone like
this in front of your face which is
actually preferable as it won't generate
as many funny looks on the subway in the
future everyone will probably be wearing
glasses like these and maybe you won't
feel as self-conscious but I do like
being able to see things when I travel
and not be as much of a mugging target
unfortunately this particular future
will not include the Zeiss cinemas on
ohlet's this has been ty Pendlebury for
