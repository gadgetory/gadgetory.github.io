yeah let us never forget bunny Chow
bunny hi Eric although we don't have her
lit up at all she's kind of in this time
just in the dark and like really look I
can only see your eyes all right on this
show an amazing selection of old meets
new I've noticed old meets I like well I
usually like to be but to put the hole
in the microwave do some meet some
vintage cured meats we're gonna we're
gonna take the show in a totally
different direction this is what we
really the burnout is set in no more
technology yeah just cured Italian meat
no uh lots of lots of exciting stuff
where it's like a like a new spin on an
old thing I've noticed like I usually
like to group together the stories under
a couple different themes shirts one
almost everything falls into this
category okay all right starting when it
started a brand-new pinball machine
themed under AC DC is a CDC pinball
machine / jukebox this is a brand-new
machine like this is gonna be released
in 2012 yes right and it really sounds
like in a month by Stern Pinball who
weird they're still making them getting
hey Lou buys them and fix them into
their place of business so that
you can come and play them like well
where do you get where do you play
pinball these days well I have a ball
museum in my city just Alameda yeah and
what about everywhere else well actually
I have to say like with my band like
almost every place i've played be it the
dive bar actually mostly dive bars
uh-huh but they almost always have like
a pinball machine hotel you that was it
yeah was it amazing that you're back to
it now I'm a banquette okay weird one
those back in like I just when we were
setting garbage collector themed pinball
machine this one is way cooler yeah
ac/dc there yeah nice yeah Wow plus no
soba about five thousand dollars to get
this machine but you know you could rent
it out the other thing is is why it's
anyone who would buy it for themselves
is because it is like the man cave
everything right it's pinball yeah ACDC
it's a jukebox right it's a giant
picture of a the dudes face that you can
look at four hours right which all men
crave in their man cave it's got a giant
blinking button right there it says fire
next to it has a jukebox all right all
right so brave I'm craven unless i got a
whole photo gallery up here it's coming
out soon it's there's reason to be
excited i think there's there's our
there's a software equivalent of this so
i can ipad app or something like that
coming i know there's a slayer like a
pinball machine for like the HD pinball
app that's that at an android is metal
dude but that's a little scary it's like
my kids into that app but i won't let
him play that cuz it's just like the
Slayer ones just like grizzled flashing
you know just horror it was about time
he gets into whistle flashing here a
year no you think you think he's a
little just a little bit young he's not
he's never too you're never too young to
be exposed ACDC I don't think the power
of rock anyways anjuna its I'm excited
this next one though this is Bonnie's we
blog these on the same day we did ac/dc
and then its counterpart the beautiful
sculptural sidi bou claims yes tell me
about this so this is um this guy sean
avery he's an artist from australia it's
actually a children's book or a writer
and illustrator but he takes old cds and
makes them into these amazing animal
sculptures these are pretty amazing
falcon yeah so he get he just has
friends and family bring over old cds or
he goes to office building get him and
then he just uses kitchen scissors to
cut him up and he basically uses a
wireframe mesh to like build the the
base and then attaches the cds to him
but he also does circuit birds which is
one that Steven showing there um but he
only makes animals nothing else killer
makes animals only animal because the
way that is rule that is his rule he
said because of the way the cds are cut
and shaped easy it just me yeah just
make furnish the birds it's like that's
a bear hey yeah it's nice i like how the
the color of the CDR film yeah yeah the
CDR he says he has about 15 different
colors and he's also making a massive
dragon for ripley's believe it or not
museum here in the US awesome of course
yeah that's the next evolutionary step
down for that unicorn yes unicorn dragon
what else what else we need the mystical
creatures yeah something else what about
the kobold an owl like the owl from the
robot owl from the crash of titans yeah
yeah out of those that'd be easy yes
seem likely be easy great yeah I could
do that in the weekend crazy this should
be weekend project yeah like I love this
this this this was whatever this bird is
looks dangerous Falcon how can this
falconer have it above your ACDC pinball
machine sure yeah man the man cave is
already coming together little dude
alright um things to bring you out of
the man cave q are coated condoms you
don't necessarily have to
the man cave if I don't know if you need
the condom if no man well it depends on
who you're inviting to the man cave
others like it you don't let women in
the man cave well anyways thank you they
all up you met you only let women of
questionable quality nuts man cave is
like Daddy kid like man cave I think
there's rules like there's rules yeah I
think I think um you you don't want to
miss an opportunity is what I'm saying
well that was that would be I mean if it
happened that would be deadline for the
QR coded condom here yeah these are
being are these being handed out by
Planned Parenthood I believe it is
Seattle area chapter of Planned
Parenthood is doing these key are coded
condoms and a website component of it
where you can can log in and anonymously
post the whereabouts of your recent
sexual encounter sex safe sex encounter
yes and the idea that just promotes the
idea that you know not only are you
sexually active or not as people are
sexually activity random places across
the at all but they're doing it safely
right now if you want to identify
yourself can you do have the option of
doing that like if you want to say this
is me don't bail I just had sex with
this condom well with the condom but I
had the condom on at the time they
actually have a map of every where
Donald bill had sex yeah look at that
that was like this is like over the past
10 years oh oh I figure just this
morning me on your way up hitch up to
work most of your time yeah that daly
city encounter was really unexpected not
at a truck's not know it's more of a
Greyhound bus station sure whatever hey
safely yes that's what matters also it
matters if you have the right code for
your foot tap I heard that matters yeah
I know much about that no I don't need
uh all right
skateboards skateboards have always been
pretty great skateboards are awesome how
to improve the skateboard with modern
technology how about if you control it
with your brain that's right this is a
evolution of the kinect powered
skateboard we saw at CES sort of
awesomeness yes the board of imagination
why can't it be like the board of your
awesome imagination I yeah both those
guys yeah well I hope we got to talk
yeah yeah that'd be nice so apparently
you can control the skateboard i like
this version of it better first of all
I'll say that instead of having to
connect things staring you in the front
your skateboard being this connected
sure sure so why do you like this
version better well you get to wear
badass brain probes share on your face
you don't look so dorky doing this to
this right man things yeah it seems more
of a futuristic thing then like a
connect you know steering and so you
control it's a direction wii controls
directions by leaning right yeah it's
like a regular skin controlling weather
goes forward or stops is blowing your
head you're thinking about future in the
past yeah right serious yeah no
seriously yeah i know that's hot that's
how it works you think I the future you
go forward you think yeah not so far in
a future you slow down yeah they
basically said you pick a point ahead of
you and say I want to go there and think
about how fast you want to go or how
school the idea that is so cool yes it's
it's a mind control skateboard mind
control skateboard yes that's exactly
what it is people I mean I mean why are
we sitting here like calmly discussing
this why aren't we like like freaking
out well what Donell should be like like
vomiting over there just because of the
incredible also disoriented yeah
Bonnie's I should be bleeding to
something I don't know just it just
doesn't seem like we have no the
appropriate reaction to a my control
skateboard you freakin break here like
the part of me that has to rain on the
parade here is that like I don't want to
be thinking that much while I'm
skateboarding yeah or being that aware
of what I'm thinking about what I don't
you don't any when you want a skateboard
you would we we had a discussion about
this offline when you use a skateboard
you want to use your your your body you
you know you want your muscle memory to
take over you don't have to think about
it but the the just a concept of this
seems yeah incredibly cool it seems like
something out of a sci-fi film yes
practicality of it having things that
are that are powered by your brain by
thought yeah pretty cool yeah in theory
sure but I mean if it's a thing like
this is skateboards aren't a broken
technology that needs rescuing by brain
power true Bonnie's like I already heard
this whole disguise i'm reading the time
but when I was like you can say that
like it in in theory it's it's it's not
in theory it's a cool concept but you
know we get to the point where I can I
can I can control it everything in this
room with my mind that's gonna be pretty
cool you know how do we know that we're
not doing it right now well we kind of
are through our mind and into our bodies
know what I mean is like it'sit's I like
the constant I'm sure there's gonna be
some amazing thing that is perfectly
suited for mine for my control agreed I
don't know what it is I I think it's I
don't I figure I a not totally going to
kill you version of my control Technic
right but but might seriously injure you
if you can free people out with it
that's that's the song there's some
value there you can like have your mind
control skateboard attack you know some
would-be burglars or something like that
out at Jerry chat room says to go talk
to a girl a runner down runner runner
girl down chat room would say you wanna
go no I like you I'm gonna I want to run
you awake if you're skating and you see
I like pretty girl and you're you're
like think about the girl near
skateboard just goes there's nothing
girls buy more attractive than brain
probe rainbow yeah I've got some QR code
of condoms and a nearby Greyhound bus
station hahaha let me whisk you away for
a magical adventure actually yeah why
not here's here's how we do this you
tell me not only do we do this is that
we segue to there were those you can
whisk your your loved one away to a
magical fantasy in space but the
playboys space station / sex club I
don't think you said there no no you're
you're you're going right direction
first the Playboy station / sex club
they're not bad they're not saying that
but look if I go to space and if I have
to add the passion all the way to the
station find out there's just a sex club
for a sign I was very disappointed
where's the champagne room oh sorry sir
there's no sex in the champagne room
that my ten thousand dollars back please
cuz it's not what I came here what I
thought no but there are some pretty
amazing artistic renderings of this
Playboy Club in space that you may or
may not want to have sexs they have
warble pleasure domes and I've gotten to
eat him orbital Pleasure Dome I really
mine in la upset band plays week um I
don't I don't I like that the art in the
pic looks awesome very well done like
the girl she looks you know suitably hot
the floating one like yeah the white
with a white skirt on
what's up with the dude who was he
supposed to be representing because you
yeah I know go back to the drawing board
for that stuff that guy I don't want
that guy representing me with his flock
of seagulls hair and his like skin-tight
black suit and he looks like he's 20
joke I don't know it looks we must have
a perfectly normal hair but in zero
gravity it kind of he looks like the
main character from a Japanese RPG I
don't know II just that doesn't do much
for me as far as like appealing to me so
you're saying because of that picture
you I'm not going I don't wanna go I'm
not going and let's say change that
picture okay I'm not giving them my
$15,000 whenever much is gonna cost to
get up to space to have sex with hookers
because this is all it is I mean that's
is a freakin brothel in space but I'm
supporting this but represent it
correctly is what I'm saying like have
that guy had like a beer gut you know
you know he could be wearing like a
flannel shirt or something like that
then it's like oh that's more realistic
that's the that's the guy who's gonna be
up there you know I just love how our
first space colony is going to have
herpes in like 10 minutes we're gonna
colonize space and we're gonna have some
kind of VD outbreak in just a matter of
a month yes the video outbreak of space
also I I haven't been convinced that
zero gravity sex is something that is
really gonna be great that's cuz you've
never tried it I'm just saying like
neither if astronauts have to like poop
into a plastic bag and hash there but
you like you know in order for it to not
fly around everywhere that's yeah that
could get messy what you're saying yeah
and you might come into a space room
like oh this is bro god no and that's
why there's no same with space champagne
room
all right yeah that's not that's not a
pity oh man oh do you have any mouthwash
anyone is this is but you know I do have
I've got Kleenex yes you do yes thanks
thanks to chimp yeah I'm under its own
perfect this Chewbacca infection
Chewbacca's figured out this whole space
space section baka connect sex in space
he's been doing it for what by by
bringing on bringing along his own brand
of Chewbacca themed tissue boxes yeah it
does this is a DIY weekend project what
the fuck's also the it's also the wicked
tissue box we can project I think Oh
wicked the character wicked man um yep
yeah pieces of chewy pieces of chewy man
I I need to talk to Seth about he kind
of is all this madison space sexually
new windows in this is out all right ten
dollars worth of supplies and you can
build your own Chewbacca tissue box for
your adventures be they terrestrial or
on the Playboy to me they look like
they're ready to have sex those little
guys out we'll just get it on okay so
family they look very excited yes that's
all I that's how that's the face I make
to my wife in ready when I'm ready I
understand there in the doorway like
until she wakes up and protect all right
I'm scared you should instead I might
walk out right now all right bringing it
bringing it back down to earth earth
earth earth to this one I just blogged
about yesterday this is the midi-fighter
3d yeah this is a DJ USB controller that
brings together DJs and arcade style
giant buttons yeah for a spastic
interplay of music and technology how do
you like that I like that like a
description the midi-fighter itself as a
DJ control has been around for a few
years which uses these oversized RK
buttons the one that makes what makes
this one unique is that it has a
built-in digital compass and gyroscope
so that you can dial in effects and
volume and whatever kind of midi control
parameters you want by just twisting the
device around and holding a certain
button combination so it's kind of like
it's literally like taking your your
button combo moves of your arcade past
sure and and taking advantage of them so
for your amazing DJ career and also
giving you a chance to shake your DJ
controller around so that so that's all
you need links any blanks all right na
Blake's so if you're d actually djing
you have it all hooked up properly and
also that's all you're controlling
everything just from the buttons you're
not looking at a screen or anything like
that you're not is that that ideas or
let's see it can be I mean if you're if
you could be doing you can use you could
use this in a couple different scenarios
if you're DJing you're going to be
wanting to look at what music you might
be queuing up you know on your laptop
screen and everyone small but then you
can take this out now look the screen
and then cue up different points of the
track remix it kind of
you know juggle the beat around a little
bit but if you're just like an
electronic musician queuing up your own
songs and you could use just use this
and never look at your computer sure
like a which is very cool yeah like it I
don't like what the guys doing he's
looking kinda like a like an a-hole
doing I don't know he's not the guy you
he doesn't that the guy you want to be
looking at at the party right now he
looks like the guy you want to kick out
I like the dubstep though Wow registers
on the side yes i'm in this wobble yeah
um so that's it that's the entire block
of old means noon that's all right great
we got through it ok we are two more
little sections here still here yeah
we're still here this I told you is
gonna be action-packed show today so far
you're not lying sir this is a putting
this under the category of the robach
ellipse or the this is how we're going
to die or holy crap it's a robot because
it always have to be a robot in the show
right oh wait always this one is a
self-assembling robot be courtesy of
like MEMS technology and like an origami
kind of like I should know who limbs
men's is like it's a way of fabricating
circuits and electronics that layers the
circuitry and the actual kind of laser
cut design for it all into one like
little sandwich yeah and then you apply
some voltage to it and suddenly the
little kind of folds pop out it's pretty
detailed go into a go into the form that
you you've selected for this particular
robot can you build these zero no no
this is for like really quakers mass
fabrication of these little particular
robots but mostly this is like a concept
I don't think anyone's really clamoring
for it I think he'll it'll be bought
definitely hit the nail in the head with
the whole robot robot apocalypse yeah
with this one this is this this is
something out of my nightmares right
here well and then there's like these
little parts of like liquid solder that
will
about and make all the joints once
they've been put in place solid uh-huh
and then you just apply some voltage to
it and then at the very honest video you
actually said the wings flap but yeah I
mean can you imagine just like
scattering out you know a handful these
little coin shaped flat discs and then
having the robots to self-assemble and
fly away kill you oh thank you Oh gonna
get in my nose and do things hey guys Oh
God actually it's like a working model
yeah WM atl and the chat room says quite
appropriately choose the form of the
destruct er that's exactly what would
happen let you be like choose it from
the destructors and I would think of
robot bees to kill me and said like oh
god it got in my head why'd you choose
that Eric I don't know just got in there
and then we all perish and I'd cuz that
well what yeah what if they all swarmed
into a state Puft Marshmallow Man after
that well that'd be buddy-buddy I guess
why I can yet yeah I could I could deal
with that could it be all cute oh no
it's really black cloud of robot bees in
the form of a stay puft marshmallow that
bees swarm from spider-man and his
amazing friends member swarm sure it's
war swore so he said swore it was a
bunch of bees or insects that got
together and he performed a huge giant
dude he sits one all right the end is
near yes but at least we got some good
video out of it um this next one is
another connect device girl connected
device yeah the kinect connected
shopping cart yeah this is from the same
dudes who did the board of awesomeness
yeah this is a chaotic moon doozy this
is the thing they were talking about
they're gonna announce this with Whole
Foods in early februari i think uh i
guess it was late now they're just they
just announced it they had this low demo
of this shopping cart that has a Kinect
hooked up to it I guess a window maybe a
windows 8 tablet as well
and it basically follows you around the
UH the grocery store and talk to you and
you know you put items in the cart you
scan them while you're putting them in
the cart and they say stuff like you
really should be eating me yes they say
they only every night you're on a gluten
free free die you should you shouldn't
just has looking at it and maybe sat
back and suggest an alternative but the
funny Azula card like oh like a little
ejector joke out no no well it's it's
best hots well it starts off as little
like you know kind of you know a very
cooperative shopping partner that's
gonna you know it's going to oh yeah
sure I'll just follow you you put
whatever you want in there yeah it's
like you know these like it's like the
beginning of a relationship where
everyone's like oh yeah whatever sure
it's cool then you know after a few
times shopping with it you know it gets
to the point where it's like oh I don't
want I don't want that why'd you put
that yeah watch put it there I don't we
you know I don't eat that you know i
can't eat that why you so mean don't
even know me yeah exactly leaving to a
beeline for the door you have to chase
it right and you have this big you know
this big argument from everyone in the
front of Whole Foods and look I'm sorry
I know I was being as being a jerk I was
Hayley's good food slack just come at
this is finished shopping and looking up
will you embarrassing me you don't even
know me tobei girlfriends you don't know
be they say I should leave you yeah this
is a I I would take the skateboard over
the I would join I like the best part is
that you can check out from the shopping
cart you can basically check out on a
shopping cart and say goodbye to it and
then it as easy as he points out in the
in the in the article it comes sadly you
know it doesn't even say anything just
come on but anyway you can check out
from there you can just leave from there
which is great if you want to back stuff
you can back stuff whatever but that's
the best part we could leave the
convenience yes yeah I can see a way to
do that without having a defense or
check out thing that they have now
sucks i hate it skin she does have like
a salt like a little QR scanner or
whatever on the cart without it talking
to you man yeah sure I don't want to
like have the car to announce everything
that I put inside it I would see a
knowing the first part it prevent me
from getting any kind of QR coated
condoms or yeah you know I'm at the
store or she's like you know the even
not even going that far but just like
large bag of Cheetos you know or you
know hostess are lots of choices means
like large block of tofu it's like oh
god am i this person who's putting
warlock of tofu if you're in hopefuls
areas that's right you would know and
then you know the yogurt cute yoga girls
will be like but I also I as a father to
the scares the crap out of me that I
could have that the cart can just follow
me around with like my kid inside of it
or maybe start tracking someone else yes
i'm not paying attention or if you're
not paying attention to it it go how
long you and and and start chasing you
down the aisles you know what put your
kid just love it he said paid i love it
also it puts a substantial cost on every
shopping cart too right yeah uh for i
don't know i mean it's a windows I don't
know they get subsidized in some way not
sure I'm not craving it i'll give you
the chaotic moon people the mind control
skateboard this same not great you know
this is just like another reason why i
never stepped foot in whole foods step
food all settings the whole foot that's
yeah that's cool that does it for me
what else do we have Eric do we have a
segment from you possibly one that I
love every week it's called
oil o doom mind-control have it here
sure I told you is cool you didn't
believe me at first we found the
practical appropriate application of it
um yeah I got some stuff in keeney
dazzle means i'll do my best then really
excited about that you know it's less
than three months until the Avengers
comes out right guys yeah yeah yes and
tomorrow they are releasing a new
trailer for The Avengers I kind of hate
when they they Telegraph that stuff
because it just makes the anticipation
just that much harder to deal with um
but it's I think it's tomorrow night
they're released a new trailer I'm not
sure was going to be in it but they also
released this incredibly photoshopped
new poster that really does not look
good at all the poll searches if you
could put that up Steven um my poster is
just not I don't know what they were
thinking by releasing this it just you
can tell like each person is from a
completely different scene you know
maybe not even the scene in the movie
probably just like a you know a
promotional oh you know you need to take
pictures for promotional purposes and so
everyone they couldn't get everyone
together so there's you know the
hodgepodge of that well whatever it
still gets the idea across that all
these heroes are together and one stung
will blow up and stuff we'll blow up and
things will fly and they'll be lights
around and stuff and Scarlett Johansson
will wear something tight which is all
multiple need to know yeah about the
movie they're going to see so trailer
tomorrow for yourself sir but well
whatever men women appreciates color
johansson too right so what made a good
point I can't remember who it was i
think was on twitter someone made a good
point about scarlett johansson and how
people forget what a good actress she is
like like there's she's been in some
really she's been that she's had some
really good parts and has acted really
well and they're her kind of hotness
distracts from her acting ability like
when I saw her in Ghost World years ago
I was impressive I mean she got my
man this young 18 year old girl is
really cute but also she's really
natural and she seems authentic and she
she just seems like a natural actor and
I think sometimes her hotness gets in a
way of her people's appreciation of her
acting ability I don't think like
playing an emotionally vacant teenagers
like that heart of a role for an
attractive girl to maybe not maybe not
but since then she's gone on to meteor
roles um where she could actually show
some of her acting chops and I think I
don't think people appreciate it and um
I'm trying to go to name i'll try
thinking the whole time the Woody Allen
film where she's the young girl and the
guys you know engaged or married and he
starts having affair with her and sure
have a got what's called oh don't take
away my ability to hate unattractive
people I don't want you to do that
especially for women because it kind of
it turns you into this is kind of nerd
stereotype we're nerds kind of hate
attractive chicks or kind of you know
says all sad no 84 I have no ill will
toward scarlet oh okay well good good
you shouldn't because she's a fantastic
actress and really hot at the same time
I think send your letters to the stuff
johansson fan club at he Franklin at
cnet com so uh what else do we have
talked about we have um with um was it
last week speaking of fantastic heroes
and sci-fi movies someone um this guy
put up a video of how he would change
Star Wars Episode one to not get better
did you watch watch it watch the whole
thing Bonnie did you watch it it's
pretty it's pretty cool so that's him in
front of his green screen he he's kind
of obnoxious the guy but they make some
good points not that these points have
been made before like red letter media
videos have made these points before but
he kind of you know puts them on to the
12-minute video that's really pretty
cool the main points being and I agree
with all of these points uh is that star
wars episode one did not have a main
character you may think it was Anakin
but actually he doesn't appear until I
40 minutes into the movie and he doesn't
take any real um you know he doesn't
take any action for his he doesn't take
any um any kind of action he kind of
just goes and in the he finds themselves
in situations and he's like oh let's try
spinning that's a good trick and all
that kind of stupid stuff and whatever
so given the film a real main character
which is obi-wan Kenobi making we want
to canobie the real main character which
would bring tension to qui gonn saying
that all I want to train Anakin then
you're gonna have like this tension you
know beyond jealous like oh why you want
to train him you know you're my master
you should be training me while you
train this little kid now whatever also
he says that you shouldn't meet Yoda
right away like in the movie they meet
you right away you don't really build it
up he's exactly like it is it's better
to hear how cool Yoda is and have
everyone talk about my old master yoda
did this net blah blah it kind of builds
up his character in kind of so we
actually do see him it's comes this good
payoff for that and you don't kind of
cheap in the character as we as George
Lucas did with the keratin and he also
said don't that we don't see him fight
which I agree with the oldest should not
be fighting you should I CEO to fight up
I agreed with everything in theory
mm-hmm I I do feel bad though for this
amount of investment in a movie that's
already been made I agree with you know
I think if you like this month at yes
just hurts no it's like yeah I agree
with you on that point but this is good
for someone like this who actually has a
passion for it is gonna be good for him
cuz is this is gonna make you know it's
gonna make waves across the internet get
him some attention excuse me and as we
got a good for the guy who made the
video but yeah he's got like almost
400,000 views yeah so that's that's
great for him I think and people are
into Star Wars and people will will
respond emotionally to Star Wars videos
and Star Wars criticisms and lack of
criticisms that people are still into
stores after in almost 40 years I just
think it's amazing that a piece of art
like this that a lot of people agree
it's disappointing that this much
attention goes to figuring out why it
was disappointing you know usually it's
something if there's a piece of art out
there that is lame if there's an album
that sucks
yeah people just ignore it they say well
it's not great but like to not let it go
that wasn't great and just I mean and
this guy's not alone he's not alone the
other guys out there that feel that way
right guys and girls I'm sure body were
you ever a fan of Sawyer's films like a
big fan as a kid as it can and they do
you really feel that disappointed when
episode 1 come out came out and I as a
kid and you know I was a fan but I
wasn't like I'm more of an avid fan as
an adult sure yeah which was why I think
Star Wars want was more disappointing
yeah yeah because because you just
didn't have that that that that that kid
nostalgia for it but you I guess you
understood them as an adult and we saw
that you when eight tomm again you are
blinded by nostalgia we first saw
episode one is what you're saying no
like you saw it you know man music when
really sucks you know that you get this
guy on is like the James Bond films that
were ruined in the 70s bad actors bad
intentions you know like really good
premises for for James Bond films and
raker yeah you know or for that matter
yeah sure um gosh it'll probably remake
those you know they could they probably
will have to at some point a lot of
ideas were but there's no chance in hell
they're gonna remake all of star wars
episode 12 wall now even I'm sure George
Lucas and put ins will don't ever relate
these I'm connect a heart all of his or
something I don't know um yeah he he
doesn't care what these guys think he
doesn't care he wants to make it he has
his own movie those are his movies hey
what we talked about that we talked that
whole argument like who owns it who
really owns it you know it's like you
have this movie that's very popular but
at the end of the day legally I guess
you know George Lucas knew what
everyone's whether I we're gonna do
whatever we want right now cuz I almost
skipped over this oh yeah thank you guys
