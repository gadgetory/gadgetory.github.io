may be the best honor noise-cancelling
headphone available so I was pretty
stoked when AKG put out a Bluetooth
version of the headphone called the N 60
NC wireless it cost three hundred
dollars which isn't cheap but it is a
very good wireless headphone it's also
compact and folds up nicely into a
travel friendly neoprene carrying case
on your models that sit on top of your
ears on everybody's cup of tea but the
end 60 NC Wireless is about as
comfortable as you can get for this type
of headphone and has effective noise
cancelling this new model does have some
design tweaks to the ear cups with a
little bit thicker padding and a
headband that doesn't clamp down on your
head as tightly which leads to a more
comfortable fit battery life is rated at
up to 15 hours with both bluetooth and
noise canceling engaged the wired n 60
NC sounds very good for a noise
cancelling headphone with clean
well-balanced expansive sound with tight
bass and this model comes with a cord
that makes it wired and allows you to
tap into an in-flight entertainment
system and keep the noise canceling on
in Wireless mode you do lose a touch of
clarity and the headphones don't sound
quite as dynamic but despite that small
drop-off in sound quality this model
does sound impressive for a wireless
noise cancelling headphone full-size
competitors such as the Bose
QuietComfort 35 and sony MDR 1000x are
on par with this model or arguably
offers slightly better sound and are
just as comfortable if not more so so
the real competitive advantage to this
headphone is its compact size I'm not
sure that's quite enough to justify its
$300 price point for some people which
will be hard-pressed to find and on your
wireless noise cancelling headphone
that's better I'm David karna for
