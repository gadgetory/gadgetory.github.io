it and we're taking a first look at the
Hamilton Beach multi blend blender now
for just $40 this blender is pretty good
at what it does it offers basic blending
but not a lot of speed or power so apart
from being very affordable this blender
is actually quite easy to clean it comes
apart pretty easily all the parts are
pretty modular and there aren't many of
them so you can just toss it into the
dishwasher and it's dishwasher safe and
it's also easy to clean my hand you
might not expect for forty dollars
you're gonna get a lot of controls but
this blender actually has variable
speeds as well as physical buttons that
are matched to specific blender tasks so
that's a pretty cool feature now there
are a lot of things I don't like about
this blender right off the bat first of
all its 48 ounce blending jar is on the
small side also it's 700 watt motor is
not very powerful so you're definitely
gonna get more speed and better
performance from another more equipped
device looking at this blender you might
think it is very premium very expensive
but guess what it's not this is actually
not metal this is plastic and the entire
blender is actually made out of plastic
parts so that's not a very premium look
and it doesn't really feel expensive so
that's one thing I definitely don't like
another issue is that the motor is very
slow it's it's not very powerful so
you're not going to get a lot of punch
to this blender at the end of the day I
think the Hamilton Beach multi blend is
fine for basic blending tasks but if you
want a more powerful device you're gonna
have to spend hundreds of dollars more
on a device from say Blendtec or Vitamix
now you can also go with a mid-level
model the KitchenAid 5 speed diamond
which for only hundred fifty dollars
offers a lot more power than this
blender and even better looks you've
just taken a first look at the Hamilton
Beach multi blend blender
