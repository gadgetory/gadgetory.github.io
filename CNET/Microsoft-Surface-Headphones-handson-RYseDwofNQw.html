premium noise-cancelling headphone from
Microsoft but here it is the Microsoft
Surface headphone it's hitting stores
this holiday season for $350 and will be
available in just the color you see here
Microsoft spent three years designing
this headphone and I found it very
comfortable to wear the ear pads are
plush and the headband is nicely tapered
to your head one of the headphones key
features is an integrated dial in each
ear cup you turn the ring on the right
ear cup to adjust volume and the one on
the left to adjust the amount of noise
canceling you want the dial turns really
smoothly and there are technically 13
levels of noise cancelling
additionally the headphone has touch
controls for pausing and playing your
music and skipping tracks forward and
back you can max out the noise canceling
to muffle the outside world or dial it
back to the point of letting sound
around you into the headphones allowing
you safe to talk to a flight attendant
on a plane without taking off your
headphones
I thought the noise cancelling was quite
effective microsoft says the headphone
is equipped with eight microphones
including four beamforming mics that not
only help with making your voice sound
clearer on calls but issuing voice
commands using Microsoft's Cortana
digital voice assistant Cortana is
always on so all you have to do is say
hey Cortana to issue a voice command
there's no button press necessary which
is cool as you'd expect the Microsoft
Surface headphone is designed to work
with Microsoft Surface notebooks but it
also works just fine with other mobile
Bluetooth devices including iOS and
Android devices the headphone is
equipped with Bluetooth 4.2 not the
latest Bluetooth 5.0 but you can connect
multiple devices to it and swap between
them easily it also charges via USB C
which is nice and has a quick charge
feature I thought that headphone sounded
quite good in my limited time with it
according to Microsoft it's got 40
millimeter low distortion free edge
drivers to be able to tweak the sound
via a companion app but the default
sound signature has a little bit of a
presence boost in the treble along with
a little bit of a bass boost to create
that punchy exciting sound that's
typical of a lot of today's headphones
I thought the mid-range sounded clear
and natural battery life is rated at 15
hours which isn't nearly as impressive
as what you get
with competing models however the always
on Cortana feature does eat into battery
life and Microsoft may come up with a
way to eke out more battery life with
future software upgrades ultimately it'd
be better if this headphone costs a
little less than competing models from
Bose and so need to make it a better
value but Microsoft has created a
compelling premium a noise cancelling
headphone that has a couple of a
distinguishing features that make it a
contender in the space I'm David karna
