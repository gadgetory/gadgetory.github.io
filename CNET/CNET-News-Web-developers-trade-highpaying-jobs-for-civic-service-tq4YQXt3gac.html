think every high-tech employee earns a
pretty paycheck many do but Jacob
Solomon isn't one of them he's a
recipient of a fellowship from Code for
America a SAN francisco-based nonprofit
organization often described as a Peace
Corps for geeks Solomon says he was
excited to learn he'd been selected for
the competitive program at least
initially and then the reality set in
that this is a year of public service
and not a year of making money in tech
in San Francisco for the year the
fellows received 35 thousand dollars a
meager amount especially in San
Francisco I applied for really the
opportunity to do meaning for the 28th
fellows chosen form small teams and are
assigned to local governments around the
u.s. to solve challenges Silicon Valley
style let's approach this as a start-up
would let's do this quickly let's do
this in an agile creative innovative way
and not take three or four years to
solve the problem but actually come up
with some ideas that might change the
conversation in three months six months
using web technologies Code for America
has spread Civic innovation from the
gulf coast to the east coast one of the
programs that we did our first year in
city of Boston fellows took about three
months to build this web application
that helped parents find the right
public school for their kids we were
told if it had gone through normal
channels it would have taken two years
and cost about 2 million dollars Solomon
is working with San Francisco's Human
Services Agency to increase enrollment
in benefits such as medical food
assistance and job resources but the
idea of offering no wrong door to human
services so client could walk in to any
building call any phone number and they
would get funneled through the system in
a way that works for them so they end up
in the right programs in the end a tall
order but the fellows are already
prototyping possibilities at this career
center every job posting is printed on
paper Solomon and his team quickly
mocked up this mobile application that
offers online job boards we're getting
what we hope is a product that
significantly increases enrollment
of our clients increases efficiencies
and our internal operations and makes
the client experience better and we're
getting it for about two hundred
thousand dollars a small price to pay
for a big technological leap forward in
San Francisco I'm see me das cnet.com
