del Conte units time to get loaded would
you pay thirty to fifty dollars to watch
the new harry potter movie at home just
a week or two after it debuted in the
theaters i would but i'll do anything
for harry potter movies but i digress
time warner says that it's looking into
this distribution model for new movies
they would be featured in its video on
demand service so you pay that extra
money on your monthly bill this isn't
that much considering that if you take
your family for to see that movie in the
theater it's about that much anyway more
if you buy popcorn sharp is set to debut
3d phones these are Android phones that
would not necessitate the use of 3d
glasses they are the Galapagos 03 sh and
the galapagos 05 sh they would be able
to take advantage of games such as
megaman and ghosts and goblins both
Capcom 3d games that will work with
Android these phones are expected to
launch in Japan in December or January
Google Instant now works on iphone and
android phones this is the google
feature where google predicts what
you're searching for as you type it into
the search bar so if you go to
google.com from your phone's browser and
tap turn on for Google Instant it will
start predicting your search terms as
you enter them in saving you valuable
milliseconds that you will never get
back the european union wants to incite
stronger privacy rules giving users more
control over their information on sites
like Facebook and Google these new
proposed rules would overhaul 15 year
old rules without having read the
entirety of these rules I will go out on
a limb and say that I'm for this if only
because laws governing our online lives
do need to be changed more frequently
than every 15 years old legislation
can't possibly be effective with the
rate at which the internet changes if
agreed upon the new rules would go into
effect next August a new version of
skype is available for Mac users among
the new features is the group calling
service that Windows users have had for
some time now this lets you video chat
in a group of up to four accounts at a
time there is no Facebook integration
however which the Windows version does
have this feature lets you skype call
your Facebook friends and this is good
news for PlayStation owners if you're
cheap like me and don't want to join
PlayStation Network
can still access hulu plus now it just
costs the ten dollars per month and you
can get it outside of the network this
starts next week also you no longer need
an invite to join hulu plus it's open to
all but again for the ten dollars per
month and finally a new browser plug-in
called social media sobriety test com
will help prevent you from drunk posting
on your Facebook page it's a lot like
Google Goggles in mail you have to pass
a test in order for it to allow you to
send incriminating things those are your
headlines for today and that wraps up
your week of getting loaded i will see
you on Monday I'm Natali del Conte for
