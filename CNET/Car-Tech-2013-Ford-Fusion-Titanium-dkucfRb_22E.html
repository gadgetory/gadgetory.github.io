most popular in the u.s. cars like the
Toyota Camry Nissan Altima and Honda
Accord have all gotten recent updates
now Ford comes to the fray with the 2013
fusion let's see how it stacks up
against the competition this Fusion is
the top trim level
this car has a spoiler across the back
we also have these nice exhaust ports
flush with the rear fascia
this car also has it's sort of fastback
roofline that's also pretty popular
these days you see that done a lot of
cards and now we get to where this car
really looks pretty and that's on the
front end and it's nicely contoured hood
we've got these slick headlights and
we've got this grill this grill is
Ford's most recent design element you
see this on the Fiesta and the focus as
well well let's get under the hood and
see what's really important here that
platter is unmistakable this car also
has a turbochargers this is one of
Ford's EcoBoost engines it's a 2-liter
four-cylinder that gets a 240 horsepower
and 270 pound feet of pork
those are great numbers for a midsize
today and that's what you used to get
with the v6 is Ford is doing it with the
four-cylinder that also means 21 miles
per gallon city 32 miles per gallon
highway not fantastic numbers but
certainly better than a v6 and with all
that power as well
in the cabin here we have these two
screens on either side of the
speedometer left screen showing fuel
economy information and basically
driving information the right-hand side
we've got infotainment functions and I
can cycle through with these buttons and
see my phone
navigation entertainment and climate
control settings we also get that same
information on the centre LCD now this
is the touch part of it one thing I've
noticed on this vehicle is the
navigation seems a little more reactive
it's it actually follows the location of
the car better I've had problems with
that on the focus and the c-max where
the GPS antenna doesn't seem to be very
strong and so it takes a little while to
get the location of the car down here
I've had no problem with the system
finding the location of the car we also
have in the system is this eye button
here which has serious travel link so we
get weather sports info ski conditions
we get nearby traffic movie listings
even and fuel prices and fuel prices is
actually one of my favorite because you
can look down this list and it'll show
you all the nearby gas stations with the
price per gallon just hit that setting a
lot of automatically throw it into the
navigation system so you can drive right
to that gas station where you'll get the
cheapest gas one problem that remains
with this touchscreen is that it reacts
really slowly much slower than you
expect from a phone or other electronic
device and that's a problem for Ford
fortunately there's a way around that in
this cars you can use voice command for
just about everything in this car so I
can tap the voice command button play
artists fleet foxes
say your line number or say another goes
one rating artists complete foxes and
also with the Sony system in this high
trim titanium car we get 10 speakers
around the cabin really good sound
really tight well balanced with the Sony
system you get a big volume knob in the
middle and all these little touch
buttons around here that control climate
control and the sources and tuning and
all this sort of stuff on the console
here we have the shifter for a six-speed
Automatic the only choice transmission
with this car it's got the normal PR ND
settings plus there's a sport setting
and I've got manual shift paddles here
on the steering wheel but what this car
really has over all the other mid-size
sedans out there are a lot of driver
assistance features a lot of really
interesting things we got blind spot
monitoring
we've got adaptive cruise control we've
got a lane keeping assistant and we also
have automatic parallel parking and you
don't find those types of features on
other mid-size sedans in this range
trying out the driver assistance
features right now I'm in pretty slow
traffic and I've got the adaptive cruise
control set for 50 miles per hour but
I'm only going about 20 because the car
in front of me is going about 20 and in
all this traffic to my blind spot
monitors are showing when I've got cars
to my left side right now because I'm in
the right lane it'll show a little icon
blinking in the left-hand mirror when
there's a car in my blind spot back here
once I get above about seems like 35 or
40 miles an hour the lane keeping assist
can start to work that's when I see the
little line turn green to show that the
car is recognizing the lanes so that
means if I drift to the side a little
bit this car just actually steered me
back into my lane because I let it drift
off to the right as far as the driving
experience goes in a midsize sedan and I
feel like the car should drive really
easily it should be the kind of car you
kind of jump in and just drive to the
grocery store and to large extent I
think this Ford Fusion accomplishes that
task but I do find there's some turbo
lag with as a engine when I kick down
the accelerator
there's a little moment where it kind of
thinks about it and then it gets going
and you kind of hear that's like
hesitation before it really kicks in
it's not a lot but it's something a
suspension is tuned a little rigid this
is definitely not a soft ride from this
car it's a really relatively smooth ride
but when you go over bumpy bits of the
road you really feel it overall I think
the ride works pretty well I like it
there's some things that interfere
slightly with that midsize sedan
experience such as the turbo lag but
overall it works nicely and the driver
assistance features certainly add a lot
to it let's price at our 2013 Ford
Fusion the titanium level this car costs
thirty thousand two hundred that
includes quite a few options like the
MyFord Touch system and the sony audio
system as well we also have $2,000 for
the all-wheel-drive system one thousand
dollars for a driver assist package that
gets you blind spot monitoring and those
goodies 995 for adaptive cruise control
seven hundred ninety five dollars for
the automatic parking system seven
hundred ninety five dollars for the
navigation system that comes to a total
of thirty five thousand seven hundred
and eighty five dollars which puts this
fully loaded Ford Fusion pretty solidly
in a premium car territory but it's got
a lot of tech that sets it apart from
the mid-size competition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
