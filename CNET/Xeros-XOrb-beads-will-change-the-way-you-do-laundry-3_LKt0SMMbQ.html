here at CES 2018 to completely
revolutionize your laundry routine so
they aren't actually making washing
machines but the technology that they're
debuting here at CES for the first time
is actually what is inside this demo
unit so it is these polymer beads called
eggs or basically the technology is
designed to replace half of the water
that would usually be in a traditional
wash cycle and absorb all of the dirt
and gunk that the water would usually be
removing from your clothes so instead of
having to deal with you know higher
water bill or higher energy usage these
bees are actually supposed to take the
place of that and the technology is
really really unique it's actually all
about how the drum is built so these
polymer beads are reusable and they live
inside the wash drum in a back
compartment that's hidden in the back of
the washer when the wash cycle starts
the polymer beads come out and mix with
about half the water you typically use
they clean the clothes and then the
beads are washed and reused afterwards
and then they go back on to the next
cycle so they're supposed to last for
the whole lifespan of a traditional
appliance to maybe 10 to 15 years again
this is the first time this technology
has been debuted so it's not in retail
markets yet but if it does it would
completely change how laundry has done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
