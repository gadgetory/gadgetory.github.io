be the future that's coming to your home
soon we've got intelligent home systems
and intelligent doorbells Chui is
purporting to be the world's most
intelligent doorbell and what it is is
something a more advanced thing you've
seen out there from competitors like
doorbot it is a monitoring camera and a
speaker built into a device and we've
got a very early prototype look here at
this product that's currently in
crowdfunding this device will sit
outside your home and will be able to
scan your face and actually do facial
recognition and from there
chewie will be able to connect to
automatic lock systems like lockitron to
let you in or it can ping you and let
you know who's at your door and will
also send messages of the person who's
checked in that they've checked in so
you could use it from anywhere from a
home to possibly an office or a public
workspace for keeping records of who's
coming and going this this is going for
$1.99 right now and the idea is to
release this in the fall this is not the
final design but you can see how it
recognizes my face at the push of a
button and adds it to the record that's
here on this computer for the set up it
also works via Wi-Fi as well as a via
hardwired and that is the idea behind
Chui keep an eye out for it or you can
take a look at get Chui calm which has
there our current funding campaign going
on right now
I'm Scott Stein at C net with a very
early look at chewy the intelligent
doorbell</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
