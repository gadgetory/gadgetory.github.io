cars for teens very different images
appear in one's mind's eye depending if
you are the teen in question or the
parent have said well the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety can broker
this one with a new set of
recommendations as of the end of 2015
they have good choices and best choices
with four and five-star crash rating at
both under 10k and under 20k price
levels isay rode in on a sweet spot the
few cars that are at the intersection of
best choice and under 10 grand there are
20 vehicles that make that cut rather
than run through them all here I've got
a link to the list in the show notes for
episode 80 at CNET on cars comm but let
me summarize a few bullets first of all
a lot of Volvo's are out there real safe
and real cheap midsize cars like fusions
and Jettas those are going to be the
lion's share of your best choices and no
pickup minivan or full-sized SUV makes
the cut some chestnuts in terms of car
type high horsepower doesn't make a lot
of sense and frankly young driver the
coolest drivers out there are the ones
who get it done with the least machine
anybody with cash or credit can buy
performance sad but true bigger heavier
vehicles remain safer that flies in the
face of intelligent and efficient design
but physics or physics as long as big
cars and smaller cars collide you kind
of want to be in the bigger car compact
crossovers those are a nice compromise
however and by nothing without
electronic stability control after
airbags and anti-lock brakes this is the
third of the big three that have
fundamentally changed auto safety ESC is
mandatory since model year 2012 and that
alone can quickly shorten your shopping
list some market notes time is on your
side every day you wait more used cars
come on the market with later and better
safety tech pushing down the price of
that tech due to supply and the average
teen car purchase price is a rather
lofty ninety eight hundred dollars says
IIHS the median more reasonable 5300 but
be aware at that price point you might
leave out some recent safety debt
