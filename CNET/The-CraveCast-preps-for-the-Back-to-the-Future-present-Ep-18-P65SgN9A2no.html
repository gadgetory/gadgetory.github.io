your host Eric Mack and I'm live from
the day before the future joining me
from a present day that is quickly
colliding with a paramount past
perception of the future is craves
Amanda Kooser she's live in Albuquerque
and also from the cnet studios in San
Francisco we've got scene thats Sarah
metra Jeff Sparkman Kaitlyn petracca
fits and behind the controls Stephen
Biff Beecham everyone so it's the eve of
back to the future day and we're ready
to welcome any allegedly fictional time
travelers into our midst and if you're
confused back to the future day is
tomorrow Wednesday October 21st 2015
that's the exact day that Marty McFly
vest in tow and company found themselves
in Hill Valley transported to 2015 in
the nineteen eighty nine flick back to
the future part two so the actual date
from the movie is tomorrow we've
literally been preparing for this event
for I mean almost two years now I mean
Amanda started reading posts about it a
couple years ago I think it's not over
two decades of preparation really so on
the show today Kaitlyn is going to coach
us on how to prepare for tomorrow for
the big day and also give us a preview
of a few of her reviews of the leading
products of 2015 from the back from the
future universe and amanda has also got
some things to review of her own I think
he's actually got some back to the
future schwag on hand i know i've got my
glass of or my glass of pepsi perfect
right here sony's will give that another
taste test and then finally we'll have
the conversation that everyone is having
this week about what the movie got right
and what the movie got wrong and we'll
also talk about how we would create our
own back to the future sequel if it were
set 30 years from now
45 so lots of fun if you want to join in
the conversation we've got the YouTube
and livestream chat rooms going you can
watch on livestream com /c net / the
crave cast there's a dozens of people in
that chat room already and also on our
YouTube page which I think Stephen they
can get to it youtube.com slash CNN yes
we're on the front door / youtube
channel so just go to youtube.com slash
cnet and you'll find us yeah awesome and
I'm also keeping an eye on the crave
Twitter feed so if you want to tweet at
us at crave you can get us that way as
well so maybe a Caitlyn why don't you
kick things off you wrote this great
piece on how people can basically
prepare for back to the future day
tomorrow what are your tips to get ready
well I mean honestly it's really a
collection of hey here's what to watch
and here's what to know and here's what
to do um it also kind of touches a
little bit on like things that we've
seen so far that we have so playing more
into everything that you really Amanda
and you over and about so Pepsi perfect
the recently we saw that was at jaws 19
actual trailer came out which was pretty
hilarious and it talks a lot to about
where you can watch and where you can
get the entire trilogy which is
available today now they have like um
all new bonus items and discs and the
blu-ray version has all these special
features and things a lot of it is a lot
of like repeating documentaries and
stuff that we've actually already seen
in other releases for the blu-ray or the
discs or whatever and I think there's
really only one quote unquote all new
bonus disc with like a new short that
features Doc Brown things like restoring
the DeLorean and then a 2009 documentary
about the making of the film and how
it's totally impacted pop culture and
our technology
things nowadays so yeah sounds cool
excellent um and so Amanda you had also
um like I said you've been kind of
keeping an eye on this for a couple
years now you've actually tried out a
lot of the schwag from the movie you
want to give us a rundown of your
experiences in your preparations for the
big day well I've got a couple items
that come from halloweencostumes.com
they have a deal to make some officially
licensed products what corresponds most
interesting has to be so these light up
sweet but they don't socialites we're
not there yet Becky earlier in the year
when the nike designer said they were
working on some placing shoes but I
don't know we're kind of running out of
time here I'm still hoping those who
live here but uh these uh these little
numbers are you know but the light up
part is is probably the coolest factor
about these but they do look pretty good
they look pretty close to the the screen
ones they don't have the Nike logo but
so those are the replica ones right not
been nike yeah these are they likely the
hundred-dollar roughly replicas this is
I think is the early version of the
replica I think they have you know done
some upgrades to the current model
that's available now well it's pretty
sweet the charge up through USB so I
mean the charger shoes by your coffee
it's always kind of experience and of
course there's this number yes but
Stephen you got to try an actual
hoverboard right yeah I got to ride the
Hendo hoverboard at arcs packs and I
think it's Los Gatos and it was pretty
amazing experience I mean you have to be
on a track you know you have to be on a
magnetic or a conductive surface to ride
it but um it was a lot of fun I mean I
would just you go into a spin like a 360
spin you could just spin forever just
keep going for it there's no inertia now
so nothing to stop you but um yeah that
they actually arcs packs just announced
that they're going to release like a
more skateboard friendly version of the
hoverboard tomorrow
oh they're having like a big event and
we really we're trying to get over there
but they said there's no there's no room
or they're all booked what so they're
gonna let us see it like maybe next week
or something so keep your eyes out for
that and now Amanda you you wore those
uh those self-lacing Nikes around for a
while at one point right what was the
reaction like well I wore them for an
entire week everywhere I went I more
than a band practice I wore them out to
you know hear music at a club at night
and inevitably people would always ask
well do they lace themselves high
recognition I mean there's a certain
cool factor just have light up shoes
kind of like the kids have liked but for
adults really great but when people
recognize where they were from I was
always asked do they lace and I had to
admit well no but they glow and that's
that was pretty cool so I did get a lot
of reactions i had grocery store a lot
of just stares to not everybody had the
guts to say anything to me about it but
i did get a lot of looks cuz i wore them
lit up everywhere i went as you would do
so yeah i gotta tell you i knew a guy
who bought them when they went on sale
what was it a few years ago right four
years ago five years ago the nike ones
they actually sold into a guy who bought
them and they were sleek we're amazing
they were stymied next one's gonna be
self-lacing we hope so I've heard rumors
so in preparation for this week and
stuff I've done I've been reading
sneaker blogs with primarily a thing you
guys are they're huge thing they are
huge crazy and so there are rumors and
semi confirmed but not really confirmed
but his from nike and details from nike
that they're working on a new replica a
new version possibly so please I mean
the details are really cloudy and I've
actually heard rumors that's gonna
happen tomorrow because of course it'd
be on the anniversary but I mean why
wouldn't you capitalize look out for
that but I you know the technology might
be feel pretty far away well in a
Caitlyn you're working on a piece for
two
r 0 for 4 back to the future day were
you and some of our colleagues went
through some of the products that are in
the back to the future universe but
maybe didn't actually make it to our
universe and you reviewed them as if you
were in the back to the future universe
right yeah so actually Sarah and I are
working on kind of a compliation of what
if the 2015 that Marty and Doc traveled
to actually was our reality so like what
if back to the future was a documentary
and how would we review those products
yeah in that world and that cannon yeah
there's no internet yeah probably no
cell phones because the movie doesn't
have really anything like what we have
crazy to think about um so how are
people gonna be reading your review my
fast oh yeah or newspaper the newspaper
silly yeah that's true I talk about
alternative I mean they also have those
like a hologram oh yeah yeah Cass center
yeah cuz that's how he found out the
Cubs win the World Series is so it'll
today in the town square popping up for
everyone knew yeah in between a dream
jaws thanks yeah we should just made a
video of it we could have been projected
in hologram oh goodness but yeah so we
chose what six or seven different
products yeah we're still here and we're
kind of writing it as though was in
universe in Cannon and saying well
here's what we liked about the self
air-drying adjustable jacket that Marty
has your dragon is now dry or the Black
&amp;amp; Decker food hydrator yeah which it's
been a fun one it's argue about Oh quite
oh yes so many arguments about how it
works and what kind of food you would
get out of it yeah cuz I mean what would
happen if you put like beef jerky see we
don't know and my argument is like maybe
in this version of the future you have a
dehydrator which people have now and
then this is the opposite of that so
maybe you dehydrate a sandwich you make
and then take it with you to like work
on Monday I there's so many maybe it's
like the New Age version of the freezers
yeah like it'sit's some way
you use it yeah we have like the pasta
that they make and then we put in the
microwave yeah oh yeah they you have a
dehydrator yeah you add something you
put it in the hydrator at work exactly
you go yeah or else you buy your packet
of pizza hut yeah or you know yeah
Donald's hamburger yeah you might go
size version okay and then you take that
with you I can you imagine how this
would impact costco there probably
wouldn't be a costco or that a food
hydrator well but oh how would they sell
the hot dog abuser would buy right you
would buy already 20 pizzas from Pizza
Hut at a time or else you also make your
own so my argument is like maybe in this
version of the future you're also still
making food from scratch like there are
two camps of people those who only eat
out and those are people who actually
make food and then they make a steak and
put it in their dehydrator and then
tutor to I don't sometime later we don't
know how much this like effects of
preservation and then they there's so
many things so there's a lot that we're
taking into consideration like if you
have a hydrator what kind of pizza did
that even make for them so was it chewy
was it crispy was it gummy yeah was it
like microwave pizza cuz I like Ashley
anti microwave pizza so my argument is
maybe this won't give you the stairs a
serious pro crispy pizza eater I am NOT
about that look like a nice team we had
a long discussion I don't know maybe
maybe it rehydrates the food and then
cooks it too I there's so many questions
are you to assist to cook I have so many
questions I Winnie so as you can see we
had Sarah write the video for food I
trainer like I have many opinions as the
foodie we chose her to do that yeah no
but we have those we have a holla max so
actually reviewing the movie technology
and then me what L suburb or lover boy
Wow hoverboard mattel hoverboard the
nike air max
is that we definitely reviewed those but
yeah it should be fun like I said six or
seven and we're gonna have that tomorrow
as part of the big back to the future
stuff yeah nice well I've got one
product from the movie here that isn't
really real except that they made a few
of them I mentioned this earlier so this
is this is the Pepsi perfect from the
movie and they gave out a limited amount
of these at New York comic-con and then
they sent a few to the the nerdier
reporters Amanda Amanda because she's in
where our ups center is and not at the
outskirts like I I do got her for me and
she got to do the taste that's first as
you can see she's tasted something yeah
I've been off tried it yet um I know
that these were selling for like a few
hundred dollars on ebay there briefly
although I think I signed some papers
that would prevent me from selling this
for profit so I'm gonna go ahead okay
yeah first try here you think your eyes
but I wanna know like you gotta go can
you tell us about the packaging first
you guys glass plastic heavy light
Mexico what um it is it is in plastic
and it came I assume we got the same
thing Amanda it came in like kind of a
clear crystal plastic tube thing to make
it look a little more dramatic there's
no one oh wait yeah and I do have this
this is the box it came in oh fun thing
that is really cool I think we might
have just done the first unboxing of
pepsi perfect yeah we should have
planned that better Eric yeah no kidding
um so one thing about this I guess I'd
never paid that much attention to the
nutritional value of the other Pepsi
products has 56 grams of sugar and oh is
it perfect sherry so it's not just like
the the glass Pepsi's I would imagine
something look that up I'm on it yeah of
pepsi's and we're going to code the
bigger oh well yes it is
it is it's not like high fructose corn
syrup is it is it like real sugar no
said it i would get some yeah okay well
it doesn't say cane sugar but this is so
yet 210 calories per bottle 56 grams of
sugar this is what the future how many
ounces is it this is a this is 16 ounces
so it's kind of a big one but it's it's
half a liter yeah when you say it like
that sounds great bigger than 16 ounces
that's half a liter I'm gonna have half
a liter pepsi metrics by the way it
takes on speaking tablespoons of sugar
it tastes like Pepsi what did you think
Amanda oh yeah no it tastes like Pepsi
it's got the real sugar though so it's
not the corn syrup version which is nice
I guess it's funny I don't think I've
had a Pepsi in probably 25 years yeah
but its distinctive it's like tastes
like a Pepsi yep but it's a nice little
packaging you know it's kind of cool to
hold something I saw on film they did a
pretty I think a pretty close
approximation of how it looks in the
movie still looks like a shampoo
container um so I found that a regular
what 12-ounce Pepsi is a hundred and
fifty calories and sugars are 41 so I
guess it really is just a radio Pepsi
yeah that's a can so then like the
turtle mounts yeah I'll can I think like
a typical 20 fluid ounce bottle you
would buy has 69 grams see so you're
yeah you're sitting in the you're
sending the good that's what it really
is just Pepsi so that's pretty crazy so
we're taking the same approach the
obesity epidemic good clearly blase yeah
one thing i should i should say is we
should actually say happy back to the
future day to new zealand and australia
melon 1168 points out in youtube chat
room
your day for New Zealand right yeah
don't tell us how it turns out what's
are you you hate it don't run into
yourself in New Zealand right now you'll
break the world so you know one thing I
thought we should do Stephen to kind of
move into some of our our critiques of
how the future turned out our critique
of the present luke westaway over at the
scene at UK came up with a pretty slick
little little video with the de Warren
do you have that cute up Steven I got it
here we go check this out Alice videos
so awesome
you
it's 2015 and folks we're living in the
future but how does the glittering era
we currently inhabit compared to our
long-held benchmark for technological
progress back to the future part to the
Year 2015 as visited by Marty McFly got
a lot of things right about today's tech
but in other ways our modern
contraptions are way beyond anything we
could have imagined back in the 80s here
are the tech predictions that back to
the future got right and bought it
missed let's start with something the
movie got right the rise of the smart
home Marty's future house is absolutely
packed with gadgets from flat-screen TVs
used for video calls to fingerprint
scanning door locks and voice control
just about everywhere it's dangerous to
enter without lights on right thumb yes
in our own 2015 meanwhile one of the
year's biggest trends has been giving
our own home appliances a similar
high-tech makeover our door lock sense
our presence our thermostats can be
controlled from anywhere our lights
change color our homes can be viewed
remotely while bizarre robots roam our
carpets
hydrate level 4 please admittedly modern
smart homes still can't cook a pizza in
second but there is one more similarity
both McFly's and today's tech enabled
household struggle to make voice control
work yes sirree where's the fruit let me
think about that here's what I found on
the web ville yes sirree where's the
fruit there is one thing missing from
Marty smart home and it's the biggest
problem with the film's vision of the
future where's the internet the internet
has been without a doubt the greatest
tech revolution of the last 25 years
offering instant digital communication
between devices and putting the sum of
human knowledge at our fingertips but in
Marty's 2015 there's no sign that
various gadgets are talking to each
other indeed there's not even a hint of
email with fax machines still the
primary method of communication fax is
one thing but when it comes to a
technology that's been steadily evolving
over the last half a century Back to the
Future proved remarkably prescient
modern television has come a long way
since the medium started gaining
traction in the middle of the last
century and Back to the Future source
several changes coming for one thing our
TVs are flat panels and they're
multifunctional handling all manner of
apps including video chat and while we
don't tend to watch six channels at once
the modern phenomenon of second screen
viewing does divide our attention with
IMDB or reactions on Twitter never far
from our field of vision speaking of
those second screens one thing nobody in
the 80s could have anticipated was the
role that mobile gadgets would play in
our lives the McFly kids of 2015 might
have something resembling Google glass
but it's not as personal or powerful as
a modern smartphone these goggles are
hooked up to a shared telephone line for
goodness sake dan is for you and
speaking of personal tech where are all
the social networks if Marty jr. had
really wanted to avoid Griffin his gang
he could have just checked his Instagram
let's talk about entertainment an area
in which Back to the Future made some
very solid predictions indeed take young
Elijah woods discussed that 80's gaming
involved using your hands and then
consider motion-based advances such as
Microsoft's connects all the
oculus rift and while we're not watching
jaws 19 in hollow max the modern cinema
landscape is dominated by sequels and
franchises man the DeLorean is cool and
indeed Back to the Future did make some
great predictions about innovation in
the automotive industry it just didn't
quite guess where that innovation was
happening our future lacks commercially
available flying vehicles but we've got
self-driving cars looming on the horizon
and fully electric cars are rapidly
gaining traction which is pretty darn
cool don't forget that while the
deloreans time circuits are powered by
the trash consuming mr. fusion the car
itself still ran on gasoline chalk one
up for the non-fictional timeline so all
things considered how accurate was Back
to the Future well bearing in mind the
makers of the movie were probably more
concerned with making an entertaining
film and playing off the Damas a lot of
it is pretty spot-on I mean apart from
the hoverboard of course which let's be
honest is the only thing that any of us
ever really wanted
of course it's always possible but not
to detect the facts the future did
predict exists for cisely because it was
in the film offering humanity a
glittering vision of what to aim for in
fact it's almost as if the film itself
was a message sent back from the future
to our past selves creating multiple
technological timelines this is Harry
that was awesome um so you know one
thing that that thing of facts is being
so prominent in the future it's funny
that doesn't just come up in back to the
future there was a series of ads that
AT&amp;amp;T you guys ever seen these they put
it out in like nineteen ninety-two oh
yeah remember those and I've shown these
um I've done a couple of talks at high
school high school is about the future
and I showed these ads from 92 about
like the vision of the future from 20
years ago and there's a scene where a
guy has a wireless fax machine set up
next to him on the beach he's getting
bad sorry we can't wireless fax machines
but not cell phone I felt like cell
phones yeah it was all those years hey
day Zack yeah but even I'm even prior to
the 80s they were being worked on James
Bond had one in his shoe all right I
don't understand well I think back then
like the fax machine was such an
important development that people
thought like oh my god no one's gonna
ever give up on this it's a fantastic
media and then do you know ten years
later people realized they were kind of
a pain in the ass and so yes I had to
stop so yeah yeah no no cell phones no
internet in both things I mean the
internet didn't exist yet but you know
if you're nerdy enough like some of us
here I mean you know compuserve and BBS
is like this stuff existed it's seen I
mean it seems like it should have been
easy to to see what was going especially
with cell phones cuz you know people
were driving around with big bricks and
so so what do we what do we think I mean
Luke pretty much broke it down there any
other thoughts on what the movie gets
wrong and
and right no cell phones no internet
what else did they miss I think it's
really interesting that and that this is
seen in the Jetsons and many other
examples that so many people thought in
the future that we wouldn't do anything
everything would be done for us and how
much of that has actually shifted
because there's more and more people now
I mean not everyone but a lot of people
want to get back to the roots and do
things the traditional way and so
despite their thighs no movement sure
like this might affect there are plenty
of people who probably want complete
automation of their lives there so
always going to be people who want that
hands-on experience so it's just
interesting to think that that argument
came up a lot in reviewing the Black &amp;amp;
Decker hydrator about like I still want
to make a pizza from scratch with like
an oven even if I could have it the
other way I probably wouldn't want to I
don't know I'm pretty excited I have a
smart home yeah but even if it takes
over like that Disney movie smart house
fully tries to kill you throwback
reference mmm yeah I just thought that
to me is really cool that sure maybe
automate the stuff that no one really
wants to do like the Roomba yeah I want
a room but to vacuum for me cuz I never
want to do that myself ever again but I
still want to do things on my own my own
hands I wanted Mintos my dishes yeah I
was gonna say weird pull the dishwasher
you got a place apartment yeah that's
been it yeah I knew only got like a like
a robotic thing that like picks up the
dish and like washes in no I mean I was
something that loads the dishwasher wash
as it unloads it for me I mean they just
came up with one that folds my laundry
yeah they also came up with like a thing
that's like a washer and a dryer in one
yeah but it won't fold pan back there on
top of ya Japan is that they want to do
anything I respect that Oh what am i
doing wrong yeah I think there's a the
like the assumption is that will make
robots that do things the way that do
things for us of laundry dishwasher
whatever by me isn't it look more likely
that you know what's actually going to
evolve our self washing clothes like the
fabric like you or something like you
 turn jack yeah exactly more
realistic
I don't know I think especially people
who are our futurists or work in
creating science fiction or you know
kind of more I guess run in the same
circles that we do you know what kind of
the minority and what I mean is that
your average person it probably has a
stronger sense of nostalgia in the past
and a connection to the past then their
connection to wanting to see technology
and innovation advance you know like our
bond to the past is actually stronger
than our bond of the future I think
which is why stuff doesn't actually move
forward that fast or look that much
crazier and that's why we have like a
slow food movement so instead of
hydrated pizzas you know yeah I totally
agree with that I also call shenanigans
on that pizza that you see in there
there is no way that you order a half
and half pizza and the the toppings are
that aligned so you can actually see the
the mark where the halves I actually are
and we found the one who has OCD worse
than me just say um it's all I mean how
do we how do we feel about the future
that we got the 2015 that we got
compared to the vision from the movie
which I wrote about this a little bit a
few months ago in a piece for her grave
but you know it seems to me that that
the vision of the movie is actually kind
of terrifying and in that it's like just
a hyperactive version of the 1980s and
everything that was terrible about it
turned up to 11 um yeah I'm so much
happier to be living in this timeline
yeah I was led to believe I would have
more hair in 2015 Ashley and I don't
think anyone really led you to believe
my family no they did yeah because like
you know cuz doc goes when he brings
Marty back to the future he makes a big
deal of like how he talked about he went
to like a rejuvenation clinic and so he
like pulls off the skin still looks okay
but I was thinking you know by 2015
maybe you know they could do something
about people not having hair but it
probably cost a lot because Marty
actually talks to the guy in front of
the Cubbies announcement and that guy is
basically balding that's true so it's
probably
really pricey what sense kind of our
future right now yeah not not in that
way but there are incredibly expensive
cosmetic procedures you can get to make
yourself looking at are completely
frivolous rubber yeah pretty much some
of which are completely speaking of
which doc doc brown ok Doc Brown does
not look that much different Christopher
Lloyd does not look that much different
is that a testament to how well he's
aged or this is a great makeup job they
did 30 years ago porque no los dos yeah
like when you hit your macro level you
just stay the same I think I'm content
with a future we have but I think like
you said you know the immense
advancements haven't really happened and
things are moving both incredibly
rapidly in my opinion because look at
like how far cell phones have come in
the last five to ten years and then yet
like the electric car has been around
for decades and only ever took off two
years recently yeah so it's it's so
interesting to see I grew up watching
The Jetsons and I was like very firmly
believing that like by the time I was 30
which totally not gonna happen but the
time I was 30 that wasn't me my life and
obviously that's not explore alert Sarah
and I heard the young one yeah it's
weird but I'm also not that far away
from 30 so it's not gonna happen anytime
soon but I don't know i mean i think to
the question is that has all of us focus
on back to the future day made us more
aware of our shortcomings in a this
future timeline yeah has made us think
more about and shoot for things like the
hoverboard the hoverboard yeah placing
shoes the self-driving car getting to
that level of automation that we kind of
expected to happen and that stuff's
ramped up just recently cuz i wonder is
that maybe yeah there's that that cog
turning in people's brains of at this
point in history we should have been
there or we were thinking we were gonna
come here I know my eyes just
capitalizing on the marketing
opportunity like Toyota has had a
hydrogen cell cars and like that right
yeah a while in what Southeast Asia and
they're only now tomorrow launching or
using it as the day to quote unquote
launch yeah the US and the UK and things
like that although
have put out some really cool promos for
it it's been pretty awesome yeah but I
mean maybe it's that maybe it's that
we're just more aware of it because
tomorrow is back to the future day yeah
we're looking at it under a microscope
Lee hmm well I mean let's let's not
forget I'm I'm hosting a show that's
broadcast to the world for literally
anyone I mean people can watch this on
their phones in Kenya if they wanted to
and if they had you know the right flash
I and I'm doing so from my office in a
town of 5,000 people in northern New
Mexico with you guys in san francisco
and i mean like so the elements of this
are in the movie but like the broad
capability and power of like what we're
doing like actually couldn't been
conceived of so we're not we're not
doing too bad i mean we have these
amazing tools to solve problems we just
still have the same human flaws that
prevent us from from solving all the
problems we have you know well said um
well what do we think about the future
from here i wrote a piece a couple
months ago that talked about you know if
this movie if another sequel will be to
release net were released now so in
other words if we head back to the
future part 4 where we go from 20 15 to
20 45 what is it what is that future
look like you guys have any thoughts
about that oh my god i really hope we've
already gone to Mars like Leon Mars
please can I go it's all sir I've been
reading the Martian a lot lately you
know like I'm obsessed with that future
but oh goodness I really hope that
self-driving cars are fully spread
across like at least united states are
most the developed world i hope that's a
concrete thing and i wonder if it's just
going to be a lot of the text that we
have now but far more better developed
and far more widespread like i don't
know what do you guys think of like what
would be the next crazy you know nano do
teristics can be like insects eyes
drones everywhere that doing have to
regulate people are gonna be scared of
like three already are kind of but they
also do really cool stuff yeah they do
good things to help deliver direct
medicine inside of your body to specific
targeted cells or they would yeah they
would help very good yeah by utilizing
your own immune system or yeah which
didn't Crichton wrote a book about those
or somebody no I i remember being
slightly younger and like no I was like
trying to come up with a cure for cancer
and like it they're finally starting
like I'm a scientist they're starting to
get the technology that would actually
make that work with like nanobots and
whatnot and it's just interesting like I
don't know I had a thought there and
then it just kind of disappeared sorry
um Michael Gray dream up ray oh yeah
that's it was the book called pray as
always thinking of november two thousand
two and it was nanotechnology and it
explored things like artificial life and
genetic all their algorithms i'm
scanning the wikipedia right now is
basically like nano swarms become
predators and how that affects our
creation of them and marty mcfly's
future you would had to get that
information facts to you so 2045
interestingly is actually one of the
dates that Ray Kurzweil he's the he's
the singularity guy you know yeah he
works for Google now in 2045 is one of
the dates he targets as when he thinks
will have hit the technological
singularity which is when one computer
is powerful enough to equal the power of
like all human brains in otherwise it's
like this huge AI frontier um we're like
when humans just become one with
machines right is that right i mean
that's weird i mean part of it and then
another part of it is like the potential
so if you have computers that are
basically smarter than all of humanity
like that's so um that's such a paradigm
shift that it's like pointless to even
try and predict it's like all
predictions would like break down after
30 years
because we can't really even conceive
for the potential of that so when I when
I wrote the piece predicting what might
happen I I actually didn't focus on
anything beyond 2045 because the
earliest pointless but um yeah I mean I
think that I would see like some kind of
a continuation of kind of the trends
we've seen where technology becomes like
more mobile and ubiquitous but at the
same time it becomes more invisible so
you know in the way that it seems silly
that we're talking about faxes versus
like mobile devices seem so much easier
you carried around your pocket why
wouldn't you think of that I mean I
could see a future where in 30 years it
seems silly the concept of mobile
devices because it's in your contact
lens why would you carry anything around
you know so I know Amanda what do you
think where we headed well I think 2045
I think we'll get a fax machine revival
it'll be it become slow communication
like see this for the Cubs to actually
win the World Series oh my god okay
Sarah and I were talking a lot about
that and how the dates were a little off
right with lady because it cuz they
added the movie was October 21st right
but here we're obviously still in the
championship series and we have reached
the World Series right and would it have
even been mathematically possible yeah
but we weren't able to come up with like
a straight answer because there's at
some point this feels like a season the
seasons have changed and did yeah
because even I think you've been like in
the early 90s the World Series didn't
really go past the beginning of October
right um a good example is it was just
recently the anniversary of the 1989
World Series earthquake this was like
two October 17 right and that was like
Dean it was last Saturday and that was
the third game yeah World Series the
Battle of the bay um and so we were like
well yeah mother I gotten pushed back
they had already you know gone through
all these playoffs we're not even quite
done yet so I wonder wonder where that
might be because there's no just more
baseball team we think something we have
thought about it was probably tianjin
team expand
and adding to the number of games
regular-season game too yeah yeah yeah
yeah just all these little changes that
have been made that push everything back
right give television more airtime yeah
that's totally what it's all about but
it's still a possibility dude it's it's
so possibility for a little while longer
I feel like Back to the Future fans who
don't have a team are now rooting for
the Cubs oh yeah you like baseball root
for the Cubs you guys come on I'm not
anyway Sandra so any final back to the
future thoughts before we sign off no I
just wish they still had the ride at
Universal Studios do they still have the
unit of the Back to the Future ride at
Universal Studios yeah I don't think so
got turned into something else that's my
final thought oh I would also like to
find out that this is what they thought
2015 sunglasses would look like and I
can't even put them on but uh ya know it
really goes to that I can't even see
with him Claudia the music helps the
dive it does it make some woman doesn't
make them any more cool though
unfortunately well I've got a couple of
things coming up that I just wanted to
tease if you're interested in the future
I was at the new worlds space settlement
conference in austin over the weekend so
keep an eye out for from my coverage of
that there's a lot of really interesting
futuristic stuff there Mars bases lunar
bases space solar power I'll be writing
a lot more about that in on crave and
also for the month of November is a
national novel writing month which some
of you might be familiar with nanowrimo
and so on crave we're going to be
attempting to actually crowdsource a
science fiction novel for national novel
writing month so details on that are
going to be coming up later this week
we're going to attempt to structure it
so that we'll have like a google doc or
something else online where you can
actually helped me write a science
fiction novel in a month oh and then it
is set in the future obviously so keep
an eye out for that what else are you
guys working on for CNN for crave that
has to do with the future and the coming
in the future well Sarah and I just have
the little mini reviews tomorrow but I
know that most of cnet has a whole slew
of awesome fun social inventive kind of
like fun little things planned for
tomorrow so I definitely check back on
the site yeah who's gonna be a lot of
content there already is a lot but just

great well you know we're wishing
everyone a happy back to the future day
keep an eye out for a strange kid
wearing a vest like this and maybe a
wacky old man running around your town
there is no real Hill Valley but any
town could really be Hill Valley when
you think about it so that's the grave
cast for today happy back to the future
day if you're in New Zealand in the rest
of you get ready for tomorrow for Sarah
mid trough Caitlin Petrarca votes Amanda
Kooser and Stephen Beecham I'm Eric and
Jeff Sparkman don't man i'm eric
mack and we will catch you next time
