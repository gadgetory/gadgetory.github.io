Morris and it's time to get loaded
Facebook is asking permission to change
its privacy policies from you its users
the changes are meant to make the site's
privacy policy easier to understand it's
basically a rewrite of this document and
an attempt to get rid of the legalese I
find it interesting that facebook asks
first these days so it's not to get the
wrath of the users when it usually does
what it does just go ahead and make
changes as they see fit they've learned
their lesson what do you know skype made
some updates to skype to go which lets
you call any phone through your skype
account this new feature lets you assign
skypes local numbers for up to nine of
your friends even international friends
and then call them directly using these
local numbers so you're charged skype
credits for the calls but you're charged
for local rates not international rates
you can do this from your mobile phone
meaning you don't even need an internet
connection the PlayStation Portable is
now forty dollars cheaper Sony drop the
price of the PSP to make room for the
upcoming next-generation portable which
comes out later this year instead of
costing 170 dollars it now costs 130
dollars the price drop went into effect
on Sunday Groupon launched a version of
its site in china it's called gal pencom
it's a group discount site that's
powered by group on the site will start
offering local deals in Beijing and
Shanghai in March there's a lot of suing
going on around Motorola first off
motorola is suing tivo for patent
infringement in tivos digital video
recorders Motorola is also being sued
for the zoom a company called zoom Corp
is suing over the name the money
transfer company worries that the xoom
tablet will cause brand confusion for
its customers New York Senator Chuck
Schumer is calling for increased
security on major sites like Amazon and
Twitter he wants these sites to default
to HTTPS which is the highly encrypted
version of the websites Schumer worries
that public Wi-Fi networks in places
like coffee shops and bookstores make
the public too vulnerable to hacks he's
calling for websites to default to https
voluntarily a man in Florida was
arrested for in
only computer viruses in whack Amole the
arcade game where you hit stuffed
animals that pop up and down the man
infected over 400 machines so that they
would stop working and need his repair
services he was just assuring his own
job security and a new facebook app lets
you tell someone that you would like to
date them if and when they become single
it's called the waiting room you
literally sign up for someone's waitlist
if they break up with the poor slob that
they're currently with when you sign up
to be in someone's weight room it does
not go in your feed so it's fairly
private and fairly desperate that's your
news of the day I'll see you tomorrow
I'm Natali Morris foreseen it and you
just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
