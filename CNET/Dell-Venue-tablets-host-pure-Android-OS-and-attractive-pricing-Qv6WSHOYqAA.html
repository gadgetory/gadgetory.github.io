with the dell venue 7 &amp;amp; 8 tablets now
this 7 inch and 8 inch pair are pretty
similar and they house identical specs
but they both differ when it comes to
size and cameras both venue 7 and 8
tablets feature a simple unremarkable
design that comes in both black and red
there are bit thicker than comparable
tablets but still managed to feel
lightweight there girthy but it's not
extremely noticeable I really like the
soft the grippy texture on the back that
extends to the rounded edges it makes
the device is pretty comfortable to hold
for long periods of time on the venue
tablets there's a power button
microphone pinhole and headphone jack on
the top edge single speaker on the
bottom microSD card expansion slot on
the bottom right and microUSB port in
volume rocker on the top left edge the
volume marker is rather flush with the
edge of the tablet and doesn't protrude
enough to be easily found without
looking the dell venue 7 houses the
front-facing vga camera and 3 megapixel
rear camera while the venue 8 features a
2 megapixel shooter on the front and a
5-megapixel one in the back despite the
slight upgrade on the 8 inch model the
cameras on both venue Talbots are
underwhelming there are no focus options
and photos come out fuzzy grainy and
dark both venue tablets display a 1280
by 800 pixel resolution which is low in
comparison to today's top tablets but
pretty standard for small budget models
despite this HD video on both of the
tablets is decently sharp with vibrant
color saturation and great viewing
angles the venue 7 and 8 tablets both
ship with a pure version of Android 4.2
point2 and although it's not the latest
version of Android anymore it is a
breath of fresh air to find on a budget
tablet inside the Talbots house a dual
core 2 gigahertz intel atom cpu and
either 16 gigabytes or 32 gigabytes of
internal storage performance was mostly
smooth with no major hiccups aside from
some occasional touchscreen
unresponsiveness
gaming performance was also smooth but
both tablets took a long time to load
larger games the 7th venue starts at 150
and the eight incher starts at 180 those
prices are competitive and attractive
for bargain shoppers and the inclusion
of a pure jelly bean operating system is
refreshing on to no frills tablets for
more information check out my full
review on cnet I'm xiomara Blanco and
this has been the dell venue 7 &amp;amp; 8
tablets</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
