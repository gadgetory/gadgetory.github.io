Qualcomm's headquarters in San Diego
California we're here at a very special
lab this is where Qualcomm tests out
some of the new technology that is going
to put in smartphones and tablets
specifically in the camera Department we
want to augment the sensing capabilities
the vision capabilities add establish
have you can actually take the
environments in a three-dimensional way
so instead of producing a
two-dimensional picture you can produce
a three-dimensional 3d model of what you
are looking at as I move you will see
the portions of the bu are covered by
these bluish tint and as I keep moving
this bluish tint covered more portion of
the scene it's like I'm making a video
detail of the environment that I want to
capture but in this case instead of
being yes a video we are actually coming
up with a three-dimensional model of
what we are looking at everything you
see on the 3d model is physically
accurate you can use different
applications which are yet to be
developed to go and measure the things
that are inside your picture on this one
the first layer of processing of the
information tried to classify what you
are looking at so instead of trying to
do a 3d reconstruction of the whole
environment is simplify the environment
some uses that we are thinking about the
technologies actually in robotics this
flat surface is actually horizontal so I
can actually walk over and these things
are obstacles or objects over my flat
surfaces so I can try to go around them
or even interact with them I can try to
grab them a lot of different levels of
testing it can be done with with a robot
came my phone track when I moved
horizontally of vertical or it rotates
the main characteristics our robot is
repairability we can say I would move
five millimeters and the computer vision
engine to tell us I move five
millimeters computer vision is sort of
on you
technology it's been around for years
but it's up to today that is been able
to work on mobile devices its mobile
devices is incredibly powerful nowadays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
