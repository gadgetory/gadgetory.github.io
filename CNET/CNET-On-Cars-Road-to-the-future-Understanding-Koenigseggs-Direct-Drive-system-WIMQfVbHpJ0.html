car has always put its power out through
a transmission either a three five seven
nine today even a 10 speed gearbox the
reason that gearbox is in there is
because your engines got a relatively
narrow range of rpms and sweet spot for
power yet your car runs at a wide range
of speeds and offers different load
requirements so you broker the
difference with a wide range of gears
but the overall problem with
transmissions as amazing as they've
become is that they remain a crutch
ideally you'd rather not have one for
three very good reasons first of all
transmissions tend to be heavy and
complex they're one of the most
elaborate things in the modern car
secondly they're expensive largely as a
result of being heavy and complex
expensive to put in expensive to fix
that's on you and of course they tend to
introduce some slop and some slow gear
changes now that's been improved a lot
lately but wouldn't it be nice to take
all this out so Koenigsegg says we can
do that because of two interesting
trends in power trains one we have
higher rpm high-performance engines and
turbos give them better lower end grunt
secondly we have very torquey electric
motors that are quite well proven these
days electric motors have all their
torque from zero on up and can spin in a
wide range of rpm put it all together
here and maybe your powertrain has a
wide enough range of rpms and abilities
to deliver power that it doesn't need
gears to help
let's take a look at how they lay that
out here's the spine of the car you can
see you've got a vertical battery pack
up in between the seats basically that
brings you down to the turbocharged gas
engine which has an electric motor on
the back side turning the crank when it
needs to - more electric motors are back
here that go out to your drive shaft to
your rear wheels and in the middle there
is a fluid coupler and a final drive
here's how that looks in a schematic
this fluid coupler and final drive do
two important things if you didn't have
that you'd have basically the automotive
equivalent of a fixie a fixed-gear
machine and that's not really useful in
the practical world and then you do have
a gearbox of sorts a reduction gear it's
a single speed transmission that never
changes so it's very simple it's
basically a free two ones of the gas
engine can run at the higher rpms which
is its sweet spot without having to
drive the car at like 60 to 180 miles an
hour all the time
now I'm not saying that this is the
beyond end-all in future drive trains we
may never see this again but it does
underline two important trends engines
that have more grunt because of
Augmented intakes from turbos and
superchargers and electric motors that
can pick up the slack where gas engines
don't do so well put it all together
you've got a spectrum of power that
maybe doesn't need to change gears one
