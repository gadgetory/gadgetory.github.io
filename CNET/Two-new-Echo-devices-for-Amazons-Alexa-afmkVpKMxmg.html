Francisco where Alexis set to get some
new hardware this month first up is the
Amazon tap which is a new
battery-powered echo like device you'll
press this button here to activate it
and then talk to Alexa like you do with
the echo you can ask it to play music or
any of the skills that you already use
with Alexa Amazon tells us that the
battery lasts about nine hours or three
weeks of standby time and that when you
need to recharge you'll just pop it back
into the included dock that'll sell for
a hundred and twenty nine dollars next
up is the $90 echo dot just looks like
the top part of the Amazon echo that's
sawed off and that's basically what it
is it's those same far-field microphones
that can hear you from across the room
without the same speaker body that echo
has the cool thing about this is that
you can connect it with your own
speakers using the line out port in the
back or over Bluetooth and that'll give
you the voice controls of Alexa to power
any speaker that you like in your home
you'll find the same connected home
controls you get with that go in the new
tap and dot devices so here if I press
this button turn the lights on okay you
see the lamp comes right on one last
thing to watch for this month is the new
thermostat API that's coming to Amazon's
Alexa family of devices with it you'll
be able to control popular smart
thermostats from Honeywell Insteon and
nest alongside the Eco b3 that means
you'll be able to talk to any of these
devices and ask Alexa to turn the
temperature up and down regardless of
what kind of smart thermostat you're
actually using all in all a busy day for
Amazon lots of new stuff we'll see how
it plays out when the devices arrived by
the end of March</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
