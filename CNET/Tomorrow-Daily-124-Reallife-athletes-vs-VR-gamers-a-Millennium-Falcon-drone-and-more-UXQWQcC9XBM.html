ability to play guitar with a very
special prosthetic virtual reality takes
on real life in a competition of skiing
who's gonna win I'll let you know all
right and and judging this particular
book by it's cover means it will get
upset and lock you out of reading it so
you should never judge a book by it's
cover sera daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley skele Jeremy's always kill
anonymous whoo sorry really what are you
coffee days this coffee date yesterday's
energy drink day good yep Kelly's it's
chock full o'Nuts kills blood stream is
actually just caffeine I didn't sleep
last night as somehow again not
surprised I like when this shows high
energy so I'm hoping I'm hoping this you
don't sleep this brings you pleasure
rather than pay yeah okay by the end of
the show you're not just like cringing
and agony yeah um we have a lot to talk
about today some really good stuff in VR
that book is totally weird so let's not
waste any more time let's hit the
headlines so this morning I really
wanted a feel-good story like right out
of the gate I was like I'm in the mood
for some feel good I need to get hit in
the fields in a good way and I did by
finding this story about a Colombian kid
named Diego corridor and he was actually
a born without a right hand so just know
right hand but the cool thing is is that
he wants to learn to play guitar and
this group named 3d gluc worked with him
to build a custom prosthetic it didn't
he say he was like it doesn't have to
look like a hand it doesn't have to be
like very soon all I want to do is play
guitar so it's a super simple hand with
a shield for the forearm and you can see
they itched in lincoln park because
that's one of his favorite bands and
then there's a pair of pincers that hold
a pic and he's actually really good wow
yeah like it we I think you can hear
play free bird free bird so it's pretty
yet so which is this like a 3d printed
hanger yeah so um that this is actually
the part that makes me feel the best I
mean I'm really excited for this kid
it's crazy it says Linkin Park oh he's
like super good at like doing Linkin
Park's gonna sue him right um so uh
there are nonprofits out there and I I
had sort of like peripheral II known
about this but like I didn't dig into it
as much as I did today because I was so
fascinated by the story there's much of
nonprofits out there including like this
group that are dedicated to providing
super simple prosthetics to people for
that costs around or under fifty dollars
so this is one of those prosthetics it
costs less than it costs about fifty
bucks to make oh it is pretty odd that's
that's almost nothing yeah it's like I
mean it's all things consider is very
inexpensive to be able to get this kid
his dream of playing the guitar and he's
actually really good like he's really
good so um I just think this is such a
cool like feel-good story and it's
really amazing how just a couple years
ago before these sort of this like
explosion of 3d printing this would have
been completely out of the question you
have to go to go to a doctor you're
gonna fitted for it it's like very
specific process where they measure you
and they have to make this custom mold
and all this other stuff and now it's
like okay well let's just get your
measurements and then scan you like with
a camera and then we just have as the 3d
printer printed out and it fits your arm
and you can play guitar that's just
really really is uplifting maybe I feel
so good feel so good it was like it was
a warm fuzzy for for the day to start
out with that's right old that they're
allowing him to enjoy his one of his
favorite art forms yeah very cool hello
yeah great good great pic nice job thank
you I hope everybody feels really good
about about science and life in general
after that story because I know I did
nice so tell me about VR cuz this sounds
okay so this is a crazy be our story
coming out of the wearable technology
conference and this is made by 3d live
because they are showing off a this this
whole competitive sport of skiing yeah
where two people are skiing in VR live
and one of them is actually out there
skiing and they're competing against
each other in both a virtual and real
space so what is happening here is we
have two people in a virtual reality
simulation and one guy actually out
there skiing but they're all
competitively skiing against each other
what's even crazier is that they're in
three different countries Oh at the same
time ones in Munich ones in Greece and
once in Austria and the guy in Austria
is actually skiing and that's the video
in the bottom right right yes oh it's
for you the tech in a second okay the
real guy skiing is Vegard angin or he
likes to be called dr. V so here's the
tech here's how it's how it's working
all right okay and then I'll tell you
who won okay all right so the people
that are back at home skiing looking
ridiculous insane are using their
emotions are being read by a kinect and
they're using a playstation wakeboard
and then using an oculus rift to see the
mountain and and you know see what's
going on all right so that's what each
of the the people that are at home are
doing dr. V on the other hand who's
actually out there skiing is wearing
this sort of like a our headset to kind
of show him where the virtual reality
people are and also kind of recording
what he's seeing right now so so that's
all of the tech that's all of what's
going on but very impressive uh yeah
they were showing this alive so that's
crazy so so here's here's the results
all right yes I wish many more
head-to-head match okay okay the first
one dr. V destroyed the outcome oak dumb
but then it looks like the VR people
kind of figured out what's going on and
so they ended up winning the rest of the
three rounds that's his own virtual
reality wins but come on dr. V pointed
out that uh when he's going down the
hill there's actually some people for
the hill so he needs to be careful and
also he has to worry about death yes and
actual like you know kids being on so
yeah there you go um okay so what is the
goal is illegal the goal is to have
people indoors and outdoors both
participating in real activity even if
someone can actually make it there she
loved it so I mean I guess let's mix
it's reality they think that people lead
but like I guess if you know my grandma
can't like make it to the the ski so i
can still dominate her no think about it
so like how cool would it be if you
entered a contest to race against a crop
country an Olympic skier and for your
country and then you could go and like
do this like sponsored by whatever
company and then you would go and they
would have the room set up where you
could ski even if you didn't know how to
ski totally do it you can race against
like your idol you can play golf against
tiger woods or you could like do all
kinds of stuff yeah that was 300 swing
scale I think it's time for us to move
to them yeah I think it's I think we're
gonna have to just no more mulligan
thank you sorry normal again that's
that's pretty cool again it's really
cool to see VR and a are both kind of
meet each other in the middle and see
what we can do with that ya know there's
always seems to be a focus on one or the
other and all those also live yeah don't
forget that this guy was live and see
for my different countries I can't
believe that's the future is like that
sort of thing can you imagine a
cross-platform hololens like the skier
with hololens like watching people and
then also seeing like his actual view
and then having the people to oculus
rift and it's good it's gonna get crazy
everybody it's gonna get crazy it
already is crazy it already is crazy
which it's gonna that means it's gonna
be so good when it's actually consumer
ready so that brings us to our hashtag
of the day which is TD vs vs vs I like I
like vs yes that's good um and that we
want you to say what activity would you
compete in if there was a real life
versus virtual reality Olympics and
would you be doing it in real life or
would you be doing it via VR headset
okay you go first ok I think for me I
would be I would love to do virgin this
is gonna sound insane but I feel like I
was really good at operation frog when I
was a kid do you remember that game it
was a science game anyway i'm a nerd ok
operation frog no I me not being nice
fun frog he dissected a frog like in the
game so you learned about Lee biology oh
um I feel like I would want to do like a
surgery game like with actual surgeons
like as an Olympic sport so wait
somebody's getting cut up so you can
have fun no I wouldn't it could be like
a cadaver you just like donate your body
to the Olympics that's all I'm saying
kill just like I told you it was weird I
told you a super weak that's great well
I would be saying we'd be like rounding
up people and being like hey
I've been randomly selected to get to
get chopped up today and I'm going to be
chopping up anybody I'm not a
professional you give me a virtual body
that's the whole point okay how do I
just spin the bottle he's kind of
competitive yeah there's a gold medalist
and spin the bottle it's cale anonymous
guys somebody make a gif of that face
cuz that was brilliant that's me kissing
that's how I kiss well alright so cool
i'm sure that's not a gold medal fake
kissy face i'm sorry but yeah so that's
the that's the hashtag TD vs TV vs. um
very cool alright I gotta tell you about
this book cuz I saw this and I was like
what and then I looked at the video and
laughed so much because it's the crits
insane so you've all heard the old adage
never judge a book by it's cover like
hey you did an old woman voice you have
to um because it's usually something
your mom says um not your mom
specifically my mom says like this
electively all of our mantra uh this is
an experimental project by an Amsterdam
creative agency called more and this
project is called the cover that judges
you so this is that's an actual book
cover that's not a art and that's a
screen inside the cover if you're
listening at home there's a book with a
C on it and then a face and it's like
this crazy little face and the guy right
now is making faces and he came at it
with a smiley face and it wouldn't open
and now notice his face scanned green
and NC he smiled again and it locked it
relocked itself so the whole point of
this is that it's a this is the
technology in this book is insane it's a
real book you can open it and look
through it it's got like a whole bunch
of an I'll explain what's in the book in
a second but there's a screen inside the
cover the book the screen is in the
shape of a human face and there's face
tracking at the top of the actual book
itself um and when you walk up to it it
scans your face it does face tracking
and if you come at the book like come at
me book um if you come at the book with
any kind of prejudgment so if you're
really happy or if you're like not
thrilled about it or if you're just you
know you're crying I don't know why
you'd be crying at this book but for
whatever reason if you come at this book
and you've already pre
judge the contents of it and the book
can scam that in your facial expressions
it will continue to stay locked and will
not let you in says it judges you
judging your cover what's inside your
thing what's inside the book okay so
what's inside is it's a collective of
creative work that has already been
judged and and won awards so the whole
point of this is that will this is work
that doesn't need to be judged again by
you because it's already been judged so
it's in this boat code and you should
come at it non-judgmentally and that's
how you can get in a look oh okay which
is--what's-- your the book again
creative works creative work so probably
photography that's you know maybe some
point on what the fact that it's kind of
like Thank You script and it's very long
it's really in there yet you kind of
want to smile for that book hello see
him that I won't let you in you better
just come straight at it without any
judge with us you're smiling at it which
means you've already judged that you
like it see I can't even be happy that
I'm about to read a book you've
prejudged you prejudge you can't do that
all right go come at it with straight
face and then it'll unlock and then he
could smile all you want actually don't
smile in flight the cover because then
it'll relock itself you just open and
then you could smell that's good but
that's what it is in the books for sale
or just that one book I don't think
they're gonna be selling it but it's a
it's a prized an experimental project
the Amsterdam agency is called more
m.o.r.e so I'm sure if you looked up on
Google if you google the cover that
judges you you can see the video which
is like the funniest thing it's so
bizarre like the face on there and it's
like scans the guy it's so weird but I
love it a page mastered you remember
that yeah totally Macaulay Culkin it up
Christopher Lloyd will do this that's
tag Macaulay Culkin it up pagemaster guy
love that movie yeah Christopher Lloyd
is the pagemaster right uh yes he's the
voice for ducky I forgot the other
voices but there was also some other
that's a great movie I liked books a lot
as a kid so I was like that was my jam
the Pagemaster cool story that's pretty
awesome anyway we're going to go watch
the pagemaster and we'll be right back
after a short break we have an awesome
mod squad this week and of course your
user feedback and our photog refer today
so don't clog late tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show oh man that
pagemaster is great so good I don't get
it so there's another so once you go
into the dream there's another level and
then you go into another dream level and
then there's another one and then
there's the bottom one that's the
prequel it's at the pagemaster a little
known fact prequel to inception actually
what's direct prequel I don't know what
inception I'm yeah Cobb is Macaulay
Culkin as an adult just FYI that's
that's what we want to know that he
grows up oh okay uh well you guys it's
uh it's Wednesday which means it's time
for another round of Mod Squad which
again working on a graphic but I promise
we'll get you one um I saw this this
morning and and may have squealed like
like I made an audible noise that was
unlike me because it was so delightful
so check this out here we have video of
this this comes from a French RC
enthusiast who calls himself Olivier and
it is a millennium falcon drone is a
drone made to look like the Millennium
fella don't get cocky kid self-build
drone but even knew this was inevitable
come on I mean as I said all right this
is awesome but the thing I like the most
about these super-bright LEDs on the
back and on the front like SuperDuper
brights if you're just listening to this
year boom you are missing out so much
right now so um he said he didn't spend
a whole lot to build the Millennium
Falcon sort of like skin or the the
little casing that the drone is held in
so really the cost was in the drone
itself and then he said that this
particular drone which is pretty cool
goes about 60 kilometers an hour without
that casing but with it on it it's about
half it's about 30 kilometers now yes it
was pretty heavy so it doesn't go light
speed is what you're telling me
unfortunately with the casing it cannot
do the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs
I'm sorry there are actually
instructions he has instructions on
building her own which is pretty cool of
him I think it's pretty awesome that
he's willing to share all of his all of
his build secrets but you can go over to
RC groups com which is where he
originally posted it I saw it over on
reddit so I and I saw I was just like
this is amazing that's pretty fantastic
I want to see somebody make like the the
the x-wings he's doing dream it already
working on a TIE fighter he had a
sketchup of a TIE fighter with the drone
like to eat rotors and it's all look
amazing I'm so excited about that too
okay now I want to see them fight I know
I want to I want to see the Death Star
listen Olivier if you're watching figure
out a way to make them shoot like nerf
projectiles at each other and just see
if you could have them fight cuz that
would be really cool I would really like
that awesome I would enjoy that but yeah
Riley finally a drone that if I saw
flying there wouldn't be annoyed Bob or
scared by yeah I'm so excited you like
hey I'll just be screaming I love you
it's all good see Chewie oh yeah wearing
my I'm wearing my he's gonna drop the
phaser he's gonna drop the bass well
sure well that's convenient how super
convenient um yeah so nice work Olivier
