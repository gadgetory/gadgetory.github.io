I'm Bridget Carey this is your CNET
update the day after Halloween stores
are ready to push out Christmas in full
force decking the aisles with
merchandise but can you believe that on
the first day of November we already are
seen sales for Black Friday Black Friday
has swallowed up all of November into a
black hole of shopping madness online
tech retailer Newegg is calling it Black
November offering discounts on nine
hundred products throughout the month
Amazon launched Black Friday deals on
Sunday but are these deals any good so
far it's a bit average nothing too
exciting in tech no matter what you get
do your research before assuming Amazon
has given you the best sale for example
Amazon is advertising this Nikon d3300
digital SLR as a deal for about four
hundred and fifty dollars a savings of
two hundred bucks
but guess what go on Nikon site and it's
offered at the same price so that's not
a deal at all and as Amazon beefs up
Black Friday promotions it's also
shutting down to other parts of its
business Amazon is killing the daily
deal site Amazon Local which was just
like Groupon Amazon is also
discontinuing the Amazon register it was
a little $10 credit card reader that
plugged into a smartphone or tablet so
that small businesses can process
payments it was just like square but
Amazon had lower transaction fees than
Square let's switch gears to Microsoft
if you're a Windows user and you have
not yet upgraded to Windows 10 listen
closely
your computer may automatically upgrade
to Windows 10 without you whine it -
unless you change your settings
beginning next year Windows 10 will be
marked as a recommended Windows Update
and if your computer is set to
automatically install any update that's
labeled recommended you're gonna find
Windows 10 on your machine you can turn
off automatic updates to be in more
control to do it manually and if it does
happen you can revert to your old system
within one month but still it's pushy
and in news outside of planet Earth NASA
is celebrating 15 years of humans living
in space aboard the International Space
Station on November 2nd in the year 2000
the first three-man crew move
and some 220 people have been there
since and speaking of space there's
another new voyage about to take place
CBS says it's working on a new Star Trek
television show to premiere in 2017 set
phasers to excited beam me down to
planet hype this would air 50 years
after the original Star Trek series
boldly debuted on TV CBS is the parent
company of CNET's so I had a little
message for the bosses please just aim
to make this more like the next
generation and less like enterprise okay
okay that's it for this tech news update
there's more at sina.com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey
