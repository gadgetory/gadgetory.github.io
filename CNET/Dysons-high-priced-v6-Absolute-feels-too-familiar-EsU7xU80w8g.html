I'm taking a look at the dyson v-6
absolute it's their brand-new stick vac
designed to push the envelope by being
almost exactly the same as every other
one of their stick backs what you get
when you do decide to shell out for the
absolute are a bunch of extra
attachments a HEPA filter which is the
very first one in a Dyson stick vac and
this brand new fluffy looking vacuum
head the idea of this cute little fuzzy
vacuum is to avoid scratching your
hardwood floors with spinning bristles
it also because it keeps contact with
the floor with the thing that rotates
should be able to keep a seal to help
you get up the fine particles while also
being able to grab and fling large
particles into the compartment but the
experience of using it isn't quite as
seamless as I'd hoped
pet hair clings to this thing it also
does fling a lot of those large
particles into the vacuum compartment
but when we test it on Cheerios the
particles that it missed actually flung
in front of the vacuum and off to the
side I have a few more nitpicks
the battery life isn't great and there's
no way to tell how much battery you have
the filter falls out a little too easily
when you tilt the thing and I really
wish the Dyson stick facts could stand
on their own but overall it's easy to
use it's fine everything clicks into
place securely you're holding most of
the weight in your hand so it's very
maneuverable it's a good stick back it
just costs too much I don't see any
reason to pay twice as much for this guy
when you can get the same engine for
half and the Hoover Linx still bests the
numbers on this on both pet hair and
Cheerios and at 180 dollars you're
practically cutting the cost in half
again at $600 it needs to be more than a
stick vac and it's not so for the time
being I recommend spending either $300
on the dyson v-6
or spending 180 dollars on the hoover
linx for more please be sure to check
out my full review on cnet.com forcing
it with the dyson v-6
it's absolute I'm Andru govern</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
