manufacturers right now trying to make
luxurious android phones that don't cost
the earth its latest efforts are these
is the idol 4 and the idol 4s so let's
take a look at the idol thought to start
with it's the less powerful of the two
it has a 1080p 5.2 inch display inside
there's an octa-core processor on the
back that's a 13 megapixel camera on the
front you get an 8 megapixel snapper
it's running Android m and it's backed
up by 2 gigabytes of RAM and if you
swipe to the left here you can see some
Alcatel software it's called OneTouch
stream and it basically pulls in
information from various different apps
to try and give you information you need
before you request it it's a little bit
like Google now now Alcatel has dropped
the OneTouch name from his product so
this isn't the OneTouch Idol 4 it's just
the Alcatel Idol 4 but I'm told that it
will still be keeping that OneTouch
moniker for its software so that's the
for now there's also the 4s now this one
is a little bit of an upgrade in several
respects to begin with it has a slightly
higher resolution sensor on the camera
that's a 16 megapixel rear facing camera
the front-facing camera on the 4s there
is an 8 megapixel affair just like you'd
get on the idol 4 it's got a snappier
tip and a slightly bigger battery as
well
the biggest difference though is the
screen now this is a higher resolution
2560 by 1440 pixels Ellucian the actual
screen itself is slightly bigger but the
main change comes with the screen
technology the screens using AMOLED
which means that the colors are a little
bit more vibrant it's a much better
looking screen
finally a fun feature on both phones is
this it's called the boom key it's this
mechanical Hardware button and it's kind
of context-sensitive so it'll do
different things depending on what app
you're in for example if you just on the
home screen and you press it then it'll
show you some fun animated weather
effects if you press it while you're in
the gallery then it'll make a little
montage it'll do other things as well
I'm also told but if you listen you to
music and you press the button it'll
boost the bass these phones are going to
be available starting in Europe from the
summer for much more check out cnet.com
