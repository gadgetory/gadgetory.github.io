little boxy code maybe you've even
scanned one those funky little squares
called QR codes short for quick response
it's a hyperlink that takes you and your
smartphone from a magazine or street
sign to a web page so here's how it
works your smartphone takes a picture of
the code and then responds to an
embedded link that takes you to a new
location some were on the web just
exactly where those hidden lines of code
are taking you you really don't know a
worst-case scenario is you install piece
of software on your phone that does a
variety of things one anything that you
send is an email or you type into your
phone is then transmitted to the hacker
it's become the go-to gadget for
marketing especially in real estate it's
very inexpensive to implement and has a
high potential return on that low
investment and about 75% of retailers
now offer customers this 2d technology
according to a recent study some
companies are setting up secure data
centers to prevent hackers from
infecting QR codes but is the public
really all that concerned no I don't and
I don't want I think I'm also afraid of
let's link to my phone and what kind of
information that company will get from
the scanning their short code gives you
information about products and
businesses or companies and I mean it is
kind of scary the technology so like
fast but I think it's kind of cool
whether you've used a QR code link or
not these are the things to keep in mind
before you give it a go if you see a
random sticker on the side of a street
don't scan it if you see something on a
random door don't just scan it you know
it don't don't play with strangers while
there have been no reported cases of QR
code hack attacks according to the US
government it's not a matter of if but
