omen gaming laptop we called it high
performance gaming - the flashy design
for 2017 HP is dropping a rethought
outline of its own in gaming systems
updated with the flashy design its omen
15 and 17 laptops get power upgrades
bringing the high-end configuration of
the 15-inch into VR capable territory
the keyboards have been tuned for gaming
in both the layout and the ability to
better accept input from simultaneous
unrelated key presses and HP's upgraded
their audio cooling and display options
as well on the 17-inch the company
brought back the optical drive option an
edit of 120 Hertz display choice but
while they look a little flashy er than
before you're still stuck with the
read-only backlighting and if you've
already got one of HP's compatible
premium late model laptops or all in
ones there's now a big docking station
called the omen accelerator which
accommodates a graphics card and more
storage to up your game and remember the
VR backpack PC prototype from last year
now it's ready to be a real product but
redefined is the omen compact gaming
desktop it sits in a docking station for
use as a PC but then you can pluck it
out strap it to your back with a headset
and you're ready for VR the more
conventional Omen desktop has been
completely overhauled with the blinged
out gaming design tool free expansion
with eBay for easily swapping hard
drives and both pcs are optimized
overclocking for both core I and Ryze
and processors there's also new pair of
monitors to attach to your systems one's
a 25-inch free sync compatible HD
resolution monitor with 144 Hertz
refresh and a 27-inch g-sync compatible
quad HD which goes up to 165 Hertz
finally it's omen accessories have been
improved to match with a new mechanical
keyboard mouse with removable weights to
optimize the feel and a headset
redesigned for more comfort and better
audio quality
