6.3 and since I'm such a phablet fan you
know I've been waiting to get my hands
on this thing 6.3 does refer to the
screen size alright let's see
Hey
pick this guy out of here wow that is a
big fun they're using millimeters it's
their primary measurement just just as a
trivia note six point three inches is
one hundred and fifty nine point seven
millimeters good to know
all right see what else is in the box
the instruction booklet headphones it's
kind of a nice touch since it's media
friendly charging cable international
power brick oh hey oh it's an adapter
yeah I I actually thought that it might
come with an SD card can you imagine how
useful that would be it's just a micro
SD adapter and then a little four gig
micro SD card all right and our big big
battery let's get it all ready I will
say even though it is obviously
ginormous
it feels really lightweight and the
battery isn't that much heavier so I
think it's gonna be pretty nice in the
hand the SIM card slot is right on top
of the micro SD card slot that's kind of
an awkward stacking but I guess if you
did this all at once when you very first
got the phone maybe you wouldn't have to
mess with it again but it would be kind
of annoying if you wanted to swap out
your tsimko your SD card for something
bigger because four gigs is not very
much get our battery in maybe because
it's so big this plastic case feels even
flimsier than usual it feels like paper
and power
that's a big display big display
familiar Samsung startup screen and
while I go through some of this setup
let's do the specs the mega has a full
HD 6.3 inch TFT display the resolution
is 1280 by 720 it runs Android 4.2 jelly
bean it has a dual-core 1.7 gigahertz
processor the battery is good size 3200
milliamp hours samsung says that should
run up to 17 hours obviously we'll have
to test that because that stream is
gonna eat up some battery memory is 16
gigabytes ports include microSD
expandable up to 64 gigabytes USB 2.0
and a micro SIM slot the micro SD card
slot is on top of the micro sim port and
the way they're stacked is a little bit
awkward connectivity wise the mega comes
packed with bluetooth Wi-Fi and a GPS
the 6.3 version comes with LTE but the
five point eight inch mega does not have
an LTE support the camera in the galaxy
mega is a slightly disappointing 8
megapixels but there are a ton of
built-in photo modes that are really fun
there are filters and you can even apply
them when you're taking video and then
there are various camera modes like the
ability to automatically choose the best
photo from a bunch continuous shooting
the best face and something called
beauty face and the front-facing camera
is 2 megapixels the unlocked price is a
pretty high 798 dollars most of that
cost of course goes to the screen now a
couple key differences between the plain
old galaxy line or in this case the
galaxy mega lines and the s4 line even
though it has some of those Samsung only
features like smart stay air view S beam
and of course the somewhat annoying
TouchWiz interface it doesn't have some
of those premium s4 features like the
eye scrolling and the gesture controls
personally I find those to be a little
bit of a novelty anyway so I don't think
you'll miss them this phone is really
all about this
display so if you're really into
watching a lot of media on your phone
and you don't mind carrying something
around this size it's a pretty nice oh I
mean you know me I like it you spoke
what I don't understand is what Samsung
is going to do
no three we're still expecting that to
be enough so if six point three or five
point eight inches seems to be a little
too much for you if I want to hold out
to get they announce their five and a
half to be the perfect size
we stopped opposite all right for our
