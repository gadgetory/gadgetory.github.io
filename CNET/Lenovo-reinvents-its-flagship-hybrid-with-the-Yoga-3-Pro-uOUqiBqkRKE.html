computer gift choice for 2014 it's the
Lenovo yoga 3 pro that's the third
iteration of the yoga pro serious and
unlike those first two models this one
redesigns that iconic yoga image instead
of having two connection points it has a
long slim strip of what looks like watch
band material nutlets it opened very
smoothly let's it stay firmly in any
position you put it in and also allows
the system to be thinner than the older
versions you get a lot of high-end
extras in the yogurt repro it's got a
big 3200 x 800 resolution touchscreen
that's something you're not going to
find a lot of other slim similar size 13
inch laptops let's say notably beat
macbook air this is kind of a similar
size to that you also get Intel's new
core m processor that's a new
high-performance low-power processor
that lets you run a system completely
fanless which lets you make it of course
the thinner and lighter and this guy is
about 2.6 pounds very light the hand the
original yoga pro was about 3.4 pounds
still light but nothing compared to this
so what can you do with a yoga unlike a
lot of other hybrid laptops this has a
very good laptop form factor doesn't
mess with that traditional clam shell
shape too much but you take the screen
and you can fold it all the way back 180
degrees flat they can keep going to
about 300 degrees you end up with sort
of a kiosk mode and then if you keep
going back full 360 degrees you end up
with a hybrid style tablet now in this
mode you can pick it up and carry it
like a slight we still got the keyboard
a touchpad on the bottom but they're
deactivated so you don't accidentally
click on anything and then when you're
ready you just flip it back to clamshell
mode making it a very flexible system
you can use at home at the office in the
coffee shop it starts at twelve ninety
nine a premium price but not
outrageously expensive I'm van Ackerman
and that is the Lenovo yoga 3 promo</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
