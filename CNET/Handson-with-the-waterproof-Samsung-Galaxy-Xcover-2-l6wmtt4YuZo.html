at Mobile World Congress taking a look
at the Samsung Galaxy Xcover to the X
cover to its a four inch samsung galaxy
phone but unlike some of these other
models it's designed to be a bit more
rugged so you can see it's it's got a
bit of a fatter shape it's got these
these handy little grip marks down the
side and it's waterproof to a depth of 3
feet I'm not going to be enough for you
to take it diving or go swimming but it
will at least keep it safe from rain or
dropping it in a lovely muddy puddle you
can see on the front it's got these big
chunky buttons to make it easier to hit
perhaps if you're wearing if you're
wearing gloves and the the textured back
should make it a bit easier to keep hold
of you can see a 5 megapixel camera with
an LED flash on the back as well on the
front is the 4 inch screen and that has
a resolution of 800 x 480 pixels which
is it's far from the yet 1080p levels
we're seeing on a lot of new smartphones
but it you know it looks reasonably
sharp also seems quite bright and bold
so it should be good enough for a bit of
web browsing and a bit of youtube if you
get bored turning on a 1 gigahertz
dual-core processor which isn't up to
the standards of some of the quad-core
chip something are bringing out in these
other phones but it should keep the
essentials ticking along nicely it's
running on android 4.1 point to a jelly
bean and if you've used any of samsung
mobiles before then the interface will
be immediately familiar so no surprises
there there's been no word on pricing
yet but we're expecting it to land
sometime in quarter to so expect to hear
a bit more on how much it'll cost near
of a time I'm Andrew Hoyle 50 net and
this is a samsung galaxy xcover 2
