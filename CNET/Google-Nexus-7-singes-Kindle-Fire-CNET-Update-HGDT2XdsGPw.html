google news today parachutes not
required I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update it's time to say hello
to the kindle fires greatest nemesis
Google's 7 inch Galaxy Nexus tablet
called the Nexus 7 it's a much more
powerful tablet than the kindle fire and
the barnes noble nook and you can get it
for the low price of 200 bucks the Nexus
will have the latest 4.1 jelly bean
Android operating system it'll have a
quad-core processor and it's got a
front-facing camera because really how
often would use a back camera on a
tablet but you gotta have more than just
hardware to compete with the kindle so
google also unveiled new features in its
entertainment hub Google Play now you
can purchase movies and television shows
and you can get magazine issues or
subscriptions the Nexus 7 is taking
pre-orders now in the Google Play Store
and it'll ship in mid-july but don't
expect Amazon you to sit back and take
this quietly in the next month we could
see the Amazon fire drop its price and
some reports say a new Kindle Fire 2
will come out at the end of July and it
too could have a camera so back to the
new android 4.1 jelly bean system it'll
be faster with improved notifications
and widgets there's also something
called google now it gives advice for
your life based on your location
calendar and your habits if you have an
appointment on your calendar it'll tell
you when to leave your house based on
the route traffic and mode of
transportation you usually take it even
updates you on your favorite sports
teams without you telling it what your
favorite sports teams are it just knows
what they are based on what you usually
search for kind of weird right siri got
a bit of a slap to ask your phone a
question it'll pull up the results very
fast and speak the answer back to you
google also is coming out with a home
theater device to take on Apple TV it's
a sphere called the Nexus Q and it taps
into the content stored in your Google
Play cloud so it can stream the audio
and the video you own to your home
theater and your friends can also play
the DJ and pull in songs from their
accounts it's a bit more pricey than you
might expect it's three hundred dollars
and it also ships in mid-july and if you
are curious about Google's Project Glass
well the camera enabled headset
stole the show stuntman wearing the
glasses live-streamed a google hangout
video while skydiving even to the roof
of the event and stunt bikers zoomed
across the roof and some rappel down the
side of a building all this to show how
a wearable computer can add some new
perspectives it's still a prototype but
people at the event could sign up to be
the first to pre order them for fifteen
hundred dollars to help shape the
development of the eyewear the first
versions will ship next year that's your
tech news update for today for more on
