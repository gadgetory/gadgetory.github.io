that is it's a speaker that you can put
your TV on top of it's based on the
cheaper SRT 1000 and if there's two key
features the other lacks an HDMI input
and Yamahas own music caster streaming
system this speak offers excellent semi
surround thanks to these beam drivers
which reflects sounds off your sidewalls
the sound base also offers two small
subwoofers but you can add a separate
subwoofer if you crave even bigger
explosions with the HDMI input the
Yamaha will decode both DTS and Dolby
soundtracks which makes it a good match
for a blu-ray player as I mentioned the
speaker comes with music cast which is a
decent proprietary multi-room system
which is also compatible with Yamahas
new receivers it doesn't offer many
services though compared to Sonos or
some of its other competitors the base
itself is designed to hold screens up to
55 inches in size but as TVs get bigger
they tend to feature stands that are
incompatible with this kind of compact
speaker legs on each end for example so
as a result you'd probably be buying
this for a smaller TV like a 46 inch for
example but these rarely cost more than
$600 would you spend more on a TV
speaker than the TV itself
well the SRT 1500 sounds really good
with movies in particular unless you
really want HDMI inputs I'd suggest
getting the cheaper SRT 1000 and saving
200 bucks instead it sounds identical
