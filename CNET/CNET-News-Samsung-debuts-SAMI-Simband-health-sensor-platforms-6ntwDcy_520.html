first open reference sensor module and
this is sim band a modular reference
platform for wearable health sensors the
symbol sensor module incorporates some
of the most advanced sensing
technologies from Samsung and our
partners around the globe all integrated
into an open sensor module designed as
an open platform it includes open
software open hardware and even open
mechanical design behind this ultra-thin
light whist platform is in serious mouth
you can see the watch pretty ordinary so
let's dive a little bit deeper this is
the dashboard my key health science all
tracked continuously today we collect
how trade heart rate variability and
temperature some of our partners are
working on spo2 and co2 and again all of
the holes are tracked continuously what
do we mean by continuously that's what
we mean by continuously not just the
final 76 how to beat per minute but the
detailed sign used in the calculation
you consider different PPG wavelengths
going from two different locations to
compensate for location red and blue to
look at different layers of their list
and as Julian mentioned we have designed
the ECG electrode into the clasp you can
see my finger on it and while I'm
touching it the blood pulse arrival time
is calculated and epoxy for the blood
pressure is displayed on the top this is
the shuttle battery it clips into simple
magnetically charging the device while
you are wearing it
typically when you wanna sleep smart yet
simple approach that opens the door to
truly continuous health monitoring 24
hours a day seven days a week no need to
ever take it off I wake up put it back
in the charger in the end it's all about
data it's a lot of data that is coming
out of the sim band a lot a lot of data
a massive amount of very complex diverse
data this is why we have created a
platform where it's all collected in its
original format
a place where smart people can come to
study the data in details to search for
correlation observed interactions and
develop novel useful algorithms that's
Sammy the Samsung architecture for
multimodal interaction Sam is a data
broker that makes it easy to collect any
kind of data
it's agnostic real-time or historical
discrete or continuous from all the
devices of your life even there are
coming from devices and sensors we don't
know anything about today so what if we
could use this kind of predictive
analytics in our video life
we asked feel like you to work with
stick track another creative started to
develop this concept in the simple way
this is what we are seeing now the
general when the score right now RAM is
at 75 that means 75% of its full
potential
if you look at the data of the past few
days you are saying that Ram is a view
he's having a challenging week I really
wonder why but Saturday was still his
best day he was at 97% of his potential
on that day he finally enjoyed dinner
with his family and he got to play with
the kids and to spend time with them
that or improved his well-being
here is the dashboard showing his data
from multiple devices in context with
real-time analysis from this data you
can start to get recommendations to
improve his willness this suggestion
could be a list of physical activities
personal coaching goal-setting this is a
small data which is the key to
understanding the voice of the body</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
