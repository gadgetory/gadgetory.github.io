with cell phones we love using them but
hate the way others use them I lived in
New York City and people just walk and
talk and you're like I'm trying to get
to work people text and drive and they
don't look at the road even at stop
signs or stoplights cuz they're not
paying attention at all when you try and
talk to someone and they are looking out
their phone the whole time a new
Microsoft poll found that the top mobile
usage pet peeves included checking
phone's constantly talking loudly not
silencing phones when appropriate using
phones during face-to-face conversations
and delaying traffic by using phones but
some of our cellphone activities like
pocket dialing losing our cellphones and
sharing our locations are also
jeopardizing our safety in today's day
and age we keep just as much valuable
personal information on the phone as we
do on our home computer in some
instances even more subtle so when
you're not using a pin you're
potentially losing your phone you could
be opening yourself up to risk and what
we call digital damage according to the
study men are technically better at
protecting their phones while women are
more socially savvy at how they share
their personal information men are
better at using the pin the personal
identification number or locking the
phone with a password and women on the
other hand are a little bit better at
things like knowing what kind of
information they're sharing online to
limit the digital damage lock your phone
limit sharing your location details and
defend your phone against malware by
updating apps in San Francisco I'm Kara
