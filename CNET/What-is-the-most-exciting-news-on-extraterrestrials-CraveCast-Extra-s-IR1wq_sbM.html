guys what is the most exciting news and
extraterrestrials that we already here
hi Barry
you know I think the most exciting news
about extraterrestrials is there are a
lot of places they could live you know
just 20 years ago I I mentioned
Barnard's star which bakwin said he
began in the early 60s there was
speculation that you know there might be
a planet here there was some evidence
that were wobbling of the planet it
turns out that wasn't the case but it
was it's only been in the last 20 years
that we have been able to detect planets
around other stars so I think that is
the the huge discovery there's a lot of
real estate out there that is
potentially inhabitable and and now
we're realizing that earth-like planets
are all over the place as well at least
super Earths the other exciting thing is
over the last 20-30 years we've come to
better understand the extremes that life
can live on here on earth you know I'm
talking extremes of life like the the
frozen tundra of the Arctic hydrothermal
vents acid hot springs the core of
nuclear reactors so once life takes hold
it can survive and so it's looking all
in all the more likely that our notion
of what's a habitable world may need to
be expanded to take into account the
variety of environments that
extraterrestrial life could proliferate
in so it seems like everything that
we're learning in the past decades
is more and more support that there
could be alien life out there some
people think it's already being here I
haven't seen it so I mean to see the
evidence you're a psychologist right
yeah and so you know I wonder like what
given the work you're doing like what do
you think what's your relationship with
like human imagination because when
you're dealing it seems like when you're
dealing with the you know SETI the
imagination takes you and all these kind
of like fantastical places you know like
Star Trek 2 conspiracy theories about
area 51 and it seems like the
imagination takes you in so many places
that can distract from the reality of
the actual science but at the same time
that imagination can keep people
interested on the work that you do do
you either okay yeah I think so you're
right imagination is great for engaging
people there's something imaginative
about the prospects of their being
intelligence out there but if you look
at the nature of how science happens
that imagination plays an important role
at the earliest stages as well
so that you know imagination doesn't
prove anything
but imagination is great at generating
ideas you know but would Kepler was
trying to understand the motions of the
planets he had this idea about the
planets are moving within these perfect
geometrical solid proportions it turned
out it was wrong but it was really
helpful to start thinking about things
so I think the the what you need to
always keep in mind is imagination is
great for generating hypotheses and then
you got to test those hypotheses and
that's where some concrete data comes
out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
