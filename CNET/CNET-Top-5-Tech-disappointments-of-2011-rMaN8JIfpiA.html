except for the stuff that sucked
I'm Brian Cooley with the top 5
disappointing technologies of 2011 tech
that only a fanboy could love let's get
started number 5
electric cars from the Chevy Volts mist
sales targets and some shrill safety
headlines to the Nissan Leafs slowing
sales to Morgan Stanley's having of its
projections for all Evie is going up to
like 2025 this was the year that Evie is
hit and bounced off much of the blame
belongs to a flood of cheap fuel
efficient 4 cylinder gas and diesel
engine cars that people actually
understand
Eevee's may still have their day in the
Sun to be sure it just won't be on a
calendar that has to 0 1 1 written on
number 4
iCloud now give Apple credit for moving
the concept of cloud into the mainstream
but iCloud is kind of an odd bird in
that cloud almost a cynically tweaked
situation to sell devices and too often
I hear the same two comments from iOS 5
users either I disinterested I haven't
set it up yet or a mystified get it I
suspect it'll be a slow burn like iTunes
was initially but for 2011 it goes on
this list number 3
Chromebooks this idea looks so visionary
when it first came out a radical refresh
of the portable computer that relied on
a browser running over Linux with the
web and apps replacing stale bloaty
software and those always full hard
drives but so far the early models do
too little and do it really poorly and
in the process they make this kind of
tacit argument that you need another
device in between your tablet and your
notebook that's a subdivision of tech
none of us were looking to move into
back to the drawing board
number 2 3d TV Emmett Lee given 3d TV
long enough the glasses the proprietary
than not much to watch the who the hell
cares
sure 3d TV sales grew a lot
20:11 but that's because more TVs came
with it built-in whether you wanted it
or not at the very least the 3d TV
industry has to move to cheap passive
Universal glasses in 2012 in the
meantime you can worry less about this
tech in the year ahead as I suspect a
lot of TV companies might do as well the
number one tech dud of 2011 was the
Motorola Xoom well and the HP TouchPad
and the blackberry playbook and
basically all the big non iPad tablets
that combined will be lucky to match a
tenth of iPad sales Motorola Xoom
launched at an insulting 899 70 bucks
above the top iPad the PlayBook the
first tablet without integrated email
from blackberry they're all about email
and HP's touch pad Fiasco was enough to
help derail the entire company as we
wrapped 2011 the conventional wisdom is
that the high end of the tablet market
is apples to lose and Android has to be
happy with the small cheap end of the
market considering that those very big
iPad killers were 2011 s number one most
promising new tech there's enough crow
for leftovers all week for more top
fives like this head over to top-5
