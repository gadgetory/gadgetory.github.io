headlines Goodyear announced a new
concept of some tires that'll let you
drive in any direction
Eagle 360 is the name of the project and
Goodyear showed it off at the Geneva
Auto Show earlier this week these tires
don't use axles for suspension instead
they would use magnetic levitation to
stay in place the tire design also
includes a surface that would adjust to
various elements and the spherical
design would help cars avoid sliding on
ice or other hazardous materials sensors
on the tires would register where and
even send Road information to other cars
this design is just a concept right now
but Goodyear thinks this could make
self-driving cars even safer yeah I love
that part in the video where the parking
lot all all the cars in the parking
lot yeah
because they can be so cool so cool over
at MIT like we we like to check in with
MIT three students have designed a
flying drone that may help artists
collaborate with each other even over
long distances flying pantograph is a
fresh take on an older concept
pantographs have actually been used
since the 1600s to duplicate drawings
and now these MIT fluid interfaces group
students have substituted a drone into
that process it uses a boring old pen
and paper for the artists motion
tracking technology and a whiteboard
marker strapped on to the drone to
replicate your art the drawings can be
scaled up or down to the user's
specification and flying pantographs
creators say this concept could lead to
collaborations that were previously
impossible examples of those
collaborations include helping disabled
people create art using eye on face
tracking not on like eye conductor and
also letting artists who are far away
from each other work on the same piece
at the same time that's so rad there's a
there's a fantasy novel called the
Stormlight archive and in it these
characters create a psychic link and one
writes something and the other miles
away writes it it's like that but real
science facts
fiction mush mush what do you want to
talk about I think these are both
awesome stories I could really go either
way I'm fascinated by the tire's feel
like we got to go tires yeah it seems
like a thing where that seems so
futuristic you guys seems like it's
something that might actually have be
useful for everyday people like in your
car so there's a lot more details about
how the tires would work and what
they're made of and all that stuff I
think we could really get into that well
we will deep dive into that on
tomorrow's episode so come back and
check that out you can also participate
in our conversation by using our hashtag
ATD yeah if you shout at us with hey TD
you can talk about any of the stories
that we've discussed on this week's
short episodes and then if we like your
tweets we will bring them in to the long
episode and talk about you right in
front of your faces that'll show yeah

chromatographer today is Gatlin who sent
in this photo with their Droid RAZR MAXX
also a really cool name yeah gallon I
like that gallon rights hello this is a
picture of my front yard at sunset that
I took with my Droid RAZR MAXX also I'm
