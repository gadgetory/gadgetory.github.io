Bridget Carey on cnet com and it's time
to get loaded amazon was already winning
the war in eBook readers especially with
the alluring new line of Kindle models
at low prices and now amazon just kicked
it up another notch amazon prime members
can borrow digital books one book a
month for free and there's no due date
amazon prime though isn't free at
seventy nine dollars a year that gets
users free two-day shipping on purchases
and access to amazon's free instant
streaming video library now add to that
access to more than 5000 free ebooks to
borrow with more than 100 of them New
York Times bestsellers the new nook
color is supposed to be announced on
Monday so we'll have to see how barnes
noble will compete yesterday we reported
on a proposal in congress that's aiming
to charge state sales tax to online
retailers the reason being it could be
an unfair advantage when overstock.com
or amazon.com doesn't charge state taxes
amazon said they don't mind but ebay is
fighting hard against it now the law
would only impact businesses that make
more than 500 thousand dollars in annual
revenues so here's the catch for eBay
sellers say you're a mom and pop shop
with an actual brick-and-mortar store
that meets that revenue even if you just
sell a couple things on ebay you still
have to deal with handling sales taxes
for multiple states and that's a burden
ebay says small business owners
shouldn't have to deal with in mobile
news Apple emitted there is a battery
life problem in devices running iOS 5
due to a software issue and updates
going to be pushed out over the next few
weeks that addresses the complaints that
the battery just drains too fast
developers already have access to the
update as of yesterday but while you
iphone users wait for that update check
out an innovative scanning app from
amazon called flow just released
yesterday it uses the camera to identify
an item and pops up a link to buy it it
also saves thumbnail links to your scans
if you're in a hurry but enough about
iphones there's news for blackberry
users a new music service is launching
today or tomorrow that's right research
in motion is hoping to be a little more
hip by getting in the music game but the
way it works might seem a little
complicated message your accounts pay
five dollars a month to download 50
songs from the blackberry catalog and
well there are more than 50 songs in the
catalog but you only get to pick 50 the
park is that if you have friends with
the service you can access all of their
50 songs plus your own and expand your
music collection that way so sharing
songs on a monthly music service then
the zune try that well if you sign up
you better hope you have other
blackberry friends with cool music
tastes those are your headlines for
today I'm Bridget Carey for cnet com and
you just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
