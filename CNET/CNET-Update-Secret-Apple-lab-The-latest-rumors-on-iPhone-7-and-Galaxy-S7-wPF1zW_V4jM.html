Samsung Galaxy rumors I'm Bridget Carey
this is your CNET update
what big features we'll be in next year
smartphones there's already buzz about
the iPhone 7 and Samsung Galaxy s7 but
let's start with Apple Bloomberg is
reporting that Apple has opened a secret
laboratory in Taiwan where engineers are
focused on developing new screen
technology for iPhones and iPads of
course Apple isn't commenting on this
but the report says Apple began
operating the lab this year to make the
next iPhones even thinner lighter
brighter and would use less battery
now there's reportedly a push to move
toward organic LEDs which do not require
a backlight but if Apple can make its
own display tech the company may not
have to rely so much on Samsung and
other companies for parts now it's still
way too early to talk about what the
next iPhone could look like because
Apple could be testing multiple ideas
but one possible change has some worried
because it sounds plausible
Japanese Apple blog mokou Takara has the
source saying that the iPhone 7 will not
have a typical headphone jack and
instead customers will need to use
wireless bluetooth headphones or by an
adapter that plugs into the Lightning
charging port now this would be done to
make the iPhone even thinner Apple owns
Beats branded headphones so it would
benefit the company of customers need to
buy something new that works with a
lightning port philips and JBL already
make lightning powered headsets so the
specs to do this are out there and we
all know Apple likes forcing people to
change their habits the iMac in 98
didn't have a floppy disk drive now you
can't find a CD drive in an Apple laptop
and Apple's new 12-inch MacBook doesn't
even have a slot for standard USB just
the new USBC port and that's the only
port on the whole thing
now what about Samsung The Wall Street
Journal reports that the company is
testing pressure-sensitive screens and a
new high-speed charging port for its
next Galaxy s7 smartphone that's
expected to come out in March there may
be even a retina scanner to scan your
eye for security now
that high-speed charging would likely be
a USBC port
which can give you a full charge in
under 30 minutes and another
high-profile Samsung phone the upcoming
Galaxy a nine could have a powerful
battery to go with its large screen a
leaked photo on Weibo was published by
the blog phone arena and it describes
the a9 with a six inch display and it'll
have a metal body just like the last
model but it will not be the most
powerful galaxy phone this is expected
to be released in January first in China
that's it for this tech news update and
there's more as cnet.com from our
