review of the Samsung at 5500 plasma TV
if you want a good television for little
money the best way to go is usually a
plasma but they're definitely getting
rarer the samsung f 5500 is one of only
three models released by the company
this year but it's still considered
entry-level under $1000 design wise it's
a standard looking Samsung with a
plastic bezel and a plastic stand which
is unfortunately not very well
constructed it visibly flexes in your
hands this is one of the least expensive
TVs in Samsung's lineup to feature Smart
TV and it includes the company's new 5
panel layout and cable box integration
the TV also comes with a touchpad remote
which is handy for writing channel
numbers directly and it also comes with
a microphone for voice search but I do
wish they'd included a standard remote
in the box as well for all the ease of
use Bichir quality is good in some
respects are not so good in others in a
dark cinema setting blacks are fairly
deep though still not as good as the
entry-level Panasonic plasmas and color
is pretty decent
but put the TV in a semi lit room like
this studio and the picture goes to heck
blacks go Brown and the screen gets very
reflective this was a problem with
plasmas several years ago but most other
competitors have fixed this problem now
given that the number of plasmas is
shrinking this TV almost gets a
recommendation by default but if you are
willing to watch the TV in the dark the
F 5500 can offer you a high-quality
picture this has been Ty Pendlebury for
