a construction site being able to track
equipment people and what they're doing
it's critical to workplace safety using
our technology right now both people and
object recognition models are currently
deployed in that construction yard and
then on the screen there before you you
can see the solution is recognizing Jana
in real time
take note again of that jackhammer in a
uba's workshop it is resting vertically
against the bench which is actually a
very unsafe position for such a large
heavy object to be in and so I've
already gone ahead and I've tagged that
jackhammer in a variety of safe and
unsafe positions in the system and so
when I update this pipeline which I'm
going to do right now it's not only
going to see the jackhammer now but it
is also going to tell me it's an
unstable orientation and it's going to
notify yuba so he's able to very quickly
resolve the issue the solution is
running more than 27 million
recognitions per second across people
objects and activities both in the yard
and in the workshop and we're making
changes to the solution in real time in
the cloud and deploying it to the edge
which is a great example of how we can
stretch the cloud to create a mesh of
interconnected devices and services</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
