kids do you feel comfortable with a
child having a tablet yes I suppose at
what age like well anyway clearly as
soon as possible well I mean they're
always at the preschool games yeah
totally now I mean yeah like Jordan
started with monkey preschool lunch box
there's a lot of educational games you
know shapes colors math it's not just
pick it up and put a movie on sure it
depends on how you utilize it I mean
like for long drives feel like a little
DVD player would have liked a little
Einstein stuff up right you know what
shapes and colors and words and stuff
like that I like the parent controls
they have nowadays you can set timers to
have it like be like up you've spent how
yeah I think I think when you when you
when you say it's okay you gotta kind
explain it so exactly it's not just like
something like oh you think are here
take it and why trying to watch kid
netflix or nick jr ollie I can't say
that I'm not a little I don't know
turned off by the notion of like like I
have a friend who all he does is just
give his kid a microphone all the time
how is this different for watching I was
just different and watching TV all
summer like I did that's how I grew up
yes I decided I it's now that the TV
just comes with you right like I was
buried in Game Boy my entire adolescence
and childhood so like sega game gear
yeah like i don't know i don't there is
no right and wrong it's whatever works
for you just you know i used to kill the
mold mattel hand hill football I feel
there's social media stuff you got to be
careful because if you open up the app
store but anything yeah um what about
games are you guys I know three months
is that's out of the question even for
me it's add the question he jordan's
lego dimensions my kids you bought it
himself with his own birthday money well
that's nice likes lego dimensions okay
that's cool yeah I can't do games just
yet like my dog and my kid are actually
at like the same cognitive
right now but realistically he rather
build with the leg old and play it yeah
and but he likes to TV on in the
background while he's building okay um
Netflix does Jordan consume a lot of
streaming stuff he it's funny YouTube he
wants to be a YouTube star he's
literally said it I mean I should have
given Brian this segment he did on his
the somme free makers Lego he built so
what is he like reviewing stuff is he
literally with his iphone he videoed he
made a youtube video for youtube about
the Lego that he built describing it
saying look at the detail that it and at
the very anybody that at the very end he
goes subscribe right below subscribe
right now I created and you know that
brings me to another point since we're
talking about it i created a YouTube
page for him but I don't use YouTube
that often and I want to be really
familiar before I put anything of his up
there you know spoke to people around
here like disable comments yes like that
you don't yer nose yeah talking to your
kids so I but he has it but the one
thing I wanted to bring up is and this
is with like the emails like Gmail and
also it'd be nice if they allowed you to
create a sub email for your kid because
in in creating his email account i
actually had to lie about his age
because you have to be a certain age
have an email i kind of wish they had a
parental email where you can kind of
make a sub email underneath it because i
did that for multiple really have to be
13 yeah something like that but he's
only eight i created it for him because
we're not gonna don't worry no one's
gonna watch well no in the iphone in
literally on youtube no in it because of
the iphone that's why i created it
because he's logged into my apple ID but
i created his own I cloudy I got you go
to create five games take also clean I
don't want all this crazy YouTube
homemade videos come to my cell okay
with their younger kids going on
facebook to that mean like I but I've
spoken to parents who have kids who were
11 years old 10 years old now it's
supposed to be 13 but they way that they
approach it is is my kid mature enough
because everyone in the class is already
on it lying about their age so you have
to have that conversation you know going
alright you have to do the computer in
the family room and
you know I had to be your friend yeah
it's tough the last thing I want to talk
about and we kind of already discussed a
lot of it do you think there is an age I
mean obviously Facebook YouTube have
ideas about what that specific age is
but do you think it's there is an actual
realistic age where someone should be on
Instagram Facebook or Twitter I think
all that comes with the parents Jimmy's
discretion maturity and the it the
network matters like Mike what benefit
is it for a kid to see Instagram unless
they're really into taking photos but
they're going to come across all the all
the stuff is you don't need to come
across yeah that's it's tough ah that's
a new job act like I don't have a kid
and I don't have to worry about you will
you will</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
