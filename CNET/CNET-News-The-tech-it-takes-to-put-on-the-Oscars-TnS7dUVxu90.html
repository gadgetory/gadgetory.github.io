thousands of people in an astounding
amount of tech to pull off crews roll
out 500 feet of red carpet but that's
nothing compared to the miles and miles
of cable needed for the broadcast much
of which is plugged into trucks at the
so-called broadcast compound right
outside the theater the director sits in
the truck behind me as well as the
editors everything that goes over the
air is done in these two trucks since
the show is seen by 1.2 billion viewers
in more than 200 countries there are
multiple backup plans the signal has
multiple fiber feeds but we also have
satellite feeds so they can cut from one
feet to the nether pretty seamlessly
transforming the tourist hotspot and
3,400 seat movie theater into the home
of the Oscars means we're moving a
massive movie screen tons of cable
dozens of seats and 28 rigging motors
inside the auditorium the Academy uses
very few motors in the Oscars motors can
fail so they're they're still using the
old pipe and ropes and encounter weights
another element not in the auditorium on
Oscar night the orchestra while people
at home and inside the theater can hear
the orchestra music it's actually being
performed here a mile away live at
Capitol Records the music is then piped
through fiber optic cables back to the
theater and it only takes two point
seven milliseconds we just keep trying
to get that latency down as close to
zero so that performers can hear exactly
what the orchestra is doing in the
orchestra can respond with them too
they're all you know seamlessly
performing together movie clips and
musical performances will be in Dolby
5.1 surround sound home viewers with
surround sound setup can have a similar
sound experience as the celebrities now
the people do have a theater can have an
experience but the people that are
watching in their kitchen and their
bedroom in their bathroom on the sofa
you don't want everybody to have a good
experience technology at the theaters
also helping stars and their fans
connect through social media this year
the green room designed by Architectural
Digest will have Samsung tablets and a
jiff mirror for celebrity reactions
powered by Twitter VIPs can hang out the
Dolby lounge to text and Instagram to
their heart's content the Academy added
a 4G LTE
cell tower to improve connectivity but
there are no charging stations since
most celebrities aren't using their
phones during the ceremony unless
they're taking the ultimate Hollywood
selfie in Los Angeles I'm Kara Tsuboi
