at the clips are 10 B sambar when it
comes to upgrading your TV sound the
sound bar is probably the easiest way to
do it and if you want a system that can
put some pizzazz in your movie watching
the clips are 10 B is an excellent
choice while may be more costly the most
sound bar systems at $600 it offers a
better performance than even our current
budget favorite the pioneer SB 120
unlike some of the more expensive
systems on the market this is a stereo
only system with a subwoofer and while
it does have a wide mode it's not true
surround unlike the Pioneer though the
eclipses main speaker is made of plastic
and is on the macho side as far as looks
go the subwoofer that comes with it is a
reasonable side made of wood and
Wireless but disappointingly it can't be
controlled with the remote the number of
inputs is quite limited with just a
stereo input and an optical at least the
unit has a Bluetooth connection with
optic support so if you have a
compatible phone it doesn't sound like
complete garbage movies sound great on
this thing with the sub giving film
soundtracks real oomph and it's one of
the best sound bars we've seen under
$1500 music is also really good for a
system of this size though if you're
streaming from your phone and it doesn't
have optics then the sound is a little
thin and brittle sounding in all this is
an easy to set up and use sound bar with
excellent performance but if you're a
power user then maybe the lack of inputs
could be a problem this is ty Pendlebury
