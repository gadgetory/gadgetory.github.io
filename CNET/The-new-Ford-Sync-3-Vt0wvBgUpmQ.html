interface now dubbed sync 3.0 the old
and often the line my Ford touch is gone
although that touch is very much here
let's take a look at what they've done
to address complaints to be honest first
of all take a look at this screen big
clean large zones and very easy to see
everything at a glance the old MyFord
Touch had lots of little rabbit hole as
you could get down into with all kinds
of settings and layers here it's largely
at one level this ribbon is persistent
here at the bottom as opposed to the
four corners they used to use for
different functions so you've got audio
at one point climate phone your apps
will be here and some settings what's
interesting is as you've already noticed
quick response now for it tells me that
you kind of had to improve everything to
get there better screen technology it's
now capacitive versus resistive they
also have more processing power and
they've optimized the software
underneath these specifics of course
once you get into them there's not a
whole lot of additional stacked layers
that's keen it used to confuse a lot of
folks who are not the most tech forward
auto owners as to what's possible and
where that option is that they were
looking for once you get down to the
apps area and interesting story because
this now fully embraces four it's a
plank platform which is the largest
collection of automotive enabled apps in
the business over 60 of them right now
but they used to be segregated only in
sync which didn't make them appear in my
Ford touch now there's been a reunion of
sorts
one last thing to show you one of the
benefits of having a capacitive screen
versus resistive on the touch is you've
now got the ability to do multi-touch
gestures you can do a swipe like this on
a map screen you can do pinch and zoom
and such now sync 3 starts to show up in
later 2015 on 16 model year cars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
