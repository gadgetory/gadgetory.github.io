februari in his episode 178 of the 359
podcast at Roger Cheng Ben Fox Rubin and
Joni salzman all crammed into this tiny
little podcaster yeah okay happy monday
is it is it happy yeah sure we'll make
it happy that's right happier now that
we're on this podcast and we're talking
about some weird stuff today not weird
and weird i'm on the grammys very
topical right we're gonna be talking
about chance the rapper why what has
wind is so revolutionary and then we'll
for the rest of time talking about
verizon surprisingly jumping into an
unlimited data plan and Roger gets to
eat some crow yeah I know by the way
they were just touting their five big
plan like a week ago like you don't need
a limited you just need five gig so not
just me I think there's also since
either i know a lot of this huh 5g
they're everywhere everywhere everywhere
I know I know a lot of good kind of it
is for the dude that's going up an
escalator and getting into an elevator
and just kind of walking around with his
phone everywhere yeah he seems to have
his life he's ago it yeah he definitely
has a life together every commercial
though there's like one part of it where
it's like him and a girl and they're in
an audience and they're both looking at
their phones except there's nobody else
the audience except for like one of the
person sees like excuse me can I get by
and they feel like stand-ups letter by
letter like everything around them and
something I hate that guy that guy is
not a nice guy the guy that's walking
through all right all right let's uh
sure we've broken down the topic if you
have any questions as always leave them
in the comments section Brian will will
pick out the best we will try to answer
them in four minutes or less alright
let's get this recording out away here
we go for the 359 podcast episode 178 in
three two welcome to 359 when we talk
about the top tags of the day and only
the crap we want to throw in I'm Roger
Jen I'm Ben Fox Rubin &amp;amp; I'm Joanie salsa
so congrats to chance the rapper who won
big at the grammy's last night he won
for Best New Artist rap album and rap
performance and that's despite the fact
that he's never sold an album or track
so we've got media maven Jones
also here to talk about why this is such
a big deal so break it down for us all
right so this is the first time that an
artist who pretty much exclusively
streams his music doesn't sell it as a
CD or as a download has not only been
nominated for Grammy but one in some
epic categories for ya um so it's
interesting I think the fact that chance
the rapper has reached the level of
popularity that he has without being on
a label and about selling anything with
traditional ways that you make a name
for yourself in the recording industry
that's right we were talking about this
before like it's kind of mind-blowing
that like he hadn't sold anything that
Ben was kind of surprised that he could
just download the song is like where
where's ya better there are days I where
do I pay for the where I pay I'm super
how do I grouper although I get it I
didn't I didn't even realize this i was
trying to buy same drugs last week and i
couldn't find it anywhere find it on
itunes now reckon I I ended up opening
soundcloud eventually like David and was
just like okay here's here's where it is
but forgive me but like you are maybe
getting it illegally if your client
soundcloud are no I just like I never
thought I'd really fun at all I i
purchase know and and so now I'm like
using soundcloud more because that's a
way for me to like actually find it
stuff do you think you're aiming service
do you think chance to shout out to
SoundCloud yesterday will have any kind
of seconds like SoundCloud and he's a
bum they can right now they're not
really people don't really know what
sounds funny well it depends it's kind
of like YouTube with older people versus
younger people like okay like younger
people if you say like the comment like
nobody really knows what's on cod is
like well yeah like no being under 30
would really agree with that ok which I
have done which is none of us yeah
unless you're on a media beat and
therefore you do know those right them
but but what's interesting about like
even the the the Grammys had to twerk
their own that's worked week their own
I've got rap in my head they had to
tweak their own rules to let chance even
be eligible so dr. that he's been on
like a billboard charts like his albums
on the village or like 33 weeks in a row
without ever selling anything in a store
or on iTunes it's just by having
streaming equivalents
produção much streaming that it
manages to get charted for the majority
of the time it's released in the year
its release and most of the time these
songs who are up there usually had this
huge machine behind them yeah and he
doesn't have machine other than the fact
that he like BTW like it's the pavement
and he tours a lot and he builds up an
audience by actually like communicating
with them we do you think you'll see
more doing this way for it would be
amazing to see more artists doing it
display and getting recognition for it
because there are a lot of artists that
do it to play and have a hard time
making a living off of it gotcha yeah um
you put on a lot of a lot of work and he
also is an incredible artist like he
also writes really great write it helps
with the song yeah actually good so dumb
all right that would be interesting to
see like it would it would be more a gal
therrien in the music industry for sure
if people's talent is what memes day
becomes a couple the internet supposed
to be about right yeah man maybe I don't
know next up verizon is back on the
unlimited bandwagon color me genuinely
surprised and wrong I thought I thought
they weren't going to do this but they
they had actually scoffed at the notion
of a limited for quite a while now but
you know this new plan eight dollars a
month will just price you the what
t-mobile and Sprint offer but they say
that you get full HD streaming video
which the other two don't offer for this
plan bet you're a verizon customer is
there something you'd be interested in
we would definitely look into it but I
think eighty dollars a month seems
pretty expensive I think we get 16 gigs
now for whatever deals our eyes and
threw at us recently so why we would
switch over to that I'm not really sure
it's also interesting to see like
t-mobile if you get four lines it's like
forty dollars yeah that's it yeah so
eighty dollars for one line I don't know
how competitive that is it doesn't at
first glance it doesn't seem that good
to me well keep in mind with the plan of
for i believe is there is actually a
discount to it right so for one line at
seventy dollars a month i guess it up
ahead of time okay sprint it's like
fifty dollars a month no no right
verizon offers oh really cooperate yeah
well I'm still like totally confused
about all these plans like they're all
like it's very complicated that's kind
of like doing your taxes
oh here it is it's a doll to the first
line and then each additional line is
$45 okay no I don't know yeah yeah I do
a lot of math I'm we're probably going
to stick with what we're doing now but
it's nice that they finally decided to
become somewhat competitive so yeah but
I think it's really over that's what it
came down to it it's not the fact that
their network valves on is great it can
handle limited it's more like that
t-mobile Sprint and even eighteen t off
are limited and they just saw the
writing on the wall they decided okay
we've gotta do this too yeah so all
right four more of these stories check
cuz I've seen it I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben
Fox Rubin Joanie soften banks will
sitting
not much going on in the chat today I
have a quick question that we didn't get
to so Joan how how concerned is like the
music industry about the fact that
chance the rapper was it was random yeah
how threatening is a said that he was
able to actually be successful doing
this I mean I don't think that it's
threatening I don't think it's right
thing because like what would the threat
of him be because these may be the
threat would be like if on math artists
are like through you music labels I'm
not going to sign with you and you
dangle all these big checks in front of
me like Universal come still dangle
really big check in front of people you
know like to get them to sign and then
owned their soul and own their their
music so in that sorry that made me son
really down on the music labels but
that's like the perspective that was
fiercely independent artists like chance
the rapper would have liked this coven l
just to like you can start to make it
big on their own like is that yeah what
it's like sell anything at all those all
the videos are free what the YouTube
stars though it's much more that's more
threatening to main like traditional
television because ads out like
traditional television makes its money
from advertising and from cable
subscriptions rice and if people decide
they don't really need to pay for cables
description scriptions anymore then they
lose money there and if advertising
dollars start going towards YouTube
instead of going to TV budgets but it's
certainly there with music it's a little
bit different because like chance rapper
he subscribed to like the idea of a
subscription service like he puts his
music on Spotify which has that premiums
here come on Apple music I believe an
Amazon music unlimited yeah so he's not
he's not hardcore singh like it needs to
be only free he just happens to offer a
free option yeah and so that's not
really retina because otherwise me has
the music and he doesn't really have an
advertising based model and here in it
so it's not certainly what that needs to
go away what's threatening is the fact
that there are these services like
YouTube which he's not on but like
YouTube where the only money that's the
music industry debts from YouTube is
through supported share ad revenue share
sorry so that gets complicated but
basically
YouTube is a lot more threatening to the
music industry and chance the rapper is
like if those are threatened streaming
it's from YouTube as an institution and
a place where lots and lots of people
listen to lots and lots of music then
like one person who was really dedicated
dreaming really getting successful then
why was it YouTube red and subscription
play into this well the public YouTube
red is that not very many people
subscribe to it not yet not yet I'm
sorry like they haven't disclosed any
numbers and usually what that means is
they're not know to brag about yeah yeah
but if they had a number to brag but
usually they brag about it and it's hard
to reach number you can brag um yeah
it's a weird landscape I mean I used
soundcloud he's a multitude of different
stuff soundcloud mixes go go place
spotify pretty much eliminate don't
really use it itunes good why is my way
no i mean occasionally when that's the
only place to get something I want y'all
go there and buy it but I'm not using
that one Apple music yeah as far as like
my listening regular habit right I don't
like SoundCloud a lot though with with
chance my other question is like how
much money is he actually making if he's
only pursuing streaming right like I've
read that you know most of the money
that he makes is off of merchandising
and touring but if he's not signing with
a music label he's not selling physical
copies of his music missing out on like
millions of dollars in sales um I mean
that's a really theoretical question
because part of the reason that he is
he's reached the level successfully has
because he has the kind of independence
that he does without being on a label
like he doesn't have to like answer
anybody's notes he can release to music
when he wants you can do things that he
that are responsive to his audience but
he knows is working and so it's hard to
like say would he be making billions of
dollars and like millions of dollars if
he was on a label it's just hard to say
because so much comes down to what
you're contracted with your label like
he doesn't have to like label contracts
with artists the amount you get paid for
what you stream is the same for every
artist basically when it goes to the
artists like chance or to the label and
then your contract that the label is
where like you start to lose its arts
degree like the label starts taking it's
like you basically gets a full
do you guys good full cut and he has
total control over where things go and
so he's not making money on streaming
that he didn't wouldn't have to have it
there but he's thinking about it in like
a 21st century way where the recording
isn't the product he is the product
touring is the product that's how he
makes money like it's a 21st century way
of thinking about recordings as not
being the thing that you sell but being
your own advertising speaking of that
Nicholas from Sweden in the chat says
seems to me like chance the rapper
simply ahead of the curve this way of
spreading a music will probably be
common practice in the future I think we
all agree with that i gotta agree with
that I mean whether or not you up yeah
on a regular basis is I think that's on
the artist right okay actually have to
put out good stuff right right there's a
lot that's not yeah but but John that
also makes a lot of central you said is
that like everything's moving towards
streaming anyway so like you said like
folks in the industry don't seem
threatened by him because you know
physical yeah physical CD sales and
digital downloads like those are all
going down so the fact that he in the
streaming means like yeah like like this
guy just said these he's slightly ahead
of the curve he's just doing it much
more as a pure-play as opposed to what
other folks are doing yeah where they're
trying to make money in all these other
ways as well yeah yeah he definitely has
more of a sort of LA it's like part of
his his philosophies not he's not like
golden mean very like philosophical
about all put a little bit here a little
bit here and he found a thing that
worked for him and his audience before
anybody else I'm really reached a lot
was able to reach a level success but he
has reached so he's kind of the first in
that regard he is the first in that
regard um but there been other people
who have been the icing the online
things yeah just I mean look back
myspace yeah we're laughs that no love
that site was music and it's still hung
on to it it's actually really i mean
like i don't i don't know nearly as much
about the music industry as you do but
it is pretty interesting to think about
how long it took an artist to really
reach this pinnacle yeah yeah it's like
well i think that speaks of the reason
that they had to change the rules to let
him reach that pinnacle like you don't
reach that pinnacle unless the people
who decide who's allowed to climb the
mountain let you climb you know like
preach
what is the same time where there's
somebody behind chance the rapper like a
precursor chance the rapper so we don't
know about that like could have
potentially won a Grammy if they hadn't
changed the rules um I don't know I
honestly don't know it's possible but I
think that it is part of a progression
in the fact that the Mesa going to have
been undergoing this progression worth
starting to accept the fact that streams
future more and more still like the fact
that it's a progressive thing that
Nielsen and billboard would start to
include streaming equivalents in
charting and so therefore you're able to
measure that he was on the Billboard 200
charts coming but was on the Billboard
200 chart for 33 weeks out of the year
for an album came out May so the fact
it's like it's kind of like push and
pull oh the Recording Industry accepting
the fact that things are changing and
not allowing people to rise to the
definition of what like a pinnacle is
well under the audience but also took
someone who is successful is oh yes to
enlarge the industry to go this way
right yeah yeah definitely have a
chicken and egg thing yes yeah be
curious to find out if anybody in the
chat what other streaming services you
are a fan of what had you think works
for you like I said I use Spotify and
SoundCloud mixcloud google play and even
you know some of our subscription
affiliates like stitcher Wow sure but
that's really not a place for my
shepherd except for my face yeah that's
more tradition like that's kind of a
forward step on that and talk radio than
it is music right as a Sarah ya know the
podcast the way the future kind of thing
yeah which horse it is I don't know
those an aside but I love that they're
called podcast although nobody like
iPods aren't means made anymore right
like I love it there regional offices
are meaning of it XOX price yeah because
I mean it's a pity word for it well it
has no real look at television anything
that's on demand there is you got to go
with yeah yeah and you need a tissue you
need a Kleenex yeah no one really
actually it's always about that brand
familiarity and if they can like sneaky
there and there yeah all right it really
is like Apple just made like 27 cents
cuz we all said podcast like
well because right that's wrong cameras
are for apple can be like yo Chris
wesley says i love soundcloud in google
play spotify i don't remember the last
time i bought music yeah yeah I
understand way more than a few times
where is a really indie artists and
doesn't have like a distribution deal
kind of thing you're not going to find
them on a major platform yeah everything
on demand yeah you might have to go to a
band camp and I do that more often than
not because that's literally the only
way I'm gonna be able to get some from
them at the same time you can oftentime
just listen directly from that bandcamp
page if you don't even necessarily pay
to download it and keep it but it's
right take it to go you got a pain
download it and then the only song are
only album was downloaded the last
couple years to say you to one that
Apple force the phone and whether you
had no choice or by Tears update oh by
the way you also got this holding you to
album yeah I was like oh alright I've
got this big now didn't want it but i
reset my phone a while ago and it popped
back up Mike you son of a bitch how dare
you give me pre beautiful SI so bi music
i just bought the bruno mars album and i
really like it I mean how I listen to
music I listen to the music industry
loves you I listened to the same stuff
over and over and over again so like
streaming doesn't really work for me so
much I'll be the curve annuit no that's
ok like well that's the great thing is
that when there's more choice I mean it
means more consumer choice if you like
to alone your measly just literally same
thing over again you don't have to worry
about paying a subscription to have it
available offline when you're trained
visitor like you just have it yeah and
that's great for you radio like let's
not discount the fact that as we're
talking about streaming and how
important that is for like finding
things like band camp finding audience
but like radio is still the best like
than a number one way that people
discover new music it's just funny I
seem auto archaic right yeah but it's
totally true and then maybe that'll
maybe that'll change as cars become
smarter yeah like you don't have to rely
on these airwaves that have been around
since you know whatever letter carrier
by a hard drive in your trunk well you
know what else revving cars that's not
good Blair off yeah that's not that far
off right but that but I think that kind
of also speaks to the fact like it's the
mega stars and the Beyonce's and the
adults that are backed by huge label
like they're not going away until
yeah um radio disappears like there's
always going to be like a lowest common
denominator yes all those all those
channels play basically the same 50
popular songs in a common yeah lots and
rotation yeah yeah can help but to be
like hooked into it rosalina says I used
to use our do to listen to full album
rest in peace yeah I got absorbed by
what Rhapsody and then that whole thing
went down right well from our do what's
going out of business if I remember I
star do is going bankruptcy going on
business and Pandora bought like the
assets for it the library yeah well not
the library but like but it was like an
almost like an actual higher like I
bought it in tech and bought its staff
but yeah are do is one of those like
beloved that was kind of pre Spotify
like that yeah there things like you're
going to go shopping there not
necessarily have it as much curated like
a Pandora type thing and it was a
Pandora's kind of going that route as
well I got a lot of great accolades for
its interface and being like
technologically having the most
user-friendly and the easiest and a lot
of people love that that service but
it's hard it's tough especially because
no streaming services make any money but
I'll lose money it's been really hard
business none of them are absolutely you
can make fair arguments in favor of so
many of their so subjective Carlos says
they all had different things to offer
are you Spotify for playlists and
quality sound Apple music for curated
playlists and radio soundcloud and tune
in yeah they're pretty much do a relay
station for actual physical broadcast
radio stations as well as online only
extremes but that's not the kind of
thing where you're going and going
fishing through a bank of assets they're
providing you a program right yeah yeah
that's cool Carlos very cool you know
you like that's cool also what was the
what was jay-z's one called I forgot
their big thing which I don't hi and
that I mean whatever you go for this
audio file yeah I mean the sheer quality
of sound that's their bore firmly now
for Sprint customers or or some a clue
may or may not even realize they have
the service in their system and that'll
be kind of an interesting thing to see
how that's going to skew the market is
when exclusives really start to weigh in
you know like people I want a netflix
subscription because I like Marvel shows
and
yeah amazon originals i like transparent
i got to get on Amazon subscription if
music starts to go that way with an
artist well is that going to cannibalize
the industry so it's enjoy because
there's a lot of push and pull with
exclusives are now Spotify dogged Lee
against having taking exclusive at all
because they think it's bad for the
artist think it's bad for this nervously
think it's bad for consumers because how
frustrating is it when Connie has a new
album and your huge Kanye fan and you
have to sign up for title yeah and then
you're like I don't want to be signed up
for title because through week later
you're just gonna put on your website
which he did and then like I mean that's
a very Connie a specific the guy he's an
island even island yeah um but uh the
nicest word about her I know sorry dr.
Frank Ocean did his kind of switcheroo
so does so you know about this no all
right so the the quick background about
Frank coach the Frank Ocean was signed
to universal to single biggest label in
the world or to one of their stuff
labels I can't remember but ultimately
like universals the people that owned
hizzle so he took a really long time so
Cecilia's contract he drops like a
visual album on Apple music on like a
Thursday and then the following Friday
once he had completed his contractual
obligation to Universal he's like I'm
going to actually release my real album
be to have it be independent and after
that happened that's the best blonde
it's Baldy yeah that that's the one that
actually went gangbusters yeah and so
after that happened the head of
universals like we're never we're not
good for no none of ours can do those
exclusive anymore because they got
burned so bad on that so who knows if it
continues Apple Apple really loves it
title really loves exclusive Spotify is
like they're not cool we're not playing
that game yeah yeah and so the interest
and now the interesting thing is is the
most powerful biggest label in the world
is like that's not cool when I playing
that game because it's got it you know
screwed over yeah it'll be interesting
to see those forces like very strange
force was competing against each other
about whether or not that should be
something that happened you got to
appreciate people like be skeptical in
the chat he says I'd buy music on itunes
for bands I want to financially support
a good idea was dreaming them doesn't
give him their fair share you know what
I would agree to that there's been a few
occasions where it's like no I want you
to have my money take some money
yeah no I'm never that generous like I
mean I don't got a banjo matter with
Lana right either yeah there's some who
I don't know put me on the spot the
clash well then I gotta be seeing much
of that money there wait who said that
in the chest be skeptical so be
skeptical one thing you may want to
consider I think that's a really great
impulse I have friends that do that to
that want to support support artists
that they love by actually like just
paying for their music but also consider
like if they're on bandcamp there's like
places with some artists do tip jars and
things does that mean what's going to
when you buy their merch if you stream
all this stuff and spend the exact same
amount you'd spent on album it's been on
the merch they're going to get a lot
more than money like a lot more it
totally depends on what artist you're
talking about their own like connect
their own contract with their label if
they have a labels they don't but the
best one you can like get money in their
pocket is to like buy merch guy their
t-shirts and posters yeah not use cos ah
ha ha anyway hahahaha last on the pan
come on throwing back I feel like the
same way i like the idea of being able
to contribute as much as I came like
I'll sit around and Spotify and poke
around and find something oh this is
great and it's like I really fall in
love with it have some money yeah I kind
of like that but now I know thing was
young we should be buying no that's
buying t-shirts yes it's really helpful
for them too I mean buying them because
that's how if they aren't a label that's
how their beds like the metric were they
like their bosses are the ones that they
have to answer to you for like yes your
investment in me was worth it selling
music is really important for that
measure but if your instinct is like I
want to give them my money if that's
what you want to help them on then like
actually then going to shows and buying
merges yeah always going to shows was
always the best way to ya no matter what
I'm gonna go to one in a couple weeks
finally gonna see at the drive-in okay /
that's driving yeah I had not banned I
fell in love with 0 through like yeah
you're high and I had me back to college
I'm low and yeah David they went away
for a while another back and I'm cool I
need to go see em and I'm really stoked
Ryan mom yeah that in coheed and cambria
oh yeah man you're taking back to my
like I go to shows kids stays well
they're playing their sophomore album
and its entire not sophomore there
Junior

anniversary really Jordan nearly alcohol
