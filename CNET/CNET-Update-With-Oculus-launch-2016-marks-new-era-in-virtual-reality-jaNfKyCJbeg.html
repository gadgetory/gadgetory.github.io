Renaissance I'm Bridget Carey this is
your scene that update for nearly three
years the virtual reality company
Occulus has shown off prototypes of its
rift VR headset at trade shows but the
company is nearly ready to sell it to
the public oculus which is owned by
Facebook announced it will have a
commercial version of its head gear in
the first quarter of 2016 it'll take
pre-orders later this year so it won't
be out in time for the holidays but you
know it will be HTC's competing VR
headset called the vibe and Sony is also
working on its own virtual reality for
the PlayStation that's called project
Morpheus and it may not arrive until
much later next year we're going through
something of a virtual reality
Renaissance you can experience VR
through a smartphone app by putting your
phone inside of a special case strapped
to your head such as Samsung's gear VR
even mattel is putting virtual reality
inside of the classic view master toy
but let's take a step back the first
oculus headset launched as a Kickstarter
project in 2012 it generated nearly two
and a half million dollars in pre-orders
for a prototype last year Facebook
bought the company for two billion
dollars oculus is not saying how much
it's going to charge for this headset
but the one for developers to play with
that's currently out it costs three
hundred and fifty dollars it may not
matter which company sells one first be
at HTC oculus or Sony what matters is
the entertainment experience and that
content takes time to build in other
gaming news Sony's PlayStation now
streaming service is coming to the
PlayStation 3 console next week on May
twelfth subscribers that pay twenty
dollars a month can access more than 100
ps3 games this first launched in January
on the PlayStation 4 and you can also
find the service on some sony tvs and
blu-ray players so you can play games

long as you have the right controller

stream video sharp is the latest TV
