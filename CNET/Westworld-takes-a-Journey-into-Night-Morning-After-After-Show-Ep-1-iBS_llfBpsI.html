morning after after show
I'm Patrick I'm Lynne and I'm Caitlin
and we're all editors at C net and big
fans of the show Wes world so today
we're going to talk about season 2
episode 1 titled journey in tonight
maybe a little Eugene O'Neill reference
long day's journey tonight any theater
people yeah all right fair warning any
time there will most definitely be
spoilers but only for the episode we're
talking about today
let's go through the episode let's talk
about what happened when we first
started we saw Byrne Arnold talking with
Delores open Arnold definitely one of
them
and they were kind of telling Dolores
about a dream they had which is what
makes me think it's probably Arnold
because Bernard never really had dreams
so he's telling her you know he felt
like he was separated from his friends
he washed up on a beach and then he
tells her the line we've seen in the
trailers Dolores
sometimes you frightened me well creepy
and if she gives a creepy smile she gets
really creepy like why would I ever find
you people
I don't do weird things yeah I mean now
we know exactly why he should be
frightened by Dolores
but back then who knows so then we
transition immediately to Bernard we
think waking up on the beach in the
exact same scene that Arnold just
described in his dream it was very
inception a dream sequence opening on
the beach so yeah like there's a lot
going on in like his flashback that
montage which showed us a lot how I
loved that montage the future cut like
of things to come right so then we we
think we see that montage of things to
come but maybe there are things that
already happened we know that this isn't
the first robot uprising we know that a
lot of these things have happened before
could this be simply memories that
Arnold has from previously could this be
or rather memories that Bernard has I
guess cuz Arnold it's long gone by then
we talk about the lady the security lady
with like it looks like us hololens or
something
like eh that's just badass look like
that is like badass security upgrade
from the first season I think I don't
think we ever saw her before right no
she is a new character in this season
paid by played by Betty Gabriel she was
also in get out as the gal who has the
lone tear she's smiling like no no maybe
that's why she has to wear the glasses
to appear like hey that was for get out
this is different I totally do the thing
and we don't know what's up with us not
you can it be sunglasses that are really
big and bug-eyed they could maybe be
something else because one thing she's
doing is she's looking for robots or
hosts she's flipping through some red
cards that look very suspicious I like
how just analog how analog that is like
has a deck of cards even though there's
like these crazy tabloids because then
we see the hologram and what's it like
with one of the Gulf Wars they gave like
the soldiers the American soldiers a
deck of cards all the bad guys on it I'm
not making this up like okay maybe it
was like the Afghan exactly you were
there everybody's like variety packs
afterwards but getting back to the cards
to the red cards but you made a point
cuz it's like oh weird why would she see
that he's a host and you're like maybe
they're not a host right so if you zoom
in and look closely I actually says high
priority
like he's a high priority target or a
high priority employee so maybe they're
actually people that they're trying to
keep safe maybe those are actually ones
that they want to you know keep with
their core group because then from that
point on we do see Bernard stay with
that group we see the scalping of a host
but specifically an interesting example
was it was a Native American hood and
then a takeout it looks almost like a
weird light bulb that's is like
processer out of the brain right and
that was that's the first time you've
ever seen inside the brains or light
bulb processors yes smart bulbs but we
do know it is their processing center
so perhaps Phillips Hughes is gonna be
taking over the future where their light
bulb
I hope that came out just like an old
like that I got a Jacob's Ladder thing
yeah okay so he takes it out first he's
really upset it's not a sterile
environment he takes it out and you
don't like fans she plugs it into his
tablet wait wait no no okay so that
moment really that's one time at me he
says Oh sterile environment said and
then he blows on it and we all know like
there's no three-second rule it doesn't
work that way
he's blowing germs and saliva on to
think Oh sterile environment just rub it
off human rubs it on his pant yeah so we
see that and then I think the next thing
we jump to is we see guests then they're
hiding in a stable and they're obviously
being hunted by some of the HOS yes yes
and some of the people that we see in
the stable our Bernard and Charlotte
Hale you remember Charlotte Hale is one
of the VPS or you know one of the
boarded on the board of directors for
dillos and we know that she was up to
some kinky stuff last year in case you
don't remember she was the one who was
orchestrating the exodus question of
Peter Abernathy so that they could get
him out of the park and that was
actually what she had done in the season
finale was send Lee to go make sure that
Peter Abernathy got out of the park
which come will come in well we figure
out literally in the episode that
because a big plot point and then they
have this little stable boy comes in and
then the guests are freaked out we got
to kill them it's like that felt weird
to me I mean I think it's a very
clear-cut
mob mentality scene this is what happens
when you let one mob rule take over and
that was a really striking scene for me
and Bernards like trying to protect the
stop them from hurting the boy and then
was do you guys remember what the line
to Charlotte had yeah a hero don't care
don't worry about the words yes like
damn super cold that is burn yeah that's
so do you think Charlotte knows about
Bern Arnold that's what I've been what
I don't know I have some questions about
that but I'm moving on so we go back we
get to the they kill the sample boy and
then one of the when we watch it we all
were like laughing and cheering we cut
to Dolores riding on horseback firing a
rifle and it's to the music of the sting
for the money the sting why did you like
that moment so much I loved it because
they dichotomy of it it's just so like
it's such an uplifting piece of music
that makes you feel like oh god yes this
Western this piece is great and then
there's Dolores just kind of being a
badass and like shotgunning humans while
riding her horse I don't think I'm
supposed to be happy no no that's
sounding that it was really cool I mean
do you think of that moment I thought it
was pretty badass I'm not like a huge
fan of her character but like having
that shot was actually pretty cool yeah
that was kinda like payoff for season
one and then we see her hanging guests
and their guests they're a bunch of
crosses and as a cemetary and guests are
standing on it with the noose around the
neck it reminded me of the Sergio Leone
Western the good the bad the ugly when
the character of Tuco is standing atop
the grave on the cross with a noose
around his wrist and that movie Clint
Eastwood rides off the distance and like
he's a like a target shooter and able to
slice the line above his head so he's
free but Dolores is not so kind and then
what was the whole thing with like
you're in my dream when he was telling
the guests that I that's a tough one I'd
liked how she knows about her own
internal dichotomy she's like you know
Dolores feels like I should see the good
in you
Dolores feels like I should really just
be happy for you and live with you
where's Wyatt she knows there's
something wrong with you and that you're
evil and you know I I think she feels
somewhere in between I don't think she
really knows how she is
to come to terms with what she feels
about humans I think she has two totally
disparate thoughts and she needs to find
her way into that spectrum of like
actually I kind of like some humans but
that's I mean that raises a whole nother
level of how just how conscious do we
really think Dolores Wyatt is I think
she's leaning this season it'd be nice
for her to lean on her Wyatt side only
because all last season it's just her
being Dolores okay being nice and being
taken advantage of advantage of and
being assaulted and if she's like all
Wyatt a hundred percent Wyatt this
season I'm totally yeah okay so that is
all good and stuff but what about the
mana black we have not seen them yet and
the first time we see him
I forget what happens I've body's off
himself yeah Oh Teddy deals his arm okay
so yeah he heals his arm talks to his
horse which is a huge moment of humanity
for him the horse
him talking to his horse it's the first
time he's ever been truly happy to see
something and he goes up to the horse
he's like hey Ned let's have some fun
and he showers it with affection that's
not a good one he's like oh let's have
some fun because now I could die and
people are dying he's just a psychic
what I'm saying is that's the first
moment that we see like an actual
inside-the-park human moment from
William wait his horse's name Ned just
that okay so he's he comes like BAM body
body body and now the scene that I
thought was it was a really insane scene
is he meets little boy a little boy Ford
and I could barely understand what he
was saying yes like all death contact
this is why I watch with the captions on
protip we watched it with you with me
and a little boy I'd be like what and
he's just like telling me secrets I'm
like what so we see the boy see the boy
he says weird cryptic things like now I
have something for you the door find the
door okay so what is the door the door
like the maze
well good point yeah good point but what
is the door like a door into his mais
door into Seoul or the door to another
level
does
the man in blue is the man in black as
ambiguous or metaphorical as all the
things he's trying to decipher like in
season 1 when he's looking at the game
and stuff is the maze an actual maze
where he feels like if he finds a secret
door entrance he will then have another
level or is it more of a philosophical
thing I think it's all entirely
philosophical I think the difference
though is that exactly what young Ford
said the maze was made for the robots
the door is for William yeah he's like
finally I created something for you cuz
you went and shot everything so here you
go right Premium Subscription there you
go you get your my door and the entire
first season was about the host kind of
coming to terms and self actualizing and
learning for themselves that they could
learn for themselves and I think the
second season is about how the humans
kind of rectify that how they come to
terms with the fact that now these are
kind of real beings they're made of
organic material we see them get shot
and bleed all the time
now they're thinking for themselves and
improvising on a whim how do we continue
to deny them the same basic rights and
things that we have and I think the door
is the door to like higher learning and
the door to kind of acceptance in the
door to the outside world not just for
man in black William but also for the
robots well he just opens the door and
gets shot in the face I was like I mean
I know he's like a valuable character
and really like Ed Harris and his
interpretation of it but it was like
he's just a psycho who's just like I
want to kill stuff I want stuff with
real-world consequences like this is
also dead time in the real world then
and that's what you want but yeah I
think that was a really good that was a
really good kind of moving William
forward moment I think it was really
important and speaking of moving forward
we see may finally we see me so what
happens in baby now she spend time with
Lee
my one of my favorite scenes is when she
makes him like strip all his clothes and
he's just like really nervous about it
and then just hit her and the other
bandit guy forgot his name Hector Hector
had like no problem Venus it's like you
make us go naked every time you just do
a check up on us and like sit down and
buck naked it's like you could do this
Li like whatever
if I find pride in your body and your
little skinny rider body and she's like
yeah I'm pride yeah but I liked it she's
like yeah you're gonna be there you
could be naked I'm gonna humiliate you
and just be naked but also besides the
shaming of Lee there that's an
interesting dynamic thing between Maeve
and Lee cuz we haven't really seen them
work together I like that I like that
we're like in a second season of
something that they kind of like MIT
like REME mismatched characters that
don't spend a lot of screen time in the
previous met in the previous season kind
of like in strangers things too when
it's like Steve and okay yeah yeah that
was a good pairing they did that one
thing with that thing oh man that was
crazy
changer things
speaking of catching up we got to catch
up with Simon quarterman the actor who
plays Lee Sizemore and learn about what
we can expect from Westworld season two
took her it took a minute for us to kind
of reconvene to shoot the second season
and we shot we shot it all in about you
know seven months we took it all
together six or seven months
so sometimes we might like like one
episode one suddenly we will be shoot
will be shooting that and then then come
in and say actually we need to shoot
something from Episode eight and you
have no idea what it actually is the
scene where it's you know and how it
fits at that particular point so we only
got the scripts a week before you know
shooting each episode really kept on our
toes in that way we just go along with
it just but it was big it was a blast so
much fun
his relationship with the hosts in the
past has been purely functionary you
know they've been they've been there for
one reason and one reason only and
that's to tell his stories the way that
he wants them told you know
it's his stories his his lines
absolutely everything that's it to them
easy they're their props to him however
they are also part of him
you know because he's written them so so
will we see him grow as a human I think
you know but from the first episode and
in that in a particular scene where he's
stripped down
it's his first kind of I think that's a
hugely symbolic scene in so many ways in
terms of you know the the roles have
been reversed completely you know the
hosts are now in control but also for
Lee it's the beginning of the the
breaking down of him you know so will we
see him grow as a human perhaps I've
enjoyed playing Lee so much you know I
find him ending intensely interesting
character to play and and yeah and it's
funny because even though he's kind of
like comes across as being well I know
how he comes across you know he's a but
I think all of that is like hiding a
fragility you know with him that that
I've you know found really interesting
to play often on all those people with
the really puffed up egos often as we
can see pretty much on a daily basis at
the moment playing out not politics not
get to deeper than that but we see just
how fragile that is so that's been
really interesting for me to explore you
know and so I think that going into the
second season with that and there's
opportunity for that to kind of like
perhaps break down a little bit
alright that was a lot of fun and we
have a ton more clips from that
interview that will be showing you
throughout this season on the after show
but for now let's close out and talk
about our favorite moments Layne we know
yours was Lee and Maeve that is an
awesome pairing I hope we see so much
more from them yeah that's gonna be so
good
what's your favorite my favorite moment
was probably the Bengal tiger oh my god
that was so crazy like I got like
shivers when I saw okay I think it
really signifies that this isn't just an
island with West world I think we're
gonna see all six parks on this island I
think we're gonna see that for didn't
just flip a switch and awaken the West
world host I think he flipped a switch
and open the gates of hell oh well the
least visited is like the last moment
when we and the head of Delos asked
Bernard hey just work with me
tell me what happened and he says I
killed them come on yes that is 100%
scary I have so many questions like how
he killed them and his suit is like no
robot blood on him he just drowned them
one by one it was very very like a boy
do you know that this we saw previously
with the scalping earlier in the episode
with Bernard we learned that since that
point in time whatever point that was
after the crazy party that was almost 12
days later
so we're 12 days past at least 12 days
past the party so like almost a month so
there's a lot of time for Bernard to not
be Bernard for Bernard to be a different
Bernard so there could be more than one
Bernard the trailers have hinted that
there might not be just one Bernard this
season now I didn't believe you but we
took a look at the trailers and there
was indeed that shot and it's like a
meat locker there's a couple Bernards
that are like a deep storage or whatever
yes and it's you guys thought I was
kidding
I was mad cuz I thought you gave me a
spoiler and I'm like that's not in the
trailer and then we went frame by frame
and it isn't a trailer so we know that
there are multiple Bernard's and a first
we're just like oh yeah it's just a meat
locker but they could actually all be
active so the Madonna that we're seeing
might not be the Menard that we know in
our sides and if it's in the trailer it
could be like something that at least
the creator's want to get like let us
know so it's not what a maybe maybe it
was just a quick look because they just
wanted you to like drill down if you
drill down on those you get a little
Easter Egg anyway yeah I think we have a
lot of questions for the news well I
don't know about you guys but I mean I'm
just grateful that we've been talking
about this and how these delicious
drinks and and which rolls back and
season to you may have been dosing been
drinking these delicious they're called
the gold rush yes
so we're talk to Kaitlyn kilos he
teaches how to make a gold rush and
Kaitlyn's cocktail corner the recipe
calls for two ounces of bourbon
and three-quarter ounce lemon squeeze
this is kind of like a whiskey sour but
more of like a summer variation so we're
doing it over ice it's a little you know
just a nice little refreshing drink and
then usually we would do about 3/4 ounce
of honey syrup shake until it's freezing
on your hand
Hey look at that frost without tasting
based on your reaction there gold rush -
lemonade - honey yeah okay good nice
okay I'll make you one Patrick hmm since
my work area is already Sunderman oh
good and there you go so that's the
first episode thank you for watching
join us next week as we cover episode
two of Wes world so let's toast to Mays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
