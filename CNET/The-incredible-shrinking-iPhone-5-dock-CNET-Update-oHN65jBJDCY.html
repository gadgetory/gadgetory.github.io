iPhone and it's time to play the tech

mercy not update the iphone 5 is said to
have a smaller dock connector with 19
pins instead of the standard 30 pin port
that has been on pretty much every apple
gadgets since the ipod techcrunch is
reporting it talked with three
manufacturers all of which confirmed a
smaller dock port which is about the
size of a micro USB so if this is true
you're ready to dish up money for new
accessories it ain't going to fit that
pretty little charging dock on your I
home anymore Google TV has another
competitor on the way television
manufacturers LG and Philips are teaming
up to create a universal platform for

show I must admit I made a mistake i
mispronounced the name of a nap spell WA
ze the correct pronunciation is ways
personally I think calling it was e
sounds more like a nap I like to
download but there's an issue here worth
exploring and it goes beyond this
particular app the current tech culture
is full of companies and products with
bizarre spellings everyone wants to be
an Internet star and pretty much every
word in the dot-com domain has been
taken so what happens these startups go
for creative Spelling's problem is if
you're creative will anyone care enough
to learn your name here's a shopping app
you might want to say it's sugar but
it's sugar not so sweet you people to
spell that one how about this app for
monitoring phone radiation levels is it
a villain in Mortal Kombat called talc
on no it's talk on Picon my colleague
Paul Sloane said he just heard from a
startup called onus okay they just
didn't even try and then there's the
folks who just disrespect valves the
letter e gets no love from flickr tumblr
the RSS readers snacker fashion app
trendabl stop going crazy with the
valves and let's take
something we can all support compounds
what's swiftkey clearly it's for typing
score big it's got to be about sports
Flipboard social cam if you want your
app to be remembered just pick one word
that has to do with your app and another
random noun or verb and voila you got
dazzle cat cloud toss jam jump bumble
bean and apparently those are also
already taken I don't know what's wrong
with the world that's your tech news
