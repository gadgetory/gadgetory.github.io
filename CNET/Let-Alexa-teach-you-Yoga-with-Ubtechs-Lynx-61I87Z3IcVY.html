echo I tend to personify Alexa
well the Lynx robot from Oobleck is
taking that to a whole new level because
Alexa kind of looks like a person now
this cute little guy dances does yoga
can reach out and give you a hug oh yeah
it has the Alexa assistant built-in so
you can control your smart home play
music and do all the other things that
Alexa can do on top of the Alexa
capabilities this thing can actually
read your emails to you you can dictate
emails to it and it has a security
monitor built in so it's a companion
that also doubles as a security device
that also doubles as a personal
assistant and smart home controller it
is really cool in concept but when I
first heard about the Lynx I thought it
was gonna make Alexa a lot more mobile
but Lynx is a lot better at moving
side-to-side and doing those dance
positions than moving forward and back
if you need it to go anywhere it's gonna
take a while a lynx rep also said they
don't have all of Alexa's third-party
partnerships lined up yet so I'm not
actually sure how many of Alexa's
integrations you're going to be able to
use with links the lynx is due out this
summer and it's gonna be expensive
somewhere between eight hundred and a
thousand dollars probably so even though
Lynx is cute and can guide you through
yoga poses that's a lot to spend on a
mobile Alexa device that's not all that
