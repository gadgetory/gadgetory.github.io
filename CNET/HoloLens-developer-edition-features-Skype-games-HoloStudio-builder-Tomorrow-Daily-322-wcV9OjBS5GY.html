welcome to tomorrow daily the Betsy
to the universe I'm Ashley together and
I'm Jeff kanata and it is time for
headlines our first of which is
Microsoft's announcement that the
hololens has entered developer pre-order
there are a few caveats though one you
have to receive an invite from them to
preorder one and two it's gonna cost you
three thousand bucks
ouch here's the good news if you did get
accepted you'll have some fun testing
out a handful of apps and games
announced on Microsoft's blog including
Skype for hololens
a game called fragments where you solve
a crime that plays out in your own
living room and even Robo raid which we
saw a demo of at a Microsoft event last
October devices start shipping at the
end of March and we can't wait to see
what kinds of innovative ideas
developers have for hololens now that
dev kits are coming out this is kind of
what changed the game for oculus is
getting it out into the hands of
developers and really having people run
wild with it so yeah I know it's kind of
out of the price range of average people
and you you really can't even get it and
that's a good thing
I think cuz now we're gonna see the
possibilities with this device and
that's gonna make everybody want to buy
it right I hope somebody's you want to
buy it alright our second story is about
Sony and they are launching an
interesting futuristic universal remote
that actually uses e-ink as its entire
screen the hue is or the Japanese
version of the name is pronounced how
sue is a product of a kind of internal
think tank at Sony called first flight
where employees are encouraged to pitch
ideas that could become real products
hue is is the first product out of first
flight the e-ink screen would be fully
and truly customizable for each user it
would use much less battery overtime
while still displaying your controls and
potentially connect to internet of
things devices in the future the price
about two hundred and fifty US dollars
unfortunately this remote is limited to
Japan for now so no word if we're
actually going to see this remote come
to consumers here in the states this
thing looks really cool and it shows
another example of how e-ink is really a
revolution right now we're seeing on
shoes we're seeing all kinds of stuff I
think it's awesome I know - and I think
this is a great idea because universal
remotes can't predict what types of
devices you have so to be able to
customize buttons for every single thing
that you own is pretty amazing so what
story should we talk about hololens I
think we got a man AR we talked a lot
last week about VR dead but AR is sort
of happening now as well and I think we
should we should talk about on Thursday
well if you guys want to get in the
conversation you can use the hashtag hey
TD over on Twitter
yeah just shout at us using that hashtag
on Twitter and then we'll incorporate
the things you say on our Thursday
episode and with that being said it's
time for our photogra for the day
today's photogra fer of the day is Hari
who took this photo on their iPhone 5s I
hope I pronounced that name correctly
hari wrote in and said hello TD I
clicked this photo from my iphone 5s
during one of the chilly mornings we had
in Virginia during them on the February
you can see frosty snowflakes on my car
window I clicked it from inside the car
it's unedited I hope you like it and
include it in the phone tog refer
section on tomorrow daily thanks Hari
that is extraordinary look at that
really really artful picture it's so
cool like I just I love the whole you
know all of the frost is in focus and
the trees are blurry I mean this is such
a rad picture and high fives to you the
one thing I don't understand Ashley is
that February is cold February is let's
colder for us is it because it's 85
degrees outside right now not a hundred
and ten which means it's cold I don't
know I just don't understand that kind
of world you guys can send to your phone
tog Rafi to just email us tomorrow Tina
calm yes make sure you tell us what
device you took it on and give us a
little explanation of what the picture
is tell us how to pronounce your name
and also give us permission to use the
photo on show you can also find us on
social media we're all over the shop
that is it for today's show we'll be
back tomorrow with a brand new dog head
of weird a wonderful science fact mean
science fiction but until then be good
humans bye guys
