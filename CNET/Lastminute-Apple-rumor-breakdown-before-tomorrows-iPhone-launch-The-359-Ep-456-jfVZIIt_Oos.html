Ben Fox ribbon tomorrow is the Big Apple
event and the rumors are flying fast and
furious a bunch came out over the last
day or so and just wanted to run through
what we think will happen tomorrow we'll
definitely see three iPhones two updates
the iPhone 10 one called two 10s and one
rumored to be the tennis max there is
supposedly a third model that is
supposed to be cheaper it's called it's
rumored to be the iPhone 10 are a
horrible name bigger but uses lower end
components and a redesigned Apple watch
with smaller bezel potentially EKG
support which is kind of interesting
actually in terms of Apple's push to
position the Apple watch as a as a
health device and then we'll likely see
new air pods and hopefully a launch date
and price for the air power wireless
charging pad remember thing it was
announced last year and yes I showed up
since then that is a lot of stuff by the
way and there's a lot to show there are
a lot more rumors that came out
yesterday I want to break down though
what do you think of this lineup this is
a pretty stacked lineup for for Apple
right I think it's a look it sounds
pretty solid showing off like three of
the newer 10 models I think makes a lot
of sense that you know they were like
this is the future of the phone and now
they're basically moving the entire
lineup to that my concern is with the
budget phone we were talking about this
ahead of the show that it could be as
low as $700 which is a budget phone not
really or as high as like eight hundred
and fifty dollars yeah according to
analysts yeah the range varies I think
one analysts know that it could go as
high as 850 if Apple really wanted to
wring out the profits on that phone
which would really significantly change
the pricing dynamic of these iPhone a
pricing range of the iPhone right it's
always been generally 650 now 700 to a
thousand now we could see that range go
even higher yeah our colleague Chara tip
c'n who also mentioned that like the
there needs to be a refresh on the
iPhone se yep it seems extremely
unlikely they are gonna talk about that
on the big stage like they're just
like the SE they do like a very mild
show off of that the last time they
didn't update on it I think they just
increased the storage on it yeah it was
a press release yeah but it would be
nice if they really tried to emphasize a
little bit more on the budget stuff but
what we're expecting to see is is like
Apple just pushing up the price on
premium phone yet even more than before
and basically if you want to get a deal
or a bargain for an iPhone you basically
have to look at the really old SE or the
older models presumably one of the
iPhone 8 iPhone 8 will probably stick
around the iPhone 7 might stick around
we'll see but those older models are
usually where you want for those deals
wander breakdown so a couple of rumors
on products we may see there's the iPad
pro which an analyst came out said
yesterday that he expects to see face ID
smaller bezels that's been rumored but
the big thing is support for USB see not
a lightning port but actually USB
seeping the iPad pro yeah that's that's
the big rumor which can be a big change
am I wrong about this they don't usually
do iPads during like their iPhone event
they have in the past they but it's been
inconsistent maybe I had their own iPad
events in past this one they may have
too much and they might push that one to
October will likely also see a MacBook
Air replacement with better resolution
which will also be in October I would be
excited to hear right and then you know
there's the ongoing rumors the Apple TV
service which our colleague Joan Salzman
did a nice breakdown over the weekend
the TV service probably isn't showing up
this year but just in case we want to
throw it out there as a potential
potential highlights the one of these
shows oh look that's a lot you know like
I think at WWDC we were all kind of
looking at each other being like okay
well what's the headline it looks like
there's gonna be a lot to write about
tomorrow so definitely come back to CNN
to check it out that's right I'm Roger
Chang I'm Ben Fox River thanks for
listening there we go just a little a
little out there
I take one day off and you guys screw it
all up okay wait how do we screw it up
it's the new year it's the new year it's
fine for more on these stories check us
out
I didn't turn it up let's play man just
blame me we usually do
that's uh that's why you guys like
having me on
but anyways thanks everybody for joining
us it's time for the post show so we're
gonna jump into the chat and take
questions and comments for anybody who's
got some good stuff keep the
conversation going
few people don't I mean we joke about
the names and a lot of people think it's
kind of a silly naming convention there
are worse out there let's be honest yeah
some do you like it though Thomas Tiger
says X R is a good name Thomas Biswas
asks which name for an iPhone would you
guys prefer don't you go ahead and floor
that we're so much better at criticizing
no look I would like them to name them
the iPhone 9 9 got completely screwed in
this whole situation so that would put
seven eight nine seven eight nine I knew
you're gonna make that joke that's such
a dad dad jokes all right and and you
know we're gonna inevitably go over all
the naming conventions for next year
right as we were talking about it with
the iPhone 10 we were like what are they
gonna call it next year well they just
called it the 10s and makes a lot more
sense so I would have liked them to just
go down to the bare bones basic iPhone
iPhone iPhone plus iPhone mini I guess
you know kind of like what their iPad
name is scheme was yeah and though this
was a little bit confusing because the
the quote-unquote cheaper budget iPhone
the lowest cost iPhone in the lineup is
actually bigger than the yeah that's
true that is true the iPhone so that the
smallest phone lineup of this upcoming
rumor lineup is the iPhone 10s just the
regular one which is an update to the
iPhone 10 mmm-hmm same size 5.8 and then
you've got the 6.5 iPhone 10's max in
between is a 6.5 inch iPhone 10 R I
thought it was six point one six point
one okay so it's five point eight six
point one and six point five but it's a
meter one the
sighs which is really weird why we think
it's the most intriguing one the middle
phone is also the cheapest phone and
yeah the common brakes the convention
that larger phones have to be more
expensive this one is kind of a
different one I mean it uses it doesn't
use OLED right uses LCD Ron said
aluminum is so stammers I know just go
for aluminium I'm not saying it let's
say that again so that part's the
confusing thing where it's a you know
and why it's so interesting because it's
it's I think it's the food a lot of
people know after because it is big if
they price it the right way if they
price it properly closing the 7 we're
all cheap so in our minds the right way
is like the cheapest price right
yeah but a 650 if I could if if they do
then it could spark that you know
quote-unquote supercycle that everybody
was like missing last year for the 10th
anniversary they still did well right
they still did just fine yeah still true
demand for the iPhone 10 definitely was
I mean far outstripped the 80 plus right
wouldn't make sense like who's gonna buy
like at this point three year old
looking phone I agree yeah yeah anyway
where are questions bring him on all
right let's take the first one from shoe
bomb I was asking if we know anything
about the new Mac with touch ID support
yeah so the analyst from the Minko that
analyst who's known for leaking a bunch
of things accurately I talked about a
MacBook Air replacement with touch ID it
wouldn't get the the touch bar that is a
basically exclusive to the MacBook Pros
right now but we would presumably get
touch ID with okay what's supposed to
have like everything else smaller bezels
higher resolution and just sort of a a
badly needed refresh of that of that
model it's been it's old it's very long
time I'm still skeptical that it's gonna
happen we've talked about it so many
times in September in October that the
prospect of it actually coming I just I
don't even know what to say
hard to imagine sounds so dour speaking
a touch next question
Timothy do did they officially kill the
ipod touch hasn't that does that still
sell maybe the I know I know the ipod
touch was the last one that they were
selling they got rid of a lot of the
other iPods like the iPod mini and the
regular oh yeah so the iPod Touch is the
last one to actually survive and I'm not
sure that they actually still sell it
think they sell it I wanted to get to
something else by the last time I went
to a store and saw one yeah oh wait wait
wait sorry I stand corrected the iPod
Touch is still around yes I do see
multiple colors
it's they're selling so few of them but
whatever what do they care they haven't
dated in a long time yeah wrong so you
know so one thing that I wanted to like
dive into a little bit more from what we
were talking about why is what would a
newer version of the air pods like
actually look like so yeah they're doing
really well I see them a lot around in
the city so they're obviously popular I
mean it could just be simple things
whether it's like shorten the tip maybe
better or better battery yeah it could
be stuff that's less cosmetic more
internal stuff yeah thanks faster I
don't know they're I don't use their
pods I'm still a little skeptical maybe
maybe though I don't know like I'm
always worried they're gonna fall out
and they're definitely gonna make them
more expensive though if they're gonna
do yeah
again - they're gonna price it twice as
much maybe the gen one gets cheaper yeah
I guess so but I I don't disagree with
what your analysis is is that it's not
really gonna be that different and in
that case why even keep around the gen
one but I don't know we'll find out
tomorrow
next question from lost legacy and James
favor can fever excuse me combined do
you think the new iPhone is gonna
support Apple pencil oh I've seen
rumblings that's a great question I
don't think so I find that very doable
it's it's a very interesting idea
they're not Samsung yeah and it doesn't
come like they're there yeah they're
keeping the the pencil to the iPad line
making that you know its own unique
feature I mean they theoretically could
for the new 10
smacks there you go because it's a
bigger phone 6.5 it is it's one of the
bigger phones out there I think it is
has a bigger display than even the no.9
so it could theoretically take advantage
of it but I don't know if they're gonna
go down that route isn't that something
that like Steve Jobs made fun of a long
time ago yeah we just like to hell with
styluses your finger yeah it's all you
needs your finger I got ten styluses
right here that's right they cost
nothing mm-hmm the cheapest Apple
accessory you ever I mean until they
find a way to charge you for right right
right right
from Pope Allah Pro therapy what's the
best way to buy the new iPhone from the
App Store Apple Store excuse me or
carrier uh it depends on how quickly you
want it I think if you want it right
away probably buying it through the
Apple store online pre-ordering getting
up it well for us 3:00 a.m. to do it or
even before 3:00 a.m. just to get ready
that part is even when you guys get up
at 3:00 a.m. as hardcore fans slash
people who are paid to go and cover this
professionally yeah there's still people
in line before you oh oh yeah days ahead
absolutely yeah well definitely not the
store the store is probably the worst
place to go you you want pure online if
you don't care about getting it right
away I would wait a little while to see
how the carrier's push this thing
because you know a few years back they
were pushing all these incredible like
buy one get one free or upgrade for free
type deals I don't know if that's gonna
come back but you know these carriers
it's still fairly competitive
environment and I wouldn't be surprised
if they'd offer more incentives at least
a little down the line like that first
the first few weeks that that rush of
buy an iPhone there's that there's it's
just it's a pain of but because the
demand is usually constrained or a
demand high supplies use a constrained
and so there's no need for incentives
but if you're one to wait around for a
little while I'm willing to bet it's
it's probably better off for you
financially to wait oh yeah if you're
really dying to get one immediately I
agree with you the pre-order is the way
to go and like immediately when they
opened
reordering is when you would want to do
it yeah yeah if you show up at a carrier
store this happened to me with the
iPhone 6 so this was a while ago but I
showed up at a Verizon store they didn't
have the color I wanted so you know you
will sometimes find the the phone that
you want and it won't be as much of a
weight but sometimes the carriers don't
have the same stock as the actual Apple
store so that's another thing to at
least consider so yeah there are also
other phone makers by the way really
brother there are other companies that
make phones did you know that not not
this week all right from potato potatoes
it's the best screen name I've seen in a
while so leaks and rumors just started
saying that prices will be much higher
than previously anticipated what are
your thoughts yeah I mean that's I think
that's something we alluded to with with
that discussion of the analysts range
especially for that budget for the I
think not the budget fund I keep calling
it the budget phone but iPhone 10 R or
whatever was gonna be called the the
cheapest one I think that's really gonna
set the pattern or the tone for what the
prices are gonna look like you know if
it's priced at 700 you could see I guess
a more rational pricing set up but if it
starts at 8:50 which is what one analyst
suggested that throws everything out of
whack and like prices are gonna make are
just gonna jump and it's or it'll I
guess be a bit interesting test on how
what the tolerance level is for Apple
fanboys and Apple fans in general and
whether or not they're willing to pay
that much more for a phone well we were
talking about this earlier that the 10s
max is expected to hit well over $1100
yeah right so so and and if you got
increased storage it could be 1,200 or
something yeah if the if the iPhone 10
are the rumored iPhone 10 are starts at
8:50 I mean yeah you could see at 10:50
or 1100 or even 1115 right so starting
price and that's not as you said that
doesn't include like the step-up for
more memory what you kind of want to do
if you can spend that much money on a
phone you you probably don't want to get
max memory possible yeah so like to
throw it out to the chat like how many
of you folks have an iPhone 10 you know
like we live around New York City a lot
of people have iPhone tens yeah I mean
like if they have iPhone eights I don't
really know because they look like
iPhone 6s so but I I don't see any lack
of iPhone tens you know like they're
definitely around but I would assume
that other places in the country
probably aren't you know jam-packed with
the iPhone tens the same way this area
is from Carlos Martinez a I have a
question it's the iPhone 10's max boy
I'm really going to learn to hate I know
I know this is it's really annoying to
say them out loud right over and over
and over again yeah it's really awful is
the iPhone 10's max supposed to be as
wide as the iPhone eight plus and a
little bit taller uh
I think it's supposed to be right around
the same size as the plus maybe you're
right it might be a little bit longer to
fit that screen but given the fact that
they've removed most of the bezel from
this you know they're using the knotch
design that they're able to jam in more
screen I think it's supposed to be right
around the the plus size but well I mean
we'll see it we'll see tomorrow
yeah and maybe they'll have well this is
an se or - so expecting like a really
impressive new feature like face ID we
don't really like the rumors haven't
really percolated about anything like
that right like that's not no that's
that's an interesting thing that's why I
think that that lower cost phone is the
most interesting one because the in
terms of the the 10s and the 10s max we
haven't seen a lot of chatter about
anything significantly new about these
phones beyond the fact that there's a
bigger one and so I guess that's
innovation they crammed in horse home
yeah they'll probably talk up the
cameras I'm sure got improvements or
software tricks whatever that they did
to the camera but like in terms of like
we haven't heard a rumor of like a big
hallmark like that our key features well
D you know well then again there last
year when like an emojis came out that
was more like the ones we all talked
about we didn't know anything about them
going in so I'm sure there'll be some
surprises to come tomorrow
yeah software is definitely easier to
keep secret than hardware so that's
that's a big reason why yep here's a
good question from lost legacy how much
do you think the tariffs are gonna raise
the price of Apple's new products good
question yes so well Apple Apple did
submit some paperwork they filed some
paperwork to say that the tariffs were
going to directly impact a variety of
their products I don't think that the
iPhone was actually included in there
for some reason even though they are all
made in China yeah so is it is it really
gonna substantially impact price that's
hard to say because Apple makes such an
enormous profit off of these phones that
would they be willing to take less money
to make sure that people didn't get like
such a shock from the rice it's that's
hard to say because they have a very
loyal fan base and it's been proven time
and time again that they're willing to
pay up maybe this price increase that
we're seeing now is it could be tariffs
or later no it's not if it is tariff
related when the tariffs go away they're
not gonna lower that you guys got used
to this price we're just gonna take more
money oh yeah
yeah but yeah that's definitely a good
question and definitely expect to see
Apple talk more about that because they
did file some some paperwork with the
government no no no not tomorrow but
like there this isn't the end of like
tariff discussions so definitely look
out for that Josef Gauss wants to know
what do you guys prefer iOS or Android
operating systems oh we can't play
favorites I use both yeah I use both
yeah same I mean like I use both I
switch to Android last year and it took
a while for me to get used to it but you
know the concept of it being more
customizable is totally true with iOS it
is a lot simpler so sometimes it is nice
to jump back on my work phone which is
an iOS phone just because it's it's
easier to use but you know you are a
little bit more hemmed in so it's
exactly what everybody always says about
the two they both have benefits and they
both have yeah they're just I feel like
they're just different you know they
have different each of them have
different quirks of them
and muscle memories different muscle
memories required for different
operating systems but I don't I like
them both for different reasons I know
that's a lame answer but uh yeah I'm a
fence sitter - I just jumped to Android
a little over a year ago and I like it I
like it just fine but I also did not
hate iOS right but uh there's nothing
about iOS it's gonna come dragging me
back now that I'm on Android yeah same
here
I totally agree totally that's about
where I sit on that one myself yep
people seem to be pretty okay with like
the new iPhone 10 I don't know like all
the different gestures and the face idea
yeah I never use kind of annoying at
first but you get used to it mm-hmm
we got time for a couple more not much
time though Samara McCoy do you guys
think the phones are gonna be fully
waterproof they should well there'll be
ip67 water-resistant what's that like 30
minutes yeah I believe it's 30 minutes
yeah exactly
it's not waterproof that's that's
definitely a big misnomer that that term
gets thrown out way too liberally
waterproof means like you basically
throw in the pool forever and leave a
sign this definitely has a time limit to
it so it's not it's not waterproof but
it will be water-resistant like the
previous versions from James fever again
what are the pricings for these upcoming
phones and let's go ahead and expand
that what do you think is going to be
the most popular one amongst the three
hmm so the pricing is still unclear we
were just talking about that earlier
like the cheapest one could range
anywhere between 700 and 850 and I think
the rest of the pricing scheme will take
its cues from that imagine the
subsequent model will be $150 more than
the next one it's the same so we're not
sure the price range could be anywhere
from 700 to a thousand to 850 to 1150
1200 sounds about right
yeah if we're following patterns at
least yeah and as far as the most
popular at least at this point we're
anticipating that the iPhone 10 are
because it's the cheapest one there are
there are still alive cheapest one but
it's the biggest one and
you know most people don't care whether
or not it's stainless steel versus
aluminum or OLED versus LCD if it's a
bigger phone and it's a lower price
that'll be an interesting one that that
really kind of makes puts the the
original 10 s the five-point inch one
that one can put in an awkward position
this is more expensive it does have
higher in specs it's got a better camera
most likely but it's also the smaller
one and I think most consumers who want
to spend this kind of cash on an iPhone
preferred the larger one yeah it's not a
plastic body it seems to me like if this
is the phone that they're describing
they've figured out the right way to do
a cheaper phone as opposed to doing the
5c yeah which was like a plasticy phone
with a bunch of rivals it was colorful
but like it just didn't sell people then
people weren't that into it wasn't cheap
and that's why I don't think they're
gonna use the the C name yep it's C
stands for cheap you know
that's right just enough time for let's
do 2 more which processor brand what
Apple used in the new iPhone lineup that
present well they use their own
processor their own design chip it's
based off of arms design but that was
the thing they don't use Qualcomm chips
which is what a lot of Android phones
use they do they do design their own
chips there are manufactured but I think
Taiwan Semiconductor and at least one
other company but they are their own
design chips that's but it's often like
the secret sauce to why their phones
tend to run faster than some of their
Android counterparts so so the bigger
story line is the modem though so let's
get it yeah yeah so obviously they've
been in a middle of a legal battle with
Qualcomm which is the biggest supplier
of modems had been there their only
supplier was up until I think two years
ago when that's year or two years ago
yeah when they split between Qualcomm
and Intel I'm not sure what's going into
this phone whether it's like the
expectation the expectation is is it's
all Intel okay and that could be a
concern for a lot of folks because
intel their--their modems aren't as fast
as the qualcomm one so you're buying a
phone that could be slightly hampered
our regular consumers gonna notice
probably not but still you're so giving
a lot of money this is a modem
connection that's for the network
connection so that it's pretty it's
pretty important
this isn't processing speed so it's not
how fast your your phone runs in terms
of running programs it is about the cell
connection whether or not you connection
be faster and yeah it's you rightly
point out Intel has generally been a
generation behind in terms of speed you
know last year
Qualcomm got to a gigabit LTE connection
first and Intel was still kind of well
behind we'll see if the Intel catches up
I think it's believed that Intel will
supply all the modems this time around
but that's one of those things that's to
be determined we we have to wait until
someone breaks up in the phone actually
like looks at the parts before we can
really confirm what's inside
someone called Bill Detweiler there we
go closing thoughts will iOS 12 be
released tomorrow or later and Scott
Myatt says I heard there's a rumor going
around that there's gonna be no
headphone adapter in the Box this time
is that gonna bother people I did hear
that rumor I heard that rumor too that I
mean that'll bother me I like those
dongles cuz I keep losing them I need
more toggles the dongle I almost dropped
it in the middle of the street recently
oh it's so tiny and I'm sure it costs
like twenty-five dollars to replace it
right are they doing iOS 12 tomorrow
do they usually they don't it's usually
like they will announce a date for you
to download it it's fairly it's not that
long you you it's like a week or two
before you actually get iOS 12 I would
not download iOS 12 at least when it
first becomes available it's usually
buggy they use have to run patches or
updates I'd wait a few weeks wait a week
or two at least before download iOS 12
just get the kinks out of it all all
right before we wrap it up couple of
closing thoughts fantastic questions
keep flooding in but we are out of time
Alex Mitchell wants to talk about the
oneplus 60 in the near future
Josh Boyd is looking forward to possibly
