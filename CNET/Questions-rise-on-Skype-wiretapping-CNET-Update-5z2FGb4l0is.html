conversations I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update microsoft is
refusing to give straight answers to
reporters about its skype service and
whether or not it can allow wiretapping
of conversations that is if law
enforcement wants to listen in
previously the online chat service was
so heavily encrypted there was no way
for government to eavesdrop on
conversations but skype just made a
change to its network technology and
some say the changes make it possible to
intercept a call but when asked
Microsoft didn't admit if wiretapping
was possible wiretapping has been a hot
topic recently because as more and more
conversations head online to services
like Skype police have no way to listen
in to these online calls the FBI has
been pushing for online services to
build back doors for government
surveillance and that's why everyone's
thinking this change at skype could be a
backdoor to help the FBI when the
Olympics kick off on Friday you'll be
hit with global games goodness from
every side of social media and Twitter
of course is included as part of the
deal with NBC Twitter will have one page
that pulls in all the millions of tweets
sent by athletes fans and NBC reporters
over the course of 17 days big-name
brands have bought ads for the Twitter
page so hey would you look at that
Twitter's making money the news
aggregator dig which was just bought
last week by beta works will apparently
beginning a new look with a relaunch on
August first so we're keeping an eye out
for that the samsung galaxy s3 is the
hot phone of the summer and samsung is
reporting that it shipped 10 million
units but it didn't give specifics also
samsung has a surprise announcement for
august fifteenth but a good guess is
that it's the debut of the stylus
friendly tablet the samsung galaxy note
10.1 we first saw the 10-inch tablet
screen at Mobile World Congress it's the
cousin of everyone's favorite phablet
the Galaxy Note but as for the hot
tablet of the month the 16 gig version
of Google's Nexus 7 is out of stock at
the Google Play Store it's listed as
coming soon but you can still get the
eight gig version although you'll be
waiting for almost a month for it to
ship
looking ahead it's a safe bet to expect
that apple's next operating system
called mountain lion will be released to
the public this week so Mac users before
ya pounce on this upgrade to version
10.8 don't forget that you'll first need
to have the previous version installed
called Snow Leopard it's also a good
time to do some hard drive housekeeping
and backup your system you can find all
the details on upgrading as well as more
