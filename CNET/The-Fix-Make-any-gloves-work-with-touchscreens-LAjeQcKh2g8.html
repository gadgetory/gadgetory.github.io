gloves available for purchase but if you
don't want your options to be limited or
you already own a pair of gloves that
you love there are a couple of easy ways
to make any gloves work with your
smartphone or tablet the reason that
gloves don't work with your screen is
because the fabric blocks a static
electricity from your finger so we need
a way to channel that electricity
through the glove the way to do that is
with conductive thread you can find the
stuff online for about 10 bucks I have
my thread a needle and my gloves the
plan is to sew a few stitches into the
fingertips I want to be able to use with
the phone in this case it's my index
finger and my thumb for the thumb I'll
put stitches closer to the edge of my
finger which is where I would touch the
screen for a pinch to zoom gesture
now if I did this correctly it should
work with my screen it won't work with
my fingerprint scanner of course but I
should still be able to unlock my phone
and enter my password oh yeah it works
perfectly let's try that pinch-to-zoom
if it's not working for you or the
connection is inconsistent go back and
add a few stitches to make sure there's
a good connection between your finger
and the conductive thread another way to
make your gloves touchscreen friendly is
by using a product called nano tips
it's a conductive liquid specifically
designed to make any gloves touch screen
friendly and according to the company
this will even work on those thicker
leather gloves in my case I have another
pair of regular knit gloves that I'm
going to try this on but this time I'm
going to make sure that there's a buffer
between two sides of the fabric for that
I'll use a spoon so just put the spoon
up through here and the way nano tips
works is you just use the brush to
completely saturate the fabric whatever
part is covered by nano tips should work
with your touchscreen if you let nano
tips air dry it'll take a couple of
hours but if you want to speed up the
process you can use a hairdryer and that
should only take a couple of minutes
feels dry so I'll take the spoon out and
give this a shot okay so if you're
finding that it's not responsive you
might want to go back and add a few more
layers of the solution to make sure that
there's a really good connection but
once you're there you should be able to
use the gloves with your touchscreen
with no problem and what's great about
nano tips and even the conductive thread
is that you should have enough material
to take care of more than one pair of
gloves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
