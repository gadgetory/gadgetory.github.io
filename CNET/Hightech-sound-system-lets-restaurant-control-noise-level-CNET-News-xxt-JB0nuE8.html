restaurant in Berkeley California it's
almost a little bit of cognitive
dissonance where you look around and you
hear all this noise and you think I'm
not gonna be able to have a conversation
and then you sit down and realize that
there's this little bubble around you
restaurant owner John paluska was able
to achieve that bubble with the help of
acoustic engineer John Mayer you have to
kind of what we called amp the
restaurant or get rid of the fact that
it you're in a cave to do that several
the restaurants wall panels are lined
with burlap sacks over tectum an
absorbent acoustic material this
painting behind me is more than just
wall art it's the latest in acoustic
technology made of a special canvas and
stuffed with recycled denim it's
designed to absorb any unnecessary sound
around us the real acoustic magic comes
from a system of microphones and
speakers throughout the restaurant the
microphones will pick up our
conversation with you technology then
you can then isolate the table but not
carry it anywhere else
no occupancy mode paluska and his staff
can control the level of the playback
through a simple iPad and iPhone app
designed by Meyer sound and we try to
maintain the music at a sort of
consistent level in relation to the
sound in the room
well paluska hasn't seen a direct
correlation with sales he says diners
appear comfortable linger longer and
return for repeat visit it's easier to
have a conversation than most
restaurants or whatever they're doing is
working really well and that is music to
any restaurant owners ears in Berkeley
