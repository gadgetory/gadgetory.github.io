samsung has finally pulled the plug on
the note 7 with a second recall telling
all owners even those with replacements
to shut off the phone and exchange it
for a different model the company has
permanently stopped production of the
premium phone that's prone to Catching
Fire the nightmare of recalling two and
a half million phones globally escalated
into a mortifying disaster for the brand
after so-called safe replacement models
also started catching fire even though
the phone is dead the drama isn't over
yet customers now have to deal with the
headache of getting refunds or getting
carriers to exchange the phone again
the whole recall also raises some big
questions that Samsung still has to
answer for starters what is the source
of the battery fire malfunction after
the first recall Samsung pinned the
blame on a production error from one
battery supplier but there are doubts
over that reasoning when safe
replacement phones still had the problem
even though they had batteries from a
different source
was the rush to produce batteries
quickly the cause for more errors at a
different factory there's another layer
to the mystery several note 7 phones in
China also caught fire even though the
Chinese models were said to have
batteries from a different supplier for
consumers to trust Samsung again the
South Korean company needs to break down
exactly what went wrong and what steps
it is taking to avoid this from
happening in the future there's also a
question of how much damage this has
done to Samsung financially some
analysts have estimated to Reuters that
it could cost the company as much as 17
billion dollars and then there's the
matter of repairing consumer trust Wilke
samsung ever make a no date or is this
disaster so bad that it won't make
anything called a note again there's
still a large fan base for these larger
note models if you have a note 7 write
to me share your experience or what
phone you're trading it in for or if
you're going to hang on to it I hope you
don't but some people have already
commented on our Facebook page that they
want to still use the potentially
explosive phone please
that's it for this tech news update I'm
