the traffic signal you're at also shows
up on the instrument panel you see how
long the light will be in its current
state also what speed to maintain to hit
the lights without stopping and starting
that waste brake pads and fuel and the
cars automatic start/stop system gets
smarter because it knows the future of
the light not just your pressure on the
brake pedal no matter how much you
shrink down that processing power you've
got to get data on what the state of the
traffic signals are in the metro how do
you do that replace millions of traffic
signals with something that beams
information to cars that's not practical
instead the way Howdy's got this working
is they've tied into the network
operation center of the Metro traffic
system big cities all have this that
data on traffic light state gets sent
over to English dot - Audi's
headquarters process into the right
database structure for the cars to
understand and then sent back out to
them through the built-in outtie data
radio and the MMI head unit that's a
long way to go to move that data but it
doesn't take long and it's an efficient
way to gather the information as opposed
to getting every light in the city to
talk to cars that's just not practice
and since this is a mostly passive
technology it wouldn't suffer the
hurdles that face regulation and
acceptance of self-driving cars for
example what's really happening here is
momentum conservation a key but
typically under some concept in vehicle
maintenance and fuel consumption
reduction
