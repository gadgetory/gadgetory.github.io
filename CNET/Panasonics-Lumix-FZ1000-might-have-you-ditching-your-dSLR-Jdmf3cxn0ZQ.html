for any fixed lens camera that has the
look of a digital SLR this however this
is a true bridge camera
I'm Josh go mussina and this is the
panasonic lumix fz1000 it's a camera
that has a lot of the control high-end
performance and advanced features
someone considering an SLR might want
but with a high quality fixed lens with
a flexible zoom range the combination of
its 16x f - a - f 425 - 400 millimeter
lens 1 inch 20 megapixel image sensor
and a powerful image processor deliver
excellent photo and video quality its
sensor size is about 4 times larger than
what you'd find in your typical long
zoom camera the bigger sensor gets you
better images but it also requires a
larger body and lens the camera is still
smaller and lighter than even an
entry-level SLR with anything close to
an equivalent zoom range but there's
enough room for direct controls to
important settings a big high-res
electronic viewfinder a flip-out LCD and
a hot shoe for a flash
you also get things like a zoom or focus
ring around the lens solid image
stabilization for photos and video clean
hdmi output and a mic jack shooting
options run the gamut from full auto to
full manual and the settings menus are
so deep that there's just too much to
mention here and even after a lot of
testing I'm still finding things you can
read the full review on cnet.com but at
its current $800 price you're getting a
great camera that does double duty for
stills and movies unless you really want
or need digital SLR photo quality this
is the next best thing given its size
performance in price I'm Josh :
and that's a very quick look at the
editors choice winning Panasonic FC 1000</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
