to the show that's all about the good
and bad inside the world of Apple we
call it the Apple bite because it's a
catchy name now let's get to the show
and it's official apple recently sent
out their colorful invitation for their
expected September 10th event with the
tagline this should brighten everyone's
day and it really did Oh it'll be held
at Apple's headquarters in Cupertino
just like they did when they announced
the iphone 4s and the smaller venue on
apple's campus leads me to believe we
won't be seen any big surprises so what
can we expect to see well if you've been
watching the show the past few weeks
it's really no secret at all we're
expecting to see two new phones with the
iphone 5s that's rumored to be coming
not only in white or black but also a
gold champagne color change that
intrigues me and possibly even graphite
now apple retail employees and t-mobile
employees have been issued vacation
blackout dates that indicate a sep
tember 20th iphone 5s launch date
feature wise the rumor mills point to
the same exact screen size and form
factor which we've pretty much accepted
now unless they've tricked us all in
yeah that has to be it now there's
possibly a new a7 processor a 128 gig
option and improve 13 megapixel camera
with a dual LED flash and possibly a
fingerprint scanner for security that
looks like this one from SW box.com and
that's really the biggest key to me a
fingerprint reader might not be the
sexiest thing but the next evolution of
the smartphone is to become our wallet
there's all these different mobile
payment standards out there competing to
be the one google wallet tried but it's
clumsy and it doesn't work very well and
now i've used phones that could be used
as true wallets back in 2005 when I was
in Japan and looked almost exactly the
same age and they worked seamlessly and
I know it's no easy task at all it will
take time but if Apple wants to get some
of their mojo back make our phone a real
wallet
that works oh and a battery life yeah
make that super long to all right if
you're using a fluorescent there's a lot
of you out there I think you're really
going to love the 5s with the new
hardware for you and iOS 7 so Apple is
trying to make it easy for everyone to
upgrade with a recently launched iphone
trade-in program at Apple stores you can
get anywhere from one hundred twenty
dollars to as high as two hundred and
eighty bucks for your iphone and the
convenience of doing it all in one place
but other trade in services like gazelle
huh not that gizelle this gazelle offer
up to 340 bucks for an iphone 5 trade-in
depending on the model so that might be
worth it to you now the other phone were
expecting is the iphone 5 seat with its
plastic shell coming in a variety of
colors that no one has told me they're
excited about it's going to target the
lower end market in other countries and
we've really seen almost every color you
can imagine in case you want to pink
this is what it might look like now
Apple also sent out invites to Chinese
media for a sep tember 11th event with
the timing only making them several
hours apart from the US announcement and
fueling rumors that China Mobile will
finally launched an iphone all things
the also reports satellite events will
be held in tokyo and berlin now iOS 7
will round out the announcements and
it's a big deal for apple moving forward
after using 7 the whole time in going
back to 6 i'm a fan of 7 even with its
hello kitty look and the top two
features i've used the most one the
control center and number two
surprisingly iTunes radio and it's
really that good plus I should also
include the lock screen I use that every
time i unlock my screen now the big a is
released six versions of the iOS 7 beta
so is pretty much ready to roll right
now between the 10th and the 20th now
iOS 6 was released two days before the
iphone 5s launched last year so we'll
probably see something similar for the
5s but what could be that one more thing
you know that
one more thing that Apple no longer
really does well there's rumors of the
eyebrow I've been told that's not
happening which is a total bummer and
they surprised everyone with the mac
Proteas at WWDC no one saw that one
coming even if only maybe four percent
of apple's user base will buy one so
what could it be guys well GigaOM
reports that a recent bill of lading
from the US Department of Homeland
Security shows apple recently took in
three shipments of set-top boxes from a
known partner in China as recent as
August the 18th now could it be an
updated Apple TV Kern Apple TVs are
labeled by their part number n is
definitely not the Apple TV TV they were
small shipments either with the first
Wayne over one metric ton that's over
2,200 pounds and the other two shipments
were over 16 and a half metric tons each
so that's some serious hardware we may
or may not see but there's no indication
we'll see anything like Samsung's Galaxy
gear watch at this keynote if that's
your kind of thing but it feels like we
already know exactly what to expect so
we'll wait to see what Apple officially
shows us on sep tember the tenth plus we
already plan to see another event in
October featuring new iPads the new Mac
Pro OS 10 Mavericks maybe even macbook
pros and possibly even IMAX and mac
minis now we want to hear from you the
Apple biters your thoughts on Apple's
announcements so send me your emails to
the apple byte at cnet com or tweet me
at brian Tong and will include some of
them in next week's show now i'm
honestly excited how can you not be but
i'm not really expecting to be blown
away but hey maybe they'll surprise me
we'll just all find out together all
right that's gonna do it for this week's
show i'm brian Tong thanks for watching
I will catch you guys next week for
another bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
