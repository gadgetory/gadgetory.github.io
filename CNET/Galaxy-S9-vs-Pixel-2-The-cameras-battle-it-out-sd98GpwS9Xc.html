9 and the pixel 2 all day and I got some
great shots and when I look at them on
the phones the ones of the Google picks
are to look good but the ones on the
galaxy s 9 with that screen look
fantastic but I'm not gonna stop there
brings both of these phones back to the
office and let's put these photos on my
computer and really compare them pixel
to pixel in everyday situations under
good lighting both cameras Excel to my
eyes the pixel to consistently renders
photos full of detail with a wide
dynamic range the galaxy s 9 is
brilliant at photos with little to no
noise
you know those blurry specs and the
photos taken in dark environments
alright let's take a look at these
pictures I took from a scenic overlook
on Chestnut Street the image from the
pixel 2 has better dynamic range in
details notice the Golden Gate Bridge in
the distance but the galaxy s 9 footer
looks more true-to-life the texture the
leaves appear more natural than the
pixel to the galaxy s 9 is the only
phone available today that can switch
apertures in low-light situations like
nighttime Street scapes and inside
restaurants the galaxy s 9 switches to F
1.5 the widest aperture found on any
phone here are pictures I took of a
building a Nob Hill before sunrise the
pixel 2 picture has more noise look
closely at the clouds in the galaxy s 9
shot it's remarkably clean and looks
stunning does this mean the galaxy s 9
is the low-light King yes and no while
its images no doubt look brighter and
have less noise than any phone I've
tested the pixel 2 handled high contrast
low-light situations better take a look
at this shot inside zeitgeist bar the
galaxy s 9 photo has no noise in it but
there's blown highlights on the menu
board and motion blur from people moving
around
and the pixel to snot you can read the
mini board but there's noise in the
shadows
then there's portrait mode both phones
offer it portrait mode separates the
person in the foreground and
artistically blurs the background when I
showed portrait mode shots to people who
were the subject they overwhelmingly
preferred the ones taken with a pixel to
noting the detail and sharpness in the
face the galaxy s 9 produces portrait
shots that are slightly more
natural-looking and softer on the
details many times shots have
inconsistent blurring for example the
right shoulder might be blurred but the
left one is in focus or eyeglass frames
might be partially blurred out when it
comes to video the pixel 2 image quality
is good but I really like the punchy
saturated video look from the GAO cs9
here's a cable car I've filmed with a
pixel to the image looks good here's the
same moment recorded with a galaxy s 9
there's just a bit more color and things
don't get lost in the shadows as much
then there's slo-mo this video was shot
at 1080p and 120 frames per second on
the pixel - here's the same moment
captured with a galaxy s 9 in super
slo-mo aka 720 HD at 960 frames per
second less resolution but way more
dramatic oh and notice the music well
the s 9 automatically selects music -
under school your video don't worry you
can change it why would you queue the
Samsung super slo-mo montage
you
the slow-mo lead has been buried the s9
offers slow-motion footage in 1080p at
240 frames per second a first for any
Samsung phone this is better suited for
capturing longer clips of slow motion
and the higher resolution makes it look
great and let's not forget selfies here
are selfie videos I recorded with each
phone the one from the Samsung looks a
little more saturated though there's
like the wall behind me here looks a
little blown out highlight wise the
pixel 2 things look a little less
saturated but it's holding the
highlights and shadows better I'd be
happy to have either phone in my pocket
at the end of the day it's all about
dynamic range for me and I find myself
using the pixel to more often to take
photos</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
