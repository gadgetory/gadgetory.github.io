buzz report first off I want to thank
all of you for the cards and letters you
sent while I was in my snake bite
induced coma not I can't believe you all
liked that clone better than me
well too bad people that's the last
you're gonna see of her or her little
friend Hector for quite some time
anyway now for the gadget of the week
the gadget of the week is the Alienware
Aurora ma LX gaming a laptop now this is
like a super-high-end 19 inch it's 20
pounds never mind gaming laptop with
incredible performance and speed but the
best part about it is that when you open
the box you'll find all kinds of crazy
extras there's like a pen a keychain
there's this t-shirt here which even has
a collar look at that there's some
really nice headphones actually these
guys there's uh oh yeah you get a nice
gaming mouse
it even has extra weights inside so you
can trick it out just perfect it's got a
luggage tag obviously and you need that
it's got this crazy like leather
portfolio thing guess if you take some
notes on your gameplay and then all of
that gets packed up in this humongous
backpack now I know this all sounds
pretty generous until I tell you that
the ma LX starts at $4,500 now that
changes things for you doesn't it now
you're thinking like t-shirt forget that
where's my bottle of Cristal at and now
for the news the entire economy of the
online role-playing game EVE Online was
disrupted this week after a huge savings
and loan scandal occurred in the game a
con man tricked hundreds of players into
putting all their money into his bank
and then ran off with all the money now
the game players are furious and they
want the authorities to get involved of
course the legal arguments have stalled
since it turns out that none of the
money was real but I say so what if the
money wasn't real the feelings were
after a deluge of complaints from
customers and a sudden interest from the
FCC Verizon has decided that it like
BellSouth will drop new fees that
appeared to replace federal fees that
those telcos no longer have to pay both
BellSouth and Verizon recently tacked
these new fees onto your bill and they
just so happened to be the exact amounts
as these federal Universal Service Fund
fees that they recently got to stop
paying the difference of course is that
the new fees went straight into Verizon
in BellSouth pockets and the old fees
went to library schools low-income in
rural areas
we asked Verizon in BellSouth why they
drop the new fees so suddenly and they
replied busted amazon.com this week

RadioShack laid off 450 employees at its
