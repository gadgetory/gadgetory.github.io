shopping I'm Bridget Carey this is
you're seen that update Facebook is
testing new ways to get you to shop
inside of Facebook the social network
has been tinkering with new types of
shopping advertisements for a while now
you may have noticed ads that's girl
from left to right with boxes that
reveal a different product from a
company's collection but when you click
on an item it usually takes you to an
outside website that could be slow to
load so Facebook now wants to keep you
browsing products longer inside a
Facebook before you leave it's created
some new complex ads to browse products
that are designed similar to a catalog
also under the Moore section below your
list of friends events and groups you're
gonna see a shopping section which puts
these ads in one feed for you to peruse
this summer Facebook began allowing some
small businesses to sell items directly
on Facebook pages and now those
businesses can list items in this
shopping section it'll also eventually
be a place to see items for sale listed
by any Facebook groups you belong to now
only if there was an eye-roll reaction
to show Facebook what we really think of
a shopping feed as you may have heard
Facebook is testing new ways to respond
to someone's post beyond a thumbs up
like button there are these animated
Smiley's for haha yay Wow sad and angry
along with a heart for when you love
something so you may use the angry or
sad to support someone who shares bad
news instead of liking it but it still
could be tacky to do that instead of
just leaving a comment Facebook only
rolled this out to users in Spain and
Ireland so far and speaking of bad
reactions here's one that may upset your
stomach Pepsi is making a Pepsi
smartphone I can't believe I just said
those words
there have been teases about it on the
Chinese Pepsi social media account Weibo
and a few Android blogs are posting
leaked details about a Pepsi branded
Android phone being unveiled in Beijing
next week on October 20th reports of the
parts suggest it's a decent phone it's
called the Pepsi p1 and the total price
would be really low the equivalent of
200 US dollars guess they think this
Pepsi
generation won't mind a logo for a
discounted average Android phone well
here's the funny thing about a Pepsi
phone any text or I say next is gonna
sound completely logical by comparison
so how about this the streaming video
service Hulu is working on a virtual
reality Channel to launch next month
it's launching in time for Samsung's
gear VR headset which requires you to
snap your smartphone inside to watch
anything the gear VR cost $100 and Hulu
is commissioning a series that is purely
virtual reality and it's also working on
a short film called the big one won't be
long before we get virtual reality
commercials that's it for this tech news
update and there's more at cnn.com
from our studios in New York I am
