welcome to tomorrow daily sub s key talk
show in the universe I'm Ashley sceva
Jeff de nada is out doing another job
for somebody else of which we feel very
jealous but for now here's your
headlines one of the best announcements
out of Star Wars Celebration was not a
trailer was not a sneak peek at anything
it was a set of drones we've shown you
fan-made Star Wars drones but these are
official propel we'll be making these
quad copters available for purchase this
fall there are four different designs
and X weighing a TIE fighter a 74 Z
speeder bike with a stormtrooper on
board and of course the Millennium
Falcon they'll hit speeds of 40 to 50
miles per hour in the sky are
hand-painted and even have little lasers
on board to pew-pew your enemies propel
says they also plan to add
pre-programmed cuts to the in-app
control so you can finally recreate your
favorite space dogfight from the comfort
of your backyard they'll cost between
200 and 300 bucks when they're released
in the UK later this year and hopefully
we will hear when they're headed to
other countries soon especially my
country because I want to buy one if you
guys have any interest in the human
brain which I hope you do because you
all have one
the human brain map is about to get a
major upgrade since the early 1900s
we've been using a map created by
neurologist Corbin Ian Broadman to study
the human brain soon this map will see a
big update mostly due to the work of the
human connect to me project which is an
effort to update this important
information through actual patient data
and machine learning the team involved
took 210 healthy adults and collected
information about their brain structure
and function then fed that data into an
algorithm that was able to mark distinct
regions of the brain this algorithm
popped out 97 never before described
regions of the brain
adding to the 83 scientists already knew
about from Brad mins original map future
use of this new map includes studies of
human evolution and giving more
information to neurosurgeons and other
doctors who treat the brain whether it's
surgically or otherwise
so that is your headlines for this week
this is both exciting in scope but we
can only pick one for Thursday's show
and I feel like it has to be the new map
of the human brain because really you
guys it's our brains it's the most
important thing that we have going on
inside so I'm gonna say map of the human
brain and Jeff and I will be discussing
out on Thursday show if you want to get
in on the discussion I want to choose
the hashtag hey TD over on Twitter and
we would love to feature your tweets on
Thursday's show that is it for your
headlines so let's check out our phone
talker for the day our phone talker for
the day today is Anthony who sent in
this photo he snapped on his iPhone 6s
plus he says this is my dog Alou in her
usual resting position you have my
permission to use these pics and he says
these pics because he not only has this
picture which he took with his iPhone he
used Prisma to change it into a
beautiful painting yeah that looks
amazing I feel like I could see that in
an art museum it's gorgeous
and your dog ullu is adorable that is
our photographer of the day if you guys
want to do that our theme is pets we
only have a few days left thing will
extend it I don't know we got a big
announcement about the show on Thursday

peanut calm and you got to include four
things one permission to use your
picture on the show two what device you
took your picture with because it takes
me wild look at your eggs if data and
I'm lazy three tell me a story
preferably giving me your pet's name
inside said story and four make sure you
tell us how to pronounce your name if
there's any remote chance that we could
mispronounce it because we would hate to
do that that is it for today's show I
will be back tomorrow I definitely back
Thursday so I'll be here all week by
myself I will be back tomorrow with a
brand new docket of weird science facts
made in science fiction but until then
