it's time for the 359 podcast episode
140 with Roger tang and Jody solzman
good morning everybody how are we hired
morning happy monday it's Monday we got
to find your new catchphrase happy
morning happy man happy money's not a
catchphrase I was just trying to be nice
all right what are we talking about
today we are we're talking about the new
the reviews for the macbook pro with the
touch bar are out this morning so we are
we talking about the sentiment around
the interwebs without mega Pro you know
our own dan ackerman was pretty pretty
high on it pretty enthusiastic but you
know there was some definitely some
caveats they're just looking around the
web the the reviews are kind of positive
to lukewarm so kind of break that down
for you I will also talk about Mark
Zuckerberg talking about again on the
issue of fake news items period and the
trending topics site and you know he was
a little dismissive of its impact on the
elections last week and you know you can
make an argument that some of those fake
stories given the sheer amount of
stories that are appear on Facebook even
if you've got like one percent that's
fake that's a huge amount of stories and
then lastly Joan had a very fun
interview with one of the stars of the
new harry potter spinoff movie prequel
movie yeah dan fogler uh who is the he's
a muckle he's the one the nomads nomad
she's the one non wizard
so we'll talk a little bit about the
interview it was a fun it was a really
fun interview he's a really fun guy and
you do this channeling James Lipton I
tried yeah so all right why don't we get
started as always if you have any
questions about any of these topics
leave them in the comments section Brian
will pick out the best and try and
answer all right cheers to listeners in
Greece Columbia Jamaica and everybody
else thanks for joining us we're gonna
get this podcast recorded and be back to
enter your questions in three two
welcome to the 359 when we talk about
the top tech news of the day no the crap
we want to throw in I'm Roger J I'm Joni
salzman so the reviews of the macbook
pro with the touch bar are in in the
sentiment is positive to lukewarm our
own den Ackman believes that it's
ultimately worth it to splurge for the
touch bar but notes pretty pricey and
that's that's a sentiment that Walt
Mossberg and with the Brewers shared and
said that he noted that this will
probably upset Pro users because it's
not quite the probe like the macbook pro
in terms of its ability to serve the
creatives why are likewise said if
you're in aspects that you might not
like the fact that Apple called this the
pro model just because it uses
underpowered or older Intel chips and
then there's this decision to go you
know all us bc which you kind of had
this expense when you bought the macbook
i bought the macbook and i was all
gung-ho about the butterfly keyboard and
sooth in it so thin and sexy and i got
the gold one and it match my phone and i
was i was taken in by all the flashy
glamour yeah and I really regretted it I
disliked it so much I had to return it
yeah um for a number of reasons it
wasn't powerful enough for what I needed
and that's on me I got something that
wasn't powerful enough for the tasks
that I was going to try to use it for
but um the tangles man are rough yeah
and especially if you're a pro user if
you're using it for if your photographer
and you want to offload things quickly
there are ways to get around it might
already be part of your normal routine
but a lot of people just like having a
USB are having an SD card easy to slip
in and you pull them off and you slip it
out and not having that thing among
others is it's just a hassle so the
macbook pro I mean especially this touch
bar one comes with four USBC port do you
still in your mind would that be enough
to kind of alleviate your shoes or is it
still
it's dongle mania and you still can't
really guilt that well one of the
hassles that I had when I had the
macbook was that it you had a limited
number of those you use USB sees ya
inputs you have a lot more on the pro
and so if you're okay with the dongles
that you use my problem is that i had to
power it and in load things and do all
this other stuff all through basically
just a very limited number of porn so I
but it's hard to say that anyone be
would be really jazzed about having a
lot of dongles to do what they could do
easily but true I mean I guess you've
got a laptop bag you can put your dongle
yes at the end of the world it's not
like a phone where you've got to carry
dongle for it I mean I got the new
iPhone and i lost my headphone jack
dongle within 24 hours I lost it so just
I don't even know where mine is yeah
well whatever i switched the bluetooth
headphones but alright so next up
facebook CEO mark zuckerberg said
finally kind of admitted that uh you
know they needed to do some more work in
terms of cracking down on the amount of
fake news and hoax stories that end up
in the trending topic section it's still
come a problem I mean he was still a
little dismissive kind of fitted the
fact that these these fake stories
didn't really have effect on Elections
right but that's I don't we think well I
think that when you say one thing to one
group of people and then say a different
thing when your back is up against the
wall that's telling so Facebook do they
tell marketers that they're not able to
influence decisions like is that what
they tell people that they want to get
their money no they tell marketers and
advertisers like we can help you drive
purchase decisions but when their back
is up against the wall they're getting
criticized for something they don't want
to admit might be something that they're
doing unwittingly right the answer is
look it's only a small part we don't
really influence how people think right
so they know you know what it's one
percent but considering the sheer amount
of volume stories I show up on Facebook
one percent is still huge huge a speck
is huge right it's huge so lastly you
had a chance to talk with Dan fauxhawk
one of the stars of the new harry potter
movie that fantastic beasts and where to
find them yes catch them okay all right
got it I don't water so I mean what
would you think what was he like he was
super fun and one of the
he's a really funny guy he came from
theatre he got a Tony it was claim to
fame his first big splash and public on
the public scene was he got a tony award
for one of his plays he's super funny a
really great comedian and one of the fun
things about interviewing at this point
before Fanta speaks he comes out was
that he was so grateful to be part of
this thing that's so much bigger than
him oh yeah I like I mean it his life's
gonna change yeah French when I was
talking to him it was only supposed to
be a trilogy it was only supposed to be
a trilogy of gigantic of a gigantic
budget movies and now they're gonna make
five of them it's just he feels really
lucky and that's really sweet to see
someone who is very talented and also
very genuine about being grateful also
you should check out the entire video
interview and story I'll we're at CNN
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Joanie salzman
thanks for listening I definitely
recommend checking out that interview
since i had the pleasure of being in the
room for that and and helping shoot that
I didn't get to edit it but I did watch
it this weekend did you like it it was
so funny you did such a spot on James
look yeah figuring out if we could get
it across that that's what i was doing
like how to get people to understand cuz
it's a very specific homage yes uh it
was a lot of fun i was a good color on
he was in on it so I mean yeah it was
all into it I mean you told me ahead of
time so I kind of knew what i was
looking for right myself but it was
pretty great I hope that people like it
I had a lot of fun doing it with him it
was he's a really funny guy are you
looking forward to the movie yeah I mean
I read all the Harry Potters I liked all
the Harry Potters actually i want to say
i just read the screenplay for the you
know i haven't read that yet yeah pretty
good actually a little surprisingly dark
I didn't hear Potter got real dark yeah
it seems aren't sure with the audience
yeah I guess so it's not dark in the way
the end of the last color books were
dark is sort of almost more emotionally
dark which is guy was good is it sort of
a good uh I should read it itself a good
payoff yeah so we got a couple of good
comments in the chat we have a
perspective from Jamaica so thank you
Michael for for chiming in alright says
the exchange rate is just not favorable
in their parts the high prices of these
premium laptops putting them out of
reach yeah I mean I don't know what say
about that is not not as in a calm i
guess i would only say like you should
start looking at windows laptops because
there are a lot of we had the surface in
here it was real cool well the surface
is also pretty expensive
true but there are like you know folks
like Lenovo and soos and all these other
guys they make decent laptops at a good
price and yeah like it's getting to the
point where these things are a little
out of reach like for me and that's
silly isn't that that defeats the
purpose the laptop is supposed to be
like the everyman computer am i right
another trying to force that to be the
iPad or the tablet or such well that
would be true but we are talking about
their high-end laptop I mean the pro
appears to be the most expensive one for
professionals but now with the right
saving and financing I in college
figured out how to get myself a macbook
right was still attainable and I wanted
it for specific production type related
meetings I think the issue is it is that
it's not just our high-end like this is
like their laptop at this point right
yeah they're not updating the low end
and that's that's what kind of irks a
lot of people yes the fact that there
isn't really a good low end option at
Apple any more like you kind of have to
go to look at windows if you want an
affordable options Bobby says the the
next macbook is going to be an empty box
no disk drive no magsafe in the USB SD
card over and for for professional
photographers no buttons no screen 999
it's lighter than air because it's yeah
it's gonna start sending you an
etch-a-sketch after far-off people would
still line up to buy that day um our
buddy Michael back in the chat uh he
thinks that the Facebook fake news issue
is colossal because you know Google
would definitely get their ass chewed
out if they had the same yeah what's the
word I'm looking for fallacy well yeah I
mean it's definitely a different they're
both monolithically large and
influential tech companies right and so
Google has to approach the way it
delivers you information in that it at
least on the surface that it's providing
you the most relevant objective
information and it can there's no value
judgments in it but unlike facebook
facebook is based on only telling you
the things that are going to get you to
stay engaged right and in there in
there's sort of this problem where the
only things you want to hear are things
that maybe aren't true yeah um and that
means like that's where you raise the
question like those facebook have
responsibilities beyond just be although
like the things like trending right it's
also what's trending and what's
necessary training is
what you need to know right I mean well
how hard would it be to implement
trending and trending for you okay well
apply the subjectivity put a headline on
it that states this story that says Kit
Kats are a viable dietary option to fill
all the food pyramid for brian is a
great story does that mean it's true no
it's for Brian right I die I think they
do have to do better job just squashing
fake stores in general like that's just
I feel like that's a pretty big issue
it's got to be as some cut off between
trusted sources and even then we have a
lot of people who are not too thrilled
with some of the more quote unquote
trusted sources over the past few months
there's a lot of subjectivity a lot of
bias and then also I can see where
forstman oozes news stories Facebook's
in a hard place because when they had
when they had human curation of the
trending topics thing they got flamed
because what happened was regardless of
whether or not they were acting
inappropriately the lack of transparency
meant that when right-wing sources
tended to be deflated inside trending
topics that presented the appearance of
bias yes whether or not that was legit
bias it probably was a little bit in
some cases whether or not that's because
fake news or less reliable news maybe
tends to skew towards a right-wing thing
maybe that's part of it that was part of
what facebook i think has said in the
past is that or no there was a new york
times story that said they tested out
something that would remove more hoaxes
and fakes news but it disproportionately
affected right wing publishers i think
you could call demographics into that
age group supplied age groups involved
with social media versus age groups who
are perhaps aggregating news through
google you know it's hard to say
especially facebook has become much
broader in the time but remember
Facebook started as a college platform
strictly one demographic not one but
much well now it's also been ravaged I
mean it's all billions of people there's
no like extends except for the kids who
are all right except people that are
under 21 what a Facebook let you elect
their aggregators their their filters I
mean like like you get to vote for who's
on the curatorial team sure I mean
don't think any any item that would be
groundbreaking that would be yeah but
also how effective would that be like
they're also publicly traded company I
don't think that they would yeah I mean
just to be realistic I don't think they
would let that like popular vote weigh
in on strategic decision yeah like that
trying to think outside the box here no
it's fine bridging from that michael
says what can Facebook really do to not
let fake stories appear in the news feed
because they're going to vet stories
first and Facebook would lose the appeal
of instantly reaching your audience I
mean I that's definitely one the dilemma
that she pointed out to like the fact
that they had human curators initially
that they got a lot of hot water for
that they they ended up you know
squashing that already so I don't know
maybe it's that's where I guess we're a
I and algorithms come in I don't know
like some something that kind of helps
detect or verify facts I guess and it's
it's really tough I Facebook is in a
really difficult position now I know
what they good answer is there's also
the consideration to that Facebook can
be abused to take people's ability to
have a voice away from them like the
fact like the example of the Vietnam
what is it the Vietnamese the Napalm
girl no doubt that was censored and
accounts that posted them were blocked
because in a bubble like in a vacuum
that does violate Facebook's Terms of
services there's a naked underage girl
in the picture but it's so significant
for world history that it it's beyond
the pale to believe that that doesn't
have some sort of meeting that's beyond
just child pornography and that's why
let me go back decades if people have
tried to sent that out of actual literal
history books yeah basically this
obviously but similar situations but the
issue the point that I mating is not so
much censorship it's losing the voice
that those accounts lost their bank they
get banned until Facebook's like oh wait
maybe we shouldn't be banning people
over stuff that's obviously considered
something that's culturally and
historically significant I mean stuff
with it and it happens with other people
to that post something that is offensive
to one group but is protected maybe as a
free as a free speech sort of thing but
because there's a request to take it
down and Facebook just hasn't built up
to its you know as a criticism they
haven't built up the ability to be able
to effectively and quickly monitor a way
to keep someone who has a legit reason
to post something allow them to connect
it to continue to have their voice on
facebook if it's a legit purchase they
people get banned for reasons that they
should it is hard to find that middle
ground where you can it's not properly
fill to yourself because you should be
able to opt-in opt-out of what you do do
not to a certain extent to the the
finite degree like if you don't want to
see risk seeing anything don't get into
a social network when there's so many
cooks in the kitchen and here's a
question okay do we think this will
change people's minds about using
facebook is Facebook going just suffer
from this I feel like people are people
live on the folks folks who use Facebook
come that's that's how they use that's
how they connect with people like it's
having this one little controversy I
think it's not going to do much to
change the overall impression or utility
of facebook I would agree to that do uh
here's a question for me should we just
start another social network called
bubble book we get to stay safely in
your own little bubble that's the
problem with kind of an echo chamber
right oh god it's it's it's weird to
think about though like because we've
been with facebook since the beginning
there are people being born into the
Facebook generation yeah yeah and they
don't know any better any other option
like this has been the the penultimate
for a lot of people's news delivery yep
and there's a lot of people who do
depend on it where they live maybe in a
secluded area where they don't get
things like cable news radio signal
certain other aspects other optional
deliveries Facebook right online access
yeah yeah Oh tough to think um looking
for some comments what else do you
thinks gonna wear what do we got going
on this week like give us a little
preview down the down the boy he's going
on this week um she's almost pretty
quiet well I've got that google photos
event that's right tomorrow so tomorrow
if you like google photos that app that
backs up all your photos and stores them
off your phone so it doesn't eat up all
of your phones drive there's probably
gonna be some updates about that yeah
don't know
yet what is gonna be but we will give
you all the details when we get them
mm-hmm actually I'm a big fan of google
photos is it a lot yeah I i have google
photos on flickr miss flickr for a while
have like no limits on storm photos like
no compression yeah and then now it's
like if you want a user now that I guess
I don't one joined it's like start
charging things like if you want to
automatic download tool that costs money
like it's gotten really shady and no
like what's that now like should I just
pull it all out of yahoo cuz cuz it's
yahoo and i know security issues but i
donno clickers really cool way back when
yeah for the eyesore well before yahoo
bought it before yahoo about it super
cool there are a lot of cool things oh
yeah it's not entirely yahoo like also
like the rise of other social networks
yeah and like yeah like Instagram didn't
exist when flickr alright yahoo bought
flickr I think didn't exist or just
barely I can't read the timelines messed
up I can't know I know you foot
Instagram was around but it wasn't
anyone yours yeah and it wasn't owned by
Facebook at that point no oh any other
questions I just a good comment I think
that's why google+ was pivotal for
situations like this um yeah being that
it has a google+ plus pivotal for like
two words it's it I mean it is kind of a
oxymoron to a sense but Michaels been
listing off some facts and I can revisit
these later about how Google Plus itself
has a more structured algorithm and how
it's been Oh in terms of like filtering
unit corrector fishing different items
whereas Facebook is really the only
major social network in a situation like
this he use the word tyrannical huh wow
that's pretty harsh it's a bold
statement okay it's based on the
background right like Google+ it's using
sort of the same kind of theoretically
objective search algorithms as Google
does right sure right it comes from a
different place absolutely so I don't
know let's see it's not gonna stop me
from using facebook no and this will
certainly be an ongoing thing over the
next four years certainly to see where
social networks kind of branch out since
Trump kind of owned Twitter for a minute
there oh yeah um last great cuz no one
else wanted to buy Twitter so
he could rim shot he was gonna buy the
Buffalo Bills to it we were gonna have
that really nothing yeah there was some
quote that he said a while ago that he
wanted to buy the Buffalo Bills he got
outbid by the guy who owns the Sabre is
also a buffalo and if he had owned the
bills he wouldn't have been like he
wouldn't have felt compelled to run for
president if you own the bills really
yeah don't blame me oh gosh that would
have been a worthy sacrifice I'm sorry
all right sorry I'll stop there uh are
you but I'm just for I'm from Buffalo
from the Buffalo area husband's from
Buffalo they're the only true New York
team to be fair everyone else plays in
Jersey yeah yeah that's true yeah and if
you're a bills fan you are a bills fan
for life because you deal with a lot why
would you not like yeah yeah okay come a
bills fan now had to be born that way
yeah that'd be all that bandwagon all
right well let's wrap it up thanks
everybody let's wrap it up if you like
anything you saw her here check us out
