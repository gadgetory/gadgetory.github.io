whenever you're ready ok good roll let's
start recording in three two welcome to
the 329 when we talk about the top tech
news of the day all the crap you want to
throw in I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox
Rubin and with us is special guest Scott
Stein's I yeah happy to be here you know
that let the mocking begin so are
scotland's here Scott is here
specifically to talk about the the
review of the walk Apple watch series 2
which is out today I just came out today
the day momentum you can also on on
friday right so what number six god what
did you think so
oh I liked it and it is definitely
better however if you have an Apple
watch original just update the software
yeah everyone's like do you get the new
one no unless you like are desperate to
swim with one like really swim with one
or you are a GPS person I might actually
take up swimming just because of a
pelagic because it says you can yeah yes
and they were like they're swimming
wearables already but there aren't that
many of them and and we actually need
you a lot more swim tracking one thing I
am NOT a gym person I try I fail but
also we were doing like four products in
a week so we are going to be doing a lot
more of that testing and seeing us going
to a lot more of that testing running
but bottom line in water it's fine
bottom line though is this is this a
watch for not someone who's not an Apple
watch owner now like is this a watch
worthy of investment uh it's a lot of
money that's a thing but if you were
looking for I think it's the best
SmartWatch right now let's talk about
dollars and cents what's the cheapest
price I can get this thing for 369 for
the thirty eight millimeter it's a lot
of money 400 for the one that's the size
that I would want to wear which is a 42
millimeter then you're going to go to
stupid tan with all that with all the
different but ceramic one right that
that way at least more yeah at least
there's no 17 thousand dollar gold
dishes they was good I that one yep
you're all set I do not like any of the
high price smartwatches you know I
understand the idea I guess but I mean
they're collectors item weirdnesses I
would go for the Affordable thing
especially if you're using this for
sports stuff you get the aluminum that's
a lot of money right other than the swim
proofing what did other killer features
are we getting with this new watch right
so it's really a sport edition thing
you're talking about like the swim
proofing which is just generally good
for water resistance in electronics I
like that trend um GPS which is on a ton
of fitness trackers already but a lot of
smartwatches they actually Andrew where
have been starting to include it Apple
integrates it although we haven't seen
in all the apps and then it's a brighter
display so you can see it better in
broad daylight it's faster to so that
what that means between that and the
watch os3 is the thing was so slow right
last year right and now it's doing a lot
better job handling everything including
siri the apps though have not all been
updated to take advantage so to kind of
see how it's really going to perform but
it just feels like it's working better
mmm so shifting gears well laid before
we do that all right you can listen to
the boys are we do need to listen to and
then it is this that's a the sound of
how much expelling water that's so on if
you happen to swim with it you know I
don't think you have to do that but it
clears out the speaker um totally weird
it's a your jacket is now dry that's
what it's like the feature a nice yeah
right alright so shifting gears I wrote
a piece looking at sort of the lack of
Android wear watch updates coming for
this holiday season you know the notable
names LG motorola huawei right don't
have any new watches for the holiday
season a sous does but no look is one of
Sue's whoo ah but susan lee because it's
cheap but a hardcore watch people look
at our like the thing with cheap
smartwater think of it is the it's a
broader issue for me like the people you
care about smart watches Apple watch
included like that i would say question
okay outside of the apple watch i would
say no they don't care about smart
watches but they still care about what
Apple is doing with its watch I would
say that's a little different and I've
seen two different camps on it I've seen
people who say sky I've taken off my
Apple watch I am perfectly fine I'm
never wearing that thing again and other
people are like no sky I wear this thing
all the time I really like it it's great
and I'm like I bring up something I have
an issue with and they're like no no
it's great and so it depends on how
people adapt to it battery life still to
me is a big issue yeah so I talked to
the butcher I talked to a bunch of the
companies and I think they acknowledged
on those issues battery life the size
just getting these components down to a
size that actually is more manageable
for a lot of people like a samsung
galaxy with the gear s3 its massive yeah
so it's still an issue I think
smartwatches definitely a long way to go
bring it home baby for more about all
this Apple watch series 2 smartwatches
check us out on Cena I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Ben Fox Rubin I'm Scott Stein thanks for
listening and let's delve into the comet
all right but so fast yeah I know really
and that was long yeah I read that were
I well along too yeah man don't forget
okay good show so first of all could you
run the audience through what different
water tests you put the watch through
because they're saying like how
waterproof is waterproof it's not
waterproof but right
water-resistant okay so they're right
water-resistant so we actually going to
be doing a lot more water tests during
the time that I used it I used it for I
mean nothing like the 50-meter stuff
that you know we're eventually going to
have to you know look at pressure in
almost things but you know I kept it in
a you know water sink for a while like
you know a guy was like seven more like
15-20 minutes I showered with it and and
I you know just worried as I would
normally wear it now swimming we still
need to do and that was those mentioning
as you need to swim test when you do all
that so stay tuned and also about how it
does swim accuracy for fitness tracking
because they claim the algorithms on
that are really good for calories we
were in a super short time frame for
this I think was about two days less
than the normal review time frame yeah
they would get for four products so it
was kind of like we're putting this out
but we're also going to be updating it
most importantly we've not looked at
apple watch series one at all and I feel
like that's going to be the one that
people are going to want to get if they
get one because you give up the swim
tracking but it's probably gonna perform
similarly so stay tuned for that and
also we want to see how the original
apple watch handles watch os3 holden
series one is a new product yeah just
the last year's model no they updated
the prot they upgraded the processor in
there to what they say is the same
processor that's in this year but it
lacks gps and lexie pass but it's a
little weird because the any get
confirmation from apple yet but if you
look on the specs page it's like it says
s2 chip for series 2 s 1 p-4 series 1
and i'm looking well and there's no look
there's no benchmark you're going to run
like a right geekbench for Apple watch
um so I don't be fusion right so I don't
know what that means they still claim up
to fifty percent faster and then watch
os3 is already making things faster
because it load stuff in the background
yeah that's how it that's what it means
by fast is not really like starting an
app from scratch will still cause the
churn wheel a little bit but it it front
loads all the apps that are in your dock
to always be available no cash is that
okay all right that's a long answer sir
list for the 859 no no that's out that
fine
how fragile is ceramic is it as fragile
as the jet black no so the Apple boasted
ceramic is what is a four times stronger
than steel etcetera doesn't explain how
necessarily scratch proof scratch
resistant it is but ceramic is super
tough they said they talked about this
whole like bonding process with the
powder or whatever at the ilume whatever
they put in there for that ceramic
material so I mean for the price you're
paying the jet black is the same cost as
a regular iphone that's just a new
anodizing aluminium process right a like
kind of tried to make it look lacquered
the ceramic is a much tougher material
so it should be fine however I can't say
how it scratches or even how it lasts
because we haven't worn one we have one
of the one of the points we brought up
the Apple watch earlier that the whole
swim resistance thing allowed our
commenters mentioned they didn't really
want to go swimming with it not because
of the water but they were afraid over
my leg not gonna get the pool or
scratches that well I don't know is that
I mean do you think that's without risk
that's still about risk if it's a valid
risk when you wear the watch around like
I keep knocking mine into doorknobs it's
nothing like what they like well I don't
talk all my doorknob impacts your door
dogs are actually all die can you get
everybody's fill it or not we're just
clearly the wall is i scratch against
walls and railings and um so you know
it's the wood is that their eye on X
which is like a gorilla glass variant
for the front you get the you get the
sapphire crystal still on the steel and
the ceramic variants which is more
scratch resistant because people have
talked about the fact that there are
scratches that do pop up on the sport
series watches yeah um I haven't heard
of any shattering but um as opposed to I
don't know for some reason I feel like
there haven't been many like shattered
Apple watch images I've it's interesting
that might mean that the newest apple
watch still doesn't have corning's
newest glass which is the sr3 and that
was in that was in a gr s3 the gear s3
and that's supposed to be sr means
scratch resistant so yeah you know me an
apple made no further claims or boasts
and so that leads me to think that it's
the same um you know I feel like any
iteration on design they are because you
would hear ya they love to talk about
every single beneficial iteration in a
temple
my power to them I yet to the micro
millimeter you know focus so yeah uh we
can confirm with that but it still says
INX glasses that is the wording um i
would expect it's still going to scratch
against like if you have like yeah
that's that's a thought in a pool um
yeah which is also by the way not to
geek out too much on corning but we also
don't know if the new iphones have the
newest form of Gorilla Glass which is
Gorilla Glass five the important thing
to know about that is that you could
drop it from a higher height from like
quote-unquote selfie height and then
won't it's less likely to shatter so
that would be helpful they have stopped
talking about Cornyn like they haven't
they haven't talked about it no a long
time I guess it would give me a little
bit more peace of mind if I knew that
but they don't you're not getting a new
phone anyways all right fine also
variation or their own supply of
whatever the glass is and they are doing
what they're doing before the watch for
all of them yeah yeah where it's the
kind of exactly this type of talking
about Gorilla Glass there there however
sourcing it but it's like not coming in
the same channel it's like I don't know
I don't know I don't know the answer to
it but it's is interesting to talk about
that as a concern for me with iphone is
the sure it survives I've said this all
along sure it survives our drop in a
puddle but would it serve high for the
impact with the pavement under the
puddle yeah you could have a shattered
wet phone ooh so I don't know what to
see we'll have to see how many
variations on that again we have not
done dropped testing on these yet no one
I know has but we will I'm sure start to
explore that I have a large supply of
iphones i am personally oh my
microphones acting up and i apologize
for that i'm personally more concerned
about your walk if you're bumping into
so many things in life are you okay oh
my general doorknob or what impact I'm
very clumsy Dora people detection yeah
that's a good for a reviewer that way
you can torch I'm concerned about it too
i stumble at a scuff against things the
hardest thing about looking at these
watches and I come across this in
fitness trackers is just the natural
thing is like I'm not a gym person so no
hey why am I looking at a fitness
tracker well it's funny because we have
Dan Graziano here
is a super runner hmm I came upon this
looking at wearable tech but now if you
say the industry is all about fitness
yeah but then there are the fitness
aspirational people we all want to tried
it so I think for the average person who
doesn't understand how to get on board
this it like myself yeah and I stole I'm
a guys like me yeah and I try to get it
i'm not ignoring and I'm not eating like
awful things I am actually trying but
it's hard right and I'm also searching
for I'm switching systems all the time
which you're not supposed to do right
but I just giving you an inside look of
this like I I'm always trying to think
about how these are doing a better job
at motivating me and then someone like
Dan is looking at I've got a regimen I
like how do these work from my pretty
serious regimen and I fee like those
both ends are equally important Apple's
now making claims at the harder end yes
and so it's got reading this
aspirational lifestyle where like yeah
um it's almost like Nike it's like I'm
gonna be the swimmer I'm gonna be the
basketball athlete I'm gonna be the
triathlon person and when I met with him
I was like they're like you ready for
almost like we're almost ready to cry
i'm sure i'll do all those things I'm
gonna be so fit with this brian are
there other questions for more comedy
confession not right now man my
microphone is shot today uh sorry for
everyone listening if you do have
questions and comments especially for
Scott we've got here for a limited time
only let me tell me I'm a mcrib we have
the expert the guy who spent a very
intimate week with the iphone 7 an even
more intimate week with the i watch her
babble more night recalled something
said what other than one other things do
you have in you like what other separate
products I'm in like a really bad blind
date with the air pods the in a blind
yeah yeah you're prob ad famous that
worst ever yeah you know I was like in
the middle of the NDA review and so like
if I became a meme and I was like oh Shh
I was like a crap and you can't really
do anything or say anything either right
for the NDA I was like well there goes
and and then everyone was like Scott go
and read it now let's talk to people
right I was like this no let's not do
that I didn't want to go the reason I
don't want to go on
is because ama you should be able to
talk about everything right there like
always imagined ama ya ask me anything
oh cool do you have them on you ok let's
not make this error let's change it back
to ask me I mean do some lawyers yet do
I don't hop on reddit for you for the
two people left the kid like sky that's
all no no people so careful how ugly the
air pods are yeah it's fine dad they
were making fun of you on CNBC already I
know this week no it's like a deep
lingering thing so I've been scoble eyes
with the with the airpot ago so I this
your inner shower when that happens so
that's the thing that's a big plus I
started to think about Cirie in the
shower with Apple watch and then I
thought that will be a scoble moment oh
yeah enjoying Syrian is actually that's
a great thing is what Siri Siri like
telling you don't forget to soak your
bad let's make one little that would
suggest oh no Scott how's it going down
there haha so um no relation anything so
I was just saying that when you use
these things in showers which I water
and any people to understand first of
all very important iphone is a different
water resistance it is not really for
swimming don't swim with that thing
where would you put it what how did you
swim with that's just a somebody
accidentally putting your yellow yeah
yeah you'd like the dirty in front of
your chest as other cool movie everybody
let's go on them Buffalo let's watch
gangs of new york so like I but the
point being I don't know so like you the
if you do that water in capacitive
displays is like skitter dance madness
like everything starts like dancing
opening some weird like magnifying think
packed up because it all treats it like
touch the Apple watch during the swim
modes shuts down the display that makes
sense so and that's fine you use the
crown interact but that's why what I was
going to say is that what's people turn
about checking your email in the shower
I'm like okay no but you could actually
talk to Siri in the shower so with Apple
watch what schools if you you might want
to do that be like you're in if you're
in the shower and you just like thinking
about something it's like a lot i get
aside my best idea i'm on you could
potentially like set an appointment or
like check your day
worth like somebody's calling you could
like answer the call sorry I'm a shower
it sounds like are you what is wrong
with me hey listening to me so much and
oh my god I cannot wait for the day
that's just what I call you up you're
like hey Roger for the shower no need
hey up it's okay let's we give you this
conversation keep talking let's do it no
I feel like but there is I'm just saying
you could operate your Apple watch that
way or you can like set it to music if
you had to connect their bluetooth
speakers you could change the music and
listen all right right right you but you
have a quite I was like a horrible idea
I'm just saying we do have some
questions what is the nanometer of the
a-10 fusion and uh what the charge here
the check you know I don't think what
that ever disclosed they don't talk you
sure my chip architecture yeah yes so
their asshole was not talking about a
nanometer I when I didn't mean oh yeah I
wouldn't even want to guess I'm assuming
it's similar to whatever the samsung one
is at this point samsung is that I
haven't been covering chip technology
for a while so I think 40 nanometer is
the latest one yeah but we don't look it
doesn't make a difference but we don't
know faster it's smaller it's a big it's
a black box as far as you know what that
stuff is but actually an apple keeps
things pretty they're pretty case they
don't talk about yeah I'm more curious
about the how the cores work and what's
going on with those cores because they
have the two high power of the two low
power and they automatically you know
they're like behind Android and resolve
their that's the core man they got a
quick though that's the thing i love you
seem like we're course is usually better
sure more is always better okay that's
the problem of discerning what that
means in apple speak and what's going on
in the in their phone and their software
is really hard to understand right
because they don't like a lot of things
they just go it just works and you're
like well when does it work and when is
it not work and what's going on there
like don't worry it works in a way that
you don't have to worry yeah bro we're
trying to actually observe that while
we're at it you talked about the air
pods but you tried the lightning cable
yeah headphones to what is your response
to those i mean to the actual headphones
they're fine
to the idea of removing a headphone jack
it bothers me a lot it bothers you so
much should we lower the rating a little
in it because of you other than that the
phones are better because yes that's the
whole thing this is a port I you know I
get it we may move to a wireless future
but there are a couple of problems and
I've been reading a lot of stories on
I've been thinking about it one is
obviously that this this has been around
for a long time and you don't need to
adopt the future yep you're being forced
to 12 inch macbook USBC didn't have to
buy that macbook they made an additional
product to the line this is the main
event right so now what are you going to
do the second thing is you've always
proprietary formats so it's like is it
as simple as Bluetooth or Apple's going
to try to lock down things with w1 chip
into a different direction or like I
know everyone was in agreement on one
thing and now or you already have this
between lightning and USB so by weight
theoretical question if Apple had just
switched to us bc would people be as mad
probably not probably not because
actually would be a great
acknowledgement of hey we're all in one
world together we're all drivers
especially for charging open up a whole
new world absolutely and I was not
interested in playing that game know
their ages i don't want some people were
like a blah blah blah I've heard a lot
of you know blah blah blah but this is a
I've heard some reports again I don't
know whether they split like some people
say the USBC on some things is not
working that well that there's a lot
different variances law there are there
definitely different variants there the
vendors have concerns compatibility
their vet we get with accessories
exactly the vendors have options in
terms of how many features they want to
tag on to us bc so yeah there's def
folio it's very despairing but as a as a
regular consumer i say blah blah blah
because you know what blah blah blah
Apple pudding from papa they put a USBC
port on their macbook so it's like well
you did that right why couldn't it be on
an iPhone yeah that's the I'm not an
engineer side of things where you go
when you know what of course you could
and and yeah that's the thing is you're
just left without one so that's my
problem with it you got the dongle
someone's going to forget the dongle or
you'll end up now but six months to a
year down the line I'm sure you're going
to be able to pick up those dongles at
Duane Reade and everywhere else or
they'll give them out with headphones
because Apple is a big force in the
industry and that happens but it doesn't
remove the fact that it's going to be
I don't know initially I hate for a
while it sounds like a panel I've been
served recommending I think I think a 6s
plus is which cost less is probably a
fine direction also always update your
your phone to the new OS to see unless
unless it's on day one yeah that's not a
good always wait then up daya but then
try it before you upgrade your phone
because you might be perfectly fine with
the update and what it did for it anyway
be like you know this awesome like I
don't need a new phone Riley we may have
known a few people who got brick oh yeah
so Brown we have one last question first
of all I want to make comment that i'm
waiting for artisanal dongles decorative
donna yeah it's gonna be a new market
that is so true oh my god Carrodus
opening exit easy go go for this already
go on second of all when is Sierra
coming oh I don't know who knows adamant
questions in the comments people want to
know when Sierra is coming soon we were
hoping it would come yet we thought was
going to come out with iOS 10 right you
know everyone kind of speculated that
we're all kind of surprised but Apple
louise if i could haven't given us any
advice come with a new macbook yes I'm
saying I which would be elected in which
is over yes still speculative well let's
expect let's expect an October event
yeah and maybe I don't have to go out to
that one but we'll see we'll see I'd
start packing yeah that's a char was
saying I'm start packing I was like I
know she is what the hell she should
take us a couple there are several
things we ever heard about from Apple a
couple other shoes dropping obviously
macbooks the other thing is smart home
because now the question is is it just
like they're just gonna keep doing it
and that's it but they had a big you
know they invited a lot of us to come
check out some stuff and talk about
smart home before the iphone event and
it's a big war that's being battled
that's our Kentucky team does that yep
but between what's at home and other
things and I keep think about that w one
ship which allows things to pair I'm
like do they have another announcement
coming in that territory I have a
feeling there's going to be something
related to that by the end of the year
or maybe not but I just think related to
home kit they've really been in my view
very much an also-ran compared to the
yeah Alexa definitely so hey I mean
they're either going to come out with a
serotype Alexa thing
um echoecho which is rumoured at this
point it seems easy to do I mean I
imagine how it would serpian no-brainer
for people to pick up that's the thing i
would amana less it's like three hundred
dollars which is sort of the apple way
sure what amazon selling you know now a
fifty dollar yeah you know version so
