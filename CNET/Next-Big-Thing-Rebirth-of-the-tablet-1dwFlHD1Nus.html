Cooley from cnet in search of the next
big thing tablet sales have been
shrinking for some time the tech biz
that's a def now even Apple's iPad line
basically synonymous with the category
has been on a lengthy sales slide that
certainly wasn't tapered off in the most
recent results down another twenty
percent in volume in fact laptops and
tablets are becoming the new battlefield
this is a shift as opposed to a complete
retreat notice how laptops are becoming
more like tablets with detachable
keyboards for example and often changing
from a desktop style interface to a
touch style one when you do the
attachment or detachment you also find a
lot of laptops now that emphasize their
flexibility like what Lenovo does with
their yoga line on the other hand look
what's happening with tablets they're
getting more powerful and more immersive
and a little more serious in their use
case than they used to be there for
going after laptops examples of this
would be the Apple iPad pro or microsoft
surface pro 4 suitable for all but the
most demanding computing and creative
tasks something you wouldn't say about
the earlier tablets and hit the market
this all represents a shift in
battlefield as the tablet is now less
head-on against the smartphone trying to
be a phone with a bigger screen and
instead is becoming more of an
alternative or complement to the laptop
with greater usability portability and
flexibility it looks a lot like chapter
2 and not chapter and know what's next
