out from school they spent aimlessly
wandering around with your friends free
from any sense of real responsibility
parents I know you love them but let's
be real you can't wait for school to
start back up this year disguise your
resentment of their youth with some
great pet gifts I'm Donald Bell and in
this top 5 I'll be counting down a
handful of my favorite tech for students
pick from scene that's extensive
back-to-school gift guide starting off
at number five a portable bluetooth
speaker kids have so many ways to stream
music and store music on their phones
these days but the only time you
actually hear music over speakers is in
the car to change that by them and maybe
yourself a great portable bluetooth
speaker our senior editors pick for the
best option under fifty dollars as the
cambridge soundworks UNS I don't know
when the Swedish Chef started naming
products for cambridge soundworks but
it's a great value and it comes in a
couple different colors too first step
up try the Logitech UE boom which looks
kind of Swedish but actually has a name
I can pronounce number for keeps the
music theme going headphones I put this
one higher on the list because a good
pair of headphones is also great for
blocking out noise it's also a good way
to get some peace and quiet when your
roommate refuses to turn down there
oontz and also it's a good low level
defense against creepy guys who are
trying to talk to your daughter for
under hundred dollars check out the
v-moda remix for a stylish great
sounding pair of in ear headphones but
for maximum dbag repulsion and over-ear
headphone like the sony MDR v6 will do
the trick nicely coming in at number 3
in HD TV now I know it sounds
counterproductive but if you send the
kid off with your old Zenith and a pair
of bunny ears you're basically forcing
them to befriend that kid with too many
Bob Marley posters and enough trust fund
money to have a pioneer kuro in their
dorm room for under four hundred dollars
you can get the vizio III twenty iao and
spare them from being held hostage at a
brew your own kombucha party
number two is a slam dunk for both
parent and student it's the apple
macbook air thousand dollars guess you
want have seen that's favorite laptops
it's beautiful it's fast has all day
battery life and best of all it's
incredibly light you think about all the
books your kids off to lug around
settling them with the heavy laptop just
seems cruel laptop like this is good for
productivity and it's good for their
spine all right and finally my top pick
from the cns list of the best
back-to-school tech gifts the samsung
galaxy s4 our editors consider this the
best smartphone on the market right now
and unless your kid is nerdy enough to
be as phone snob already this phone will
seriously rock their world like any good
parent though you should give that phone
with the caveat that they have to answer
the thing when you call them they have
the whole rest of their adult lives to
blow you off until then it's your job to
check in and make sure they're not being
forced to listen to Jack Johnson so
there you go five tech gifts that will
help bribe your kids off the couch and
back to school for more back-to-school
recommendations head over back to school
