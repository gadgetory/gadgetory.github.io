of Google's announcements at their
Developers Conference a I'm making calls
powering Android and Google Maps photos
Gmail and even at the doctor's office as
some of this borders on sci-fi others
border on creepy we're going to go
through the risks and benefits of
google's AI future what you're going to
hear is the google assistant actually
calling a real salon to schedule the
appointment for you I'm looking for
something on May 3rd
ok so I can get behind a technology that
saves me from having to call the hair
salon but I'm pretty skeptical about
this one because we didn't see any live
demos as it was all pre-recorded there's
the number of ways this could go wrong
because at the end of the day you are
talking to a human so she can't be
pre-programmed to answer every single
question and I don't know if I'm gonna
end up with something completely
different than what I originally set out
to get from this call yeah I could see
your concerns with that but I would
think when Google is going to implement
this for real-life usage they would
probably figure out who is being called
with this robot that's powered by duplex
because if they're calling private
numbers that would seem a little creepy
especially if they don't tell you hey
I'm a robot or I'm working through
Google assistant perhaps it's gonna be
more business-focused this is all
speculation by my part but then again I
don't think Google is going to just
introduce something like this without
thinking it all the way through we use
machine learning to start suggesting
phrases for you as you type all you need
to do is to hit tab and keep order
completing I like smart compose because
anytime I don't have to do the thinking
and replying in an email I'll actually
properly write a response otherwise like
what is this person talking about what
is the nut of this maybe it'll work as
well as smart replies ok but what about
the smart compose fails it's like the
autocomplete fails on your text messages
I already have enough of those and I
write in two languages and so that even
makes for even more
autocomplete fails so I can imagine the
gibberish that I'm gonna be writing an
email and potentially because it's a
more office setting to my boss so I am a
little bit apprehensive about the Gmail
smart compose would Android P we're
going to beyond simply predicting the
next act to launch to predicting the
next action you want to take we call
this feature after actions so let's take
a look at how it works at the top of the
launcher you can see two actions one to
call my sister Fiona
and another for my evening run so what's
happening here is that the actions are
being predicted based on my usage
patterns the phone is adapting to me and
trying to help me get to my next task
more quickly you don't with the app
action sign I like it because I get to
think less what's coming up next what I
have to do next because I will forget
from one second to the next
Android knows and that's a load off my
shoulders yeah but then I want to I want
to have free will what if what if you
suggest something but I didn't want to
do but all of a sudden I want to do it
because it suggested it's the power of
suggestion and I don't want to be a part
of it I want to have ultimate
responsibility of where I'm going next
and I don't want anybody to know me
better than I know myself
it's creepy but you don't have to follow
everything it says you know you can just
say no and then it will learn how you
are now but then it already put it in my
brain is I think that'll be fine another
area where AI can help is to actually
help doctors predict medical events
turns our doctors have a lot of
difficult decisions to make and for them
getting advanced notice say 24 to 48
hours before a patient is likely to get
very sick that's a tremendous difference
in the outcome okay this we can agree on
we can definitely get behind a in
medicine because it's not going to take
people's jobs it's not going to replace
doctors it's just gonna enhance the
amount of information they have and they
can assess in one sitting it was
incredible to watch how much information
they could just determine from your
retina see my big thing several people
my family are doctors to get overworked
and if anything can lighten their load
or make the decision making a little
sharper I think that tool be welcomed
really blew the easily so easy the
photos under expose
our AI systems offer a solution to fix
the brightness right there or if you
happen to have a very special memory
something in black and white we can
recreate that moment in color
and make that moment even more real and
special you can really get behind the
new Google Photos it's got colorization
options it's got smart fixes so you
don't even need to tinker around the
settings to find out how do I adjust
this to make it better and then you can
make your old photos in color and pdfs
and at the end of the day you already
gave all your information to Google
Photos because if you're already using
it they already know who everybody on
your photo reel is so might as well yeah
so I guess that's kind of like
three-quarters up sure you open the
camera and you start to see lens surface
proactively all the information
instantly and it even anchors that
information to the things that you see
definitely I think we can both agree on
this one is I mean my one of my favorite
features was the ability to search using
visual search so for example I do this
all the time where I see it an outfit
that I like and I want to know where to
buy it so all I would have to do is
point the camera and I'd have all this
information about where to find it same
thing with the copy/paste of text in
real life that's amazing the augmented
reality concepts that can be applied
with google lens seems so useful just
being able to identify what exactly am I
looking at it sounds like something that
should've been solved by now but maybe
it really is I really hope it works like
the demos should our teams have been
working really hard to combine the power
of the camera the computer vision with
Street View and maps to reimagine
walking navigation so here's how it
could look like in Google Maps let's
take a look you open the camera
all right this is really cool to be able
to see the directions in your
environment that takes me out of the
screen right here and avoids me from
running into the stuff running into
people running into oncoming traffic and
who doesn't want to follow the Fox I
love when I'm visiting a new town I
basically have to spin around to check
where I am and like it's a dot moving
I'm gonna move three steps this way
oh the dot I'm going the wrong way with
a are just look up and you can see where
you're supposed to go I really love that
idea
game shader I have no sense of direction
so ultimately it comes down to how much
information you're willing to share to
gain access to these pretty cool
features some of these features won't be
really customer hands for a while but
others will be available in the coming
weeks we're going to have to ask
yourself these same questions so tell us
what you think about these new features
cool or creepy respond in the comments
