hear you plainly isn't this great Here I
am in New York and there you are in st.
Louis and and it's just like you're in
the next room I said it's just like
you're in the next room few inventions
can claim to have changed the course of
history as thoroughly as the telephone
from simple sounds beamed down a wire to
holding the sum of human knowledge in
our hands the ever-evolving tech that
lets us instantly chat with someone
hundreds of miles away has altered the
way we live time and time again here's
how the telephone has changed and how
the telephone and how the telephone in
turn has changed us the telephone itself
was more evolution than revolution
building on the Telegraph a genius bit
of gadgetry that allowed coded messages
to be sent through wires as electrical
impulses problem was this setup could
only take one message down a wire at a
time the popularity of the Telegraph
booming in the second half of a 19th
century
the race was on to find something better
inventors tackling the problem included
Edinburgh born Alexander Graham Bell and
Elisha gray from Ohio at first the plan
was to transmit multiple tones down one
telegraph line and in 1875 gray patented
the electric telegraph for transmitting
musical tones inadvertently becoming the
father of the synthesizer before long
though it became clear that transmitting
human speech had even more potential one
year later the telephone was close to
becoming real as both inventors rushed
to get their increasingly sophisticated
creations enshrined in patent law it was
Bell who got his patent in first
becoming the inventor of the telephone
well maybe frankly just the question of
who truly deserves the credit for the
telephone could make your head spin on
Valentine's Day 1876 bells patent
application was entered onto the books
just a few hours later Gray's paperwork
hit the official record
a month later its Bell who successfully
transmits speech but there are
allegations that bells transmission used
a liquid transmitter suspiciously
similar to grace or paint examiner's
anus Wilbur's claims that bells team
slipped him $100 in exchange for a peek
at Gray's work then later claims that
those claims contradicted Wilbur's
Leigha claims hundreds of legal cases
into while out of court experts continue
to debate whether it was gray or Bell or
invent a psyche antonio meucci johann
philipp reis or charles pourcel all of
whom were dreaming up or building voice
transmission tech you could even argue
that Thomas Edison deserves the credit
as in 1877 he patented a carbon grain
transmitter which used the variable
resistance of carbon under pressure to
make long-distance calls practical okay
so it's unclear who deserves the title
of telephone inventor but we do know who
actually got it Alexander Graham Bell a
few years after the patent war the Bell
Telephone Company today known as AT&amp;amp;T
had exchanges in most major US cities
and as the telephone caught on new
developments came thick and fast early
phone calls involved an operator who'd
manually connect you to the phone line
of the person you wanted to talk to
these would eventually give way to
automatic switches of the kind patented
as long ago as 1891 by Almon Strowger as
transmitter tech improved the
candlestick phone became increasingly
obsolete replaced around the late 1920s
by models like this one which crammed a
transceiver and receiver into one
handset 1927 saw London and New York
connected by a commercial transatlantic
phone service it was conducted via radio
but in 1955 and 56 a huge feat of
engineering saw the laying of the
transatlantic t81
the first of many underwater telephone
cables that would ultimately connect the
entire globe by 1969 90% of US
households had a telephone but this
world shifting tech still had one
downside wires GPM I see me no lady I'm
an eccentric millionaire I'll get so
many phone calls I could carry the phone
around with me mobile telephony dates
back to 1946 when it became possible to
make a call from your car so long as you
had loads of money and hardly anyone
else in town was trying to make a call
at the same time one year later
Bell Labs is Douglas H ring sent a memo
describing something much fancier a
hexagonal cell network that could make
countrywide car phones a reality it was
the blueprint for a cellular phone
network but the tech didn't exist to
support such a system two decades later
that was all changing the early 70s and
Bell Labs was still working on cellular
tech but was still focused on putting
phones in cars
ultimately it was Motorola who captured
the public's imagination in 1973
demonstrating an entirely untethered
phone the first cell phone the DynaTAC
8000x hit shelves
a decade later weighing two and a half
pounds with twenty minutes of battery
life and costing around ten thousand
dollars in today's money it wasn't
pretty but Motorola's breakthrough spot
a global obsession with mobile
telephones the next two decades or
mobile marvels get more powerful more
affordable and more miniature while the
telegram got a kind of mobile rebirth in
the form of the text message by 1998
there were nearly 70 million u.s. mobile
subscribers a figure that would double
just four years later at this time
Bluetooth 3G color screens and cameras
were making our Mobile's truly
multifunctional as the power of these
devices grew in line with their
popularity the next step forward in
telephony was only a matter of time and
we are calling it iPhone it's ironic
that is today's touchscreen 4G capable
phones get more advanced we use them
less and less for the actual
transmission of our voices the original
problem that so many great minds
grappled with nearly 150 years ago but
in another way modern mobiles are
fulfilling the telephonic promise like
never before giving humans more tools to
communicate with and understand each
other regardless of whereabouts on the
planet they are that's all for now but
for much more do check out see sorry he
