CNET's dedicated phone reviewers tons
and tons of phones come across my desk
all the time but right now I'm here to
talk about the phone I use every day and
it's the one plus 5t keep in mind I
actually do like this phone it's my
daily Android driver for a reason it
does tons of things well which I'll get
into later but right now I kind of want
to dig deep into the initial thoughts I
had and what's changed since then keep
in mind some of the things I talked
about isn't so readily apparent when you
first handle the phone so whatever I
might sound overly critical or as I'd
like to call it so one of the things I
don't really like is facial recognition
it doesn't work really well unless you
kind of are in great lighting and you
use it right in front of your face in
this kind of unnatural motion it doesn't
really work when you place it on your
desk or even when you're hanging out and
you're kind of like looking down on it
and it has to kind of always have this
thing and most of the time for me at
least it doesn't really work so I kind
of just use fingerprint ID which works a
lot faster as you can tell another thing
I hate is a new thing in the camera it
actually changed from the one plus five
to the five T and that's an aspect ratio
it used to be sixteen by nine but now
it's 18 by 9 and I just hate it because
it zooms up so close to the subject that
you're trying to take a picture of that
I have to default to four by three which
I hate that ratio it's the iPhone ratio
and I just kind of missed the sixteen by
nine I kind of want it back
lastly and this isn't a knock on the
phone itself with the company and it's
just how it recently handled the credit
card breach it affected a lot of users
and it just seems that every launch
there's always something whether it's
the breach or collecting an inordinate
amount of user data or benchmarks
skewing it just seems like there's
always something and the company should
just do better their users deserve
better and oneplus makes great
affordable phones and for now a lot of
people are willing to kind of overlook
their missteps but you don't want to use
up the last of your good graces you know
now that that's over with I'm gonna go
back to the stuff that I like I really
like - charging believe the hype the
battery is still great without it it
still lasts really long but - charging
will save you if you're in a pinch
five minutes charging on this thing and
you get 20% more battery don't quote me
on that that's not exact but that's
basically kind of what I've observed if
you could afford it get the - charger
for your car it saved my life a bunch of
times so get it definitely recommend it
another thing that I like that actually
didn't expect to like that much and I
just kind of grew to love it is reading
mode it changes the screen to make it a
sepia tone whenever you open certain
apps and it makes reading really
comfortable especially when I'm in bed
at night I'm on these ABS reading
thousand word articles or whatever and
it just makes it more comfortable my
eyes aren't strained it gives me that
old newspaper feeling just getting that
really and I thought I'd miss color
pictures for this but not really it's
fine I live it another thing that I like
is individual app and lock it just adds
an extra layer of security to certain
apps of your choosing and the reason I
like it is because my friends not as
much anymore but before any time you
left your phone and intended we would
just take it and just start posting
Facebook messages or something like that
under your name and it got me super
paranoid so now I put it on my Facebook
app on my text messaging on my gallery
or whatever my friends are really nice
but it's just some that's the kind of
environment that I grew up with socially
so now I just kind of like it kind of
keep it I put it on my you know text
messages gallery it's just like an extra
layer of security that I like oh one
last thing that I'd like to add is you
should always wait for more colors
oneplus does the thing I'm not saying
it's gonna do it every year or even this
year with the next one but kind of every
time they've launched a phone they've
launched other colors after it this year
with a 5 T it's white this pretty white
one and red both looks really great but
both are also super hard to find so if
you're cool with scarcity and don't mind
waiting a little bit want to see more of
your options wait after a little bit
when oneplus releases launches a phone
and then see what kind of new color
they have so that's it those are my
takeaways three months after its lunch I
still really really liked it and I still
recommend it so yeah check it out
yourself three two one
so the two things I like I'm gonna start
with I feel like I have hair on my arm
sorry okay all right
just chill okay and with the recent
credit card beach reach beach go ahead
