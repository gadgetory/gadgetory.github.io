first episode of ask the experts it's
the first time seen it and GameSpot I've
ever gotten together and had a love
child my name is Jeff Bakalar I'm Peter
Brown and we're here to answer your
questions that you have about the next
generation gaming consoles because we
are the experts we know a lot about this
stuff for better or worse first question
we have is about console exclusives Ryan
writes in and wants to know which
console has the best exclusives out of
the gate these consoles launch within
the last month so Peter Brown what do
you think it's up to me it's only up to
you right now in the Sony Playstation 4
has the most console exclusives if you
look at it in terms of just raw numbers
but then a lot of those games also
appear in other platforms so but between
the two sony has the most but I'd say
Microsoft has the stronger you know
group of games going in they've got
forza which is really impressive racing
game that's just doing that serious
keeps getting better they've got the
game rise from Crytek which looks really
good in fact that's an early report yeah
dead rising 3 is kind of a nice surprise
i think a lot of people were really
worried about that game based on past
presentations but it's a really fun
title and a lot of people are enjoying
it think with dead rising 3 it really
came together and like you said it
surprised me after that first hour I was
like all right this is something I could
really get into the weapon crafting is
really fun and for me I think dead
rising 3 is probably the best uh you
know consult you subtract special so I
think if you're looking for like the
games that you kind of must-haves out of
the gate yes probably a few better
options to go with on xbox even though
they don't have as many launch titles
these places before yeah and it's also
worth noting too that you have a lot of
other games that are available on both
systems here games like assassin's creed
4 you know and those are really popular
as well obviously call duty battlefield
4 the difference is there though are
worth talking about is on the
PlayStation 4 a lot of these games run
at 1080p 60 frames per second where they
wouldn't on the Xbox one you know I've
done a significant amount of testing in
that regard you know having both
consoles hooked up together doing
battlefield for back-to-back doing
Assassin's Creed back to back you can
tell the difference ps4 just seems to
have that little edge in performance
they it's just playing games a little
better let's look maybe six to nine to
twelve months from now where do you
think we're going to stand maybe a year
for that titanfall is a really important
title for Microsoft right that is the
like parkour influence you know
first-person shooter game with mex and
everything and and they've got that
unlock that's coming from EA but they've
also said yeh said well no it's not just
a timed exclusive Sony's never gonna
happen right Sony any other hand is a
lot of indie titles coming that I think
are interesting a lot of people who want
something that's different from the
blockbusters that they can get you know
any month of the year right any content
all right Jeff our next question comes
from Isaac on facebook who wants to know
am I ever going to be able to play xbox
360 games on my xbox one oh this is easy
absolutely not next question okay well
in a second you know there is a chance
down the road that Microsoft could
follow suit what Sony did on the
PlayStation 3 with PSN okay take old
games you know take the code and poured
it to the system called a classic I also
want to bring up the fact that
PlayStation 4 has some really wacky sort
of ambitious streaming stuff planned to
we don't really know too much about it
we know that backwards compatibility
will be addressed in some capacity yeah
whatever it is it's not happening till
2014 that's for sure yeah so I mean
there is a little concrete info so he
has gone on the record is saying that
the service they purchased in 2012
gaikai there's a cloud game streaming
service will be utilized to let people
stream ps2 games to the ps4 and even the
Vita afterwards all right Peter that's
going to do it for our first episode of
SP experts thanks so much for the
questions we've got a lot more to answer
so stay tuned each and every day for a
new episode of ask the experts until
next time I'm Jeff Bakalar I'm get
around thanks for tuning in we'll see
you guys very soon there's a lot more
information coming your way about these
consoles you're not going to want to
miss it it's you soon
