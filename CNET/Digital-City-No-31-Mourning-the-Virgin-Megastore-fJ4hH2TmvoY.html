forties meet the business amount of
Motown's very gaudy turn grand rock into
a chain of 1440 sorry we're now we are
back you know each other this is now
judge i watch ofs you digital city
that's right that's right and what are
we doing here we do things that people
don't do we see things people don't see
we hear things plaid is pretty amazing I
I prefer to think of it as a telling
interesting stories about things going
on in the world of technology and
digital life and urban living and all
that stuff and as I flipped through the
cameras I'm Dan over here is Julie and
over here is Joseph and let's see number
four works and it does look at that it's
it's Gus and then if you want to see the
group shot there it is and I say all
this because we continue to play with
and learn about this fantastic camera
system we have in here etc etc so does
anybody know what we're going to talk
about today Joseph like to do a quick
rundown we're going to talk about
virgins or should I say kindling virgins
a little and a little touching or a
little phoning a little I phoning
touching virgin kindle thing is that the
pg-13 I don't know goodbye all of our
trend tags yeah that was a little
strange there maybe we'll rehearse that
a few times so obviously one of the
first things that I want to tell you
guys about is I went down to union
square right here in New York City where
the Virgin Megastore is going out of
business as all the virgin megastores
are just like Circuit City did several
months ago and I took my little camera
down there my little uh actually my
iphone camera and I went in took
pictures inside the store of the
different like sale tags you can see
what was on sale how much the discounts
were and you know whether or not they
were actually good deals because a lot
of the time when you have one of these
liquidation sales there are no good
deals if you guys enjoyed you have go to
the circuit city sale I had stuff going
on I really didn't catch the sale but I
just wanted to go to see because it was
like such a big thing and I walked in
and I just saw like empty floor like
half the floor was empty
which is like it just was unheard of was
like you just never expected that to
happen the circuit city I'd walk by
there just when I'd get off the train
just so is there a DVD that i might want
to get that's out or something and they
didn't it was just crazy i really didn't
look for any deals because in talking to
you you made it very clear I wasn't
going to find any alright so I had
already gone down there by the time you
went down there and you'd heard about my
my crazy stories of fake discounts Julie
did you go down to a circuit city when
they were going out of business no and I
had one very close to my home but I
never bothered to go in there they have
a lot of big signs up there like a
gazillion percent off well there's a
huge one in Atlantic Avenue so but yeah
all you saw were just huge signs that
said going out of business mm-hmm sale
blah blah blah and I was like no it's
depressing so I didn't bother going it
was it was not have a dude you go by the
circuit city liquidation sales and they
were going on I steered clear river
report i heard including yours including
line i mentioned that the discounts were
terrible and I'd issued Circuit City
anyhow so I I cut a wide swath away from
it but I've shopped at virgin megastore
for many a movie soundtrack in the 90s
now that's what I work for is actually
very similar to circuit city in fact
here in Union Square New York they're on
the same block together they're right
next door to each other right and the
same company is doing the liquidation at
both of these stores what they do is
this company comes in outside company
comes in circuit city or virgin
megastore they don't actually do the
liquidation sale themselves they just
say we're going out of business we're
hiring a third party to handle all this
and they come in and they take over the
store they run it and they make up the
prices and they put the stickers on and
they make all the weird you know rules
about about you know the return policies
and the percent off and stuff so that's
why when I went is the Virgin Megastore
the signs the percent off signs were
exactly the same as the ones that were
right next to at Circuit City like for
four or five months ago it's all I wait
a minute this looks awfully familiar
someone have even said circuit city yeah
probably summer circuit city products so
all make signs outside said up to thirty
percent off so I went inside looking for
my thirty percent off i found one thing
that was thirty percent off that was
video game hint book people still buy
those there should be thirty percent off
all the time yeah that's probably the
only video if you need a video game hint
book that's the way to go so it should
just be a nap
or for the iphone 99 video game him /
gasps oh that's a good idea actually
it's like the Kindle yes they should
just publish those on the candle I mean
that would be great because I'm this way
to actually get up and go to your
desktop to look up a code yeah there we
go to run to your ipod going your home
Wi-Fi holiday all the fact that that
that's really the only site anymore game
ironically a cnet property and give you
an option from screenshots on or also
pages can come up quicker well you're
really over thinking this guy I told you
know most of stuff in the store like I
think dvds and sees like twenty percent
off but twenty percent of the already
ridiculous virgin prices where
everything's you know 1899 or 24 99 for
a DVD when they're you know ten bucks
less at best buy down the street so that
was really a big discount video games
were like ten percent off so you know
since games are really discounted I
guess that's kind of a little bit of a
discount electronics didn't really have
a lot left they were discounted like ten
percent but that was off the MSRP which
of course is higher than what they
easily sell it for in the store so we
looked up a whole bunch of stuff and we
found that you can actually most of it
cheaper on on amazon I mean the only
thing that was really great about virgin
with the wide selection I mean you can
go in there and you can find like like
audio CD that you wouldn't find anywhere
else or maybe like only back in the day
at Tower which is no longer around or
maybe they're blu-ray selection which is
sick I mean you'd go to so many
different places they'd only have
certain blu-rays but you'd find like a
wide variety of blu-rays they're just
really sad that now we're losing all
these resources in Manhattan where you
can just walk in and browse it's
becoming like only on the internet and
if you don't have a preview so be it
whatever you know just move on by it or
don't buy it they don't care you get it
in six to eight weeks or you pay double
to get it over overnighted well I'll
tell you I mean they had a lot of I mean
they had a great back catalog at virgin
and they did have some like Gil they
have a lot of iphone accessories
actually they had iPods for five percent
off which doesn't sound like much but
considering there's never any iPod
discounts that's actually okay I don't
think I had any in stock by the time I
went through but they did have an Apple
TV or five percent off they went five
percent off an apple TV with no return
policy you're really going well I
meanwhile i'm chatting about this
actually Scott do you have our google
doc open under your machine new frontier
right here um no but i will go to that
and click on the link and we'll go to
the slide show where I actually
get some specific products and compare
the prices between the Virgin sale and
like just current regular everyday
prices on on amazon and is it true you
have 25 pictures for the slideshow going
on uh yeah that said that that's what
makes a good slide show you need a lot
of is it yeah when to when I went to the
new york comic con I hope Tamar screen
my camera I got let's see okay well now
i'm going to jump to thee to the
computer output cam right now click on
that link not quite ready anger you can
just you can just hover over it and i'll
get a little arrow haha computer
tutorials with joseph in Scott oh yeah
Julie you would have had this stuff
right away and I already have it I have
it up as well everybody has enough
except Scott all right yeah I trusted
you I've got it up I've got enough now
this guy can't get it up oh my god now
click on the photo gallery so we can
look at the actual slides hey colony
here we are illegal excellent more get
dance clicks for a job at six seven
eight I'm now gonna slide 8 skip ahead
okay we're gonna watch it uh-oh slide 4
that's an empty 15 you've done six keep
going you're almost there that's what a
frame looks like okay let's see wait
wait yeah stop at any of this which
which one is there hey let's get
creative let's look at it so what is the
price what does it say there on the
screen it says take ten percent off was
9999 you pay 8999 and what is he and
what is the text next to the pictures
take that's right i looked up the price
I the non HD version of creatives Votto
video camera virgin 8999 amazon 7990 if
you look at that it's cheaper it's
obviously cheaper on amazon i mean if
you click to the next thing i'm sure
it's the same the same deal i think the
worst part hahaha that's just nothing
that's just sad i think the worst part
of all this is like if you like you
could probably get the best deal on or
products that are already out of the box
and that's like probably the most
dangerous because you can't bring it
back I can't bring anything back you can
wear limitation in terms of like the
best deals are on prod
they're open box products I think the
best deals are on the shelving when they
saw the shelving for like thirty percent
off i think like no it is not because a
big note there and if you find the slide
that i'll give you a shiny nickel it
says there's like a ten percent premium
on the shelving if you buy the shelving
tennis imprinted like extra ten percent
fee if you're buying the fixtures all
fashions and there's enough i guess the
million-dollar question is is beverage
my price is going to go way up now
there's no comedy on the game and
occasionally are they gonna you you are
the only game in town after a lot of
stuff you can order it and wait or you
could buy it right now for the low low
price of three easy payments of you know
other cities have like fries and stuff
like that i guess and other stores like
that but here in New York they're really
the only big retailer because we don't
have like Target or Walmart here really
we have a Kmart visitor targetable Coast
Guard there's a target in Brooklyn yeah
okay we don't have one yeah there's a
target in Brooklyn definitely all right
but that's not the target in the Bronx
you know I know what Ackerman means you
know what I'm talking about i don't want
to say it he doesn't have to get on the
Iron Horse or drive wants to walk there
out of the pub as long as they don't
have to take a cab there I am I'm
happier public transportation I can walk
there he doesn't have to take a break
this is what it that way doesn't have to
take a bridge to get there I would also
not like to have to take a tunnel so
either bridge or tunnel read into that
what you will see all these days County
you're depressing the Auld amazing i'm
looking every single wanna thank you
they're very sad look at that you're
looking another one with about twenty
percent off what you know yeah twenty
percent off their overpriced dvds i know
ridiculous alright moving on and you can
obviously check that out at the digital
city website what's the biggest city dot
cnet com fred is getting confused for a
minute don't worry about it we're here
to help you so another big thing this
week obviously is the kindle kindle
mindell i thought it's nevertheless
bigger kindle a bigger kindle kindle DX
it's not one of the telephone something
about the kindle yes so they had the big
press conference this week in New York
announcing the 9.7 inch e-ink until DX
for the low low price of four hundred
eighty nine dollars what is wrong with
these people it's still black and white
exactly scale exactly what it does have
a PDF reader built in it also can much
the I'm own PDA change between landscape
and portrait by tilting it also takes up
that space in your bag it also charges
you to convert your documents now per
megabyte you gotta be kidding oh it
always yet always charged you it just
switched they used to have an email
account where you could just write but
they still charge like ten cents or
something went out to 115 yeah boy and
they got rid of the Wi-Fi I think from
they never had it no no Wi-Fi the
whisper the original Waldo the first
kimmel that came out had Wi-Fi hmm and
this DX doesn't have Wi-Fi yeah what has
3g eight has Yeldon whispernet but yeah
that's not really for web browsing and
you know you're never gonna get
multimedia over that you can browse on
the same slow experimental 800 x 600
browser in grayscale I think my only
problem with the kindle is it's a great
idea it's a great product but they they
can give you more for what they're
charging you so it's not a great product
I mean it's a great product in a sense
that it's good for like you know the
sight impaired and you know with the
with the voice of text and the fact that
you can just carry and carry books on
you can download it and they're a lot of
books that they're making specifically
for but I just don't think they're
they're making it the best they can make
it for what they're charging its got
like a premium price and in like Scott
alluded to it's like still grant wide it
just takes you back to like when we had
our Apple 2 plus and you had the
freaking green screen you know the green
purse or something and I were say Joey
speaking from authority as he is one of
the most voracious readers I know I've
never seen this guy not walking I was
telling I was all these two books under
I told Julie I was like I'll get it and
she's like really was like here cuz I
can have it read to me do you want to
turn big word hahaha ok which for big
birch oh yeah it should be a hundred but
that's one of the faculty issue things
about this word oh it's got that text to
speech thing yes and apparently one of
the phrases it doesn't know how to say
correctly was Barack Obama we might want
to get to that pretty quickly might
wanna love date what did it sound like
did you hear them doing I'm imagining
it's probably like Barbara oh yeah like
that it's hard to miss her name's Obama
sounds like very straightforward Obama
given to a computer it doesn't know
apparently came out Oh be lame
not like Raja know what not like twin
peaks at you like to play again
apparently sounded like black Alabama
that's a bad came out hey watch it with
that black see that's what the that's
what Jeff oh okay program the thing to
say do don't yes there's a whole website
dedicated to the sort of like play the
record backward ID like wonder what are
the mispronunciation sound like on the
camera what are the kindle family
messages we lack Alabama but it should
be it's strange to because it's in the
end I have a problem with it because
you're paying four hundred eighty nine
dollars for something that's now selling
you ten dollar books so at least with an
iPod technically you are buying
something where you can rip your own CDs
into it and bring stuff Emmy it's mostly
tied to the itunes store hbu could bring
another mp3's it's kind of hard to di's
business model for well the New York
Times wants to do that brighter times
wants to sell you a new york time
subscription like a digital you know
version of the paper subscription and
give you the kindle to read it with if
you prepay for like a two year
subscription or something so to say
here's the kindle because you're given
us a thousand dollars and with the
newspaper whatever it is it which is
kind of a nice idea but idea by 95 a
month for their uh time subscription
well you know me but on the paper but
they're only doing that right now in
areas where or they're only planning on
rolling that out in areas where you
can't get the paper delivered which is
like Mars Antarctica normal i don't know
but if they decide that although I'd any
also you can get I mean this is their
own problem because they made the
content available online for free right
now but not only do you get out in every
other newspaper you also get the videos
or free and not that they're great but
the point don't get the videos when you
pick up the newspaper off the street
vendor either no videos an end it's just
if you're going digital you might as
well anyway for an apple tablet knock on
the registration no no New York with the
New York Times and the free kindle you
get like hit with a bunch of ads on it
like yeah right Papa why your page is
loading while you watch it yet we'll
have to wait and we will have to wait
and see although one of the things that
is kind of annoying about the kindle it
still has that little flash when you
flip pages it's not quite as seamless as
it should be which i find which i find
pretty doing that's what you know what
if they said subscribe to the no I just
go out and buy the new york times every
day because i like it and i read it and
etc etc if they said sure you subscribe
to the paper
and we'll give you this digital
subscription on the Kindle and with roni
kindle if you prepay for like a two-year
subscription I'd be the first guy to
sign up for that that'd be great I
totally be down with that i read it on
my phone so if they decide to suddenly
turn around and say we're charging you
for the iphone content then i might say
i'll take you up on the kindle deal but
until that point yeah but even really i
mean i read on the iphone also and i
read the website and i read the real
paper but it's not quite you never get
quite the same experience as the real
paper that's cuz you grew up with
there's a lot of thumb wiseman you're
sitting there like you got a lot of like
that any foot and you're on the subway
you're hitting people with your arms cuz
it's a big paper you know they say tell
you when you read the papers you know
you're supposed to fold it over in half
and fold it up and always opposed to if
you had it yeah that's how you read the
paper oh wait am I love it into reading
something my bad it's nice because you
can browse our organs how to read the
minutes The Daily News you can just hold
up yeah yeah yeah I fold it over four
times for Dilbert all right so anyway
that that's what's up at the kindle and
i believe they already have a hotfix for
the for the black alabama problem and
it's the s second you can't say that i
can only say that okay it's a second
most popular gadget now in amazon com
that's right it's already it's already
behind well the kindle too there was
actually though a CNBC reporter who was
furious this morning because were a
couple of days ago because I should've
bought the kindle to a few months ago
she can angers that there a UH they are
a retailer not a technology company
that's true when did just come out I
mean they really could have saved them
both up and released a Mets a get this
mon or get the big one because I've been
a lot of people how we did buy the
kindle to write rather have this big one
I wonder if they do some sort of make
good like remember when when Apple did
that if when the iphone 3g came out
right everyone who bought a previous
iphone like a couple months before it
got like a gift certificate also that
was that was the original on the drop in
price paid 500 for they drop to 200
bucks i was one of those people i got a
hundred all the credit so did I i bought
it i bought the many happy after fifty
bucks on and bought a nano yeah it goes
right back to they should give a um they
should give some sort of an M&amp;amp;A i was
right at your certificate yes they're
gonna go right back to the store and so
I mean I'd rather have the bigger one
from what you know just looking at the
two of them it just seems it just seems
like a nice reading experience trade
your kindling for a dozen books
dimensions are nicer it's not there is
as much of that annoying white space on
the side there's a like thick plastic on
the on the two it just seems like too
much empty spaces are the outer bezel
yeah the other bezels lot thinner on the
other one I like the proportions better
on I just wish it was color and you can
toggle it on on and off for reading so
you don't get like the crazy texts but
it mean I certain color because like you
may have like I mean you can even use
it's like view illustrations maybe
photos Joey's waiting until they put
comic books on it well no I'm just you
could you know maybe a great you can go
marvel comics you know that route that
would feel ya marvel or the DC edition
where you can add like the Hulk on the
back amusing I think you should do
something this data stylish yeah that
would be really cool and you can even
you can even charge even more if you get
the actual artist to autograph it or H
their name in each one I mean if you're
gonna mark it more like a cutter I'm
trying to market this towards more
towards like college students basically
their faces pilot program but their
their college a stink doesn't really
make sense but sixty percent of the
textbook textbooks that are made that
those manufacturers have agreed to sign
on to sell books it's unclear how many
they'll do and then there's that pilot
program with I think it's only I think
Pace University revealed that there was
only 300 students they're trying it with
over all right so it's very small if me
like one lucky class at each University
and everything and don't pan out all
that well I mean especially if you if
you your custom if you were a college
student and your custom having a whole
mess of books in front of you while
you're doing you know a paper yeah and
you have everything like set up to a
certain point in the page for each tech
textbook I mean how are you supposed to
do that like with the kindle like okay
I'm viewing this right now don't have to
exit out of that you the next thing but
then I forgot where I was you know so
it's kind of it's it's kind of a funny
kid doodle in the margins yeah UK okay I
like you know you could take notes but
it's like a quick cramming will be
impossible right exactly through slowly
as it refreshes value I mean you use a
laptop and you maybe hook it up to a
second screen a dual monitor where you
can have like yes that's right Joey
let's take something complicated me in
Italy more than double purpose oh you
take a laptop you should not even get a
kindle you take like a laptop and you
can you can have in a second monitor or
you can do your cramming on you that was
Stan well as I pointed out I did the
e-book readers your ebook really
ah yes so you look at that I'm backing
you up here before oh yeah you know but
honestly to I have to say on the subways
I'm just gonna say it the Kindles look
dorky i know i am no thank you let's be
honest and you never see them look you
yes I mean they have some nice design
when you hold them but they look so
dorky they're just clunky a little you
know just like very any cheese looking
though yeah or maybe like maybe a v10
maybe not even maybe not use the like
the eggshell white color or whatever
it's maybe little darker a little less
little as noticeable as I'm customers
may not agree yeah you know but just as
soon as you soon as you see the thing as
a BAM it's sort of like when you get on
the train as soon as you see the white
headphone you know it's an ipod you know
it's just like you see this big white
thing I boom oh my god nobody's gonna
mug I'm getting I'm getting off with
this iphone and I'm getting over that
kindle the imagine if you will a Stephen
King branded kindle how about that there
you go little it would all that was
gobble with all those novels in it right
yeah pre-loaded maybe why not I bought I
bought but I haven't read that he made
that special kindle novella which is
supposed to be pretty cool it's only
like two bucks but it it's a it's meant
to be read on a kindle and it's all
about it as if the kindle would access
alternate worlds in which other books
were written so you access other
newspapers from other times and
dimensions that sounds that's super no
Wi-Fi Dorothy anyway it would know but
issue can owen speaking speaking on that
like the Stephen King the Stephen King
kindle you can even have it read the
text a word in his voice use his voice
to read it back oh we can't do that
right now cuz I'm just saying robot yeah
I'm just saying you use his voice you
know I'd be hot that'll be for the next
gen well I didn't eat money I want a
little credit for that idea okay okay
you didn't get comics on it on a
next-gen Kendall something that would be
in color pink in color yeah Dibley in
color I like you guys to know please as
we're having this wide-ranging
discussion how deftly I am jumping
between the different cameras watch
somebody say something anybody at random
burp ippity Boppity boo Kendall feed
okay now now now I'm messing it up well
the thing has like a dry sherry the
pressure I know really the thing has a
delay know soon somebody starts talking
start see you later yeah it has delay
you should let your fingers
I'm still staring at your discount see
right there picture and it's depressing
me okay I gotta close that I'm watching
what you're watching to be careful to go
to next Kendall single generation right
there are you still have it on ooh yes
he like Apple Apple plug from Joseph all
right finally finally today uh you guys
wanted to tell us a little bit about
will speak downloadable oh well with
inspecting in sticking with the handheld
devices and DLC Scott and I had a
sparked up a little conversation in the
lab earlier with the PSP yeah well this
this week on tuesday the PSP had its
first they've had downloadable games
before but this was their first game
that should have been in a box it was
sold overseas as a UMD Patapon 2 only
available via download for twenty bucks
which would have been the same costume
that it would have been in the store
actually if you go to a gamestop you'll
get an empty box with it with just a
download code inside which is kind of
cruel they did that for the lost and
damned the yeah you can go to the storms
are 16 I was branded it wasn't it was
actually just an xbox points gift card
but I branded with that they integrate
if they gave you the download card and
the disc you know it's kind of like when
you buy something online you will you
used to have that option does it down
lately expenses involved which is all
point of doing that well I'm just a
little bit cheaper but they don't charge
you any less so they're gonna charge you
the same price that's how many more
money which with these companies to do
better they should pass on well the
thing is is exactly the way they'll be
better just save save money the way
better work against that sounds like
socialism yes you're better'n is take
care of the people take care of the
people you build a quality product
people will come what about notice
Joey's bring a red shirt don't you Tommy
he had a black one this morning I didn't
notice he had a black one this week did
he change you'll be the cameras again
Superman quick change no cuz I look like
it was supposed to rain today and black
doesn't really show the rain and it's so
sunny out black doesn't work with the
Sun so I you know switches over strategy
Joey Jojo change his shirt he powdered
his head it's a whole new wow it's a
whole new Jones I don't shout you off
for putting mascara on before this
booba the concealing that concealed yeah
awesome that you can cut it some or the
hairpiece like more about words right we
often make ourselves pretty somehow
somehow so uh yeah I think the key is to
this is that it used to be they make a
game they printed on a on a CD or a DVD
or blu-ray they print out a booklet they
put the whole thing in a box seal the
box put the box in a bigger box full of
other boxes put the box on a truck drive
the truck across the country go to store
put on the shelf you go to the shelf you
buy you bring it home that's a lot of
middlemen if they can cut out some of
these middlemen and just have you
downloaded directly they save a lot of
money because especially with fuel
prices you know so high last year this
this year not so much but this time last
year was when people were talking about
incredibly high fuel prices anything
they could do to get away from that was
considered a huge plus and we saw you
know the download suffer lost a damned
all the downloadable guitar hero and
rockband stuff all the fallout 3 add-on
packs yep the watchman movie game was
download only what else has been a big
DLC thing well you've had I mean xbox
live arcade has been huge right this was
a small again now you're seeing bigger
games kind of what wasn't brave raid was
pretty big rapist yeah castle crashers
all these sort of like indie games World
of Goo was huge on me that was like when
everyone seemed more kind of triple-a
style titles yeah mode only did but the
thing this is this this is this is the
problem with the download only there are
some games that you want but you don't
want bad enough to pay that full price
and by making it download only you can
never go into the store and possibly
pick it up use like return it yeah like
I picked up by picked up like Call of
Juarez for like yeah magley you guys are
my pick it up for like seven good for
you for making it out for 17 bed Oh for
17 bucks it isn't yeah it's not what I
thought he was buying red dead
revolution right oh all the Western II
yeah you know what the poor reading
skills just screwed me at the counters
like oh but no but if you can write a
used but but if i had to pay 65 bucks i
know but this enables these companies to
have variable pricing on these things
where a game can be like the watchmen
game the same game in a box would've
been $59 online it was like twenty
dollars even though it's the same game
have variable pricing now here's the
million-dollar question how do they
decide what goes LC versus disk did they
judge it bike the crap rating oh this is
not as good this is not good i thing
what based on those i guess and no i
believe at least for some of these
things like watchmen or going forward
one its timeliness you can publish a
game online faster than you can print
disk put them in a box driving to store
get them on the shelves right and and
secondly volume if the thing is not
going to sell that many copies you have
to print X number of you know tens of
thousands of discs to get a game in the
store if you think it's not going to
sell that much make it a DLC so basic
also rap crap level okay but also don't
know they can yeah they can't just would
like half and half it's a little bit of
gameplay to I mean I've seen a lot of
demos now for these things where they'll
admit to you that the gameplay may only
be about four hours right right actually
shorter taste in dis based games but
you'll get a little less gameplay they
meet it out so the development time
ideally what you want to see is that all
these indie guys will have a chance to
make games on lower budgets and then
you'll be able to buy the game for less
but hopefully the big companies variable
pricing i think is key and the ability
to get stuff to market quickly and again
when you put a disc in a box you got to
print a minimal it's very difficult to
do for instance if you for instance had
a music album out and you wanted to get
in stores you'd have to print up like
thousands of thousands i'm kind of like
your album oh my god four inch in apush
test in this in this feed nobody oh you
just plug it off to makeout man wears
around lots but once again that that
still falls upon us because let's say
like like a perfect examples like me i
buy games like sick i go games really i
got erics had his xbox insets come out I
haven't even had money year I have more
games in it but in the case of that if i
were to download it i love your fat i
would orders and other people i don't
know Erika Franklin all right cnet Sam
Fran um but the thing is that if I kept
downloading everything eventually my
hard drive is going to fill up now I
gotta run out get another hard drive i
mean that's another comment and with the
playstation with the playstation it's
not so complicated cuz you can get a
laptop hard drive slap that sucker and
you're good to go yes
fox is a little boy it's like the more
you stuck with that that proprietary
crap though it's nice on the at least on
the PlayStation Network you can
redownload titles yeah you can delete me
down like siren uh siren blood curse a
12-part game I was playing each one is a
huge download you know if the download
moister keep them is like like Netflix
type things like I can get this whenever
I want yeah delete it they have to every
company has to do that where you just in
because in the case you lose the steam
is really good at that yeah buy some
from steam you to redownload it on to
any computer and he say that's a good
example a hammer time you have a good
point Joe suggested let's say you're
having internet issues you really want
to play that game yet you cannot your
final iphone point the whole point you
were making to me about this this is
mean the iphone ipod touches one yeah
well that's it yeah that's like we were
talking about yet um i guess in handheld
supremacy is nintendo and sony PSP and
nintendo dsi PSP is dead well it was a
coming out with the new PSP and it seems
that everyone's following everyone is so
excited about that I can't no he go two
steps out somebody saying oh my god I
can't wait for the new PSP see I've been
accused of being a sony fanboy but
you're so later okay calm down don't
stop hating ah but I'm serious well
they're all doing down there all doing
downloads exactly which is with the
iphone ipod touch and price should have
been memory stick or flash based in the
first place yeah and then the iphone
ipod touch has cheaper games which
obviously sometimes people aren't making
enough money have a crowd yeah too well
know how it ended even download him on
the fly yeah in defense for the PSP it
would have been successful with with the
UMD because of the movies but they
charge the same price for the movies as
it was for a standard even exactly and
the unity shoulda coulda know had the
UMD's been priced what they are now
removing that thing would have taken off
and have the racist Reba 299 it wouldn't
I better tell you but that's that's the
problem its own its pricing you know
they got a video download store from the
first day of the PSP but nobody knew
about it and not store it was is the
kinect page okay they never did anything
with it was like they had one nature
video and the location free TV was it
was available before like you had to
sling box huh oh yeah yeah
nobody really it was the device was too
expensive to use it's all very
proprietary and so maybe the iphone
could out nintendo nintendo i think the
iphone can out nintendo nintendo who I
like that it's a lot more interesting
it's a lot more elegant it's nicer it
appeals to many more people than the
yeah yeah so everyone plays it and like
we're a maz and moms and and and like we
were saying Bella grandma was like we
were discussing the form family the form
factor of the DS really hasn't changed
much and it's not really moved with the
times um will maybe a better quality in
terms of graphics and the touchscreen
with the style is he look but it's like
we were discussing they should maybe
like you know tapered it off like they
did with the macbook air I kind of round
it off to the edge like it like a
compact that's a child shoes then you
have apple vs. nintendo and nintendo
just can't compete with apples design an
apple should by nintendo my god asian
fusion of fanboy well I I gentleman wait
what I'm sorry one more thing that is
another point though how there are more
games within a year for the iphone then
the entire system anyway then for any
city for any Apple system throughout his
exist it's like 6,000 a lot of them are
like 99 cents or grieve free and no more
than 10 bucks that's right all right
anyway we're gonna wrap it up now
