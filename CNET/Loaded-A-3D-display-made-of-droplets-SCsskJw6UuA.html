you use Microsoft Outlook you can now
integrate facebook and windows live
messenger this is part of Outlook Social
Connector it brings your social networks
to the email client so if your facebook
friend emails you then you'll see the
email as well as their Facebook photo
and Facebook activity these are outlook
plugins that come with updates to
outlook 2010 speaking of Facebook a man
in New York claims he owns eighty-four
percent of the company Paul DC glia
claims that he had a 2003 contract with
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to develop
the site the contract supposedly
entitled him to one thousand dollars and
fifty percent of the final product plus
an additional one percent per day until
the site was completed Sieg leah's math
puts that at eighty-four percent of
course Facebook claims that this is
bogus and why did the guy wait six years
to say anything while microsoft claims
to be working on several tablet
computers to be released soon it looks
like blackberry is working on a tablet
too we don't know that much about it or
even when we'll see it but rumors are
that it will have an 8.9 inch screen two
cameras and support flash it would
likely run BlackBerry's
yet-to-be-released operating system
blackberry OS and maybe even have a
slide-out keyboard BMW is the first line
of cars to integrate apple's ipod out
feature on iOS four this means that you
can plug your iPod or iPhone into your
middle console and control music and
applications with your car's own native
buttons which of course is much safer
than navigating the device itself while
you're driving and barnes a noble
announced nukes study this is a
downloadable program that lets students
access and organize each text books as
well as other course material like
lecture notes images workbooks and your
own notes taken either within the
program or on the nook you don't have to
have enough to use this but you do have
to be involved in academia the program
will open in august to students and
professors only for now a new technology
turns water droplets into a
3d display that does not require 3d
glasses this comes from a project out of
Carnegie Mellon University Professors
there were able to control the drop
layers so that when the projector
switches an image it follows the
patterns of the drop and lights them up
as they fall creating a 3d effect so far
this has only worked on a 12 inch laptop
and professors don't expect to have it
ready for mass market for at least
another decade that's your news for now
thank you for watching I'm Natali del
Conte was seen at TV and you just been
loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
