and this is an epic gaming rivalry
between sony and nintendo who are
writing yet another chapter in their
storied history it's a prize 5 punch out
between the sony PS vita and the
Nintendo 3ds our judges for this fight
our senior editor Scott the bottom line
Stein editor Jeff the Backstreet Boy
Bakalar and yours truly Brian
the honey badger Tom now we'll take all
three judges blind scores and average
them out to the nearest tenth each round
the final price wise score will be an
average of all rounds using the same
decimal system it's a six round
throwdown showdown first is design the
PS Vita is flat-out the sexiest gaming
handheld that shows off its gorgeous 5
inches of OLED goodness and it's smooth
curved edges fit comfortably in your
hands now we know it's not the most
pocket friendly but you won't even care
because you'll be entranced by its
amazing screen now the Nintendo 3ds
keeps a similar form factor from its DS
lineage but it's not nearly as
eye-catching the 3ds protects its two
screens with a clamshell design that's
thicker than the Vita but it doesn't
feel assault with a hinge that you can
hear clicking into place it's 3.5 inch
top screen is new and the three inch
bottom screen is still touch but overall
the design feels like more of the same
the PS Vita takes this round with a 4.7
and the Nintendo 3ds gets a 3.3 next
round is controls user interface people
have been asking Sony for dual analog
stick controls and the PS Vita delivers
the best physical controls on a handheld
its analog sticks might feel a little
cramped to the d-pad and face buttons
but we're not complaining it also brings
a full touchscreen UI that's responsive
and intuitive Jeff calls it the best on
board gaming OS ever made is gyroscope
can be used with some games the front
side touch screen also brings a hybrid
gaming experience and its back touch
screen add unique gameplay elements that
we've never seen before
fans of the Nintendo DS will know
exactly how to use the 3d so there's no
major learning curve here the operating
system is pretty straightforward but it
has a dated look and feel there's
nothing wrong but there's nothing
spectacular about it now we're all part
of the touchscreen generation but the
that we're still using a stylus at times
feels pretty silly now the 3ds brings an
analog stick which is nice but Nintendo
is almost admitting it's mistake by now
offering a second analog stick add-on
the PS Vita takes another round with a
4.3 and the 3ds gets a 3.7 so after 2
rounds the Vita leads by a full point
round 3 is feature Nintendo's main
feature is its glasses-free 3d and it's
pretty sweet
we've seen nothing like it before but
then sometimes the image breaks up if
you're moving too much and a good amount
of people start getting dizzy or
uncomfortable playing for long periods
now when a warning says take a 10 minute
break for every 30 minutes of gameplay
yeah it's probably not a feature you
want to use all the time it also takes
some fun low res 3d pictures and video
but how long does that novelty last
there's an SD card slot to store your
photos and downloads Wi-Fi and a web
browser plus Netflix but are you going
to watch on a screen this small now the
PS Vita brings a more versatile device
even if you're handcuffed by having to
purchase their proprietary media card
format it's a 5 inch screen that invites
you to consume more media and having the
ability to purchase current games TV
shows and movies directly through its
store and the addition of Netflix and a
legitimate music player makes it more
than just a gaming device now I'm
personally not a fan of web browsing on
the Vita but the bigger screen makes it
more appealing plus there's a Wi-Fi and
3G model if you sign up for a plan and
it has built-in GPS to interact with
maps now 3d is the killer feature for
you then the 3ds makes sense but the PS
Vita brings an entire ecosystem of
goodies the Vita takes its 3rd round in
a row with a 4.7 and the 3ds gets a 3.3
next round is game library the PS Vita
launched with 26 titles and they're
already a handful of must-haves like
uncharted golden abyss that brings the
promise of a console experience to a
handheld plus awesome platformers like
Rayman Origins or the galactic shooter
Super Stardust then you add a library of
PSP games ready to download from the
store to beef up its initial launch with
more big names coming to 2012 now the
lack of a UMD trade-in program hurts
here in the US but we weren't expecting
it to happen the 3ds has about a
one-year head start and finally
starting to see original games we're
talking about like Super Mario 3d Land
which might be the only game really
worth playing in 3d and then 3d reboots
for The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time
the eShop has some original titles and
DSi titles but they feel dated as well
one bonus though is that at least you
can play your older DS cartridges the PS
Vita takes yet another round for its
fourth arrow with a 4.3 and the 3ds gets
a 3.7 so after averaging four rounds
we're still where we left off the PS
Vita leads by a full point round 5 is
performance the Vita brings us the best
looking games on the best looking screen
that we've ever seen on the portable
consoles now the promise to bring near
ps3 light graphics
holds true with its quad-core processor
and snappy menus that we just can't get
enough of now on the flipside battery
life isn't going to be great and our
crew managed to squeeze out anything
from three hours to 5 hours of battery
juice but it could be better
now Nintendo has always been known for a
stellar battery life but that's not the
case with the 3ds it's 3 to 5 hour
battery life for gaming is the lowest of
any recent Nintendo handheld and it's
really a disappointment plus its
graphics are better than previous
generations but when you stack it up to
what the Vita can do it's no contest the
PS Vita continues to dominate with a
perfect 5 and the 3ds gets a 3.7
Nintendo needs a miracle and the final
round that decides it all is valued the
PS Vita starts at 249 for the Wi-Fi only
model and games cost an average of 40
bucks
now the hidden cost is the required
proprietary memory stick that's not
included but starts at $20 for a four
gig stick that's not cheap for four gigs
so if you want a bigger card it adds up
fast before you buy your first game the
Nintendo 3ds is $169 and games cost
around 30 bucks now there's no hidden
costs here and we like it but to put it
into perspective it's still more
expensive than a week Sony's memory cost
hurts it here and the Nintendo 3ds
finally takes around with a four and the
PS Vita gets a three point seven so
let's average out all six rounds and in
a prizefight where Sony dominated from
the start with five straight rounds
there was no way Nintendo had enough to
come back and the
yes Vita takes this battle 4.5 23.6 and
is your prize by winter the PS Vita has
impressed us all but the bigger question
for both platforms is if consumers are
still willing to spend their money and
time on a dedicated gaming device with
the rise of the smartphone and 99-cent
games i'm bryan song thanks for watching
we'll catch you guys next time for
another price bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
