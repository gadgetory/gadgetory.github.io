wanted to play games on your iPad with a
controller just like a Nintendo or a
Sega or Sony system well at long last
there is a controller the SteelSeries
Stratus you can play with wirelessly and
play Sonic the Hedgehog like I'm playing
right now right here on this iPad you
can also use an iPhone how is that
possible well they may have heard of
m-phy compatible game controllers but
Android has had the ability to use game
controllers with their tablets and
phones for a while and Apple has finally
allowed this on iPads and iPhones there
are a couple of controllers out there
the Moga ace power and the Logitech
PowerShell or two that plug in your
iPhone and act as a battery pack and a
controller all in one the SteelSeries
Stratos is the first that I've seen that
is a standalone Bluetooth controller
that works not only with iPhone or iPod
Touch but also with an iPad and is
particularly great if you stand it up on
a table right here and use it like a
little game console and this thing is
tiny fits in your pocket really small in
fact maybe you find a little bit too
small it's kind of a micro controller
and it's based on the SteelSeries free
design that Android users already know
about that's out there how many buttons
does this have the full package this is
everything that you'd expect in a game
console controller
you've got shoulder buttons you've got
trigger buttons you've got dual analog
pads right here you have got four
buttons here you've got a d-pad and a
pause button that's a lot of buttons on
one little controller they feel pretty
good there's no Rumble or anything like
that let's not go crazy but and the
trigger buttons here are a little bit
cramped but it all feels pretty nice for
this size and it gets about ten hours on
a charge with a little micro USB
attachment on the bottom so how much is
this cost $20 $30 no $100 yes
$100 that's a lot of money that's a lot
of money most people wouldn't expect
that this costs $100 and that's the
downside to this type of iowa's gaming
accessory unfortunately but that's par
for the course right now in fact every
iOS gaming controller accessory for some
reason costs $100 right now the Logitech
PowerShell the Moga ace power take your
pick
the advantage here is that while
you don't have the hard lightning
connection it does have the universal
compatibility with any iOS 7 device you
don't have to deal with lightning
connections and it has all of the
buttons so that's a big plus but if
you're hoping to play like a like a Game
Boy or a PlayStation Vita on the go this
is just not going to be as convenient
because you're gonna have to prop up
your device somewhere and play like this
now the SteelSeries Stratus does support
multiplayer games so you could actually
have two of these paired at once I
haven't seen any games that support that
yet in fact finding games to support my
game controllers is a pretty big
challenge right now there are supposedly
hundreds out there already that use it
but it's a trial and error process we
found some that advertise it pretty
prominently like grand theft auto san
andreas which does a fantastic job and
there are other games that are working
it in almost in a stealth fashion like
Sonic 2 in its new remastered version
which plays great and as for the others
you know there are websites we list some
of them other places list some there's
an app I found on the App Store it's
pretty haphazard and that's a bit of the
early adopter process here you're gonna
have to get on board and explore which
of these games will use it there are
bound to be a lot more and in the coming
year you'll probably see a lot of games
start to develop really Virtual Console
or retro style appeal by having
controller compatibility at the moment
if you want the best most universal game
controller that we've seen that works on
iOS the SteelSeries Stratos is it but
you are paying a premium for it
it is pretty cute though I'm Scott Stein
and that's the SteelSeries Stratos game
controller for iOS</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
