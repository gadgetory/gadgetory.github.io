Bridget Carey on cnet com and it's time
to get loaded get ready for facebook to
be a public company this week and it
will be one of the largest initial
public offerings ever if not the biggest
from the tech industry The Wall Street
Journal sources say Facebook could be
seen evaluation between 75 billion and a
hundred billion and it's reportedly
seeking to raise as much as 10 billion
if that's true Facebook stock market
launch would be six times larger than
Google's IPO Facebook is not commenting
but it's speculated this could happen on
Wednesday Facebook stock may have high
value but a new poll suggests a majority
of users do not think highly of the
network a poll by security firm sophos
asked what users thought the new
facebook timeline profile which is
rolling out to 800 million members over
the next few weeks 51% said the new
profile worries them since it makes it
very easy to pull up old posts and apps
contractivity automatically without a
user needing to click a button to share
or like something more than thirty two
percent so they don't know why they're
still on facebook nintendo has announced
it will create an online gaming network
a similar product to xbox live or the
PlayStation Network it will be called
the Nintendo network and it will offer
full game downloads and add-ons as well
as let users play against each other
online it will be integrated into the
new Nintendo 3ds and the upcoming wii u
console and the nintendo network users
will also be able to customize their
personal accounts and maybe that means
accounts will have user names instead of
a hard to share string of 16 characters
on saturday many twitter users held a
protest against twitter by refusing to
tweet calling it a twitter blackout only
you may not been aware of it since you
just were not tweeting during the time
the protest was in response to Twitter
saying it would allow the censorship of
tweets coming out of some countries if
those tweets break local laws after the
outcry Twitter officials clarified that
the company still pushed for free speech
but the new policy allows the tweet to
be taken down in one country but still
seeing everywhere else so a tweet is not
deleted from everyone's view if a tweet
a sensor there will be a notice that
there was a request for it to be removed
more than 5 million Android users may
have downloaded apps and
with malware according to security firm
Symantec the bad apps were disguised as
free games in the official google
android market under titles like
counter-strike ground force balloon game
and sexy girls puzzle Symantec says
these apps can steal personal
information from users but another
security company argues these apps are
more likely adware something that
corrupts the user settings and forces
advertisements to appear on the screen
where they don't belong either way it's
a good idea to practice safe app
downloading and stay away from those
sexy girl apps all right folks those are
your headlines for today I'm Bridget
