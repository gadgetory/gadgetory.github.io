been under self-imposed house arrest for
1718 days so I wanted to explore what it
feels like to be voluntarily so cut off
from the world and yet still so
connected but I'm not going to the
Ecuadorian Embassy and I'm not even in
London I'm here on the rainy streets of
Liverpool where an art exhibition
invites you inside Julian Assange's
office and maybe inside his head
and so this is Julia sons office first
impression I guess is how one day is
imagine spending whole life in here
[Laughter]
now obviously this is only a recreation
it's an artist's impression of Julian
Assange but if we look at little details
we can try to imagine how to resize my
Steve himself so if we look at the
bookcase over here we see authors like
Subway Susak
I've been Welsh Quentin Tarantino
iconoclast some bad boys or we also have
Neil Stevenson zodiac which is a book
about a lone hero fighting against
corporations and Pharisees and we also
have a genuine war and Rubicon zone on
the wall here we've got a child's
drawing of a man making a daring zipline
escape away from this building over the
heads of some of these very angry
looking placement presume is freedom so
I've been here a little while now and
one thing's restock me is I can see out
of that window there's people bustling
around I can hear music there's people
coming at now and I wonder if this is
way it's like the Julian Assange to be
confined in this space but also it's
been constantly painfully reminded that
the world is still out there still
spinning on without him and it's it's
restraint and troubling to think that
someone who's subjecting themselves to
this weird solitary confinement can
still reach out with technology and
influence
elections and shape a world
yoga really sees through that window and
through these screenings we not only
been here a couple of hours already I
can feel my worlds really shrinking so
I'm going to do one thing that's doing a
Sun chanting within these four walls of
a mechanical</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
