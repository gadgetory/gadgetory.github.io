New York International Auto Show we're
celebrating the return of the four-door
sports car this is the 2016 Nissan
Maxima this new model is actually longer
than before some two inches longer and
it's lower and has managed to lose some
80 pounds over previous generations that
means gonna have better handling than
before it's also got more power the 3.5
liter v6 under the hood is gain 10
horsepower up to 300 tol it still
manages 3 miles per gallon making it
fairly economical the exterior has been
completely redesigned which gives it a
bold striking look which I quite like
but some people might find a little bit
derivative of current loss like the
Mazda 2 certainly these sweeping fender
flares look pretty derivative of that
company but again I think it's a nice
step forward over before the interior is
completely redesigned as well some
higher in materials we've got quilted
leather seats contrasted stitching and
they've redesigned the layout of the
Interior 2 to bring the infotainment
system a little bit closer to hand the
whole thing wraps around you they say
it's a little bit like the Nissan GTR
it's perhaps a bit of a stretch but it
certainly does give the car a more
sporty feel something again that they're
trying to sell with this 4-door sedan a
full new infotainment systems in there
as well an 8 inch touchscreen will be
the control system for everything in
there now the cars gonna be available
later this year starting price around
$32,000 a bit of a premium but again if
you're looking for a sporty 4-door 4
seater
not a bad place to start I'm Tim Stevens
we've seen that here the show floor the
