editor-in-chief of techrepublic and with
me I've got my longtime partner in crime
bill detwiler managing editor and the
man who likes to take things apart so
today we're gonna crack open the Apple
pencil right bill that's right so if you
haven't seen this already this is the
must-have accessory for the ipad pro
this is Apple's a very large ipad here
and this pencil is a really unique among
styluses what it allows you to do is it
allows you to draw on hoops it allows
you to draw on the iPad if I could if it
will work pick your tip yep so see like
that and it has some interesting sensors
inside that allowed to detect the angle
with which you're painting allow you to
take the pressure which which you're
using so it makes small light lines or
really thick dark lines and there's a
lot of technology inside this that
actually makes it function so what we
want to do is we want to actually show
you guys what's inside and how it works
so you remarkable piece of technology I
mean when we got one in right our
multimedia editor Aaron Carson who's in
the audience crying right now because
we're about to crack it open it was a it
was something that she picked it up but
she unlike you and I can actually draw
and and quickly was very impressed with
the technology cause it's in the pencil
it's it's a unique stylist um and one
that works really well if you have an
iPad pro you'd probably need one of
these yes so let's get cracking since we
have a little out of time now i do want
to forewarn everyone normally when i
take things apart we try to take them
apart in a way we can put them back
together again in working order i don't
like to destroy my gadgets I can't do
that with the Apple pencil this is not
made to be taken apart the it is a
sealed container there are several
layers as I'll show you inside this so
I'm going to destroy this pencil as I
take it apart so if you're not ok with
that you know hide your eyes but it
should be fun also there's no way to do
this without cutting inside of the play
pestic so I've got a handy vice here to
hold a pencil we've got a handy rotary
cutting tool in a diamond wheel that
we're going to use to slice through the
plastic and the metal inside and we have
some safety gear too usually I don't
need safety gear when we do our cracking
open yeah but this time we've got a few
safety glasses for Jason and I I've got
some safety gloves that will use when we
start cutting this thing open and we
have Katie over here with the fire
extinguisher ready to go we will
probably get a few sparks a little bit
of smoke from the plastic but we
shouldn't have a fire alright so let's
let's go ahead and let's get cutting so
the first thing that we'll do is we'll
remove the tip of the Apple pencil which
is actually made to be removed inside
the tip there's actually a small piece
of metal which interacts with this part
of the pencil here which is a sensor
which allows you to detect the pressure
it also helps the detecting the angle
which of how the pencil is held against
the screen will also remove the cap now
these are both made to come off the cap
has the lightning connector and with
that that's pretty much all that you can
actually disassemble yourself with the
Apple pencil and it actually does come
with a replacement tip for when you wear
that one out so we'll go ahead and wear
them we're going to put this in the vise
and now we're going to oops add in our
studio at techrepublic we have one an
even larger one than this but you rarely
have to use this bill right you don't
use this hard with you I mean one of the
reasons that you crack things open is to
to learn about what's inside to learn
about the design of these devices and
also to talk to our audience about if
they are having to repair them and put
them back together so most of the things
that you crack open I can count all
we've been doing these since 2006 I can
count on one hand the number of things
you've actually broken over the years
and made unusable this will be the
exception here this will be the
exceptions a second one you did do one
of these already and they can see the
gallery a full gallery of photos on
techrepublic of all this the process of
cracking this open all right so let's go
we've got a diamond wheel here and we've
got our rotary jewel
we'll see how we can do here now I'm
gonna do my best not to cut through the
battery there's a very small lithium-ion
battery inside this but it should be
okay you could set that in town you
could actually get some sparks or flames
right if you hit the battery yeah we
could actually but it's so low voltage
it has such a small capacity that it
shouldn't be too much of a problem
there's also adhesive in here and
normally I would bring a heat gun and
try to heat the adhesive up we just I'm
just going to cut through it and do our
best to peel it apart very good very
good you can see I'm doing I'm be very
careful not to cut through try to cut
not cut through the interior metal
component yeah if you are inclined to do
some of these dis assemblies on your own
there are a couple things to keep in
mind one be very patient you have to be
very very patient bill is incredibly
patient with these things if this was me
you know when it comes to things like
this I tend to want to force it you know
if it's not coming if it's not working I
want to force it and what happens is you
that's how you break something and then
it becomes a you know worthless
unrepairable so you have to be very
patient don't force things and you know
in this case you should be pretty
dexterous right you should be pretty
good with your hands bill kind of has
the hands of a surgeon he has very
steady hands and he he is very light on
in the touch with these things you can
see he's being very light with the touch
just bare just barely getting through
this thing so if you want to do these on
your own we recommend most people don't
you know we do these so you don't have
to but if you do want to those are the
two most important things don't you
agree Bell oh definitely and now so what
I've done is I've actually cut through
each side of the plastic housing and I'm
going to do my best to peel off the
plastic housing here and we have an
array of tools that we use when we crack
these things open some of them small we
have plastic prying tools these are
called spud jerz we have pliers we have
wire sniffs oh you can kind of hear it
kind of
back there a little bit work our way
around the adhesive you see this thing
is going to be completely toast going to
show you guys this here again you can go
to techrepublic com and see a full
gallery of all this in action when bill
did the original cracking no business he
took photos of each step which you
typically do on all of yours you take a
photo of every step of every potential
pitfall if you were taking this apart
and you also learn a lot about these
devices what do you learn you know when
you do these cracking open well one
other one of the reasons we do this is a
couple things to learn their weak points
to learn how they might fail in the
future so that people can learn better
how to support them how to take care of
them so if people come to them and they
ask them hey look I've got this device
is it a good device is it rugged is it
sturdy is it durable we also like to
learn how technology of alls over time
and by looking at the inside of the
devices we can see the chips we can see
how they're made and we can see what
manufacturers are doing yeah when the
you know when they're developing new
products so as you can see I've got the
plastic off of this the shell and
there's a second metal shell inside of
this so what we're going to do is we're
going to go ahead and we're going to
have to cut through that also there's no
way I tried I really did the first time
I did this I tried to remove the
interior without cutting through the
metal but there was just no way to do it
that's why you get the diamond that's
why i use the diamond wheel too there's
also extremely small try wing screws or
that are that are used inside the pencil
now why Apple put screws inside a device
that was never meant to be taken apart I
have no clue it's extremely frustrating
so I'm going to try to get these out
with one of the smallest tip
screwdrivers that I have I don't know if
they'll come out if they won't we're
just going to cut through them okay
which we can do that too Apple so one of
the most frustrating devices to take
apart you know they don't want you to
take these apart they want they want to
take them apart they want you to take
them into the to the apple store they
also use a lot of different size screws
that's another thing that's very
frustrating and throughout the years of
cracking open lots of different devices
including Apple devices
uses many different kinds of screws so
if you are trying this at home you're
not going to be able to just use your
normal tools you've got to have some
specialized tools to crack them open
like pentalobe screw drivers and things
like that where can people get those if
they have an interest in that online
most of the tools that we get we order
online and you can pick up a lot of the
specialized screws need to take apart
the Apple iPads and the iphones and
things like that yeah this screw doesn't
want to come so I'm just going to cut
right through the metal anyway we're
going to go ahead and driver for Apple
you're going to need a pentalobe
screwdriver is one of them you can take
a you can do a search for that you can
get places like ifixit.com cell sets of
tools that are quite useful and you're
good you're handy dremel can also be
your best friend if you're interested in
this kind of thing alright so we're
doing a little bit of a spark here but
it shouldn't push for my Lucy got your
glasses on all right so there we move
here we go now we're talking you guys
see can you guys see the sparks there
so another thing that you know to keep
in mind with these cracking open is that
we try to do the devices that are most
in demand that that are the things that
are most common and that especially
business users professionals are most
likely to use because of course
techrepublic a sister side of cnet
focuses on the technology that people
use for work so you can see all kinds of
devices that bill has cracked open from
iPads to the Microsoft Surface to all
kinds of different phones and then every
once in a while we do some fun things as
well things like a connected soccer ball
that has lots of sensors and processors
in it surprisingly what are some of the
other fun things that you've done
recently bill I would have we done we've
done the world we've done the bebop
parity Bop drone we've done a the new
Amazon Mecca fire tablet lying on the
Amazon echo which is a lot of fun we're
gonna cut through the other side of this
alright more sparks on the way I'm doing
my best not to cut through the circuit
boards that are inside not because we're
going to be able to save them and use
them for anything because I want to show
them to you now I am also doing my best
not to cut through the battery that's on
the inside of this again if you hit the
battery with something like this that's
when you really could set it on fire
potentially so you have to be careful
again if you you can kind of see that
bills applying a really light touch to
this and that's one of the most
important things with this kind of thing
is having a light touch don't force it
you know it's easier to go back and do
something a second time that it is to
completely destroy the device if you're
if you're too rough with it unlike this
hands of the surgeon like I said hands
so you can also find cracking open bill
does videos of these cracking opens as
well that you'll find on cnet he does a
special version of the cracking opens
that are in the cnet magazine you can
find the cnet magazines around the booth
for those of you in the live audience
and you can also subscribe to see that
magazine but bill does one of these for
each of the cnet magazines as well where
it takes a bunch of these photos and
shows you them in the print magazine and
then on techrepublic com you can find
the full complement of photos often as
many is you know 40 or 50 photos you'll
do for a lot of these right but we try
to show people the process and then also
show them the hardware inside yeah
alright so we can hear the metal
cracking apart here we're going to try
to bend it as best we can this thing is
really toast at this point it's a this
is this is one of the more difficult
devices that we actually cracked open
this year yeah we spent um probably I
mean well you can see how long it's
taken me about 30 minutes or so to get
through the whole thing to cut a little
bit more and a lot of times you know I
talked about the patience while this
thing really is sparking oops hey look
it's there he goes got a little battery
no check it out it smells like burnt
popcorn up here now oh so I'm glad that
actually we can see this because um
because it does show the danger of doing
this shuttle blow smoke and how careful
you have to be I don't think it's the
actual battery yeah yeah circuit so um
earlier we cracked open one of the
hoverboards you know the hoverboards
that don't actually hover that have been
going up in flames lately we cracked one
of those open it I think everybody was
hoping that a little bit we would
see a few sparks or maybe some flames
none for that but on the Apple pencil
the the battery did give us a little bit
of smoke and some sparks there if I can
pull the metal off here all right come
on so again specialized tools lite touch
patients those are the things it takes
to do this kind of thing we also learn a
lot about the the design of these
products when we do these things I
remember a product that bill from a very
popular vendor bill had cracked open one
time and he you know said come take a
look at this and he showed me and really
inside it was a mess like the wires were
were all over the place there was tape
taping things down and uh and it told us
a lot that that product was really
rushed to market and the design was a
bit haphazard this was one of the
tablets one famous tablets and then on
the other end I've seen bill you know
number times bill you've talked about
the fact that devices from vendors
especially not surprisingly like Samsung
and Apple on the inside the design is
often just as detailed as it is on the
outside that it does help show the the
high quality of those devices and the
fact that you know that they have
engineering culture that is very serious
about about their design yeah so what
I'm going to show you guys here is now
that we've got inside the pencil
although it's very difficult to see
there is so much tiny tech inside of you
that is it's really surprising it's one
of the smallest circuit boards that I've
actually ever seen here inside the
pencil it's got a I'll try to explain
the different parts here this is the
Lightning connector up here they're
antennas for the Bluetooth a
transmission back from the pencil back
to the iPad there's a battery this is
the very small lithium ion battery it
does look it does look like that I
nicked it there and that was what was
causing the smoke yeah and then there's
two circuit boards these are circuit
boards that are actually sandwiched
together this is another arm cortex
aleve it's an m3 processor in there made
by st micro
then down in here are the sensors for
the tip that help determine its angle
against the face of the ipad pro and in
the pressure that you're applying to the
tip of it too so there's really you know
you can see there's two different metal
shells there's a whole other metal shell
in here I'm gonna see if I can cut
through you guys want to see if I can
cut through the other side to let me
keep going okay well I think what
they're telling us that we have to wrap
up here in a minute I'll have a whole
lot of time so you can't anyway all the
photos yet you did take this apart down
to all the very bare details you can see
all the photos that techrepublic
dot-coms right yeah they can see all the
photos there in a whole video of the
process of me actually cutting both
sides off and taking it completely apart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
