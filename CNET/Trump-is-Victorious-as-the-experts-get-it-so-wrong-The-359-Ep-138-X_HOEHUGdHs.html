of the 359 podcast here's here's who's
been Roger all right Brian Brian
obviously also had a very long night
yeah I don't think I slept much either I
I mean like I cashed it around 1-130 but
I cash in at three after Trump's speech
yeah so we're all we're all tired um
yeah so bear with us as we talk slower
and are ya lower energy Jeb Bush Ian I'm
gonna try to I'm gonna try to go high
energy let me shake things up Franco
high energy just idea that's a contrast
that's Trump's America baby go um look
we're gonna hope that he makes America
great again right because I would hope
so yeah so what we're gonna do today is
we're gonna have a special election yes
we can't can't ignore the election and
ignore that it's November right where I
we're gonna we're gonna talk about Trump
winning election we're not gonna talk
about the politics per se or really even
share our thoughts aside from what
Brian's doing right now but we can talk
a little about the effect that social
media had the impact social media had on
this election you know for better or
worse you know definitely helped fuel
Trump's ascendancy uh and also like how
did it get it so wrong yeah right
everyone being the experts experts of
the whole nauseated social media
everybody everyone everyone yeah
everybody that makes it a profession to
know this kind of stuff right which
isn't us by the way we're that's not our
job not our job let's let's get started
get started as always you have any
questions put them and leave them in the
comments section Brian will pick them
out do our best answer deal all right go
welcome to 359 when we talk about the
top tech news of the day only on the
crap you want to throw in I'm Roger
Cheng I'm betting Fox Rubin if you're
like me you're a little tired from
staying up late watching the elections
unless you've been living under a rock
you'll know that Donald Trump will be
our next president woohoo his victory
I'd virtually every poll in
prognosticator seemed like even social
media failed to predict the win so but
how did how did this happen what why did
everyone go so wrong I think there are
gonna be a lot of post mortems around
this yeah and it's really hard to say at
this point we we have a story out where
we worked with a social media companies
read fast read fast and they provided us
with a lot of data around who's tweeting
more positive stuff about whether it was
Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump and it
looked like Clinton was actually a head
in a lot of the states that she actually
lost so can twitter predict an election
at least for this one no yeah yeah so
just interesting way taking it back a
step you know the role that social media
that Twitter in particular played in
this election I mean both Hillary and
dog were pretty savvy and social media
but you know Trump sort of took it to
next level you almost a very interesting
could almost say you know in terms of
like the incendiary tweets that he would
throw out there couldn't help but to
command attention right yeah absolutely
as I was listening to I think this was
CNN pundits last night they were talking
about how this is going to be the first
social media president and a lot of
presidents before him basically
commanded whatever medium it was of the
time whether it was radio or television
what have you or you know the internet
for Obama I remember that's what they
were talking about but social media has
become this dominant force and it's
interesting to consider exactly how he
used it he didn't use it as a
professional politician my he did like
tweets at three in the morning he lashed
out at people regular people like not
not famous people or anything like that
and for a lot of people knows a lot of
people that was what worked that that on
social media right cuz it was once
seemed authentic but the exact wasn't
just like this standard template Twitter
account yeah we're going on say that
like Clinton's Twitter account was you
know you could argue that she quote
unquote did everything right with that
she had a lot of tweets she was really
trying to inspire her base she had a lot
of nice pictures whatever but it was it
was kind of like you might argue in
retrospect it was a bit of a
paint-by-numbers from social psych yeah
yeah
from Twitter perspective whereas he was
like really like you were getting the
unvarnished Donald Trump yeah for a lot
of people that was good enough but you
actually had a chance to go to the Trump
election party last night how was that
event yeah so I was I was outside I
didn't actually get to be inside the
ballroom where all the excitement was
actually happening but I got to talk to
people as they were coming in yeah and
there was a lot of cautious optimism
early in the night i was there from like
basically 5 30 to 7 30 so I'm still
there a little bit early i think Clinton
didn't concede the race until like
somewhere around two a.m. right but and
and the folks that I talked to I talked
to them about social media which was
that was that was how they found
like-minded people that's how they
shared memes that's how they shared
different things around you know like
their their enjoyment of Trump rallies
and stuff like that so that was the glue
that kept a lot of Trump supporters
together which was which was interesting
to hear about so lastly if you're if
you're not happy with results you're not
alone in fact when it appeared that
Trump was going to win enough people
ping the Canadian immigration website
and actually crashed and then you notice
this happened is happened the last time
I think it did it last thousand if I
remember correctly one yeah so you know
we're we're prone to panic okay I it
sounds like pee Canada might be building
a wall so see using American laborers
rank of weed jobs alright so for more
about these stories check us out on cnet
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox ribbon
thanks for listening first question is
he going to close the e DV lottery
system Oh a lot of reasons don't we need
more information when I political what
is the e DV lottery system is that the
that might be the referee maybe that's a
refugee gonna have to google that Google
sorry electronic diversity visa oh so
okay one interesting thing about Donald
Trump is nobody really knows what his
ideology is on most things so he did get
voted in as president but it's still
entirely unclear what his position is
going to be on a lot of stuff yeah we
know
Trump the candidate is but now we also
know Trump the president we also know
Trump the businessman has always been
sort of a little bit flexible right he's
donated always wants the Democrats and
Republicans he sort of his positions
have changed depending on the mood or
depending on the the contacts and so
it's really hard to predict what he's
gonna do right and again watching CNN
this morning a lot of the folks on there
were saying look you know he doesn't
want to why would he want to cave the
economy if he has so much based in it
and ran you know maybe maybe we have
reason to be very positive about a trump
presidency but it sounded to me like a
lot of them were changing their tune
because the experts got it wrong they
didn't expect this to happen and maybe
only a week ago or even a couple days
ago they were like how is this guy even
the thinking he's going to pull this off
right this is this is really you know
kind of crazy there's a lot of comments
i can't read on the air okay all right
let's try to keep the the violence and
threats to a minimum folks if you can
please a stress on us no no no not
against us I mean except for that one
guy that wanted to punch you in the face
oh we got that guy back that's not back
MC weeks point about miss that guy yeah
miss that guy can he didn't say he wants
to punch me in the face too if he wants
that's just jealous I am I am I need I
need a face punch fan so um but yeah if
anybody has any other comments or
questions that aren't violent that they
want to share em that sounds that sounds
great yeah we're I mean we're happy to
read some of the comments and your
thoughts right dimensions and the
results and we're obviously aware that
this isn't a typical show but you know
it's November ninth there's no way we're
going to avoid the fact that it was it
was a huge upset election and yeah we're
not tight we can't talk about Samsung
facebook right it seems a little real
good to talk about Facebook and Twitter
and whatever Yes Doctor dr. lumen
promises he will punch all of us oh
thank you thank you that's really nice
that's what I needed this yeah yeah
that's that's really gonna make America
great again and I might feel better
after that i'm a little hungover it'll
be a friendly punch how late if I how
late were you out last night but two
okay you were out we have our own
dragging back and forth okay did you
like was it back and forth and back and
forth like did you go to the bar back to
the apartments back to the bar I'm not
sure okay yeah what it does in clean
night what interesting thing that I want
to share about going to the trump event
yesterday was that it being I feel like
it being in Manhattan there really was
not much of a spillover crowd outside of
the hilton and and I think that that's
because most of the voters in the
Manhattan area were probably clinton
voters and we saw that at the Javits
Center salzman went to the Javits Center
and that was a pretty heavy spillover
yes but the folks you talked to were
they they were from Manhattan right they
were from one of them I talked to was
from i think it was Ridgefield
Connecticut and the other one was from
the Boston area oh just looks so so I
did get to check to you know two people
and they were slightly you know out of
the area but it's it's worth mentioning
that Trump intentionally had you know a
smaller event we have a Javits Center
that place was packed obviously Clinton
was expecting things to go differently
and you know some sometime around two in
the morning they just told everybody to
leave yeah they're not gonna say
anything more questions about visas
stuff we really can't answer not our
Forte yeah maybe if you haven't really
about Lear yeah I mean we're not
political analysts we are involved in
the tech side of things for this so if
you have questions about social media
accounts and how different media outlets
have played into this this year it has
been an odd early fascinating 10 11
months really the way thing or the next
more than that rise but especially in
the final sprint hear ya where network
coverage has branched off to incredible
new interesting ideas we've never seen
before the liveblog fact-checking I
always I thought yeah otter like
fantastic that was really fact that like
Twitter basically had its most active
night ever I think with like two or
three of those they are two of those
debates last night 75 million tweets
about the election from Tuesday going
into early Wednesday whole thing I
tweeted about it last night I did a
little like at three in the morning I
mentioned that the Simpsons are always
right because they called a trump
presidency
did it yeah yeah yeahs in one of in just
one random episode they so yes they are
an incredibly present show still
relevant after all these years hello is
it 30 30 years 30 years yeah so yeah
let's talk about the Simpson is Donald
Trump going to increase taxes on kabobs
I hope not that that would be a pretty
highly unlikely horrible I think people
would riot streams also cute magic
passing attacks like a single single
food type right we would just have to
like take it off of not even like a
category neither like beverages or lunch
meat like kabobs only like oh yeah seems
unlikely it seems it seems unlikely but
then again everything gonna everything's
are pretty unlikely improbable didn't go
on it I don't know women say no there's
not gonna be a tax on kabobs thank God I
don't think I could handle that um but
yeah one other aspect that might
actually be interesting you remember
several months ago you wrote a story
about what it would mean if the Apple
yes brought back some of its factory
jobs or some of its manufacturing to the
US yeah and what that would actually do
to iPhone prices and at first blush it
sounded like your iphone would then be
two or three times the current a
conservative estimate I got four medals
at least double the price but that's a
really really conservative right yeah it
makes sense I mean obviously us laborers
are going to be paid more hourly than
Chinese laborers in China and there's
also the cost of ramping up a facility
like that right like we don't have
anything close to what if Foxconn has in
terms of the ability to build like
millions upon millions of phones totally
oh right and yeah well we don't even
have the labor force at the labor force
we don't have a facility all set right
of the facilities so that is a you know
a potential put up or shut up moment
mean that for this round it's definitely
one of the big cam paper we're gonna
bring jobs back never and he never
really answered that you know like how
we actually specifically you know you
want to say he says he wants to keep
jobs here but there's a big difference
which which is a little bit easier right
but in my heart there's a big difference
from bringing jobs back
manufacturing back and you know it's
president you know president night
estates the most powerful man in the
world but even they would be difficult
for them to force a company like Apple
to yeah its entire strategy look it's
always been interesting to me that intel
has maintained its factories in the US
and i think a lot of that has to do with
the fact that they want to protect their
patents but you know and they don't want
to send them over anyway we have a
question do you think in the next four
years we could use social media to vote
and no we had this discussion last
couple days I don't we already had
enough Haram by right ends yeah what I
think that's that's kind of recipe for
disaster social media is it's a great
place for communication and sharing
ideas it's also a great great the
bastion of trolls and well I think
online voting still isn't a thing at all
no it's not so I mean we talked about
the fact that you know the idea of
having a nap you know allowing us to
both the app that's still not that great
like I think but I think it means
something that we actually have to go
through the effort of like getting to a
polling place and voting comes worth
it's worth arguing the point for like
low tech at this point because more than
a hundred million people voted in early
voting and on Election Day so I'm not
going to say that everybody that wanted
to vote voted you know obviously
probably people my point is if you make
the voting process too easy then you
just invite trolls and pranksters like
more so than ever like there there might
have been a fair share of troll voting
for this selection but people I should
had to go out and get to the polls and
do it or you know or send a absentee
ballot yeah so I I wouldn't really
expect that any time soon is Donald
Trump going to be the new host of apple
byte haha I think he's busy now writing
the new the incoming president president
elect we'd love to have him sure he's
welcome to come on apple byte or for
this podcast we're on the 359 absolutely
yeah we'd we'd be interested in asking
to about visas well actually I would
love to have him on to talk about tech
because he's he's made a lot of comments
that sort of betray the fact that he
doesn't know
as much about tech is maybe he should in
terms of like I don't think he uses a
computer when he talked about shutting
down parts of the internet that that's
controlled by Isis right he references
the Cybermen there if there are some
things he has to have to speed on in
terms of Technology because it's a huge
issue in this country whether it's you
know an engine for growth or or whatever
and Trump has to get on top of him
anything I agree with you however he
hire the right people to get on top of
it for him hopefully yes I mean he kind
of had definitely shown in instinct for
social media I'll get for sure
absolutely he's savvy and social media
but when it comes to things like how the
internet works he doesn't know how it
works so yeah here's a good segue and
about that could Trump demand Google or
Facebook turnover private chats in order
to prosecute someone very interesting
question I feel like that that kind of
happens already to an extent the FBI or
he does it right so but would he hold
authority to make that what do you have
to go through yes critique apartment so
I don't know why the president would do
that direct oh no I think you know a lot
of things you can ask why what's someone
would do so in the app with the whole
Apple versus FBI thing ultimately that
was going to go to court you know one of
the other solutions that was floated
back then was a law passed by Congress
that would you know give some clarity as
to what Apple could or couldn't do in
terms of disclosing customer information
so and that never actually came to never
came to pass does FBI back down but it's
hard for me to see like Trump or any
president taking that direct role like I
feel like it would be Congress's role to
the kind of have that kind of mandate it
here's here's some good questions since
Apple is an American company and Samsung
is Korean could Trump's trade policies
have an impact on the smartphone market
absolutely yeah absolutely there's I
mean he's well it's very upfront about
he actually manages to change some of
the trade laws their trade pacts are in
place one could argue that he would try
to make it more difficult for samsung to
import phones and and argue that they
need to do at least more of the you know
parts manufacturer or like the
construction of the phones you're on it
on US soil right I know that a lot of
automotive companies do that already
because that's more difficult to share
yep that being said I don't it's it's
going back to the same point that we
made already is that it's very hard to
build those factories create that labor
force that's something that does take an
extraordinarily long time but I think
that's a really good question and it
really speaks to well where do we go
from here and a lot of people don't know
and allow the automaker's speaking of
the automaker's I mean they're their
facilities aren't here they're in Mexico
some of them yeah there's a huge hub for
manufacture oh absolutely is Trump gonna
like the man that gets all moved back to
us or it's again a that he made a
central part of his campaign was a trade
policy yeah bringing jobs back to
America and I think that's one of the
central promises from his campaign that
did he walk back Matt them really have
to you didn't say he was going to walk
back NAFTA he said he was going to try
to revise NAFTA I don't know enough
about NAFTA actually know what that
means right um so nobody does I just
know it's though all these windows
because we're not X personal apologies
no is the worst deal ever ever f chord
trotting to chance Trump has a huge
iphone and tiny hands is this just in
the Canadian government has decided to
move an army of beavers to build a dam
separating Canada and United States so
good these are good nonviolent comment
yeah thank you yeah we need to laugh
Friday and that's been a very rough
couple of days regardless of your
affiliation it has been a nail-biter
it's been a long night last night and
yeah it's been it's been kind of a
terrible horrible election for anybody
yeah yeah I on my vitriol on both sides
it's just I'm glad I'm Lisa to that
point I'm glad it's all over I actually
had a great conversation with a guy that
runs a shoeshine station on forty
seventh and sixth on my way to the trump
rally and he said that what he'd been
hearing from customers all day was that
folks just wanted to be over yeah almost
don't even care yeah they didn't care
like who's going to win whatever but
they just wanted to be over and some in
certain ways it's a good thing that it's
not a close election we're not waiting
for the wires to get involved like this
was this was decisively in Trump's hands
well I'm an electoral college from an
electoral college perspective but i
think that the voters would have really
upset and annoyed if this somehow drag
dawn in two courts kind of like a min al
gore yeah yeah for sure a hanging Chad
moment yeah as much as I miss hanging
chads what are your personal opinions on
the social media affected you do you
think it killed this election
specifically is that is the question I
wouldn't say killed I mean I think it
transformed the way the election works
and I don't think it's a positive or
negative thing I think it's just it's
just the way it is it's a way the world
is now is live our lives on social media
and it's natural for something as
high-profile the election to follow suit
right the thing that I find fascinating
about this is how Trump really rewrote
the social media playbook for any given
politician and the question is is our
other folks going to follow in his
footsteps or is there going to be a
realization that he's he's like a
one-off figure that can actually he's
the only one that actually do this and
everybody else would be considered like
this would be too many gaps well for
anybody bringing it back to the business
and tech world I mean it's you could
draw similar comparisons to t-mobile CEO
John ledger totally who I'm sure he's
gonna want much less I'm sure he's gonna
hate that comparison because he hates
trumpet has been very vocal against him
but he's used social media in a really
savvy way he's been able to kind of
connect to individual customers in an
authentic way and that's as its renegade
tell correct and that's helped the
t-mobile brand so much definitely
rejuvenated it and got past the point
where you know you kind of look at the
other carriers as stuff as as he
presents them as stuffy carriers right
yeah that's that's a really interesting
parallel and granted sorry about the
comparison yeah sorry John that's yeah
I'm sure you're gonna do to you about
yeah that's a really good point actually
and I it speaks to the point that like
if somebody else wanted to do that in
the telco world let's say all right way
just tech considered wouldn't yeah but
like wouldn't they just be considered
like a copycat or would it actually work
i think it i think it's a it's a dodgy
move it did it just hands on the
execution for sure like if you can if
you can gonna I feel like if you're
authentic about your presence on social
media which Trump for better Wars has
been I think and st. John ledger
effective like if you if you go on
Twitter and you you follow the playbook
or if you try to be loose with Twitter
or you try to you know have fun and it
doesn't come off as a pet dick like
people turn on you really quickly sure I
would throw out this argument that is it
authentic when Trump does it or is it an
act that looks authentic I'm not
suggesting one or the other maybe
they're really good at me he was he was
on TV for many many years so who knows
let's bring it home with a little bit of
prediction on what tech and social media
impact will continue to have going
forward in the political spectrum do you
think we could get VR rallies oh yeah
I'd be cool right yes yeah vr rallies I
mean I think social media is gonna
continue to play a huge role there you
know life I mean like we wander but we
wonder about the the wavering Twitter
and how if that will phase out what's
not quitters it's not Twitter something
else it'll be snapped yeah hey why do
you wonder if this was politics I wonder
if this will figure it out yeah I'm sure
I think I think that this might have
been like Twitter's like biggest hurrah
like that it is basically a presidential
candidate that become president elect
did it in many ways through Twitter so
yeah I don't know that we'll ever see
that again all right let's let's wrap
things up if you liked anything you saw
her or heard here check us out on seen
it I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin
