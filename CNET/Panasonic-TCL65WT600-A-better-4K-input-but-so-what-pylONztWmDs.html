is panasonic tc-p 65w t600 this is a 65
inch LCD TV and it's Panasonic's first
with 4k resolution that means this
gigantic screen has four times the
number of pixels as a standard 1080p TV
I'll get to that a little bit but first
also like to mention is TVs other
distinguishing characteristic it's the
first on the market with an HDMI 20
compatible input that means that some of
the higher frame rate formats that are
going to come out in conjunction with 4k
will work with this TV no other TV has
that right now although some are
promising upgradeability in the future
in addition to that 4k HDMI and a
DisplayPort that's 1.2 compatible this
set has three standard HDMI inputs three
USB s and an analog input the styling on
the WT 600 stands out as well you've got
a silver bezel around the edge
relatively thin you've also got a unique
ribbon style silver stand here it
doesn't allow the TV to swivel but all
told the real impression is lots of
silver one thing that i did find pretty
chintzy though on the bottom there's a
little piece of plastic that makes the
TV again look a little bit cheaper than
it should for such an expensive
television panasonic through and a bunch
of extras on this TV of course you get a
built-in camera you also get 3d
compatibility although it's active not
passive 3d panasonic throws in a pair of
3d glasses you also get a full suite of
Smart TV apps and features and
unfortunately panasonic also pushes ads
on the screen itself in form of popups
you can disable those pop-ups however so
I recommend you do when you get this
television another external awt 600 is a
pair of remotes there's a standard
clicker with a bunch of buttons and a
touchpad based remote with just a few
one of the advantages of touchpad remote
is that you can use the built-in web
browser a lot easier panasonic also
touts 4k resolution on the web browser
but in practice really didn't find that
made much of a difference and that's the
story with 4k in general on this TV at
this size when we put it next to a
65-inch 1080p TV and send it essentially
the same sources one in 4k one in 1080p
it was really hard to tell the
difference it was also hard to tell the
difference we sent both tvs standard
1080p sources from a blu-ray and again
since 4k sources are so rare you're
mostly going to be feeding is TV 1080p
for the foreseeable future aside from
resolutions TV delivers a pretty good
picture although not quite as good
some of the better lcds we've tested
it's black levels are pretty good but
there was some blooming that we saw
color accuracy was excellent it's bright
room picture led by this anti-glare
screen is one of the best we've tested
those good points aside where were 4k
really isn't worth the extra money I'd
say wait if you want to get a TV with
this resolution for a couple of years
when it's prices are a lot closer to
those a 1080p tvs that's a quick look at
Panasonic's WT 604 k 65 inch LCD TV i'm
