eleven month old iPhone 10 have a lot in
common especially when it comes to
photography both have dual rear cameras
portrait mode dual optical stabilization
and cost $1000 in the u.s. photos and
videos from both phones are fantastic he
had with so many similarities I was
interested in the differences so I took
them around in San Francisco to see how
they stacked up to each other
essentially the galaxy note 9 has the
same cameras found on the galaxy s 9
plus including that nifty dual aperture
but the note 9 adds scene capture
software that optimizes photos for 20
different subject categories for example
when I framed this photo the camera
detected a person notice the tiny icon
of a person the bottom of the screen and
the galaxy note 9 optimized its settings
accordingly the results are good though
a bit confounding the scene
optimizations are not obvious like
Instagram filters sometimes there are
very little noticeable differences when
the scene optimization is on or off take
a look at these pictures I took up a
course on the first one had it turned
off and here's the same croissant taken
with it enabled the galaxy note 9
identified the croissant as food which
it is notice the one taken with the
scene optimizer has richer looking
colors and is better exposed the iPhone
10 does its own optimizations for
textures patterns colors but unlike the
galaxy note 9 you can't turn it off
here's a shot from the galaxy note 9 of
Salesforce tower on the left and Fremont
tower on the right the iPhone 10 adds a
lot of contrast and chooses a color
temperature that seems a bit off making
the windows of the building on the right
look aqua green the note 9 gives a much
more faithful representation of the
scene and even holds the highlights and
the clouds better than the iPhone
something I noticed during this
comparison is how photos from the
Samsung devices like the s9 the s9 plus
and in this case of the note 9 look on
the phone screen versus my computer
screen so here's a picture some cares
that took at the Transbay terminal I
would say the picture looks a little too
bright almost like it was a little
overexposed
however when I go back to the note 9
screen it looks perfectly exposed and
the colors look saturated and the
temperature looks accurate to the way it
was in real life
the iPhone 10 on the other hand seems to
be optimizing the colors to make them
more vibrant and those chairs it's kind
of pop out but that's not the way they
looked in real life and it to my eyes
they look a little off especially
compared to the note 9 as far as
low-light goes the Galaxy Note 9 with
its dual aperture opening to super wide
F 1.5 has the edge over the iPhone 10
take a look at these photos taken inside
a dark bar with red lighting the iPhone
tends photo has noise in the walls and
is starting to look a bit painterly with
all that noise reduction while the
shadows are crushed the iPhone 10
handles the bar lighting pretty well now
here's the same scene taken with a
Galaxy Note 9 it looks brighter has less
noise but is also much softer notice how
the bar lights become white blobs so
let's talk portrait mode or live focus
as Samson calls it it basically blurs
out the background making your shot look
more like a DSLR neither phone is
absolutely perfect but both can yield
some killer results the iPhone 10 has
portrait lighting mode which allows you
to change lighting looks for your photos
before or after you take it when the
iPhone 10 nails a portrait like it did
here you see wonderful sharpness in the
face and eyes and a nice focus fall-off
from around the head and shoulders the
live focused shot from the galaxy note 9
does a good job separating the
foreground in the background and you can
even adjust the amount of background
blur before after you take the photo I
should note that beauty mode was turned
on for this portrait
video quality from both phones is good
I'd be happy filming with either one of
these in most situations as far as video
stabilization whether it's 4k or 1080p
the iPhone tends video stabilization
just looks better also I still can't
believe that both of these phones can
record slow-motion video at 240 frames
per second at 1080p resolution slo-mo
video from the iPhone 10 has better
colors and dynamic range than the Galaxy
Note 9 but the Galaxy Note 9 also has
super slow motion which allows you to
film at a whopping 960 frames per second
I'll be it at 720p resolution selfies on
both phones are ok I prefer the ones
from the galaxy note 9 over the iPhone
10 but as far as portraits the iPhone 10
offers portrait lighting mode for its
front-facing camera and the results look
pretty good especially compared to the
selfie focus mode on the galaxy note 9
however if you're a fan of beauty mode
smoothing your skin out the Galaxy Note
9 is the way to go also in the galaxy
note 9 you could just hold up your hand
to take a selfie as far as selfie video
the galaxy note 9 looks sharper it has
better colors but it crops in a lot and
I do mean a lot the iPhone 10 looks okay
a little flat sometimes then there's
that S Pen on the galaxy note 9 which
can double as a remote control to take a
photo this was such a hit with the
people I showed it off to but fret dot
iPhone 10 fans you can do the same thing
using the ear pod that came to their
phone it just need to be within the
length of the cable
so to wrap everything up it seems to me
when the Galaxy Note 9 was announced
that people were disappointed that
Samsung hadn't radically changed up the
cameras but the small additions that
were made like scene optimization for
photos are really nice the iPhone 10
even after almost a year still takes
phenomenal photos and videos and has one
of the best all-around cameras on any
phones but if you're considering an
iPhone 10 I would say wait
rumor has it Apple might be announcing
some new iPhones pretty soon
