for triathletes this $450 watch can
track running biking and swimming using
gps and glonass
there's even a special triathlon mode
that lets you switch between each sport
with a single button press rather than
having to manually stop one and start
the other this mode will also time how
long you take during your transition
between each sport overall I like the
735 xt it's very lightweight and
comfortable to wear while training or
even throughout the day but there are
some concerns it lacks an altimeter and
instead of relies on altitude
measurements through the GPS which I
found weren't all that accurate the
heart rate sensor also doesn't work
while swimming so you will need to spend
extra money on a swim proof chest strap
but even then it won't display data in
real time and will only show it after
your workout is complete and battery
life while good it may not be long
enough for some people to finish a full
Ironman it will last up to 14 hours with
an active GPS signal and heart rate
tracking but that drops if you have
GLONASS turned on
there is a special ultra track mode that
will extend battery life to 24 hours but
it disabled the heart rate sensor and
reduces how often the GPS is pinging the
satellite so there are some sacrifices
but during training I typically saw
between 5 to 7 days it was more than
adequate for me but your usage will vary
depending on how frequently you work out
the 735 xt is an exceptional triathlete
watch it's slim and light it's
comfortable to wear and it has almost
all of the features you would need to
compete overall it will do just fine for
most triathletes but if you rely on
accurate altitude information a
quick-release kit or looking for
something with longer battery life the
Fenix 3 or phoenix 3 HR may be worth the
upgrade for more information on the
forerunner 735 xt check out my full
