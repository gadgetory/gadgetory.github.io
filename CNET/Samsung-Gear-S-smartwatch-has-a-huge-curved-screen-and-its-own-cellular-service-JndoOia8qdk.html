wrist what a samsung Smart Watch this is
the Samsung gear s now if you're keeping
score this is yet another SmartWatch
it's actually the six in their line but
every one is a little different and this
has a curved two inch AMOLED display 360
by 480 the biggest and widest SmartWatch
that we've seen from Samsung and it's
running Tizen so this actually goes back
to running with the gear 2 and the gear
2 neo ran which is Sutton's own app
collection they're going to be a
thousand apps available by the time the
gear s launches and one more special and
probably the biggest thing this has its
own SIM card and it has Wi-Fi so that
sure you're pairing this to your phone
and that still means samsung phones
running Android 4.3 just like the other
gears but it will allow you to get
notifications and connect online for
messages whether you're connected to
Wi-Fi or again with its own data plan
now details on that aren't yet available
now it has a removable strap here it's
this one's a rubbery you know
comfortable but definitely wide
hyper-stylized type of a feel and it has
a heart rate monitor ip67 for water
resistance just like the gear 2 and the
gear 2 neo and the watches can actually
go into a low-power mode
much like you saw in the Android wear
gear live and there's more there's a
battery charger here that actually has
its own battery pack so now when you
plug this into charge you could fully
charge this too and give it an extra
boost so you can pop that in on the go
and give it a little more juice expected
maybe about two days of battery life but
that really remains to be seen but you
can see here that it is a bright vivid
screen with a lot of functions a lot of
apps and s-voice
but similar types of functions that
you'd find on the gear 2 neo this also
has Nike Plus support so you can use
this as a Nike Plus Fitness device that
app is included here and boom you can
use it to run and connect to Nike Plus
on the go this is definitely the premium
end of Samsung Smart Watch spectrum the
Samsung gear s I'm Scott Stein at C net
with the Samsung gear s here in New York
