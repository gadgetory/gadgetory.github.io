has helped evolve storytelling from your
perspective well you know if we go back
to right back to the beginning into Lord
of the Rings the essential thing that
was discovered on that was that Peter
Jackson had this idea that you know up
to that point visual effects were
imagined they were imagined by other
actors you know in real you know
shooting on live sets so they had to
imagine that there was a dragon there or
or you know a threatening beast or
whatever it was and Peter Jackson did
not want the actors playing Sam and
Frodo in Lord of the Rings to have to
imagine what Gollum was doing so he
wanted to have an actor on set play that
character and then the then performance
capture or as it was called in those
days motion capture it was beginning to
kind of emerge as a tool but that was
the sort of the main tipping point was
was it was this moment where we suddenly
went from a visual effect becoming real
character and and that was having an act
to play the role so so I would go and
shoot on set with with my fellow actors
on live sets and live locations but I
would always have to go back and repeat
the the plates the empty plate that we'd
shoot both with the actors and then we'd
have empty plates shot I'd have to go
then back and populate those empty
plates using motion capture on my own in
the studio the significant changes over
the course of the next 17 years was such
that when I went back to work on King
Kong we started to use facial capture so
I had 130 markers stuck to my face but
it was still in a controlled environment
it was done in a motion capture stage
then when then in between those films we
started working on Tintin and and at the
same time avatar was happening and at
that time they freed up the actors to
work in the volume wearing head mounted
cameras so that you're fully free to
move in 360 degrees
whilst you are being captured and then
the next big shift in technology was
taking all of that and then placing on a
live action film set so that you didn't
have to go ever go back and repeat it
that we could capture everything in the
moment so acting opposite your live
action actors which I'd always done but
I had to repeat it this now we could we
had the technology to put the
performance capture cameras in the same
room as real film cameras and lighting
and get the whole thing all in one here
so that's that was that was the sort of
the progression are you still blown away
by any of the the evolutions that have
happened maybe things there like I
didn't realize I didn't think this could
happen or is it and it will happen how
you thought it would it's it's I mean
the the essence of it hasn't changed
hugely but what has changed is the
artistry that goes with it the software
the the engineering that that and the
rendering and all of that that makes it
feel more photo-real but also the
artistry in the sense that I have now
been working with that team for for over
the course of 17 years so they they
fully understand what it is to to honor
the actors performance and to try and
emulate it exactly and that and through
through all the new software that's been
encode that's been written to to make it
look photo-real then you've got to
actually you know because what what the
director is working with in the cut is
the performance that he's shot on the
day so so my face will live in the cut
for months and months and months when
they come to make Caesar's face work
there is this an artistry of bringing
you know Caesars face putting it next to
mine and going well okay the first pass
animation shows you know what Andy's
doing is he's being angry but there's
some vulnerability there but we were
only seen that the anger are there so so
there's literally 120 iterations per
shot until you've exactly matching that
the the authored performance by the
actor so that's and when you see those
shots start to come through you you you
know it those have improved dramatically
over the last then you know certainly
throughout the course of making these
three movies</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
