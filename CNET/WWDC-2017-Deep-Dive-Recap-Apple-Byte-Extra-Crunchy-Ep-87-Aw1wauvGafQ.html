Francisco California it's the Apple byte
extra country podcast with your host mr.
Brian Tom what's up everybody welcome to
the show guess would you guys all tuned
in we have some issues with our iTunes
podcast before for the pre-show the
preview of WWDC you're here for the WWDC
recap show we're going big here and when
I talk about big we're timeout our
executive level fine senior editor I
call him ed editor extraordinaire Scott
Stein in the house joining us for this
entire podcast are you ready for this
Scotty oh yeah I'm totally ready you've
got a swivel chair oh that adds that
adds like is that an augmented reality
live streamis guy this is my VR chair
you got a soul in your VR chair haha
absolutely so everyone just obviously
the orders of business when we start
this show off this is a complimentary
piece to our Apple bite video podcast
that comes out weekly here we get a
really deep dive get in-depth and talk
to you guys and gals as well as the
experts here see net but in case you
want to be a part of the show because
that's what it's all about you can
always call us is our voicemail system
at one eight hundred six one six two six
three eight I think there's a lot of you
that have thoughts and feelings about
what just happened we'll talk about that
but we also want to hear from you so
make sure you call in your name where
you're from and what you want to talk
about but let's just jump in this Scott
you were there on site I think that the
way that mainstream media has been
covering this event is always kind of a
little different than how the tech media
covers it of course there's a lot of
excitement about the home pod and we're
gonna kind of use it as our launching
point the home pod tell me you were
there you did get to see it correct yeah
I got to see it I got to listen to it
and that's what I want to hear about you
know a lot of people aren't privy to
being able to get into these demo rooms
and see it can you explain to us exactly
what they even showed because it doesn't
feel like they obviously when they
announced it they positioned it as a
music speaker they really weren't trying
to focus as much on the smart aspects of
it maybe it's not baked yet that's fine
but what did they actually show you on
site really just the speaker demo
completely didn't do
if they didn't do anything smart with
this thing I mean you know terms of
smart functions um so this was a this is
a chance just to listen to it and if you
didn't order to get the message on stage
that they were focusing on music for
this and how it sounds
that was completely the focus so it was
like Siri you're in a room and you are
sitting down listening to five songs and
Apple showed it next to Sonos play three
and Amazon echoes I was interesting
they're actually computing products to
listen against which is really not often
the case uh in that demo and I'm not an
audio reviewer so I want liked I
Pendlebury in there or someone you know
I want their ears but even they said
it's hard to tell and it can contain
demo you can't really judge what
happened to make that experience occur
but it sounded really good sure that
demo was really crisp booming and they
were trying to show that it worked in
360 degrees that if you walked around
the room it sounded good from different
angles whereas the play three up against
the wall and the Amazon echo sounded
flattered
and or tenure um echo Sam much different
so nose was fine but it didn't have the
same 360 sound but you know what does
that mean and how does that you know how
is that actually going to feel later but
they are showing that this is and they
also played not just one home pod but
two home pods so I got to listen to two
in the same room and that's one of the
pictures they're making is don't get one
get two set them up to speakers multi a
home pod your house in it they basically
act as stereo speakers they split the
music and do a surround more of a
surround effect like you would with um
you know putting home speakers in your
house for for anything hey Scott so
here's the thing right the three when
it's it's always interesting when you're
at Aquino because you know there's
always kind of some level of the way
that Apple shapes us and you you know
sometimes you're around the buzz but you
know I can't ignore the fact when
they're demoing this it's almost like oh
yeah by the way to home pods are seven
hundred bucks yeah and when you talk
about that just from the competitive
landscape we know that Apple
charges a premium you know my guess
before the keynote would be that I would
be like 249 the Amazon echo is 179 the
Google home is 129 instead they went 349
and so it seems are they when you when
you've been to so many of these events I
don't want to say are they still kind of
they are in this bubble of their own
world but to kind of just brush it off
like get to its 700 dollars like it's
it's almost like are they paying
attention to what's going out there do
they we know they have a high-end
customer that will buy that stuff we get
calls in my emails about that all the
time but you can't ignore that $700 for
two speakers is completely out of the
ballpark of what is actually happening
in the industry from a standpoint of
speaker slash smart speakers yeah it
means like they were clearly playing in
like a so no space or like Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen sort of territory you know this
is like this felt like that type of a
demo versus anything like Amazon echo or
Google home this is not and also those
are you know on sale a lot you get it
for 100 bucks and you can get them as
basically stocking stuffers you know
even if you're not fully on board with
what a smart speaker does at 100 bucks
you play around with it and a 349 that's
well out of that range so you're not
going to just play around with it
probably for that for that price and
that's where I think this is a very
different proposition and it's bigger
Google home the Google home is not in in
the demo so I don't know why but um
Google home is really small and the home
pod is not small it kind of feels like a
cantaloupe that's a curtain you know
we've seen a lot of obviously the
internet reacted to it it was like oh it
looks like a roll of toilet paper it
looks like a cat scratching post I
thought it looked just like a big giant
marshmallow that I would want to you
know toast oh yeah the other thing that
you you mentioned is how they positioned
it in they clearly were focusing on this
is a music speaker and then maybe it's
because they don't have with all the
smart functionality baked in the biggest
thing that I was expecting and we had
talked about this before of what Apple
could do here at WWDC is just talk about
their vision for Siri and their platform
and it just really didn't happen there
were nods to Siri getting a little
better but
there's no actual real deep-dive of how
it's smarter why it's smarter what
things can it actually do was that a
missed opportunity or is it something
that you think okay I'll give you a
chance to talk about it more in
September but if we don't talk about it
any more in September it's got to be
kind of a red flag of as the industry is
moving in that direction where does
Apple really stand and I can think about
that whole show I actually expected a
lot more talk about Siri in general and
I feel like for all we were expecting a
lot of talk about Siri I don't think it
was talked about all that much WWE and
not enough and you know I am holding the
air freshener here the Google home um
I've got it biblically is so small yes
is like a really cute little thing and
you could just put this somewhere and
not worry about it but this is the
market that Apple needs to think about
what are they doing to make their thing
smarter and I think there's a lot that
needs to be addressed with that sure how
apps hook into it how Siri is going to
listen better they better have a
separate event diving into all that I
don't know if that can be shoehorned
into share the stage with an iPhone
event because it sounds like a lot maybe
it's a separate event and it's coming
out in December so and and for Apple
sometimes a month means like the very
end of the month so you know like was
December going to be like December 31st
I have no idea but you know it's usually
they tend to the the window tends to be
a little bit later um
I don't know that's anecdotally um yeah
I really want to know a lot about what
it's going to do how it's going to be
aware in your home that's an interesting
part of it too is how it's meant to be
spatially aware and understand where the
other one is or even they didn't explain
how but how it understands what's going
on in your room is it sending out is it
infrared or sound waves or you know what
is it what is it doing the math your
room out and and push the audio in a
direction that it sees makes the most
sense so that's pretty interesting
as tech there are others that I think
have dabbled in that but that you know
that kind of remains to be seen that was
really not explained what is the media's
feeling around it because when you're
there
everyone knows that they're behind
Amazon echo there behind the Google home
and when Apple talks about is it almost
like I don't want to say it's
tongue-in-cheek but are the reporters
kind of like okay you guys have to admit
that you're not really you're not there
yet but they don't admit that is there
almost a weird tension or thing that is
just there while they're talking about
this and you guys like uh you know you
guys are really behind still I think
we're just waiting for some of those
things to show up and when Apple is
going to amplify the solution you know I
think there's you know when you see VR
being mentioned on stage you go okay uh
VR is here you know Apple is finally
addressing VR the same thing with AR um
I like the direction that they were
choosing what they are I feel like it's
almost like Google cardboard you know
it's they're trying to make it much more
accessible and I think it's a it's a
smart move but yeah you do wait for like
machine learning there was like machine
learning drinking game online before you
know how many times can you mention it
you also get numbed out when you start
hearing machine learning because what is
it you know it sounds like an 80s dance
craze you know what is the hahahaha
machine learning uh craft work you know
it's it's very what does that mean for
Pete
it means like eight different things
there's a billion ways you can apply
more than eight you apply so many
different ways the machine learning does
things it's really like programming you
know it's like that doesn't really
explain what it does at the end so I do
think that there is a question that on
the other hand Apple will also I'm
always interested that press sometimes
even seems more optimistic about some of
the directions like the iPad introducing
computing features there's a whole other
thing we can get into Oh Joe the iPad
because I have a few distinct thoughts
on that well you know what will
transition over that I do want to talk a
little bit just quickly since you didn't
mention it earlier hear about the
augmented reality you know push for
Apple I thought is really fascinating
because we've we've seen demos like that
before but then all of a sudden again it
shows how powerful the muscle the
ecosystem the reach that Apple has when
once they show this you're like holy
crap
you have you have all
these devices on the market you won't
need to buy any single bit of additional
hardware to enjoy these experiences and
developers obviously are smart enough to
be thinking hey the platform is there
the App Store is there the devices are
there it's time for me to finally
develop for the iOS platform when they
touted their instantly you know the
largest AR platform alike they
absolutely are and it's smart just from
a business standpoint yeah and they also
can so as compared to Google because I
was thinking well why isn't Google doing
like a you know air toolkit in its in
Android and I think the answer is that
Apple just has a much more contained
hardware platform and they can say just
a nine and eight ten chips that they can
optimize graphically for it and I think
that's why Google had to make a tango
phone among other things and that same
thing with daydream where only certain
phones get daydream VR because there
were just so many Android phones and so
many Android solutions that they can't
optimize for particular things unless
they create a cutoff so Apple at least
has that advantage and it's smart
because then you you have a lot of
people using it it we're already using a
Optimum's between snapchat Pokemon go
whatever and they're and they're
basically saying okay we know that
everyone's making these things anyhow
let's just make them better and more
consistent I think they're trying to
create lookup like a core framework and
thinking so like maybe down the road if
they're thinking about other types of
things that could start being set up now
but it's it's it's beginning that demo
with the lamb I thought was really cool
it it's like it looked better than I got
to look at Microsoft's view mixed
reality which was it AR through their
Windows machine and they had that at
their education event that was okay but
it was a little more like pop up in a
little more a little bit more janky it
didn't look as polished because again
they I don't think it was as graphically
optimized from what I saw but um I guess
it was like an early peak but I think
it's good I I think it's not like rocket
science I don't think it's something
that's you know really all that
different than other things that are out
there but bring
together um I'm not I'm not an engineer
where am I it might be rocket science I
have no idea dismissive such a
dismissive thing for me to say no come
on you're such a jerk
it's not rocket science I mean a bike
but I do think it's really it looked
really good I think for a lot of people
this is going to be what AR is and so
it's a smart move for Apple with that VR
though it looks like they're just trying
to make creative toolkits yes froggy and
platforms and it's like if you're making
your big Star Wars experience at ILM or
if you work in VR design sure but
they're not even looking at like games
or the average person using VR the other
thing is and as we talked about this a
our VR platform and how Apple is really
sinking their teeth into it you know
they showed off the iMac Pro and
obviously it's going to be a beast and
obviously they're like look you can
develop VR on here your metal 2 platform
is going to be able to help support that
as well so we have the tools in place
but it reminds me a lot of hey look
people don't think of the Mac as a
gaming platform people have already
started their development in their
workflow on the PC for VR development
although they have the hardware there
yes it's a build it and they will come
I'm really curious to see how many
developers are just going to be all of a
sudden ok we're just going to go to the
Mac exclusively and develop here now
when HTC vive oculus they've had they've
established at least a framework for
years and will those developers and
those companies all of a sudden want to
pivot
what will that Mac iMac pro be that
compelling that they that they want to
do that do they want actually if they
even look at the Mac platform when they
maybe even want to look at the actual
future Mac Pro modular design whatever
that is instead of say hey we're gonna
go all gung-ho on a $5,000 plus a Mac
Pro I think I can see what they're
trying to build there and lay the
foundation but as as a usual right
hardware software goes hand in hand I
don't know if developers are gonna flock
over the iMac I haven't seen even any
stories of developers saying we're
definitely going to give the Mac a try
now for our VR AR development at least
VLS a VR
yeah I totally agree first of all there
was that you know they've acknowledged
there's a future MacPro that'll be more
upgradable and then you'd want to wait
for that uh if you are developing VR you
know and you're really in the industry
you're probably using what you've got to
be using Windows thing for all of its
ability to experience and develop and
and the graphics flexibility there were
some tweet or some comments that had
said that this is more for people
already use Mac's and I think I would
agree with that and I think this is I
think the I'm they're trying to say that
here's a solution um should you want to
use Mac's we're going to be there we're
going to offer this and it's it's
available now versus later but I agree
how many people going to pick that I
don't know I think it's trying to
provide a solution for high-end Mac
users who one also dabble in creating VR
and have a machine that's capable that's
that that's definitely a subset I don't
know you're buying saying is $5,000 um
and it's not upgradable I don't know
right that sounds that sounds rough it
doesn't sound like the most attractive
proposition and yes you can find buy one
potentially with eighteen an eighteen
core Xeon processor based iMac pro but
again it still won't be expandable once
you buy it right I mean it won't truly
expandable the other thing that I saw
when we were watching this photo oh go
ahead then it just becomes the one that
your kids use the $10,000 18 cores yeah
I'm out do your homework on the Mac bro
hey minecraft looks amazing on that I
Mac Pro come on let's not let's not
discredit that okay but the other thing
about the iMac Pro when I saw the
announcement the first thing that I just
you know when you have like that what I
call the sniff test when I watched it I
was like wow this was their actual
vision for their next Pro machine we
know the Mac Pro the trash can the
cylinder design it hasn't been touched
and they hadn't acknowledged that they
made a boo-boo but it's really
interesting because the iMac Pro that we
saw today is really what they believe
or believed for at least the past three
years that this was going to be their
next new Pro machine when all of a
sudden this April they're like actually
yeah we realize we're alienating our Pro
users that want expandability
customization but it I don't want to
call it a lame duck product because it's
going to appeal to a certain audience
but that's what they thought would be
their next Pro machine I thought it was
kind of interesting like it's almost
like a relic of the past of their
thinking being put on stage because they
still have to but I'm really curious to
see how many people are gonna actually
buy the iMac Pro with that idea of a pro
machine I think the value is still there
the price points there but that is what
they felt was their Pro machine what do
you think about that did you feel that
at all either um yeah hard to tell I
would I would say I'd want to wait and
you know I'd kick myself if there was a
new Mac Pro that was more like the thing
I'd need so yeah if it's launching at a
weird time December or end of the year
you know when is it coming out like you
know they said the summers with it yeah
so it's it's an odd time and uh I don't
know I mean you might want to wait
that's what I'll have totally agree yeah
I just I don't know meanwhile I guess
the Mac Pro became the home pod exactly
that thing looks just like a Mac Pro do
you know what the best part about I
don't know if you've seen the videos but
if you look at the original Mac Pro
launch videos like you know when they
have their sexy teaser videos I kid you
not the angles the way they tilt it the
way they is exactly you could literally
swap them out for each other right it's
just missing the hole in the center the
hole is now the Siri because here we go
right but it's like practically it's
it's smaller but I mean it's it really
is like very much in that zone we pulled
out on the Apple byte uh you know are
one of our prototypes that we stole from
their headquarters and we literally
wrapped a MacPro in the fishnet
stockings that's great so that that is
that's exactly to your point right make
your own may you can have a Mac Pro
looking thing for
3:49 now let's you know let's jump to
the iPad pro people that listen to this
show I should stop saying it no I'm a
big fan of the iPad pro I know you have
your thoughts on it I felt that it was
to me the star of the show from a
standpoint of I know that the surface
pro as a hybrid device that has a
desktop OS and the tablet OS can do more
but what I really liked and maybe it
feels like it's a year too late but what
I really loved about the iPad pro is it
feels like its own thing like what the
way that you're interacting with it you
can't do that with a service although
yes the service can technically do more
I liked how they finally made it a beast
of its own and really I don't even know
if they should call this iOS 11 on the
iPad they should it should be it's
finally its own thing and I I applaud
them for that but it does feel like it
came a little late especially with
tablet sales just continuing to decline
I don't know if it's going to give them
a spike i pre-ordered mine right after
the announcement because again I am the
biggest iPad pro freak but I'd love to
hear your thoughts because you clearly
have some about them yeah so I been
looking forward to the iPad pro getting
an update for a while and iOS being
updated for the iPad so I thought a lot
of those updates when I wrote it like a
preview wishlist piece a lot of those
got net on the dock the file system the
the added modes for presentation I think
those are great I like the fact that
it's going to be more pencil based where
you can instantly take notes new
handwriting search making those old
great moves and looking at the 10.5 it's
definitely a nice screen enhancement my
other question is if you have a nine
point seven inch iPad pro I don't think
you would need to upgrade because it's
it's a modest screen gain you are
getting processor but who knows I mean
it's not it's not clear and right now
it's not clear on iOS 11 will make it
you know great compared to the nine
point seven or the previous generation
iPad pro the twelve point nine from late
2015
maybe that one is great you get that on
sale so I don't know that's that as a
thought as you know with the with the OS
make it great um would
you want the new one no matter what so
we have to kind of measure that out but
I think it's great I'm disappointed by
the fact that it still feels a little
too much like iOS for iPhone you know I
want I agree it needs to be its own
thing I think they should just keep
moving away get away from the grid of
apps uh be comfortable making a bold
move because I don't think it's going to
be that crazy a change people will get
used to it at this point and it would
help present more things on screen you
have a lot of screen space plus
accessories they did not announce new
threes for this that so I thought that's
the first thing that shocked me not only
that right so i pre-ordered this so I
have an original iPad pro I was always
mad and jealous about the true tone
screen I love this whole 120 you know
Hertz refresh rate and the fact that the
pencil is gonna work better much your
point earlier about Oh will someone
upgrade I think if you're someone that
really does use the pencil artistically
or how you use your iPad pro today you
should if you or if you're thinking
about upgrading I think it's worth it
but if you're just using your iPad like
you're using the iPad the same way you
did three years ago four years ago I
don't know if there's an its I don't
think it's worth upgrading right it's
right it's actually a lot of it yeah so
um but your point about accessories so I
buy this iPad problem like all winners
you know what are these new cool you
know what are the cool things I can get
and I don't know if you saw this but
they're selling a freaking case like a
leather case for the pencil just like a
sleeve specifically for the pencil
pretentiously yeah just like like a
cover for the pencil for 29 bucks and
I'm like wait okay let me look out and
see what else they have now they have a
full leather sleeve that has a little
slot for you to put your pencil and it's
like 149 I'm like but then it completely
exposes the iPad when you need to take
it out like I'm sorry I kind of need to
have it protected on the backside which
was then weird to me because they
completely got rid of that silicon rear
case for the iPad they don't have any of
them online they have third-party ones
but not an Apple one and that don't leak
secure so you know that that hard
she'll kind of Apple branded yacon
that's not available for the 12.9 and
it's not on there when you search for it
that it's not there this is the one here
um if you go go to store go to store at
Apple comm and then they'll be like yeah
and goes is accessory there's but what
I'd use this silicon kittib axle-back
back and it's very useful yeah it's just
it's just standard right but then what
what about the smart connector man I
mean that what it are they completely
ignoring the fact that they put that on
the iPad let's talk about the smart
connector because I was asking Apple
about this and it's the same technology
in the new smart connector as the last
one
you would have heard about it it was
upgrade course you know uh right now the
smart connector Li was two things
keyboards and charge Docs like to allow
charging through pipe and Apple and
Logitech are the only companies I know
of that are making anything um like
Logitech is like the kind of exclusive
third party partner for it or you know I
don't know how it's being arranged but
there are no other companies and I'm
sure others have been wanting to I would
think no there are no other accessories
out there that I've seen and it's super
limited and why what else can it do you
know you should you should be able to
drive a trackpad which so I would love
that I would love to see a trackpad
I love whether or not Apple C is any
it's like of course you could have
certain app support it and you could
edit and that would be worth it for
people or a doc that would do other
things I don't know just it is strange
like the whole idea of that was meant to
be a modularity and there is very little
in terms of options and Apple's own
smart case the keyboard cover is the
same it's okay I like logitech's better
it's bet it's much more lap friendly
it's backlit types better and so
surprised that Apple didn't upgrade
their keyboard and take a chance of
doing something a little new maybe add
backlighting at least maybe it's not
powerful enough to but no it is Logitech
says backlighting of course it's
powerful enough um yeah you could have
made a backlit some cool glowing keys
whatever um it's just so
strange to me that you had this new
product in this big design and
accessories were not part of it that
transformed the iPad and that's like the
one remaining thing that prevents me
from using it as a laptop real laptop
replacement that in certain software
things but um you know that's usually
that that's usually the whole thing that
holds me back
and I bought the smart keyboard for the
iPad pro 2.9 inch are originally but I
returned it literally maybe two days
later because I hated how it felt it
doesn't even feel good you know when you
compare they're the Apple branded
keyboard to let's say the Microsoft
Surface keyboard it's not even close
like right the way it just feels the
feedback to push and so you know I like
I did like the Logitech one but it you
know it's a little thicker for me I want
them to give me a thin feeling sleeve
type nice responsive keyboard but that
appears to be too hard for them you know
why could they not have done the twelve
it they've developed this super small
butterfly keyboard mechanism the other
the macros and 12-inch MacBook you can't
put that on a case and offer that it's
so strange to me like that's that's what
Microsoft did they should have had two
variations at least the the soft one and
a hard one that's the minimum you have
to do and then the the maximum is to
rethink some of this stuff and think
about a new solution when is that going
to happen I it's such a slow I mean the
piece I wrote about it you know was
exactly that that I felt like this is a
gradual evolution and it seems like
we're just going to have to that's the
way it's going to be but it is it's
super frustrating because as much as I
like where the software is going I you
know I reminds me of iOS 9 they had good
updates for the iPad and then iOS 10
they had no updates for the iPad or
almost none and then iOS 11 they're
doing updates for the iPad is I mean
they're going to skip another year and
then you're going to see it later you
know just feels feels a little glacial
uh and I think it needs to be happening
more aggressively this leads me to
another question that I've always felt
for why
now especially after Apple put all their
apples and you know in in the basket for
the Apple watch do does it feel like
Apple is spread too thin because they're
doing just too many things now that they
they've lost kind of some of the focus
to bring some of that level of Polish or
you know you used to feel like hey this
is a solution they've got all this
they're focusing on this we see it year
after year but to your point it's like
okay iOS 11 gets that finally gets the
new tweaks it took to it's like a two
year cycle just across the board of a
lot of their things now yeah and so we
right before the event I remember the
one thing I got to say was I was looking
for synthesis product for the kid for
the keynote I don't think we had that
nope at the keynote
there was no grand unified theory of of
Apple and it may be that you know they
feel there can't really be one um but
yeah I agree that I mean the when you
that whole style of presentation which
was like we've got six things to talk
about and we go so let's go we got a
hurry we got a hurry um it felt like we
were already rushing and and to keep up
with all the points as opposed to
breathing and saying what is the one
thing we want to take away what is the
one idea and it sounds like Apple has
got a lot of work in a lot of different
areas they're trying to accomplish
pushing into a lot of areas that are
going to matter in the future a RvR um
still wearable tech and health um some
of them are very interesting and AI and
machine learning but it is all over the
place it feels like when you hear about
it and you wonder you know the classic
thing is for instance when you're at
home with your products ok Siri works
one way or in my iPhone it works another
way on my Apple TV works another way on
the watch on the iPhone I have some apps
that take advantage of 3d touch some
apps that take advantage of Siri summit
absent iMessage you don't know which are
going to be which and there's still such
a wide open area I remember app
developers in the past we're feeling
like they really had to make choices
between do I support this do I support
this because you can't you can't do them
all I think Apple is offering
so many options to explore that I wonder
about what's going to happen because you
know do you support Apple watch do you
support this part of the Apple watch do
you support this part of iPad um it's
it's kind of never-ending and it doesn't
feel like there's a clear hierarchy of
and it should have started with Siri and
maybe it still will the iPhone but when
are they going to announce that what are
they going to address that well that's
what's you know to the casual observer
to the tech fan to the tech reporter to
media it's it's not it's not like this
is hard for them to figure out everyone
wants to know what they're doing in that
space and if they really don't have
anything to show off or to tell a story
like I think about yeah they may not be
as sexy but at Google's i/o they told
the story of what they were doing with
AI how they were building it what
improvements they've done from your a to
B or whatever but they told us a story
and I this WWDC the first thing as we
were watching like this feels really
rushed there is no storytelling we to
get us maybe at least informed and also
a little more invested in okay this is
why they're doing it there's none of
that it's just AI OS has so many
features that they didn't talk about
that I would have thought might have
been interesting but because they were
so jam-packed they just went through
maybe five or six real fast they showed
off Mac OS Sierra's like did it I did it
and there was no reason or rhyme to be
like look this is where we're going this
is why we're doing this
they couldn't even spend five minutes on
something like that and so it just feels
like do they really know where they're
going and because it doesn't seem like
to us that they're telling us that other
than product product product product
WWDC and at the same time I know there's
workshops at WWDC I don't even feel like
this keynote was even really truly
catered to the developers that much you
know a little bit of showing the AR kit
but we've seen other demos where they've
gotten a little nitty gritty because
it's a Developers Conference developers
get no access to what they're doing with
Syria or with the home pod I just think
that the even the glaring you and I
talked about it they're in a lot of
different directions
they haven't set some sort of clear path
that we can all be like okay we're on
board with this oh he dropped uh-oh no
Scotty dropped off he's coming back okay
he's calling us back in a second
Scott I don't know how much you heard of
that or not I don't know what happened I
got I was thrown into the abyss I know I
didn't hear it how how much did you not
hear a fair amount everything I talked
to after Cirie I didn't you guys said
especially Cirie and then maybe the
Cirie God's punishment ha ha ha well
that's where Tana punished me oh you're
saying after you spoke it cut off yeah
oh so you didn't even hear me talk at
all huh
it was like dropping the mic oh you just
meant boom well you know what well
ultimately I just said everything about
their keynote felt rushed they didn't
give us any type of storytelling and it
you know Google explains their AI how
they're evolving it what's happened
before why they're doing this and we're
not getting any of that it was like
product product product and it's I just
we know we want to see a direction of
what they're thinking and they're not
telling us that well I think also it's
the it's inevitable effect of for a
while now a couple of years they had not
been having products at the developer
conference there you know they would say
okay we're not gonna crowd this
developer conference with products we're
going to focus on software this year
they introduced a ton of products and
then the flip you know there was
literally how many likes to eight or
whatever you know they're the max the
iMac Pro the iPad home pod that's like a
whole product event yeah so when you do
that in a two-hour span then yeah you
even have less time to talk about
software and strategy I think that was
the biggest reason why it felt so rushed
yeah so you know we could talk about
this for hours I think that we want to
just get to some of the phone calls and
then we'll wrap things up are you good
with that Scott yeah okay let's uh let's
see where we're at with the Apple bite
nation and again for all you listening
to extra crunchy you can always call us
at
calls and we got you know some positives
about WDC and we got some negatives
about oh very play both and see what
everyone had to say right
hey guys it's Ryan from Sacramento I
have to say that yesterday's Developers
Conference was one of the best that
we've seen in a while and that's
exciting uh my question today is about
the smart speaker that we saw I like it
many other people already have an Amazon
echo I have the dot and being in the
Apple ecosystem that I'm naturally going
to want to buy this new speaker because
I could play my iTunes I can use I
messaging all that stuff that I can't do
with Alexa but I also don't want to lose
the smart assistant Alexa because it
seems to be better than Siri so my
question is will I be able to pair these
speakers together somehow I know that
echo dot can pair wirelessly with other
speakers so I want to get the smart
assistant Alexa but still be able to
play my musics at a better sound quality
and use iMessage will I be able to do
this it's like having two girlfriends
one sexier one sounds better the other
one's smarter has a better personality
and I'm just trying to get them in bed
together you know what I mean Brian
loved the show can't wait to hear we
guys don't go warriors yes as if I have
experience in that area Scott I'll what
do you think I mean yeah sure it's
always it it always the dream for us to
have the best of both worlds from the
two top devices that we love I feel like
it's always a dream for us I want to
climb into bed with all the smart
speakers at once we can arrange that I
mean we can do a photo shoot it it could
be awkward but it could be amazing at
the same time I don't think that you can
count on the echo ecosystem syncing and
working with this smart speaker I don't
think there's any way that's not that's
not part of the game plan and but I do
think there's a chance it's a question
that all of these devices do have is
that we're going to start maybe having
more than one of them in our home how do
you deal with that you know what what
can you set up some to do some things
and some to do other
do these companies start acknowledging
that it's different than when you have a
phone and you pick one phone it their
price so that you could easily have
multiple devices in your home and it's
like all of these companies don't really
want to think about that but they're
going to have to and I think will be
really smart to come up with a solution
that acknowledges that you know the one
company that's trying to do this I don't
know if you recall Andy Rubin he
released the essential phone which is
kind of their answer to the phones but
he also announced the essential home
which is kind of their again they're
smart speaker home assistant they didn't
show it off it's only in renders but you
know their goal or really their dream he
said like we want this to be platform
agnostic we want it to be able to run
Siri we want it to run Alexa we want it
to run Google Google's assistant but you
know when you say that out loud and you
realize wait you have to make deals with
all these with these three groups to in
order to run their assistance on your
hardware it just doesn't seem realistic
based on how then the history of time
how these companies who have built these
platforms to really be an ecosystem that
doesn't necessarily play front friendly
with others for that to actually happen
I just don't see it I don't try to be a
you know I'm it's not that I'm not
optimistic but I just don't see
something like that happening well yes
interesting I got to talk with with
Essentials president a little bit Nicola
Damacy I yeah exactly that the strategy
that they're laying out is they want to
go it's like it's like central wants to
be the Android of smart home and
accessories that these are going to be
open source but then they acknowledge
that not everyone's going to play nicely
with them I do think that there's a
chance that two of the three will play
nicely yeah yeah because Android Alexa
is actually really open Alexa generally
plays nicely with everyone so I think
that will probably be fine and
considering Andy Reubens relationship
and it's they're using an Android phone
um I would think that they're going to
develop some way to fold in Google
assistant um but then it's really it's
Siri as the outlier and Apple I think
it's the one they're probably referring
to I mean I
also feel like if the the idea that they
were pitching was like quark they kept
calling it choreographing the home uh
which maybe sounds like a way to dance
around that how about their fingers can
you scare me really fold them in yeah or
is this is it like a logitech harmony or
you like developing scripts that begin
to learn how to deal with handing off
things to other services that don't that
aren't really integrated I don't know if
that's a right analogy but I kind of
feel like that might be what they're
trying to do but they're also trying to
become another player in the game
lightly they're gonna have their own
assistant and they're gonna want to be
like the one that you choose that's a
lot of things it is you know for the
Ferrari hey did we just want to throw in
a guitar riff just to give you some of
that bang
auto auto play which I will be fitting
will be addressed by a map by Mac OS hi
Sierra
alright let's uh Sofer to answer the
question to our color I mean you can
hold both of them in your arms in the
bed at the same time but they we don't
expect I highly don't expect Apple I'll
be working with you know being able to
talk to those anytime soon like that
it's just not an apples DNA we got to
try to make a video where we put them
two next to each other and try to get
them to talk to each other somehow like
trigger their words so that they say
things that trigger the other one so be
it'll be amazing I'm gonna try to figure
that out I'll let you handle that Beach
all right I'm gonna put the next call
here we go hey Brian my name is Johnny
from Washington DC I love the show I'm
actually a past contestant winner so
that's a thanks for the awesome gift on
that whoo so WWDC was this week and I'm
a little confused as to what Apple has
created that's innovative because from
what I see there's actually nothing new
that they've presented for example the
Apple does a new app store they didn't
have to create no one told them to
create a new app store that's not
innovation
let's see Apple pay they created a venmo
and then no app I don't understand
what's what's a so different about that
I mean it's basically the same thing as
venmo
um let's see Safari will block I will
play videos that should have been done
from the very beginning that is a
security patch not an innovation I don't
understand what Apple has cooked
demoscene Oh shown this this year to be
innovative it's quite frankly in my
opinion this is probably one of Apple's
and worse WWDC yet the only thing that
in my opinion might you know have some
innovation to it is the new live photo
features the software capability to
create like for example the seamless
move and some of the other effects those
definitely took much effort and from
from offensive software standpoint so in
that aspect yes I do agree they didn't
probably have some innovation but in
some good money investing into that but
everything else there's nothing
impressive so I don't I honestly if this
is what the new iOS is bringing I'm a
little scared as to what the new iPhone
is going to look like I hope that they
seriously step up your game
this is ice apples you know landmark
iPhone yet so they need to bring
something that is going to outshine and
outpace this past WWDC thanks for the
thanks for listening out it's long those
long I use use lighting at all Gowanus
you just letting it all roll but that's
okay look we'll see what hats the thing
it to me it's also kind of weird that
we're giving Apple the benefit of the
doubt to say like hey maybe they'll show
us something more with Siri at the
iPhone event which they might but really
they should have done it at WWDC so I'm
just gonna wait until then but man if we
don't hear about how it's changed or
evolved or really is you know at least
leveled up to a point where Kim where it
can at least hold its ground in certain
ways or maybe do unique things it just
feels like Syria's one you know the
stepchild that we're just going to keep
on beating up on when
everyone else is doing big things just
got drop off again no I'm here I'm just
like quietly listening I am I think
they've done a few things that were
innovative that are useful I think a our
kit is actually really useful for
developers are already excited about
that because I don't know if there are
that many toolkits that people can jump
in right now and really develop a our
apps with the way that I think Apple is
enabling it yeah but I think that was
nice
I don't think there's that much more and
that brings up the point I think
innovation of the OS was surprisingly
not there you know like except for iPad
I agree I was very surprised at iOS 11
for the big supposed 10th anniversary
yeah thing that we think is going to
happen with the iPhone you know and and
maybe a huge iPhone revamp in the fall
well this didn't really seem like this
did not suggest that yeah yeah even like
you said even the suggestion of it write
it again we'll see we'll see maybe
because of specific hardware features
they'll show us more but the basic
suggestion of it being you know a big
new revamp even you know I'm not the
type of person that needs to ask for a
complete facelift but if it is this 10th
anniversary phone you want it to feel
like oh like that's it but we didn't get
any of that
no all right next call all right no more
hey guys this is Blair and West
Hollywood you are able to listen to
YouTube with your browser and phone
closed on your phone it's called YouTube
red you have to pay 10 bucks guys
probably both got free for a month or
three months and just forgot that was
what it is and why is it that YouTube
can play it faster on the computer but
you aren't allowed to change speed on
the phone or the iPad thanks that the
more you know yeah I'm not gonna pay
time not gonna pay would you would you
pay $10 Scott to just so you could hear
the audio in the background on your
YouTube videos
with your phone turned off or the screen
off so I tried out YouTube bread as a
trial and now I'm paying for it so the
answer is yes but accidentally what's
the content on YouTube is it just
because you like not getting ads
basically and it's except I got a free
trial for YouTube bread and I tried it
out and I was curious but um I'm not
really into like you know unique YouTube
content and ads I can deal with on
YouTube I'm not tremendously bothered no
it was really just like I wanted to try
yeah and now but no but I would not want
to add that is yet another thing I'm
paying for are you personally paying for
an Apple music subscription I'd the
trial but I never decided to get on
board I heard there's a lot of really
flack about the planet of the apps show
that just released on Apple music
they're just saying like it's a really
drab attempt at a shark tank without
being anywhere nearly remotely as
interesting so I'm paying for Apple
music and now I'm also paying for spot I
basically I need to stop paying for all
these music services I I'm also paying
for Spotify a lot of us to have things
to test on different device exactly
exactly
to do but I've got pick one the problem
now is Apple music I'm worried about how
it has glommed into my my existing cloud
music library uh and I know people have
problems in the past when you've
deactivated it might a little hard to
get rid of some of your music right
somebody's my dad was some of your own
library somehow like associate those
with the cloud that's why I've always
been paired that's why I've never wanted
to do it after I had a bad experience
with iTunes Match scary
- all glommed and I don't know my
original music library is it's like on
some server I haven't plugged in for a
while so it's all like in the cloud I
dumped air ascitic you know it's got
some symbiotic relationship that I I
feel like I I don't know what to do with
this
I've walked down a road that I feel like
I should just try and pull it out yeah
and then I think it's gonna like rip the
brain stem out of my music collection
scare and I'm got to start all over and
I'll cry well that's that exactly right
now right cuz you you kind of invested
in and now you're like okay where do I
go from here I can't really go back I
can't really go full for but I'm you're
in the
tweener spot right now you're in the
tweener spot oh and yeah and by the way
why aren't they dressing that more I
would like Apple to talk about that
weird relationship with with music which
never you know I feel like we deal with
but they haven't tried upgrading and
dealing with and that makes me think
like I'm not a huge fan of the Apple
music app at all games of its layout and
to address with that guy said about
Arabia's before that about the App Store
I do not like the new App Store design I
was turned off by it immediately it's
you can't what the first thing you look
at is just a single icon of a single app
now but it's less discovery and totally
they suggested there's stories and there
will be articles and I don't really need
that at all yeah I need I need ways to
compare collections and you want to look
at charts and it's it just seems yeah it
seems way too presumptively curating
like yep you know oh this is the one app
you need today yeah like I don't need
apps every day I'm not it's not a daily
I'm not gonna look there every day for
like today's app fix well you know how
you were talking about oh I don't really
like how the aesthetic of the Apple
music app it really feels and looks like
that they're trying to get that
aesthetic across the board not only in
the App Store but even the messages app
kind of has a little bit of Apple music
aesthetic and you know in iOS 11 it's
it's kind of interesting some of the
decisions that they're taking and making
but I'm completely even I'm not even a
personally a developer just as a
consumer who wants to discover more
content I hate how the new app store
looks like and as a developer you've got
to hate that too I think it's going to
be painful and it the whole I really
don't get the daily thing that there's a
today view because with music it makes
sense if you're a music subscriber you
want new things every day to list put to
have in your ears that you're paying for
all this free content that you what
you're paying for it but I mean it's you
know you get to try it all you don't get
to try all apps it's not like you have a
key to every app in the kingdom and so
daily discovery of apps just seems like
a bizarre a use case that they would
focus on maybe this is what the show
plan of the apps is about for
discovering new app
that's their answer to redesigning the
app store what app are you using today
like I don't wake up every morning going
like time to try a new exactly I've
never yeah it's all about the buzz or
what you hear
alright do one more one more all right
let's get to it hey Brian hey Steven
really great show great job you both are
doing this is Pritam yo I'm calling from
Fremont California so usually I tend to
watch your show live but if not I watch
it late at night so thanks for the show
and good informated stuff now coming on
to the question so you know there's been
a lot of talk about Apple offering its
own video streaming service similar to
let's say Netflix Hulu and all that with
the live TV you know it's funny thing
that the Apple TV came out in September
2015 and it's been 2 years almost and
still they haven't given any service
what's up that that I mean I just wanted
to kind of understand the thoughts going
behind was that you know people like
AT&amp;amp;T DirecTV now sling TV PlayStation
view Hugh Liu live TV and you know
there's so many subscription services
now everyone's doing it what is Apple up
to something why is that dead lagging
behind just wanted to know your thoughts
and have a good discussion on this
thanks bye
yeah thanks so much for the K Brian hey
thanks so much for the call we've we've
talked about this a bunch of our show
earlier in past episodes of just how you
know there were many reports about how
Apple you know who thinks they're still
Apple walked in the room with executives
from the content providers the network
the cable operators and they want their
own terms you know they do have a large
user install base but the prices that
they were asking or what they wanted
right they they want it their way they
don't want it they don't want to take a
group of maybe 20 or 30 channels they
want maybe ten of the best channels they
want to control the terms and it's not
going to happen that way and we've
complained about it for I feel like I've
complained about it for at least over a
year and a half
we've been talking about a long time
just the fact that they couldn't get it
done at every every six months that went
by you saw a new player enter into the
market to have their own service and now
even if you look at the Apple TV
interface they have this watch app or
the TV app I can't remember what they
call it remember was like confusing to
me but they have this app that now kind
of curates the streaming services and
those of the ones that our partners are
kind of all integrated in this single
app where you can watch TV shows but it
doesn't include things like Netflix or
Amazon video it's just the partners that
they have it was almost to me a cop out
of the fact that they were not going to
do a TV service I don't expect that we
see them see one from them now maybe
they'll surprise us but there are no
indications that they've gone back to
the table to even do anything like this
and to me it's a little bit of the
reason why we don't see it today is kind
of more like apples hubris gets in the
way when it has to deal with other
companies and it's kind of in their DNA
unfortunately Scott do you have any take
on that
yeah it's they did not address Apple TV
much at all at this and I feel like that
was something that we expected it was
like the Amazon announcement was the
main thing and then they kind of wrapped
it up how was it on yeah and it's like
okay we knew that would happen
but I agree like I used to use I still
use fan TV reviews you know that was my
discovery app and I always felt like
their TV app is trying to be like that
to go cross-platform and it doesn't even
hook in everything the way that I'd
still like it to and then I totally
agree
if they're not going to be making their
own TV streaming package they should be
integrating other people's TV streaming
packages in Apple TV in a way that
allows you to pick one and bring it to
the forefront you know like you should
like you should be able to pick sling or
something else and and make it your
instant on TV and build an interface
around that it's very it's very strange
I feel like I don't really understand
where that's going and they're not
really talking about app development
much I feel like you're you're not
hearing any more about other types of
apps for the T which like we're because
it's yeah
pretty powerful box and why are they not
wise nothing happening
yeah again you know when we talk about
are they confused or they spread too
thin I don't know where the focus on
that product is either you know
everyone's like just give me a 4k Apple
TV look that's the most basic thing that
they could do that's just easy for them
to do but then we're talking about how
will the platform how is the platform
evolving what are they doing with the TV
service look I have a PlayStation view I
love it but that's what I use is my TV
streaming service I I don't know if
there's ever gonna be a reason for me to
really switch over an Apple one but so
many people are now invested in these
other TV streaming services well if they
even get back in there what are they
going to do and then like you mentioned
the whole app development WWDC they
spent three two minutes on just saying
Amazon is coming to Apple TV and that
was all that was literally it that's
crazy
and they haven't tried they're certainly
not keeping up with what everybody else
is doing and they're definitely not
going to the next level with where it
could be I do think for a brief time
when the when the revamped Apple TV came
out it was introducing a few new ideas
like the ability to backup and hear what
somebody said or um you know a couple of
other functions like that but yeah now
um you know what what is it doing to
advance and rethink the TV it's not yeah
it's not that's just the bottom line
it's not so you know what before we
leave Scott do you have maybe I don't
want to put a number on it but what was
your overall feeling about WWDC as a
whole you know thumbs up thumbs middle
thumbs down where do you stand with all
of that I'm more thumbs up yeah me not
because I think that you know look there
are many years we kept saying why are
there no new products or we're not
talking about this and they did oh they
did a lot in this show but I'm I'm just
you know it's skepticism about where all
these things are going to go and how big
any one of them is going to be like they
did have their home speaker we just
don't know anything more about
we you know they they dip they dipped in
AR and VR big-time but we just don't
know how transformative either one will
be for them and they updated the iPad
you know there's there's all these areas
that we've been talking about like will
they do it um so in that sense a lot of
bases were covered but the reason why
I'm feeling you know it's just like are
you feeling it like as you're watching
it you know when something resonates
with you totally and you go that's
awesome
and I there weren't really many moments
like that and so that's the part where
you go was just going too fast or just
you know and you wonder where they if it
was a bigger thing why wouldn't they
emphasize it more so I just feel like it
you don't step away having been inspired
in a lot of different directions and
that's a big part of what a developer
conference should be - because you're
talking to developers you're meant to be
inspiring developers this is a pitch you
know you're saying it's tools but it's
also a pitch and I think that there
wasn't enough of that big bold
inspirational push all right oh my voice
just cracked did you hear that that
means the time it's time for the podcast
and holy cow I hope people still listen
to us all the way through but they
completely ignored that fact all right
Scott thanks the Pres my voice is shot
you're the one that flew in on a red-eye
and just got a home back in the East
Coast and I'm the one whose voice is
cracking um I may or may not just be
wearing boxer shorts let's um yeah that
we you can keep the camera tilted up I
really know but um okay but the UM San
Jose was fun I got to have delicious
foie Thanks recommendation from Lynn LA
yes and that was just a comment you want
to throw in there before we in the show
right that was just a comment I wanted
to say I don't know why I'm plugging a
bowl of noodle soup no consciousness
just coming out at the end of the show
but I just know I'm just feeling like
exactly that uh it was nice to be there
I was exhausted maybe that's why my
voice didn't fall apart well Scott hey
