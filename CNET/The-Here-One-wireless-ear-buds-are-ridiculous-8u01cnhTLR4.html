it's live coverage of CES 2017 i am
brian tong and join me here is CEO no
crap from Doppler labs two thumbs up for
this guy he's here to show us some
really cool not even really cool to me a
little bit of a mind-blowing wireless
earbuds we know wireless earbuds are
super hot and Noah first of all thanks
so much for coming out here being here
we appreciate it I know you're busy man
and a let's just jump right into it
we're here to talk about the year one
year but is that the official name of
them or what what do you guys call them
you know what what do you call them dear
one okay see that's that's why he's here
to tell me it's here one thing they're
here buds haha or here a bowls uh we
don't like that see people been throwing
that around I get it basically piggy
backs on wearables which has a lot of
connotation to it yes the way we look at
it is here ones truly the first computer
for the ears and I know that's a big
statement yeah I was doing but the way
we look at this product is obviously
there's a lot of wireless headphones on
the market and if you know we started
with this product called here active
listening the main purpose of pure
active listening was to tune you in or
tune you out of your world in a way that
was right for you right showcase last
but that was show yeah that was your yes
right exactly right off the technology
exactly and the purpose of that was we
wanted to give people full dynamic
control over how they hear the world we
call it kind of superhuman hearing you
put that product in and you could turn
the volume up you could turn the volume
down you could add filters like airplane
mode and it was really kind of augmented
reality now we knew to really make this
a product that people could use all the
time headphone functionality is
something people need and so with here
one what we did is we said look we're
going to use the kind of basis of a
headphone wireless headphone as a way to
get people to adopt this product if you
think of the analog of kind of the
iPhone right the iPhones a computer but
when Apple launched it they didn't call
it a pocket computer they called it an
iPhone because the core function to
begin with was phone calls but then you
had apps and then you add email and so
the way we look at the world is we
believe in the future people are going
to be wearing tech in their ears a lot
more and we want to give people a full
feature set of you know streaming
telephony but also the secret sauce we
add is when you put the product in you
can hear the world totally normally and
that's what you're going to try today
because what that allows you to do is
still be able to interact with
people have this experience it's dynamic
as well as utilize a headphone telephony
and everything else you'd find in a
normal head I think what I want to be
clear to the audience right now is that
you know I brought here one on stage
because I've never tried these um there
this is really the first time that
they're showing them off you know - you
know outlets to showcase in video format
yeah um do you guys have kind of been a
little more secretive like okay we'll
let some of the writers talk about it so
you know to me there's this little bit
of like tech hype built up and I just
wanted to be to experience the first
time but also allow you all watching a
really understand what's going on here
because quite honestly this is one of
the products and I'm most hyped up for
2017 and so why not bring in the stage
everything I've read and heard sounds
bonkers so can you first of all to kind
of like bust them out and yeah so Matt
give me a give me a pair of here one so
I also got a new nickname from instead
of you know computer for years yeah how
about a compute here we've you can
imagine every version and I was the
first one wasn't the first one we've
even you know ear pewters oh every bad
branding idea you can imagine I think
that's great break your ear Peters yeah
it's good all right take this out this
is your one so the first thing is this
is for your left ear okay I'm gonna get
ya give give people a chance to kind of
see these right this is like all
wireless earbuds or hear like the here
ones yeah this is a charging case
correct yes and so basically the way the
tech works is the charging case
basically allows you to get multiple
charges out of it but as you can see the
buds are really small and we spend a lot
of time with this a product yeah making
sure we kind of tried to balance three
things one is aesthetics it's really
important to us this is a product people
wear proudly because it has that pass
through people are going to be wearing
this in social environments right we
actually launched the last product at
Coachella and you can imagine having
people protecting their ears is not the
easiest thing at a festival but that's a
whole part of the ethos of what we're
doing we want to play in spaces where
our normal wireless headphone can't
because the normal wireless headphones
about isolating you so you can listen to
a string now we can do that very well as
you'll try but what we can do that no
one else can do is that full
augmentation that allows you to connect
with okay let's put in your image give
it a shot your point like hype is cheap
the product is what matter this again
first first I'm a here one virgin yes
they say
okay I'm a hurt he referred her to keep
ripping Arjun I guess okay so I'll pose
this sorry is this a slap
you're going in threat I put it in the
wrong hole guys Wow
here we go all right okay perfect there
we go got it in this is for the right
ear there you go
righty-tighty lefty-loosey okay whoops
there we go no it's perfect okay so the
first thing you'll see is you have a
product in yours but you can hear me
completely normally like it's your
normal ear so is there any setting that
you set on this is R 0 so if you see
basically the home app has the volume
knob and so will actually perfect this
is zero and so what we worked really
hard on is what we're actually doing is
digitally reproducing the audio entering
your ears yours are completely blocked
and the fact that it sounds like your
normal ears was not easy to do this
sounds very this sounds very normal to
me so that's the whole point so your
baseline is even though you have a
product in yours you're just interacting
with the world now this is where it
starts getting weird I'm gonna Pat let's
get weird turn up the volume on your
world and all of a sudden everything is
going to be very loud I can hear you
letting deer really but then I can turn
down the volume on you okay he just
basically dead it's feels like right now
it's like air butter in my area there
are plugs right now that I I can't hear
anything and so what we've done is you
have this full volume knob but what we
started with of course with this product
is an excellent headphone because to get
people to really adopt this we want to
set the standard for wireless streaming
okay so that's that's the baseline you
got to get the table stakes right and
then you can build on top of it again
the iPhone hadn't made good phone calls
you wouldn't have used it for email app
store etc right so what type of music
are you into give me some hip-hop give
me some like that or give me a little
RiRi whatever you got to do it I'm gonna
give you some olds we're gonna give you
some dizzee rascal it's gonna be and
this will show you how good the basis so
the first thing I can do is I can mimic
a true wireless headphone so I'm gonna
actually turn down the volume of your
world noise cancelling and I'm gonna
turn up the music wait talk right now
hey how's it going it's good yeah this
is good and so what we can do is what we
did is we created a head carry right now
I know so actually when you're talking
like here's the first thing tap the side
alright
tap one tap yep oh wait what just
happened
when in a bypass mode you're not a
normal hearing okay so your first like
in your own world listening to music and
then with one so let's say let's say
you're sitting at your desk open oh
you're you're at a coffee shop in a lady
walks by that you want to talk to that's
I'm looking out for all you nerds out
there all right no but the point is
right now we're having a totally normal
conversation yes but you have a product
in your yes tap again just trying to
blow my mind here aren't you girl wasn't
talking to me I'm back to my music yeah
you got it forget you so you I don't
need this the basic premise here got my
Sinatra in my ear right now but actually
so to that point actually I'll show you
one more thing with the headphone we
call this layered listening so right
what I showed you before is the
headphone right now you're listening to
Duke Ellington at like thirty percent
right okay but you can still hear me
totally normally so now you have a
soundtrack to your life yeah so the
point of this is I'm controlling but you
when you have this have the mix for
yourself so maybe you want full fidelity
of the world with the score I listen to
the score of the gladiator all the time
because it just pumps me up but I do it
at 20 percent so no one knows I have the
score the gladiator on it 20 percent
that's just totally pumping me up Wow
okay so you're still listening yeah yeah
I will see you that are watching G are
you understanding kind of what we're
talking about this make sense I know you
can't hear it but I'm able to experience
the world around me while also listen to
my music and on the fly change that like
and I'll show easy now I'm gonna put the
commentary for the Giants in your ears
so we can be sitting here right now
totally interacting with me but hooked
into the game if that's what you need
right it's true me well I hope I'm
interacting with you more than I the
game I'm not I hope I'm not that boring
right or Siri Siri can just give you an
update but we're still totally talking
it doesn't remove you at all and that's
one of the power of the ear right unlike
the eyes where it's totally in the way
you can do this kind of subliminally
right I'm going to give you the weather
right now yep weather update but again
you're not removed for me and you can
choose to listen to that you can choose
what volume it's at you have full
control these layers these are these are
incredibly cool now a question that
obviously there's a lot of hype around
Apple's air pods what type of physical
controls can you play pause because
here's the thing my biggest criticism is
you can only set it to prompt you Siri
or pause and play so what level of
control
- yes sir 1/2 so right now we're we're
we have several stages of you I so as
you can see a lot of it is app enabled
right now and we added cap touch because
we don't want you to have to pull out
the phone yes right now you can tap
touch for bypass you can tap touch for
phone calls and you can double tap for
Siri okay right but we didn't want
people doing all this you can you know
some other exactly like volume drives
triple Morse code on your ears that
point is that's awkward
yeah so step one is there's cap touch
and there's the app next is voice we're
really interested in voice commands
right so this is an audio system you can
imagine world where a voice pops in your
head and says hey do you want to go into
our restaurant mode and that's what I'm
going to show you next kay and all you
do is either tap or say yes and the
system you never take your phone and
we've built this whole machine learning
backend that eventually will even become
proactive and curate the world for you
but we're jumping way ahead let me show
you some sits because it's a compute
here yeah exactly remember um so the
bottom line is to your point we the UI
is really important to us because it's
as much about the social interaction as
it is about the tech right you need to
have this flow so we're gonna bring you
deeper into the app and I know we're
going to go through all this but again
the big part of here that you're one
that makes it different is all this
curatorial stuff so what I'm going to
show you next is directional hearing
okay so we have directional mic snores
so the first thing I'm going to do is
just kind of turn your ears left and
right what I'm going to do is actually
Matt over there is going to talk and
just right now kind of Matt's are
talking so you can't can you hear what
he's saying I mean I can hear him a
little bit but can you make out what
he's saying especially I'm trying yes
but but not really right so if I'm gonna
turn on front directional mics okay so
now turn towards Matt just turn towards
him and he hasn't changed his voice
okay I turned to the dude and started
hearing him louder this is disturbingly
crazy yes this is a way he'll whisper to
you question from the audience
battery light great one don't you it
depends how you're using the product
right so the battery life for streaming
is about two and a half hours with two
and a half full charges in the case now
it's a really important point that you
were asking about air pods we'll get
into this yeah this is an episodic
product we are not just your normal
wireless headphone if you want to just
have a wireless headphone or wired ed
phone right
earpods you should go buy that this is a
product that's really meaningful for
specific uses right and you can use it
as a great wireless headphone don't get
me wrong but this is for the consumer
who's in the open office who needs that
tap so they can interact with people
one of the biggest cohorts that comes to
us is commuters right you might need to
hear while you're biking the world or
when you're on the subway you might want
to talk to your or if you're in our
airplane mode our airplane mode takes
out the jet engine but doesn't
adulterate human speech is crazy so you
can sit on an airplane with a colleague
have a totally normal conversation
without the jet engine or you can listen
to media and again with one tap the
flight attendant comes up hey I want a
ginger ale you tap again we're really
aiming for these cohorts that need that
real-world augmentation and uh you know
just to explain to people this is really
a technology that you have to experience
I just wanted to kind of illustrate the
best way that I could being your guinea
pig a quick thing literally available no
don't do that just put on crowd filter
so if ever can everyone start talking
actually in the audience just like
blabber make noise la blah blah blah
blah right yeah they're blah blah okay
yeah so we're talking now yeah yeah and
now all of a sudden they're gonna go
away are you
no keep talking so okay that's enough
reaped out that's a badass so what he
just experiences our crowd filter will
tune into the so imagine you're at a
restaurant right you can tune into the
conversation at the restaurant and take
out the dinner the world around you okay
we're gonna wrap this up a little quick
thing before we go I do want to do one
comparison because I think this is
important right I'm gonna let the crowd
here we play a little game called CES or
C II know and I you know from a fashion
standpoint you know I'm gonna turn this
way okay CES or C II know I'm gonna turn
my head what about design yes
again again that's what I thought that's
what I thought
all right thank you very much you're
worried jailable in February February
you're well oh how much here one is
$2.99 $2.99 it's available for pre-order
now it'll start shipping in fact I'm
telling my blowing tech this is amazing
guys thank you so much Noah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
