com and welcome to road warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up it's very much
about cars today we have a garmin gps
device a caddy and a Porsche but first
let's look at the casio exilim exz 70
unlike cars it's small and cheap but
like some cars it's fast like other
current casio cameras it has the quick
shot feature which means that once you
press the shutter all the way down it
takes the photo without achieving a
focus lock now you can turn that feature
off but you should know that this
feature is by default enabled so if you
just power the camera on and start
shooting click click click when you get
home a lot of the shots are going to be
blurry and out of focus we'll set
another thing to watch out for is the
power button which can get switched on
easily in your pocket and now the cars
the cadillac SRX SUV is full of tech but
not always fasttech brian cooley shows
you what i mean hit the button for the
sunroof and get a cup of coffee it's
going to be a while before that enormous
expanse of what they call the ultra view
glass sunroof opens up because it goes
all the way almost to the passengers
heads in the back seats there's also an
adjustable sunshade that goes back and
forth at different levels so you can
adjust how much open how much glass and
how much shade you've got going ok ok it
does play DVDs and even DVD audio and
there are auxiliary jacks in the front
and back seats next up the 2007 Porsche
Boxster S it can't play mp3s without an
upgrade has no video playback no iPod
input or even an auxiliary jack anywhere
so what does it have besides the
flat-six engine it's an open car they
offer noise cancellation that's
interesting it's part of a Bose audio
upgrade above and beyond the upgraded
audio system that will give you the
audio pilot and center pilot
technologies audio pilot is the one that
provides noise cancellations with
samples road noise and then sends a flip
signal through the speakers to cancel
out a lot of the harshness you can also
get parking assist and electronically
controlled shocks if you have 60 grand
or more to throw around no matter what
car you have or even if you don't have a
car you
take good advantage of the garmin nuvi
660 as you can see the design is really
simple which is good there's just a
power button on top and an SD card slot
on the side if you want to listen to
music or view pictures on the device it
also comes with a travel kit you can
have audible books and I said like mp3s
and picture viewer also has a language
guide so if you're traveling overseas
you can get translations or a bunch of
different languages that's a nice big 4
inch screen you're looking at there and
all the maps are pre-loaded however it's
going to set you back about a grand
that's it for this edition of road
warrior I'm Tom Merritt check back next
time for more gadgets that keep you
armed and dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
