and we recently found out that apple has
officially announced that the home pot
is coming out on February the 9th so
what this really is is everything that
you need to know things that we've
learned before the actual pre-order and
that's gonna take place on January the
26th it'll be available in the US the UK
and Australia and they haven't
officially given the time but we can
presume that it'll start at 12 midnight
East Coast time that would be nine
o'clock p.m. West Coast time the price
obviously three hundred and forty nine
dollars but if you're talking about
other countries in UK it's going to be
319 pounds and then Australia that's
gonna be $4.99 for them France and
Germany it'll be available later this
spring but countries like Canada and
others Apple has not given an official
timeframe of when it'll be available for
them now we also got to see in their
press release we learn some new details
that we haven't heard before about the
home pot specifically now the first
thing to know about it will not support
multi-users this is something that is
common on the Amazon echo or the Google
home they made no mention if we'll ever
see it and the other thing multi-room
support this is really important because
Apple talks about how you can buy two of
them and use them as stereo speakers
that's coming out in a software update
later this year again they didn't even
narrow down the timeframe and even if
you wanted to buy multiple home pods put
one in one room and one in the other and
play different songs from them that is
coming again sometime later this year
with a software update another thing we
learned here Apple care for the home pod
it'll cost $39 now that gives you two
years of warranty instead of its
original one that also includes
telephone support but let's say you're
super clumsy and you knock into the home
pod and it not and it falls over and
breaks if you bring it into a store
you'll need to pay an additional thirty
nine dollars to get it repaired that's
called like incidental or accidental
damage you can do that twice so you buy
$39 for Apple care and then you have two
incidences that you will pay an
additional 39 to cover we've seen
similar plans right with Apple TV or the
iPhone you do have to pay in order to
get it serviced but it won't cost like
the entire price of the actual home pod
so let's just break down what it can do
right now first of all it can
messages you can set reminders and it
also listens to podcasts you'll also get
Siri news which is kind of like the
latest update also Siri integration this
is gonna happen via its six microphone
array and also home kit compatibility we
know it's going to be able to work with
the Apple music subscription but they
have not said anything about third-party
services it's powered by the a8
processor this is the same processor in
the iPhone 6 it has this spatial
awareness this is the feature that they
really want to tout and finally it will
come in two colors white and Space Gray
this is important because I know you
like to match your decor so we're gonna
talk about it now the other big question
is will the home pod get better over
time absolutely it will it just needs
some software updates really to get it
up to speed with what else is out there
but remember Apple has always positioned
this as a smart speaker that has
superior sound compared to the
competition I think out of the box it
most likely is going to versus the
Google home and the Amazon echo now how
it stacks up against the Google home max
which is at 399 that remains to be seen
but Apple has positioned this as a
speaker with premium sound that is one
advantage that it has out of the gates
but then let's talk about like the other
competition that's really only the main
differentiating feature that makes it
better than anything else that's out
there we know come on Siri still
inferior to the Amazon echo and still
inferior to the Google assistant we also
know that it falls behind when it comes
to smart home device compatibility and
thirdly it has no app or third-party
skill support this is a big deal in the
Amazon echo world trust me if you've
experienced that you're definitely gonna
use something like that so when you
really stack up all like the main things
that make these speakers important Apple
is coming late to the party they're
behind it but I think this is really the
first time like out of the gates that
we've really truly seen that Apple is
not only coming late to the party but
they're not really bringing anything
special by being a late comer and we're
just gonna have to wait over time to see
how they have all this product now let's
be real will it sell of course it's
going to sell we know why are you
watching this video if you're not gonna
buy this thing but also
I don't expect Apple to release its
actual sales numbers they haven't done
it again with the Apple watch which the
Apple TV it's it's not gonna sell large
enough numbers where they can feel
comfortable enough bragging about it
after this holiday season when everyone
went out in droves we're talking about
the tens of millions to buy Amazon echo
pieces or Google home pieces so it'll
sell but there's no way out of the gates
it's going to go bonkers especially at
its 349 price point of course I'm gonna
buy this because I've got to review it
fairly we're gonna see how it stacks up
to the competition but there you have it
just kind of another Apple byte Apple
bits and we'll see what happens</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
