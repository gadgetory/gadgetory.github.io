company manages to make better streaming
gadgets than Apple Amazon and Google
serving up the best experience around
whether you're watching Netflix Amazon
Hulu HBO Go or anything else so if
you've decided to buy a Roku the next
step is figuring out which one currently
there are four devices at four different
prices here's how they compare the
cheapest at less than 50 bucks is the
new Roku streaming stick it's the size
of a USB stick and hides behind your TV
completely out of sight it's remote
communicates via Wi-Fi so you don't need
to aim it and the Roku app lets you
connect a pair of headphones to your
phone for private listening which
automatically mutes the TV audio it
offers Roku's full interface and apps
and is just as fast as any of the more
expensive Roku's then there's the Roku 2
last year it was my favorite streamer
but not the new stick is available it
seems like a forgotten stepchild the
main reason to pay the extra money for
this box over the stick is if you really
want it's wired Ethernet connection the
more expensive Roku 3 as a swanky remote
control with a headphone jack right on
the side for private listening without
having to use the Roku's app and you can
also perform voice search with the
remote another feature that cheaper
rogue who's relegate to the app finally
for all you 4k TV owners there's the
high end Roku 4
it offers 4k streams from apps like
Netflix Amazon Vudu and YouTube and
makes for case show's easier to find
than any other device including your
Smart TV unlike your Smart TV however it
doesn't have access for the best quality
videos encoded in high dynamic range
known as HDR so which Roku do we like
best the cheapest at less than 50 bucks
the Roku streaming stick is all the
streamer most people need
