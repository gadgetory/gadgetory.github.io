com and I'm here with the RH a sa 950 I
headphones these are an on-air model and
they're from a small Scottish company
that makes pretty good headphones for an
affordable price a few things I liked
about this model they are lightweight
and they also are pretty comfortable for
on-air model I'm not a huge fan of on
ear headphones but these are pretty
comfortable they also sound pretty good
for the money they offer a nice well
balanced sound pretty detailed decent
bass not a huge bass but well balanced
and they offer sort of an audio file
profile in that they don't accentuate
the treble or bass too much a couple of
other small features worth noting this
does have a detachable cord that cord is
cloth covered and there is an inline
remote with a microphone that is Apple
friendly for Apple friendly devices so
this does make cell phone calls as well
I had a couple small quibbles with the
design one is that these don't fold up
for more compact storage also the shiny
or glossy finish on the earcups may get
scratched up over time the one good
thing i will say about this they do come
with a three-year warranty so if
anything goes wrong with them and during
those three years presumably rha will
send you another pair i'm david carr noi
and those are the rha SI 950 I
headphones thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
