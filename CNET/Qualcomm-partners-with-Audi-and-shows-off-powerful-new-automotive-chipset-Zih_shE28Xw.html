partnership howdy is already prepared
for the next generation upgrade and
let's have a look on it the system being
demonstrated here supports four displays
with a 4k Ultra HD infotainment
touchscreen and HD hybrid instrument
cluster that showcases rich 3d graphics
capabilities as well as two HD screens
up here that represent the rear seat
entertainment displays let's take a look
at the quality of the graphics the
display and the real-time rendering in a
navigation use case and now we have a
driver out in downtown San Diego and
Jeff will show you how seamlessly the
audrina 530 GPU renders the graphics
working alongside the x12 LTE modem for
real-time map and traffic updates the
infotainment display provides richer
quality of information that can be
manipulated using multi-touch at
different screen angles will now focus a
little bit on the advanced driver
assistance support use cases you'll
notice that on the infotainment system
the 828 tracts lane-keeping and lane
departure events which are
simultaneously highlighted in color
sharing as well as alarm events on the
instrument cluster the 820 is programmed
to detect multiple lane marking types
traffic signs are also recognized using
deep learning thereby enhancing the
real-time navigation updates with speed
limit warnings through the cameras that
are mounted near the steering wheel and
facing the driver the zeroth machine
intelligence platform can detect the
head orientation of the driver as well
as other facial features such as eyes
mouth etc if Jeff is the driver and he
looks sideways for more than a moment
you will see how the system labels him
as distracted let's transition over to
some entertainment features for
passengers are air seat screens are
running to HD displays so let's take a
look at the rear seat display and you
will notice that one of them is showing
a navigation display which can be
independently controlled but can also
replicate when the driver is seen what's
cool about this system is that we are
managing multiple concurrent
capabilities from navigation to a dash
the complex instrument cluster graphics
which all run their own
independent audio streams and complex
camera machine learning interactions
with entertainment functions to their
seat all while being connected to LTE or
the cloud in conclusion the 820 a is a
connected smart and aware automotive
processor platform this is what is
possible by bringing together all the Qi
connectivity compute and machine
intelligence technologies with the
Snapdragon 820 a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
