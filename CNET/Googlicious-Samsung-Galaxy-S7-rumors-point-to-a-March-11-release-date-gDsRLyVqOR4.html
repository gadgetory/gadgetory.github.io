Google Isha's for everything google we
can pack inside of a show we all know
virtual reality will finally get its
real mainstream consumer push this year
we saw it everywhere at CES and the
experiences are amazing those are not my
pants or legs do you uh do the objects
appear closer in real life oh wait it's
over see amazing now Google looks to be
working on its own hardware after
multiple job listings including one for
a hardware engineer lead specifically
mentioning virtual reality in the main
description for consumer devices google
has made recent hires from people in the
VR space to add to their team and
YouTube started supporting VR video
content back in November they've really
helped push VR forward with its google
cardboard but now it looks like they're
going to build a more serious platform
all right Google glass is a platform
that's still alive for business even
though it's pretty much dead for the
consumer market glass has officially
shut down all of its social media
accounts including Twitter Instagram
Google+ and more now the google glass
enterprise edition is still being worked
on under the project or a division an
earlier reports say they are even
working on to screen lists headsets that
rely on audio only the FCC released
images of the Enterprise Edition to the
public but google has yet to officially
announce its existence all right it's
still january and news about smartphones
really comes together in late februari
after Mobile World Congress to the early
March timeframe but a tweet by the
reliable Eveleigh reports that friday
marks the 11th will be the release date
for the samsung galaxy s7 schematics and
case leaks indicate that the s7 won't be
too much different from the previous
generation but we're sure to hear more
at mwc now leaked pictures of a covered
up LG g5 from droid life show off a peak
of the metallic edge on the front and
two camera sensors on the back and a
spot for a fingerprint sensor below that
the phone is rumored to still include a
removable battery and a microSD card
slot mobile fun even has showcase their
armadillo
protective case that shows these
features a little more clearly and a
volume rocker located on the side now
instead of the back and if you thought
Amazon was a one and done with
smartphones a report from the
information says you thought wrong they
won't be getting back into the hardware
business but the report says they are
pushing for software partnerships with
OEMs Amazon is looking beyond just
loading their phones with the amazon and
kindle app for purchasing goods instead
they're looking to integrate something
like taking their product identifier app
that takes a picture of something and
points people to the amazon store but
this time put it directly into a
manufacturers main camera app making
life easier for all of us and JetBlue's
fleet of a320 planes will be getting an
infotainment overhaul with new
android-based touch screens in the
seatbacks this is good news the upgrade
will increase the screen size from five
point six inches to 10.1 inches and will
include over 100 channels of programming
compared to the current 36 but don't
hold your breath the rollout starts next
year and all aircraft will be equipped
by 2019 and if you're one of the 100
million active Spotify users Spotify is
expected to release video content on its
Android app this week according to The
Wall Street Journal iOS will be ready at
the end of the week Spotify is video
content partners include BBC comedy
central MTV ESPN and more they say the
videos won't launch with advertising and
the goal here is to build their audience
and introduce video viewing to users
that use Spotify solely for music until
now alright that's going to do it for
this week you can email us at google
issues at cnet com or tweet me at brian
Tong thanks for watching we'll see you
guys next time for some more of that
