consumer DSLR space even using flashing
lights tons of colors to lure first-time
and family buyers away from more staid
Nikon's and cannons with the chaos - the
company goes for a slightly more
conventional design combined with the
weather sealed body large viewfinder and
solid photo quality that have long been
the hallmarks of pen taxes entry-level
cameras the result is a really nice
alternative with unfortunately middling
video quality I'm Laurie grinning for
CNET and this is the Pentax KS to the
camera feels sturdily built and
comfortable to hold and use without the
usual plasticky feel of low-priced DSLRs
and the color accents are relatively
subtle it also uses lights a little more
judiciously than its sibling the KS one
with indicators for movie versus still
mode when automatic self portrait mode
is turned on and briefly at power on my
only issue with the design is the flat
navigation buttons which are easy to
miss hit the new kit lens is
disappointing though it uses the same
collapsible design that companies like
Olympus have already used and discarded
with a button you press to expand the
lens and a tough turn to fully collapse
it the size advantage you gain isn't
really worth what you lose over a
standard 18 to 55 millimeter lens the
photo quality and performance are quite
good for the price it renders relatively
neutral white balance and colors though
you have plenty of options for making
them less neutral if you want for
instance Pentax offers something called
color temperature enhancement mode that
pushes the white balance to emphasize
dominant colors in the lighting JPEGs
are reasonably good through ISO 1600 and
usable through ISO 6400 it's also fast
enough for most kids pets and travel
photography with solid auto focus
performance and a sustained burst rate
of about 4.5 frames per second the video
is pretty disappointing though with
Shake Reduction on the movies have a bad
case of the wobbles if you turn off the
shake reduction the wobbles go away but
then it gets the shakes those issues
aside
the video also suffers from serious
moir√© plus it lacks continuous
autofocus in movie mode otherwise it has
tons of useful features including two of
pen taxes own semi automatic exposure
modes sensitivity priority and the
mouthful shutter an aperture priority
auto exposure mode it also has built-in
Wi-Fi with a nice remote shooting app
Astro tracer which works in conjunction
with an optional GPS to shoot long
exposures without star trails there's
also a typical interval movie record
which produces in camera time lapses and
horizon correction which straightens out
slightly tilted photos automatically as
a camera for the family photographer or
step up from a point-and-shoot the
Pentax chaos 2 is a solid option
provided that the video issues really
aren't a deal killer for you I'm Lori
grunion and this is the Pentax KST</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
