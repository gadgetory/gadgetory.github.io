dreamed of keeping your iPad above your
desk or maybe you've want to turn your
ipad into a computer maybe you want to
be some sort of stock day trader and
keep another monitor next to all of your
other computers well the vs. stand could
be that for you this is not really that
event of an idea but it's really turning
your ipad into a monitor why haven't
more companies done this maybe I've just
not been looking in the right place this
is seventy nine dollars which is really
not that bad for a kind of ikea
furniture piece for your ipad the vs
stan has a simple aluminum bendy frame
that kind of feels like one of those
adjustable desk lamps and yes it can
rotate a full 360 degrees for portrait
or landscape mode even better this
actually detaches from the stand and yes
it's it's own case it's a hardback a
plastic case with a big aluminum ring on
the back this is smart cover compatible
so you could use this and just go on the
road this is a little bit bulky on the
side here but it's really nice that you
can then pop that in and out when you
get to work and this stand is remarkably
lightweight and folds really flat this
whole package could easily slide into a
messenger bag or backpack you could take
it with you wherever you go it does not
have any docs on the back you know the
dream of maybe you could connect an SD
card or USB port but who are we kidding
the elevation while it's not that great
is a much better solution if you use it
like an extra monitor check out the vs.
stand I'm a big fan of it I'm Scott
Steinman that's a quick look at the vs
stand for the iPad
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
