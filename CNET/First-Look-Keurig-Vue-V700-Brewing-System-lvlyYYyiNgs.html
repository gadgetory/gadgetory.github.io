today about the Keurig Vue v700 single
serve coffee maker this is a coffee
maker with a bit of a twist everything
that Keurig is done up into this point
has been a k-cup coffee maker and one
that bruised a cup like this and this
was Keurigs proprietary design that they
licensed out to other manufacturers but
still kept the Keurig name associated
with the problem is is that the patent
on the cake cup expired in 2012
so what Keurig did was they came out
with this and this is called a Vue pack
and the Vue pack is a little different
than the k-cup the Vue pack is shorter
it's a little fatter and unlike the K
cup which gets punctured from the top
and the bottom with water going straight
through the Vue pack only gets punctured
in the top and what happens is the water
goes in it steeps with the coffee and
then it pours out through this little
teapot like spout into your drink and
supposedly this spout makes for a little
bit better brew a little stronger but
one thing I like best about the Vue pack
is that it's recyclable k cups aren't
you just peel the top off of a Vue pack
and the plastic that's left behind is
number 5 which is recyclable in most
areas also another perk is that the Vue
packs come in multiple sizes you have
this one and also a large sized one and
that will give you a really good tasting
talk of a coffee for like a travel mug
so how about the view itself
well the v700 is a pretty bulky coffee
maker as you can see it's a little bit
bloated and designed and that's partly
because it's got this nice 74 ounce
reservoir here that comes out for easy
fill ups but one of my problems is is
that you've got this kind of symmetrical
design and they replicated the bulkiness
of the reservoir on the side that
doesn't have a reservoir so it feels
like a lot of wasted space over here
that said there are some features of the
Vue v700 that we like a lot and this
little drink tray is one of them it's
really easy you just pull it up and
twist it and you get a slightly higher
platform for your drink to sit on and
then up here the sort of showcase
feature of the view is the touch screen
it's a full LCD color
touchscreen and it's really easy to use
it's very responsive it's very fast and
it's very well designed if you want to
simplify your drink it gives you a lot
of options and it makes it very easy to
use those options to get the exact
beverage you want so is the viewer
recommended by well it depends if you
want to make really good coffee from a
pod we say yes the Vue v700 retails
online for about $200 and that's a
pretty comparable price point for other
models that do a similar job we also
enjoyed the Cuisinart SS 700 and really
like the Bunn my cafe MCU so if you're
thinking about the Keurig take a look at
those as well this is the Keurig Vue
v700 for Cena I'm Rui Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
