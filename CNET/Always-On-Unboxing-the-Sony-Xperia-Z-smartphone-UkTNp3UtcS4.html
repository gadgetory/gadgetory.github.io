inside this box probably the strongest
competitor I would say to some of these
like really hero smart phones like the
Samsung Galaxy s4 this name may surprise
you sony sony xperia the Xperia Z right
here let's get it out so this is no
question a high-end smartphone one of
the other things about it is that
supposedly it's waterproof we get the
International unlocked models so we get
an extra little charger there may be
slight differences not usually but just
like that's a good-looking box yeah
Xperia Z not to be confused with a Sony
Xperia tablet Z that did confuse me that
one's coming later and now it's over
Chevy that's a nice touch I like in
front things know so that you could
totally like protect it yeah wow that is
very thin and light in fact also in the
Box we have oh that's not norms that's
the I assume that's not I mean this is
our international charger thing that is
nice and you know what that weight is
with the battery yeah that reason it's
light for something so big yeah alright
so then inside the box we got our little
charger which is it's a cool power
button mini USB oh I love that okay can
I just say that my current complaint
about all consumer electronics is that
the power button is virtually invisible
and flush with the plastic and I do not
understand that because why would you
want to make the device harder to turn
on I want to turn it on and therefore
use it I really feel like we've come to
something here do you need to get that
out clearly yeah way more than I thought
there's a bully rant for you alright so
some headphones yes please turn on and a
bunch of different you buds doesn't need
to be charged maybe we hope vibrated
that's a nice
big display
now here it has a fast process or maybe
it could get through startup faster we
go awesome alright we're gonna play with
it for a little bit and get it all set
up while we do that let's run down the
specs the Sony Xperia Z has a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon processor
and 2 gigs of RAM so it's snappy it has
a 5-inch display with a resolution of
1920 by 1080 Sony's calling it a reality
display not retina reality the pixel
density though is 443 pixels per inch
compared to the iPhone 5 326 the phone
is thin at 7.9 millimeters and also
extremely light weighing only 146 grams
it comes with Android 4.1 jelly bean but
sony says it'll be upgraded to 4.2 very
soon it features a 13.1 megapixel camera
which is very nice 16 gigs of built-in
storage but it's expandable using micro
sd it supports 4G connectivity and it's
got NFC as well sony claims the phone is
water resistant with submersion up to 30
minutes it's available now in the UK for
450 euros I gotta say I think Sony has
kind of a winner with this phone I'm
surprised it's really nice-looking the
camera is awesome
cameras awesome which is a huge selling
point I don't know why more
manufacturers aren't going after the
iPhone on camera alone yeah and we both
love that power button I love the raised
power button my only complaint right out
of the gate is that it is loaded with
Sony crap where my favorite I assume you
can delete it and it's still jellybean
so it's gonna be plenty customizable but
I really do think that this is a strong
competitor to be a great seller it's
really surprising yeah good job Sony who
do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
