inside this box probably the strongest
competitor I would say to some of these
like really hero smartphones like the
Samsung Galaxy s4 this name may surprise
you sony Sony Xperia the Xperia Z right
here let's get it out hmm so this is no
question a high-end smartphone one of
the other things about it is that
supposedly it's waterproof we get the
international unlocked model so we get
an extra little charger there may be
slight differences not usually but just
so you that's a good-looking box yeah
xperia z not to be confused with the
Sony Xperia tablet Z that did confuse me
that one's coming later alright knows
the chamois and now it's a chamois
that's a nice touch I like it up in
front things no so that you could
totally like protect it yeah well how
nerdy that is very thin and light in
fact also in the box we have oh that's
not normal that's the I assume that's
not I mean this is our international
charger thing that is nice and you know
what that weight is with the battery
yeah batteries in its light for
something so big yeah all right so then
inside the box we got our little charger
which is it's a cool power button mini
USB oh I love that okay can I just say
that my current complaint about all
consumer electronics is that the power
button is virtually invisible and flush
with the plastic and I do not understand
that because why would you want to make
the device harder to turn on I want to
turn it on and therefore use it oh I
really feel like I've come to something
here you needed to get that out clearly
bothered you way more than I thought
there's a Molly rent for you all right
shush room headphones yes please turn on
and a bunch of different year buds
doesn't need to be charged maybe we hope
it vibrated that's a nice big display
I hear it has a fast processor maybe it
could get through start up faster good
will do awesome all right we're gonna
play with it for a little bit and get it
all set up while we do that let's run
down the specs the Sony Xperia Z has a
1.5 gigahertz quad-core Snapdragon
processor and 2 gigs of RAM so it's
snappy it has a 5-inch display with a
resolution of 1920 x 1080 Sony's calling
it a reality display not retina reality
the pixel density though is 443 pixels
per inch compared to the iphone 5 326
the phone is thin at seven point nine
millimeters and also extremely light
weighing only 140 6 grams it comes with
Android 4.1 jelly bean but sony says
it'll be upgraded to 4.2 very soon it
features a 13.1 megapixel camera which
is very nice 16 gigs of built-in storage
but it's expandable using microSD it
supports 4G connectivity and it's got
NFC as well sony claims the phone is
water-resistant with submersion up to 30
minutes it's available now in the UK for
four hundred and fifty euros i gotta say
i think sony has kind of a winner with
this phone I'm surprised it's really
nice looking the cameras awesome cameras
awesome which is a huge selling point I
don't know why more manufacturers aren't
going after the iphone on camera alone
yeah and we both love that power button
I love the Rays power button my only
complaint right out of the gate is that
it is loaded with Sony crap where my
favorite I assume you can delete it and
it's still jelly bean so it's gonna be
plenty customizable but I really do
think that this is a strong competitor
to be a great seller it's really
surprising yeah good job Sony who do
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
