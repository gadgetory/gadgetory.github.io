off comic-con and San Diego is coming up
this is a pop culture event kicks off
july twenty first and it's not just
about the cosplay and toys for me it's
about the toys but this year we've got
plenty of movies getting the spotlight
attention at the convention this summer
alone we've got Suicide Squad we've got
Star Trek beyond who knows what beyond
it that's where we're going what movies
are you guys looking forward to and
letting you're not allowed to say X
Files because your next boss had me know
you're excited about that franchise you
are now here now not all have to talk
about that so yeah what would maybe the
movies you guys looking forward to in
the in the geekdom universe I'm super
excited about suicide squad but that's
just because I'm obsessed with Margot
Robbie who is
gorgeous and she's what is the name of
the character Harley Quinn yes well
that's that's kind of important i forgot
that bird that's important yeah i'm not
into the i could be into the geek side
of it you're just like her I just like I
just gotta margot robbie thing yeah all
right I'm into that she's great she is
yeah I don't what has she done uh she
was in wolf of Wall Street oh she was a
very sexy okay why it's you really like
Margaret I respect the hell out of that
all right so what about what about
suicide squad are you are you into the
whole sort of back story about what that
group of villains are like what that is
yeah they're all like villains who are
now coming to help save the day is that
the premise I really just know that
Margot Robbie is in it okay fair enough
you got a one track mind apparently so I
so liner woody what are you what are
your thoughts on that movie um I I like
the idea that it's another comic
book-based movie sure and I'm Pro comic
book movies so you know the more the
merrier right so I wish you success yeah
but there's a but here I can hear it
comin screamin coming in high just like
um I don't know yet I'm not quite on
board yet I don't know what it is I know
what it is what is it you're just not
convinced yet good that's probably what
it is not convinced of what how good
it's gonna actually be so got a hype
around it and I understand why yeah so I
support that sure but at the same time
I'm like is that story gonna be really
as good as their promise I don't know
looks good though it was I got
obliterated good I like the fact that
will smith is like getting his hands
dirty with a comic book movie I think
that's really cool the whole Jared
little Joker thing yeah I'm not end of
and don't get me wrong that's Jordan
Catalano okay like I go way back with
jared leto okay you know it's a fan do
you know no my so-called life no no oh
right you're not take 25 right 22 oh
yeah you have to get that any good one
in the building feel old hey
to do uh so he I don't know I feel like
the all the hype surrounding that movie
was a little muddied when they debuted
him as the Jill right not that he's an
incapable at inferior actor he's a
brilliant I something didn't jive right
right what was it just a little all
right just can't put my finger on it I
think people were maybe a little
unimpressed with the depiction of the
joke that they were trying to go for
with that I mean people who've played
the Joker it's a pretty high-profile
pedigree I memory talking jack nicholson
heath ledger oh he's ledger so choker oh
right it's crazy like Margot Robbie
exactly okay that's oh I mean come on
let's be honest it kind of just did it
for you yeah me I mean we're both for
both he did it for both of us I know um
yeah I don't know what it is I feel like
things kind of got started off a little
weird with that um I don't know I mean
there's capable people making this movie
it's not like this is a de left field so
I'm cautiously optimistic have a good
way I'm ready to put it let's leave it
at that all right then we have the new
star trek film I really dug the first
one that JJ Abrams did yeah same people
kind of didn't like a second middle one
what was that called it's like more
stars in trucking basically that's what
of what was happening yeah I don't
remember do we know this is the queen of
the memory what the hell that movie was
called Brian um you know he's like I can
order into the darkness thank you thank
you they went to the darkness yeah um I
did I you know I guess I'm cuz I'm a fan
of um what's his name God here I go
again Zach Quinto no no I'm the one who
played out the main guy the main bad guy
the main bad guy Oh Eric Bana Eric Bana
oh those the first gonna be playing
doctor Oh cumberpatch yikes Benedict
cumberpatch yeah carbon-rich that went
out a comer bitch but uh oh I did say
that that's what they're called the
groupies are comfort yeah oh my god
that's not a close i'm not that one but
i do like his works okay yeah i thought
it i thought i did a great job sure i
enjoyed it Oh
I feel like this one the the hype is
kind of lukewarm agreed however on the
social side yes Zulu is supposed to be
gay oh and this one lots of time I was I
mean kids pretty people are pretty
excited about it except for the guy who
used to play him how's it Sulu right do
it do it yeah okay the guy you used to
play him is not happy about it well cry
me a river right what are we gonna do
get what times all right yeah roll up
how about you grow up all right so
that's cool there's new Marvel stuff
coming out that was arranged every
golden Doctor Strange what do we think
about dr. strange I'm all on board I
know there's some some conflicts in
regards to some of the characters we do
i explain to me because I I Know Who
Doctor Strange is yeah that's about it
so what's what are the conference people
are talking about oh there's I want to
bring it up but no this is a safe place
well they says some some people are
saying is being whitewashed oh I'm just
like really I like the whole thing like
yeah they're changing it up sometimes
I'm against it but this one it looks
like it'll work okay um when the other
bad eases may not be as bad as people
are gonna think here so that's another
thing people kind of like I don't know I
think it's gonna work out Sam any
thoughts on Mr strange I know less than
you do but it sounds thrilling okay that
was a very genuine opinion I'm sorry I'm
sorry um it's also a very exciting
because it's more deals with more
supernatural side right sure comics
which they kind of tried to do in floor
but they were timid eight okay I think
I'm tell you really know your stuff oh
yeah if he's set up around this ya know
but I really when I slore Doctor Strange
to the comic book movie I was like wow
this is really good stuff so I'm really
glad that I charted put it on the big
screen I think people will enjoy it okay
there you have it and then finally uh I
love the first one of this franchise
it's a relatively new comic book series
guardians of the galaxy to who if you're
a fan of my podcast for four sho i'm
actually interview
James Gunn the director of sardines of
you has echo we did that like years ago
way before there was a guardian or a
galaxy way before I galaxy way before
there was any of that it was important
you never seen in spider-man well no it
was red he was actually directed or
wrote a video game at the time so we had
I'm in there oh pretty cool you can go
back into the archives and check that
out but the sequel to guardians of the
galaxy did you see the first one I did
would you think I loved it yeah and I'm
very excited for the second because I
mean I'm into every type of this kind of
like action or superheroes and this was
sort of a funny satire love that and I
was into that for me like almost
scratched that the itch of like a
hitchhiker's guide yeah yeah that kind
of thing I think I just really dig those
like goofy sort of space opera things
yeah and this really you know did it for
me Lyta what you think same yeah thank
you feeling it okay before we take
questions let's talk real quick Star
Wars world one like lot of information
coming out about that oh there's like a
new there's a new droid there's yeah
jhansi I like don't want to know this
stuff I just want to sue them exactly
beep aren't really happy until they show
you every last thing and is moving like
a bug a giant buzz gotta go he's got a
weird you seen it right yeah he's got a
hot head seems like k2s 05 yay 6 11 12
yeah geez 11 12 oh my god I'm like
really what so there's all this stuff
that's coming out about Star Wars some
of it is a little spoilery we're not
gonna get into it new artwork they did
they have a whole behind it seems a
video it did I saw it it's amazing you
want to get psyched about that movie
watch that can you give us like a quick
crash course like without spoiling sure
well basically they just take you into a
lot of the like tracking shots they'll
show the director and the camera guy
like actually moving with all the
characters and they show the big
explosions now a lot of it was shot
outside without a green screen and it's
really exciting alright and the music
that goes along with the video really
gets you yeah right it's tough look I'm
not gonna lie I thought
what was it the latest Star Wars was I
thought was okay for a carbon copy of a
movie yeah okay yeah kind of into the
rogue one stuffing yeah I like it I'm
hearing we have some questions from the
control room what do you got for us in
there hey everybody so we have a few
questions from our live chat Jason a
couple comments as well jason says that
he can't wait for the gardens of
galaxies to see well if I pronounced
that right wants to know your thoughts
about if you heard the news about a
young lady taking over the Iron Man role
but i'll be in the comics and raymond
wanted to ask if you guys think the
enterprise will race other starships and
Star Trek and a quick shout-out to Dean
and YouTube hi we're live hey we're very
live this is all happening right now at
this very you are freaking out man um so
will the enterprise race other is that a
Star Trek don't know I don't know I've
never heard of that that would be weird
that would be like Phantom Menace kind
of cream and kind of cool though I mean
you know get them all together like race
you'd be like okay I see Bruce you're
like a future with yeah where are they
raced to write like Saturn I don't get
it that'd be good yeah are you meeting
that I raised to say that works with the
Saturn where he goes and even then what
do they win I don't know like space cash
hey fans hey oh you David alien right
guess so oh that's an interesting topic
the Iron Man as a female character I
heard a little bit about that hurt
nothing isn't she a young black woman
and she's like a badass right what is
she doing cool things oh it's
comfortable all over seen it so that's
how I heard oh I just heard my ear she's
15 years old yeah she's a 15 year old
like brilliant warrior type of it I can
Antoinette stark sort of situation here
yeah here's the cool thing right well
here's what I want to know and again I'm
a full transparency I don't know enough
about this whole story but so is she
like because if it's if everyone knows
like everyone knows Tony Stark's Iron
Man right so this girl is I like moon
call iron woman right yeah we're sure
they're all ending part is 15 iron team
iron teen that's what you just like are
we not crafting our own my iron universe
way you're right it does sound like a
vitamin right right have you taken your
iron teen today exactly per year it's
really great what was the other
questions when it wasn't it was there
another one the other overrun or the
other question was do you guys think the
enterprise would race other spaceships
in Star Trek right right did we talk
about it what yeah we talked about that
it wouldn't it wouldn't round I wouldn't
race they wouldn't raise and iron teen
is our newest friend who would win in a
race iron teen or the enterprise oh now
that what the enterprise is thousands of
times hotter girls like the speed of
light what if iron teen is actually
several miles tall ah Shh oh boy you're
mine my own while our minds are being
blown over that comment Mike you have
another question for us yeah one more
question from Raymond he was wondering
do you guys have you guys follow the
Fast and the Furious films and they're
getting sequels what are your thoughts
on that franchise okay real quick they
shot a huge scene like two blocks away
what I did excellent sure yeah I did
that's very exciting so many freaking
cars it was I don't know don't fashion
furiously yeah I mean by it's eight now
like where are they like what brace on
the moon already exactly i know it you
have to change the plane literally like
we have to just go to the moon yes go on
yeah go to the moon and then I'll watch
it go to the moon and race the
enterprise and iron chain and a hot teen
be Vin Diesel in like a charger or like
a mustang cobra like a show be all right
yeah whom that like nitrous iron team
that'd be cool with her like nuclear
accelerator
Enterprise I can go the freaking speed
of light or wherever passive and go yeah
I think it's faster faster that I'm sure
who's gonna win you tell us he's always
running on diesel all rights on a roll

Amazon Prime day if you actually got

third topic and robot World Cups what
sports you would like to see robots take
on after the Robo world cup so we are
going to go on one other break and we
will be right back
you
we're finally underway with pokemon
tournament ok ok ball sleep yeah it's a
hit
you
what happens when you upload a baby
picture to Facebook anyway well it goes
from your computer through a bunch of
wires out of your city and travels at
nearly the speed of light until it gets
here this is Facebook's first data
center located in Prineville Oregon to
call it massive is an understatement
it's got buildings big enough to fit
four football fields in and all of it so
that you can view that throwback
Thursday photo whenever you want so
Facebook has six data centers around the
world all but two of which are in the
United States this one was the first and
it's quite a sight many of the
technologies inside were invented by
Facebook one example is air cooling
oregon's nice and cool and Facebook
realized that it can take air from the
outside mix it with water and computer
exhaust and find a way to cool its
computers without needing to use energy
sucking air conditioners why cold air
well computers can't run too hot or they
just don't work right they also can't
run too cool or they have the same
problem behind all those blinking lights
that's Facebook so is this and this and
this how much of Facebook is stored here
well all of it if Facebook's other five
data centers were suddenly to stop
working you could still rewatch your old
ice bucket challenge video and Facebook
hopes you won't even be able to tell
anything was wrong by the way there are
exactly 10 people on staff who fix
computers all day long Facebook is
experimenting with testing its app on a
bunch of different phones even old ones
dating back as far as 2011 the last
little nugget a computer that can learn
to paint this is a computer program
analyzing thousands of paintings and
then using that information to paint one
of its own hey welcome back to cnet's
open tab have an open tab today
an open couch because joining us now is
Jake cool crawl crawl no relation Nick
yeah now no not a non k rol as far as
I'm away okay fair enough fair enough

thanks for being here J perhaps one of
our lab interns he's a very good dude

room well done someone called me a
snorlax today yeah you're like oh I said
what pokemon do I remind you of he goes
Snorlax I look up Snorlax free coconut
sleeps all day and it's like a fat mess
it's a big one yeah thanks friends
Pokemon go has had a huge week and we
just have to talk about it just a little
bit if you've got a question or comment
about Pokemon go you obviously do
because you've you're playing it right
now probably on your other phone who
knows anyway make sure you chime in and
we'll get to as many questions and/or
comments as we can so Sam Jake tell me
about your thoughts your passions your
dreams your hopes your futures with
Pokemon go Oh specifically about mango
yeah okay no not like not my love my
dreams there's another show for that
okay what yeah what have you been
playing I specifically have not been
playing because then I wouldn't do any
of my work okay however I went out and
two of my friends left the bar to go
find Pokemon and then what I'm thinking
though is at these gyms is that what
they're called yeah just don't you like
can't you meet other Pokemon players yes
i'm waiting for the first love story to
come out of it oh that's definitely
happened like there's definitely been
like one night Pokemon ghost and oh yeah
there should be like oh I can't wait
till inevitably someone there will be a
couple against Mary they'll have kids
and then like how did you go okay mom
and dad how did you meet well there was
a Bulbasaur Central Park your your
mother just couldn't let it go yeah
looks like that I love
and that's how it all worked then you
came around five years later hahaha yeah
so I I haven't been playing a lot I've
seen it I it's not on my phone because
like you said I need to have a life I
can't be bothered with like you know
squirtles and whatnot um and Jigglypuff
switching a fish take less of an echo
command so you can be put um but what
about you Jacob nothing I haven't played
i downloaded yesterday if you went out
and we kinda did like human to pokemon
story so yeah we went to do that some
people were like really into it we met
some people from Italy who like came
over and like we're waiting for it to be
really we don't have this they don't
have to have it is very excited but some
people like saying there's like a whole
community around it yeah pretty crazy to
see like I tell I think it's something
worth appreciating the social phenomenon
that it has created right where you have
a thing that everyone can play right
mostly if you've got a smartphone you
can do it you can be a part of the whole
party right so I think that is something
really kind of special that most games
don't really nothin really that was a
big thing is that you get out and like
it somebody said it gave them something
to do while they were like walking
around so it's kind of like it right
walking walking can your life regularly
and seeing a beautiful city like New
York that's boring yeah I can't do that
can't do that but their branding it as a
are like augmented reality but it's not
really a are because you have to be in
the app all the time walk and it's like
yeah and you're walking in it needs to
be open when you're walking for anything
to evolve sure and it only goes into a
are when a Pokemon approaches a regular
overlay it like a map that Rory show
which makes sense i mean kill i think
the whole sort of accessibility like
most people if two weeks ago if you said
hey what's a are they be like no idea
talking about at the very least if this
is done anything to educate the public
it is that Oh AR this is what it is like
whenever I now need to convey that idea
that concept somebody like you did
Pokemon go right that's AR Chadha do you
overlay on top of the real world which
which i think is pretty cool I mean what
else how long do you think this last
lesbian
same month I think you think we've got a
month left I think so okay so I say
three and a half weeks oh I feel like in
two weeks it's not really gonna be like
much of a thing I don't know I feel like
it's just taking up too much time like
it's yeah you know people are leaving
work someone got in a car crash I mean
miserable awful things could happen yeah
that stuff's been happening and
unfortunately and it's kind of evolving
i know we we there were some stories
yesterday that business owners are
paying to like have like the owners the
gyms come to them right but then like I
feel like it's interrupting the
experience you're like the true players
in the game they don't have to go and
like have to pay to like catch a poke
you know that's real bad it's not gonna
be good for and I don't know it's and I
think like see I think for the next two
weeks we'll over three weeks up to a
month we'll have that sort of hangover
but then don't forget all the copycat
stuff it's like if your developer mobile
developers you've been do and you've
been even thinking about doing something
with a are your all oh right now that
I'm rushing to get that out and coming
out get it certified and get it put in
the store so I'm excited about that
though to see more a our game yeah I
mean I'm all down for that okay very
cool we got some questions about Pokemon
go some comments let's toss it to Mike
in the control room alright so Jason and
our chat commented on that his wife is
29 and pregnant but it's not stopping
her from hunting Pokemon in this game
Cesar wants to know what you guys think
about the the Pokemon go plus the
wristband accessory and Pablo is also
asking how how far do you think Pokemon
go we'll go yeah I think we answered
that last one um I mean personally and I
don't want to I won't be like to go
hating on programming because that I
think it's a team of a kind of cool but
I just needed it's at a ten I needed to
be like a six yeah it's a little too
much in my favorites that's all maybe I
don't know think about real life for a
second oh and there's gonna keep it
going as long as they're valuing up by
Oh Lilian Zardoz yeah they're gonna push
it as much as they can ya see what if it
dies down there still gonna be putting
out updates for it and trying to fix Oh
it'll definitely be up there there'll be
new features and whatnot what about the
wrist accessory they're going much
for I think they're ready like 35 40
bucks but they're on ebay for like three
hundred five hundred dollars and
essentially it adds like another element
to the game all right I know what it
does it cuz I'm not super I think it
allows you to catch pokemon when your
phone is not there see that's actually
good that's what it is okay yeah to have
something while your phone's not on
right or at least not yeah you know open
with the app that would be and it looks
like a put on the end so if I kinda like
what he's like did you know that Pokemon
means pocket monsters what's that yeah
pop Pokemon needs pocket monsters oh
okay I thought it was a Maya I could see
that yeah that's pretty cool pretty good
the more you know thanks Sam yeah that
little nugget of info uh let speaking of
nintendo nintendo announced a brand new
micro console oh it's okay i believe the
nes is probably older than the both of
you which just need a moment of silence
for that's really weird anyway um so
there was this game system in the 80s
and it was called the nes and it was
like the first major home console and
they're releasing this as a sixty-dollar
little device packed in with 30 games
this is really cool stuff have you guys
played I played the games I mean doesn't
it seem like a good deal to get that
many games I've a little pretty good
deal I think like for me you know you
look at the games that they're offering
its 30 games a lot of that stuff is sort
of spread out on the Virtual Console
stuff that they've been offering the
last couple of years on the Wii the Wii
U the DS 3ds I think it's like a really
nice idea to get all that consolidated
into one thing another cool thing the
the little mini nes has the same port
that the wii controller has so you can
likely plug in any of those old pro
controller or any of those accessories
that you might have for William will you
pop it in there you're good to go it
also comes with the original square
rectangle nes controller you could buy
another one I feel like yeah it's 60
bucks but it's like that $60 like I
almost want to call it a stocking
stuffer sort of thing it's got the
packaging first up in some way it's like
a lot of stars and graphics
you're like oh I get it this is like at
the checkout line at target or something
like that so I think it's actually a
really cool idea that you guys are you
guys into it I think it's gonna be I'm
excited for Donkey Kong yeah I think
it's gonna be popular I get to you a lot
of my friends at college Charmian oh
yeah in college gonna put their money on
just plug it right into the chest right
in the size its gonna hurt and they'll
probably release like a yellow one with
30 years and a blue one they'll do that
whole thing all right let's pivot into
amazon prime day which just concluded a
couple days ago what did you guys think
what did you buy full disclosure
everybody I bought underwear that's
right I bought 25 freakin dollars worth
wonder where and it's gonna last me for
the next decade Wow yeah I know it's not
as glamorous as an as n amazon echo or a
kindle would you guys get I didn't get
an echo either I actually didn't get the
one thing that I wanted which was a slow
cooker they had some great deals on slow
cookers what happened I forgot and then
no so the question I murder just ran out
and then it was back to 140 dollar slow
cooker and I'm not shelling out that
much kidding me it was a cool wine it
was just right store yeah it was a
warmer a cooler a yogurt maker go tell
you all along all right there's a seven
in my beers like the intern gift that no
I'm not promising you with local forgive
I need a slow cooker what did you try to
buy you get your slow cooker I did not
gonna slow-cook I had a lot of issues
buying stuff that what the like
emotional or technical technical there's
a lot of technical issues with it so the
Lightning Deals like it said minus 61-54
what the hell's that mean I have no idea
i couldn't add anything to card but i've
actually got there and I picked up one
of those like bendable tripods okay Oh a
nice big creative vitamin water I felt
like a lot of the stuff there's a lot of
like toilet paper and Ramires yeah yeah
I got underwear I got like a bunch of
dormitory bundles for like tide pods and
dryer sheets and all that kind of stuff
yeah I was like that big of a discount
was it and man you know i love amazon i
probably spend 5 grand on amazon a year
okay full transparency but I feel like a
lot of the deals where Matt may be
deceptive but a little misleading right
you seem to be creating the illusion
that you're saving more than me
you actually were but nevertheless it
was definitely an improvement year over
year and they're probably gonna do it
again next year I mean yeah they sold
after ton of stuff my ya want to feel
that works at cnet but a ton of diapers
yeah that's the move first of all we
have so many parents at cnet right do
anything it's a lot of lot of parents
myself included there you go there's a
onesie right there was that say I drink
until I pass out tonight one that
applies for all generations especially
me Thank You Ryan call creep okay
comments everyone's screaming at me in
my ear my wife's calling me oh that's
not a joke she actually is um yeah what
do we got in the control room there Mike
alright so on you to back up people are
still in Pokemon they say that they
can't they cannot leave this game they
love it another one says that Pokemon
goes importance may die down but every
update with more Pokemon people will
freak out again then over moving into
amazon Jason on facebook said he bought
an echo but it hasn't shipped yet he's
hoping not to get a rushed one Danny was
also tempted by was tempted by a pot
that she saw in her Facebook feeds Cesar
saying the Phenom is a lightning deal in
several colors we click on the colors
it's sold out and it's add to a waitlist
so you felt like he felt like it was a
little bit of a convoluted sales system
but yeah that's that's that's what they
were saying on that for the Amazon topic
stuff I feel like I I mean I I'm filled
with a lot of regret I should have got
an echo I should have gotten a lot of
things I just you know it's still
running past it wasn't the best deal
that was like 130 but when it was first
released you prime members to get it for
a hundred oh that's right I feel like
there's a new one around the corner
you're probably get this one for cheaper
and I still get the software updates
what are we gonna do when you guys leave
maybe lost we lost without you guys you
too Tom don't forget a lot of interns in
here I just a lot of internet this whole
show is being held together with duct
tape and interns what's day it's going
well what's happening uh the robot World
Cup took place in Germany did you guys
know about this I did they fell over a
lot yeah yeah because robots I ain't the
most graceful things in the world that
can't play soccer look at these Soccer
kicking robots actually
apparently they can play a little bit
I'm sorry this looks like the most
boring past soccer game can you imagine
watching that like in person I won't let
you look at all these oh well what's
gonna happen with the black team and oh
okay give me a break robots can't play
sports hey chef but apparently they did
oh Henry told you get out of here down

tough that was a real real persistent
provision do it again yeah uh so this is
a thing there are a lot of people there
inexplicably what uh what sports would
you want to see robots play if you had
to not going by this because that looked
mostly awful maybe bowling bowling is a
good decision bowling bowling is like
the easiest it's like a pitch machine
like a pitching machine could just have
that elbow 300 he'll be good yeah yeah

of see how well they can keep the boat
set and you know I believe that our
grace on their boat I believe it no I
you got skill I mean like you have a
boat and then you have little robots
sitting in it okay like really right

thing yeah that's good not recruit cyl
crew you want robot crew yeah I resent a
waterproof I feel like that's good the
big issue if not would be kind of
hilarious if not you know they all grab
saran wrap all okay war front of
