focused not just on providing the
easiest to use the most elegant browsing
experience but also the most innovative
these are the kinds of innovations that
Safari is broad private browsing
blocking of third-party cookies for
privacy making the web easier to read
with features like reading list and the
html5 audio and video tag all Safari
firsts and the engine and Safari web kit
juice by over 1.5 billion devices well
in mountain lion we're making Safari
even better we have a great clean new
homepage with top sites from there you
can get at great sidebar where you have
access to all of your bookmarks and you
can browse right from your bookmarks and
in that sidebar we also have reading
list we're now you can continuously
scroll through your articles moving from
article to article without ever having
to click and a great new feature called
shared links where you see all of the
links shared by people you're following
on Twitter and LinkedIn you can browse
them right here now in addition to these
end-user improvements there's also a lot
going on under the hood big improvements
to JavaScript a full process per tab
architecture and memory efficient is the
improvements with shared memory resource
cash and a whole bunch of big power
savings as well so far uses way less
energy than chrome and when you compare
to Firefox it's just kind of sad so
that's Safari I'd love to give you a
demo of some of our advanced
technologies in Safari right now
so let's start with responsiveness and
I'm going to go now into male and so
here we have a mailbox with about a
hundred thousand messages in your inbox
and I just want to show you how how you
scroll now with that accelerated
scrolling perfectly smooth incredibly
fast almost 60 frames a second whenever
you do it it's just epic and when you
look here at scrolling through a
conversation this is a conversation with
26 messages in it again just super
glassy smooth super fast it's really
really nice let's take a look at that in
safari in Safari we've improved
scrolling for more popular websites and
actually optimized heavily for retina
displays so now it's just super fast
super smooth now let's take a look at
power yeah there's a fan of smooth
scrolling right there in the front I'm a
fan of smooth scrolling as well so let's
take a look at power usage have a power
meter up here that's showing CPU
activity in Safari and you notice right
now it's quite low just we're not doing
anything but let's go into a website
that's gonna use a lot of power and you
notice the power meter shoot right up
because we're doing a lot of animation
here using on a cpu and that's okay
that's what the CPUs for it's doing
something cool for me right here but
very often you'll have something like
this happening in an ad off in the
corner you've covered this window up and
yet it's still draining your battery
life you don't even realize it well now
with this technology we call app nap we
keep track of what's going on and what
things you actually see to decide where
to direct power so watch what happens
when I bring up this iTunes window over
the safari window power drops right now
that's extending your battery life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
