first fully wireless home theater in a
box systems we've seen at the full 5.1
kit and it operates over the less
crowded 5 gigahertz spectrum it doesn't
look much it's mostly constructed from
plastic and I was called a wireless
system it still features spindle e power
adapters to connect each speaker one
reason to buy this system though is that
it's easy to set up each speaker is
labeled so you know exactly where it's
supposed to go and once you plug them
all in you plug in your Roku or cable
box and you're ready to go
it comes with an enclave app which is
kind of cool and gives access to a
number of streaming services and
universal plug and play but it's kind of
unnecessary given that it uses bluetooth
hence you could just use whatever app
you want the system sound quality was
surprisingly good with the 8-inch sub
blending real wait to action movies
dialog was intelligible and surround
sound effects seamless music was also
better than you'd get from a tiny sound
bar but at $1,200 you can't get better
sound from the dedicated speaker package
and receiver on the other hand the
Enclave could be worthwhile if you just
want a plug and play system that sounds
decent</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
