watch the trailer for Episode seven the
force awakens they were introduced to a
man stranded on a desert planet we now
know his name is Finn so what happens to
thin we won't know that until December
but I spoke with the actor portraying
him John boyega after his photo shoot
for cnet magazine he told me that Finn
is on a journey that will turn him into
an iconic superhero we also know that
boyega will wield a lightsaber at some
point in the film is he the next week
Skywalker boyega loves that he knows and
we don't still some people aren't happy
that boy llega is playing the lead role
there's been backlash on Twitter against
having a black man playing such an
important part as for boyega he told me
he's just focused on making a great
movie meantime Disney is focused on more
than just the next Star Wars the company
is in the middle of a huge effort to
remake its business around a video game
and toy called infinity Disney isn't the
only one making these either there's
also Activision and Nintendo and
together they've pulled in more than
four billion dollars in the past four
years the boom isn't likely to slow down
now that Disney is adding the new Star
Wars characters including thin to its
infinity game so the way it works is
that Disney makes these toys well
figurines really that have a chip in
their base and when you put them on this
pad that's connected to your television
and your video game console there's a
flash of light and suddenly this toy
that was in your hand is now in the
video game
I visited Disney's offices in Utah and
saw how the infinity team works they try
very hard to make the figurine toys is
true to their characters as we see on
the TV and movie screens take Darth Maul
from Star Wars Episode one the phantom
menace in the movie mall has red skinned
black tattoos and eight horn sticking
out of his head when Disney built the
toy the horns were a problem because
they were considered too dangerous for
kids Disney had to convince the Star
Wars teams at Lucas to let them create
their figure with six larger horns
instead so it would be safer Disney and
its rivals believe many of the toys we
played with as kids will go the way of
the dinosaur in their place will be
these new devices that we can play with
in the real world and inside a video
game as for boyega I asked him what it
felt like to be a character on the big
screen and in a video game he's a big
gamer so for him it's more than a dream
come true it's one thing to be in a
movie he said it's a whole other thing
to be in a video game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
