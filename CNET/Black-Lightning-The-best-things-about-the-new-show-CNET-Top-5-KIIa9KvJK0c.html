the new Black Lightning TV series
there's a new superhero show called
Black Lightning based on the DC Comics
hero here are the best things about the
show and I'm basing this top 5 on the
pilot only if you haven't seen the first
episode be aware mild spoilers are ahead
and number 5 is it avoids the origin
story unlike a lot of hero based
properties the first episode of Black
Lightning ditches the standard hero gets
his mission and purpose in episode 1
instead the Black Lightning pilot is
about the return of a hero and by the
time he actually shows up you're rooting
for him a little mystery is good and
number 4 are its strong characters the
first episode established plenty of
strong characters from the Pierce family
to the 100 gangs boss Tobias and
inspector Henderson all are relatively
well defined in 42 minutes now a lot of
shells tend to have their characters do
weird things and potentially act in
stupid ways over time hopefully Black
Lightning will avoid this at number 3
being a hero out of costume the main
character is Jefferson Pearce foof
spoiler was once Black Lightning here's
the thing after Pearce drops his
crime-fighting alter-ego Pearce
continues to try to make a difference by
being a high school principal he wants
to empower his students and family to
make a difference other than by punching
crooks in the face
coming in at number two is the show
features a grown-up hero in a black
lightning we have a lead
who chooses to continue living his life
Jefferson Pierce has two daughters and
an ex-wife he is nine years removed from
being a crime fighter he don't get
teenage angst or whines from Jefferson
he's got bigger things to worry about
which makes the whole tone of the show
different in a lot of other DC shows and
the best thing about the new black
lightning series is it's set outside of
the air overs yes Black Lightning airs
on the same network as arrow Supergirl
and the flash those these shows have
their characters crossover because they
are part of a larger universe known as
the arrow verse according to a black
lightnings executive producer the new
series is not part of the arrow verse
this it allows Black Lightning to have a
level of realism those other shows just
can't especially in the way tackles
social and political issues even though
Black Lightning revolves around a guy
who has electrical powers it's very
grounded his grounded and electrical pun
are you positive
is that an electrical pun what did you
like or dislike about the new Black
Lightning series let us know on Twitter
or on YouTube
