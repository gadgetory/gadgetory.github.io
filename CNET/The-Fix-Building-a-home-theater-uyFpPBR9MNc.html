show about DIY tech and how-to on Donal
Bell and I'm Sharon Vaknin this week
we're focusing on all things related to
your television including some super
useful tips on how to mount your TV to
your wall and how to get the best sound
quality but first Eric Franklin tells us
how to pick the right size television to
maximize your viewing experience
hey guys Eric Franklin here now when
buying a new TV one of those important
things you're probably thinking about is
screen size so how do you figure out
what's the best screen size for you well
thx recommends a 40 degree viewing angle
in order to get the most immersive
experience from watching movies and TV
shows in high-definition
now there's a very simple formula to
figure this out and I'm gonna show you
exactly how to do it so first I'm gonna
measure the distance in inches from
where I want to place my new TV to where
I'll actually be sitting I'll take that
number multiply it by 0.8 4 in order to
get this screen size for the optimal
viewing experience so in this case I'm
gonna measure from the TV I'm gonna put
back to where I'll actually be sitting
which equals roughly 77 inches now
that'll give me the optimum viewing
angle for the most cinematic experience
now if you take that 77 inches and then
multiply it by 0.8 4 you get roughly 65
inches which is the exact size of this
screen now that may be too big for you
but CNET recommends home with
at least a 50-inch TV for a livingroom
area but also pushing it to about 60 or
even more it's gonna be even better the
overall takeaway here is that long as
you're not sitting really close to your
TV it's always better to go big you get
a bigger TV you get a bigger TV everyone
gets bigger TVs thank you very frankly
all right we're going to do a quick
break but when we get back we're
tackling a DIY project on putting your
TV on your wall with a mount that will
only cost you 30 bucks plus some tips on
dramatically improving the sound quality
of your TV
welcome back did you know I just bought
a new place Oh
how's that going for you pretty great
it's a blank slate right now but I
figured I'd be doing this anyway so show
everyone how to wall mount a flat screen
TV oh it should be good that's a little
measuring a little drilling but all in
all pretty easy process here's how to do
it step by step and on a budget so
here's the deal we've got a new place
got a new TV and this time gonna do it
right I'm gonna wall mount my television
instead of having it sitting on a you
know console so I bought this one on
Amazon it's the cheetah flush tilt wall
mount $30 leave reviews it sounds like a
good deal I've got the wall mount that's
gonna go on the wall and then I've got
the brackets if you're gonna go on the
back of my TV and attach to the mount
alright so the first thing I got to do
is find the studs in my wall I hope they
exist to locate them I'm gonna use the
stud finder this is a magnetic stud
finder which is convenient cuz it's no
batteries to replace studs are typically
around 16 to 24 inches apart
all right lining them up with the stud
marks I made on the wall that's pretty
good
now we're attaching the right size drill
bit for our screws here goes
now we're gonna put the frame up on the
wall and use the bolts to actually get
that thing into the studs hopefully nice
and secure
so now I've got all my bolts in is
looking pretty good I'm double-checking
against that level the bubbles right in
the center all right now this thing's
rated to hold a hundred and sixty-five
pounds that means I should be confident
enough to give this thing a tug I feel
like it's not gonna come right out of
the wall now for the next step we're
gonna want to put the braces on the back
of the TV before we do that though I'm
gonna need to take the band off the
bottom here give it a new life as a
wall-mounted TV you're free so here are
the two braces here where they're gonna
go the main thing you want to be able to
do is be able to conceal the braces
behind the TV so if you have a smaller
TV you knees are poking out the top you
have some wiggle room here to get the
right fit
feels solid it's just solid confident so
the idea is that these hooks on the back
on the braces are gonna hook right over
the lip and hang down from there and
that can use a little security screws to
really lock it into place down below
time let's put this sucker up on the
wall oh yeah there we go let's check it
out on the back the hooks are over the
frame now the cool thing is that this
can slide on the track so I can scoot it
over if I want to get the perfect
placement it's on we're almost done last
thing I want make sure it's right dead
center and then I'm gonna screw in the
security bolts and lock it in place
beautiful it's on the wall looks like an
art piece
all right I am considering this a
success everything looks great let's
play some video nice all right now the
kid assembled really easily it only cost
me 30 bucks and I did it all by myself
this is how you wall mount your own
television oh not too shabby Donald
thank you mama I love the look of a
wall-mounted TV well as most of you know
and have probably experienced an HDTV
offers an incredible picture but a lot
of times these thin pretty TVs have thin
sound too but there are ways to make it
better
the biggest mistake TV owners make is
not investing in audio these flat panel
TVs look great but the problem is they
don't leave much room for booming sound
so today I'll show you three ways to add
audio to your home theater system the
easiest and fastest way to do it is with
a sound bar they're cheap easy to
install and look undeniably good
underneath the flat panel TV with sound
bars that you can go low-end or invest
your money in a higher end sound bar in
this case Vizio is affordable and still
sounds good especially for movies the
drawback with sound bars though is that
they're well-known not to perform as
well with music however lots of them
come packed with features like bluetooth
and they usually come with a sub like
most high achievers the Huayra is a
little bit different from all the other
kids in the playground for the richest
home theater experience a 5.1 surround
sound system is your answer in this case
sound hits you at every angle with two
front speakers a center speaker two rear
speakers and a sub woofer
now there are some drawbacks to consider
for starters the speakers alone can
easily cost you $2,000 and then of
course you want to factor in the cost of
a receiver to on top of it all 5.1
systems requires some planning because
you want to consider placement
concealing the wires and in some cases
you might even want to install the rear
speakers in the ceiling if you don't
want to go all out with a 5.1 system the
best solution is two stereo speakers and
maybe a sub it's one of the most
underrated options but you get great
sound for music movies and it's really
easy to set up you'll still have to
spend a few hundred bucks but the good
news is that these speakers can last you
up to ten years and they'll still sound
just as good as when you bought them
setting up stereo speakers is really
easy in this case I have a compact amp
that gets plugged into the TV with a
digital audio cord then these two
bookshelf speakers plug right into the
back with regular speaker wire it's
really that simple
so whether you go for low-end speakers
or invest in something more high-end
there's always a way to add audio to
your home theater system for an amped-up
viewing experience
that's it for this week's show thanks
for watching if you have any ideas for
is any tips we really want to hear from
you you can tweet me at samel and i'm at
sharing back next week we have a whole
show dedicated to smartphone photography
we'll see you then back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
