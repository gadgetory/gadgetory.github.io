step-down model from the company's top
tier black but it certainly doesn't
perform like it I'm Josh Goldman with
Cena and the hero4 silver is a
noticeable improvement over its
predecessor in features and performance
and in turn earns our Editor's Choice
Award what you're getting with the
silver are essentially the bones of last
year's excellent hero 3 plus black but
with beefed up features including new
night photo and night lapse modes for
brighter low-light shots highlight
tagging so you can easily find important
moments for playback and editing and the
cameras protune settings are available
for video and photos which gives you
more flexibility with image correction
when editing the menu system has been
reworked making setting changes easier
to and there's better Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth physically it's the same size
as the three those swapping batteries is
easier with the new bottom loading
design but for most people the killer ad
here is the built in touch screen that
you can use to change settings set up
your shots and play back the results
without connecting to your smartphone or
buying the add on screen now it's
certainly not the only model out there
with a screen and it's still not
waterproof without a housing the battery
design is new so you can't use your old
ones and it's battery life is still
south of two hours and it's four hundred
dollars which is no small sum of money
but if you're getting a GoPro for most
people this will be the one to get I'm
Josh Goldman and that's a look at the
editor's choice award winning gopro
