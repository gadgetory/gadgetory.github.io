taking a look at the Sony Xperia z2 it's
the latest flagship phone from Sony
packing a whole host of top-end kit to
get excited about physically it's quite
similar to last year's experience
sejuani has the aluminium band running
around the edge and it has the same
glass front and back which looks pretty
sexy and like its predecessor it's
completely waterproof so you can even
take some photos while you're snorkeling
the screen is now a larger 5.2 inches
across
but the bezels have been made much
slimmer so the body of the phone hasn't
had to bulge out too much now the full
HD display uses the same tech from
Sony's TVs which it reckons gives much
richer colors inside as a Qualcomm
Snapdragon 801 processor now that is a
quad-core shet clocked at a mighty 2.3
gigahertz along with three gigabytes of
RAM which should make everything
incredibly Swift on the back of the
phone is the same 20 point 7 megapixel
camera but this has been updated to
offer 4k video as well as image
stabilization which does mean that you
will need to get one of those super
expensive 4k TVs if you want to enjoy
your video at its best the phone will
arrive from the latest Android 4.4.2
kitkat software when it goes on sale in
Europe in March sadly there's no word
yet on price or whether it'll be
available in the US but make sure to
keep it CNET for all the latest news I'm
Andrew Hoyle and this is the Sony Xperia
z2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
