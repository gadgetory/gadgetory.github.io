the chevy cruze eco but this is the
chevy cruze eco a much more
fuel-efficient turbo diesel let's drive
Chevy's entrant in the field of
powerplant America loves to hate and
check its efficiency tab now spotting a
cruise diesel is not easy it looks just
about like every other cruise they tell
me it's got a subtle aero kit I guess
the chins a little different
beyond that you got to look for this
little teeny-tiny TD badge on the rump
that makes a VW TDI logo look huge in
other words this car doesn't scream I'm
green if that matters to you now I'm not
going to spend a ton of time inside this
cruise because we've shot the Cruze eco
check out our in-depth video on that
also the 2014 Impala is a great deep
dive on the Chevy MyLink radio I'll let
it suffice to say that navigation is
optional though display radio is
standard with Pandora and stitcher
rear camera is also optional on this guy
which I find a little disconcerting and
beyond that the fit and finish is nice
leather comes on the diesel as well
that's going to be an interesting factor
later in the story but the big story is
up there under the hood now of course
the diesel engine is a big part of the
story here you don't often see diesels
in America let alone with an American
car company 2 liter turbo diesel the
turbo parts really obvious here's our
little Garrett unit right up there very
plain to say we also have direct
injection going on here which is what
modern diesels all do the numbers 151
horse 264 foot-pounds of torque that
last one is the whole point gets this
roughly 34 hundred pounds via
up to 60 fat 8.6 seconds that sounds
pretty class average notice the mileage
is what's interesting
27:46 hello neem that's a nice number a
cruisee co gas gets 26 39 average of 31
cruz turbo diesel gets 27 a big 46 on
the highway but only averages 2 miles
per gallon more average 33 annual fuel
cost is only 50 dollars less on the
turbo diesel but the MSRP is over $5,000
more because the diesel has 4-wheel ABS
remote start leather interior available
of the sunroof heated seats and even
more so if you don't care about the
extra equipment the math is pretty harsh
it's a $5,000 Delta paid off at 50 bucks
a year over a century ok so driving the
little Chevy diesel what's it like well
first of all you don't hear most of that
diesel clatter we heard under the hood
it's much better managed inside so
you're not gonna find that it's you know
a rattle box the torque is very muted
once you get spooled up it's there but
it's rather muted because I think this
car is heavily tuned toward economy and
you're not getting a huge amount of
great leaf down low just the way this
car is engineered that said it has ample
orly sufficient power I don't feel like
this cars gutless especially if y'all
work the gearbox a little bit that's not
the idea right we're doing a really nice
average mpg and all of us on the car
tech team were able to see at least the
cars calculated 50 mpg on the highway
pretty easily ride quality is real nice
member it weighs quite a bit more than
the Gaskin June car and that does
wonders for suspension planted miss
which I always like nice and quiet sight
lines are good on this car it's a very
livable everyday vehicle that is a
little bit sluggish in transitions on
the throttle because that diesel is not
giving up its torque as much as it is
being tuned for economy I find that a
little disappointing but they are
getting some good numbers out of this
car so in sum what I say about this car
on the road is that it's it's absolving
a lot of sins that general
Motors committed in the 80s I mean
they're largely the reason that
Americans hate Diesel's they did some
horrendous diesels back in the day an
Americans swaram off back then you could
get either a Mercedes diesel that was
expensive and for the rich people or
then there were these American diesels
that were like oh well this sets the
record straight General Motors to make a
real nice piece of car I'm pricing our
cruise diesel you got to know this guy
does not start off real cheap they have
positioned it as a high trim model as we
discussed a little earlier so 25 7 is
your entry level then on top of that a
number of things to get seen a style one
of which is this convenience package
that's how you get the rear camera and a
bunch of self adjusting mirrors
basically I'd normally would bristle at
a camera being an optional cost but it's
only 380 for the whole package so I'll
give them a pass if you want driver
assistance rear sensors cross traffic
alert and blind spot indicators it's 800
bucks
sunroof another 900 navigation as I
mentioned is extra 795 it's not gonna
break the bank and they do a pretty good
job on the all inward just about 29,000
on the nose not bad but notice you've
got to care about the high equipment
level on this car to make it work out
otherwise you can never earn back the
additional cost of this versus the
cruise Eco gas car it just isn't gonna
happen unless you got a century on your
hands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
