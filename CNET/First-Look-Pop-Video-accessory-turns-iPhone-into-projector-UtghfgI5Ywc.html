cnet.com and I'm here with the pop video
pico projector this is a tiny pico
projector that attaches to your iPhone
or iPod Touch it's only $99 it has about
two hours of battery life it has a
built-in rechargeable battery
there's no speakers inside it but it
uses your iPhone or iPod Touches
internal speakers and that actually
works pretty well the big question is
how well does this actually project it
has 960 by 540 resolution that's pretty
good
it isn't a bright projector as you might
imagine so it really helps to dim the
lights even a blackened room is really
the way to go with this you can get
pretty big but obviously the smaller you
go the brighter the picture is going to
be so I would say more like in the range
of about twenty twenty to thirty inches
is probably ideal for this there are a
couple of small drawbacks to the
projector one of the issues is you do
have to have this in your hand or
somehow proper dup it's not so easy to
get a perfectly square picture when you
prop it up also your iPod or your iPhone
doesn't attach that securely to the the
projector itself it has a nice pop out
dock that's pretty cool its retractable
this is very small and you can carry it
around with you but your device isn't
that secure so you have to be careful it
doesn't pop off aside from that this is
really the direction that pico
projectors have to go that attaches
right to your iPhone it has a passable
picture it's relatively inexpensive at
$99 so what I'd say is keep your
expectations low and you'll actually be
pretty impressed with the pop video it's
not a great projector but it certainly
is worth bringing along on the go as far
as what you can project from your iPhone
it is a little bit complicated you can
do videos you can also do images and
then there is a pop video app that
allows you to project facebook as well
as webpages you do have to launch that
app in order to do that aside from some
of those drawbacks as I was talking
about this is
the direction that pico projectors need
to go that it's relatively inexpensive
at $99 attaches to your iPhone or iPod
Touch and you can take it on the go with
you that's great the picture could be a
little better but if you keep your
expectations relatively low I think
you'll be actually kind of impressed
with this I'm David Carr Noy
and that is the pop video go from micron
technology and thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
