two features that fans loved I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your CNET update the
Mobile World Congress trade show is
going on now in Barcelona where the
world's tech giants are showing off
their prized products of the year
Samsung took the wraps off the Galaxy s6
and it comes in two flavors a flat s6
and the curvy s6 edge which has a screen
that folds over slightly on the sides of
the phone now there's no reason samsung
made two versions other than the fact
that the company must lack confidence in
committing to the curved design because
everything beside the curve is the same
on both of these phones they both use
metal instead of plastic the screens are
5.1 inches they can wirelessly charge
there's improved fingerprint readers and
better cameras and they both have a new
tap to pay feature called Samsung pay it
works with old card swiping machines as
well as NFC but the big news isn't what
Samsung added it's what Samsung took
away the new Galaxy s6 models have no
option for a removable SD memory card
and no removable battery and unlike the
s5 this also isn't waterproof the option
to replace a battery or memory card is
what helped the galaxy stand apart from
an iPhone Samsung is bumping up the
internal memory starting at 32 gigs to
make up for it and if you're wondering
what's the point of the edge well it
just looks nice and of course that
curved screen is going to likely cost
you more but the price and release date
were not revealed HTC also showed off a
new top-of-the-line smartphone called
the HTC One m9 it's also decked out in a
metal design with a 5-inch screen but it
looks almost identical to last year's
model HTC chose to beef up the specs
inside with better cameras and
processors rather than redesign the look
the more interesting news from HTC isn't
a phone it's the accessories the HTC
partnered with Fitness brand Under
Armour to create the grip fitness
tracker this rubbery wristband comes in
three sizes and it has onboard GPS to
measure your runs
it also can alert you to missed messages
and incoming calls it connects to iOS
and Android
phones and it arrives this spring in the
US for $200
HTC also has its own virtual reality
headset called the vive made in
partnership with the video game company
valve yes there's yet another virtual
reality headset in the world because
apparently every tech company needs to
prove their cool by making something for
your face the vibe is a bit different
from others because it has a built-in
screen and processor you don't have to
slip your phone into the front to make
it work like you do with Samsung's gear
VR and speaking of which there's also a
new version of the gear VR that works
with new Galaxy S smartphones
that's your tech news update and there's
always more cnet.com from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
