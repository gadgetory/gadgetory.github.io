the pixel to excel man that name is a
mouthful you've seen Google's newest
giant phone but you're wondering if you
should get one before we start this list
is based on what we saw Google's
presentation stuff could change after we
get our hands on it all right let's get
to it
and number five the design the 2xl
actually looks like a modern smartphone
with a six inch screen and small bezels
the original XL packed a 5.5 inch screen
and looked like an iPhone the pixel to
excel follows a style of competitors
like Samsung but at least Google's phone
has a fingerprint sensor on the back
that looks like it's a lot easier to
reach than on the note or the S eight
and number four it's water-resistant
this is another catch up feature but
it's a good reason to upgrade from last
year's pixel the pixel to is ip67 water
and dust resistant meaning it should
survive in water up to a meter for up to
30 minutes on the other hand Samsung's
Galaxy S eight phones are ip68 rated
they survive in up to 1.5 meters of
fresh water for up to 30 minutes and
number three free storage so all pixel
phones have fixed storage options which
kind of stinks but Google has a
workaround you can backup all of your
photos and videos to Google services at
full quality from your pixel to Google
photos the Photos app also has a free up
space option which will remove content
on your phone which gives you more room
for apps and number two the camera the
rear camera on the pixel two is optical
and electronic image stabilization with
the ability to use both at the same time
Google calls this feature fused video
stabilization neither of the original
pixel phones had optical image
stabilization
this means that pictures on the pixel 2
should be less blurry and video should
be a lot smoother Google even touted
that the camera on pixel 2 received the
highest score of any smartphone camera
ever and at number one it's got the
latest and cleanest Android the pixel
lineup phones get the latest version of
Android before any other Android phones
every cool feature every security
improvement all of it they show up on
pixels first Google lens will arrive on
the pixel first if it works like the
demos it should be awesome the biggest
standout for the pixel to excel
and any pixel actually is the ability to
get an extremely clean and an always
updated version of Android with the
Google pixel to excel it looks like
Google has caught up with competitors in
most features if you're looking for
reasons not to buy the pixel to excel
