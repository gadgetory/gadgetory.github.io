app comes with iOS 8 it's apples way of
trying to help you make sense of all the
fitness and health data you collect
using your phone wearables and fitness
apps the health dashboard is entirely
customizable
so you can display the data that you
care about most that can be steps walked
blood glucose levels calories burned or
even really specific things like vitamin
D intake each item you track gets a
chart that visualizes the data over time
let's build a dashboard I'll go over to
health data then fitness then I'll add
steps show on dashboard and flights
climbed each of these things can be
tracked using my phone's built-in motion
processor and the barometer alright
those two things are in there let's give
it a try
now I can see how many steps I took and
how many stairs I climbed plus the app
will continue to track that data all the
time but that's just the beginning
the health app can also access data that
comes from other apps for instance
there's the seven-minute workout app
which has this theory that all you need
is to workout seven intense minutes per
day to track the app I'll go to the
sources tab and enable data importing
from the seven-minute workout app there
is also an option to allow it to read my
weight from the health app which will
help it determine how many calories I
actually burned so not only does health
collect data it also enables apps to
talk to each other finally I'll go to
health data and add calories burned to
my dashboard let's give it a shot
now that I completed the app I can
launch health and see how many calories
I burned alongside my weight steps and
flights climbed giving me a complete
picture of my overall health if you have
any questions or tips of your own and
hit me up on Twitter and check out
cnet.com / - for the complete guide to
the health app for CNET I'm Sharon
