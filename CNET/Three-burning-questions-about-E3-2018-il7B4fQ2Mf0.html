e3 2018 we want to talk to some of my
friends and colleagues and get their
opinions on some of the best stuff they
saw here some stuff that they're not so
psyched about and maybe if they could
summarize III what would it be
let's go see some of our friends if you
had to describe III in one sentence or a
few words what would that be incredibly
busy and very tiring it's always that
way
I totally agree Ashley if you could
describe III in a sentence what would it
be it would be line capped it's true
it's very every line has been capped at
the start of the show they're fans
because it's open to the public now the
lines have been capped so early on that
if you do not get here early you're not
playing the game you want to play now
you have to fart and you think you can
do it quietly and it comes out really
loud and every in the room notices you
and it's kind of disappointing that's
how he pretty wise for me this year but
the so the fart is this so the fart is
III yeah everything is different it's
kind of finding itself again yeah yeah
they're trying to find a new identity
for this thing the show when people
would just shut up about cyberpunk
if you could describe III in one
sentence over to be one sentence a bit
thin a bit thin Thanks very busy for me
okay that's a bit selfish a lot of bold
choices a couple nice carpets a couple
nice covers there's at least half a
dozen it's underwhelming at times but
it's still been a lot of fun if there
was one game that you had to take out of
e3 that you were allowed to just play
right away what would be a cyberpunk
cyberpunk I have to go with cyberpunk I
saw it behind closed doors and it was
unreal in that one hour I got it more of
world-building and kind of a level of
detail in an open world that I haven't
really seen in games I played for like
20 hours I'm sure everybody's saying
cyberpunk 2077 like obviously but I
think for me I'm actually really curious
about playing Fallout 76 because I
didn't think I would want to play that
game until I heard a little bit more
about it and now that it's not going to
be thousands of people spawn camping
like one deathclaw for some sort of
death claw skin for a quest like I'm
actually pretty stoked
absolutely control okay this is the new
game by the remedy people tell me about
that so I feel like remedy is finally
making the game they've always wanted to
make which is a nonlinear obtuse
narrative but also action game it's it's
as if David Lynch and remedy sort of
teamed up to make something and it blew
me away I would say anthem
I mean anthem is this you know it's
Bioware's new game we finally got our
hands on it and like the shooting is
great the world is really interesting
it's kind of like destiny last of us to
Spider Man a Kingdom Hearts 3 dying
light to made a really strong impression
what's the most upsetting kind of thing
about e3 2018 the Nintendo booth was
kind of stinky like smelly no I wish it
was smelly ok very good see you later uh
you know I'm a big Nintendo guy and I
think Nintendo kind of dropped the ball
this year I'm excited for Smash Brothers
but I would also like to play other
games Dan record too much leet I like
surprises at e3 I like excitement and
most of these press conferences we went
in knowing about practically everything
so I just you know I want to be
entertained thank you be soft had dance
numbers that was cool the directional
air dodges have too much landing lag on
platform for Super Smash Brothers
ultimate Hotel Wi-Fi continues to be
terrible it's not good the metal
detectors so there's about 70,000 people
here and there's 12 metal detectors so
it's not so easy to get it Square Enix
has press conference it was pointless it
made no sense all they did was show
trailers from previous press conferences
the one game everyone wanted to hear
about from them Final Fantasy 7 remake
was not present and it was too bad you
know the one thing that upset me the
most and I'm still dealing with my
feelings is the lack of news on Final
Fantasy 7 remake oh that game is never
coming in Jeff it's never don't just
don't
Resident Evil 2 remake is already coming
out and that yeah I'm literally gonna
I'm gonna start crying right now I
didn't that was my intention but thank
you very much Ashley you're you're very
welcome thanks for making me cry</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
