the Apple vibe for all the good and bad
inside the world of Apple let's jump in
the stories with new details for the
next-gen iPhone now NFC or near field
communications was rumored for the
iPhone 4s but it didn't happen
nine-to-five Matt reports now that
looking at the hardware code leads them
to believe the next iPhone will have an
NFC chip directly connected to the power
management unit in the future
iPhone the Apple showed off passbook in
their iOS 6 preview that's a gift card
and ticket management app and they could
possibly plug in a payment system with
the presence of NFC which still hasn't
taken off here in the u.s. an NFC chip
could also allow a quick and easy way to
share files between two iOS devices even
though the bump app does that and it's
primarily only used between two guys so
believe it or not we'll just have to
wait until the phone actually comes out
to find out more now we've also show you
plenty of the potential rear panels and
rendered images from the rumored iPhone
5 that featured a smaller dot connector
techCrunch reports it will be a much
smaller dot connector port with only 19
pins that's more similar in size to
microUSB it's also being reported that
the new connector will be magnetic like
the MagSafe connector used on Apple's
MacBook line but what about all your
current accessories apple or a third
party company will come out with an
adapter but I'm not throwing a bad apple
out on this one we've had the same
connector for over five years and in
order to get a smaller form factor or
fit more things into the phone other
parts need to take a blessed space and
I'm all for this even if it will be a
pain transitioning for about a year
because don't tell me you're not buying
a new iPhone that has faster speed has a
bigger screen and will talk to you when
you're alone at night just because it's
dock connector smaller you're lying to
yourself also guys the news on the iMac
front several outlets reported that the
all-in-one desktop line was due for a
Retina display upgrade of its own we're
still waiting for them to make an
appearance this year but Instapaper
developer Marco Arment sources tell him
the retina display will not make it into
this year's refresh because of
production issues for display
that size and for all the Alpha biters
who wrote in about IMAX just wait for
the new models this year I expect them
before the back-to-school season and
just because it might not have a Retina
display it shouldn't stop you but what
about a retina Apple TV see I just made
that up it's not happening anytime soon
but a new report from Topeka Capital
Markets claims that Foxconn has
accelerated its schedule for ordering
television sized LCD panels from sharp
with hopes and Apple branded TV set will
launch in time for the holiday season
but I'm still saying early 2013
now we're also expecting mountain-lion
this July and the data is getting
narrowed down after reports from an
Apple third-party tech support firm says
there will be a vacation blackout from
July 22nd to the 29th to support its
desktops and portables division this
blackout could also potentially point to
new iMac and Mac Mini hardware as well
apple also released an update to their
iOS 6 beta that's available in
developers right now over-the-air and
there's a few updates you guys to check
out you'll now have a new toggle with
the shared photo streams feature in your
photo and iCloud settings the Twitter
icon in Siri you eye has been slightly
redesigned and I didn't even realize the
share widget that's a part of the
notifications pulldown which is pretty
slick also in your cellular settings you
have a toggle to sync your reading lists
over a cellular connection and there's
plenty more we'll find later also Apple
has said they'll be releasing a
standalone podcast app but it still
hasn't been included and their podcast
management leaves a lot to be desired
so while we wait for one let's check out
the best podcast app on iOS right now
huh yeah hey guys welcome to tap that
app I'm Brian Tommy and this is the
place to find the hottest piece of app
in the mobile space
now this one's for iOS users and podcast
listeners and it's called downcast on
iOS devices you can download a podcast
through the iTunes Store by each
individual episode but you can't
subscribe to the podcast and have it
automatically download on your mobile
device
the only way to do that is if you use
iTunes on your computer subscribe to the
iTunes app and then sync your phone with
your computer what genius thought of
that well they might fix it in iOS 6
but downcast for a dollar and 99 cents
allows you to automatically download and
listen to all of your podcasts without
the need to sync with iTunes at all now
you can add any of your favorite video
or audio shows check out the top
podcasts that people listen or watch
there's a really good one I recommend
called the Apple buy it now you can also
search for specific ones or manually add
the feed link for the podcast now I like
the ability to create specific playlists
for your different podcasts so I'll
break mine out into topics like sports
news and comedy and there's a variety of
settings for each playlist that you make
now during playback you'll be able to
listen at different speeds and scrub
through the episode like you can with
iOS is media player but one of my
favorites is the quick skip buttons that
allow you to jump forward or backwards
through the podcast easily plus you can
even set a sleep timer on the podcast
now you also get iCloud syncing so all
of your podcasts subscriptions and
playlists will be synced up across
multiple iOS devices Booya so see
there's really no competition and
downcast is the best podcast player app
on iOS that you never heard of until now
now if you guys have any other apps
you'd like us to tap send them to tap
that app at cnet.com i'm brian Tana
thanks for watching I will see you guys
next time oh oh oh oh that song just
takes control of my body
alright guys we told you to answer some
of your emails on our show so let's just
jump into them the first one is from
Peter O'Callahan and he asks I'm in the
market for a 13-inch MacBook Air what
are your thoughts on the Retina screen
should I hold off or purchase one of the
newly updated models personally I would
be okay with getting the current
generation I don't expect them to
release a red
display in the next six months because
really they don't need to and it will be
a good marketing push to tout the Retina
display with the next update next up
Richard Mendoza says Brian you make me
want to be a better man you're welcome
John Sartain us why haven't we heard
anything about the iPod Touch when is it
coming out or have they discontinued it
John
early September is the music refresh
time period and will most likely see a
combination of iPhone and iPod refresh
is so sit tight for that next up
Erwin writes in with hey Brian I'm just
a typical teenage boy who doesn't have a
good-paying job and really wants a Mac I
think you should do a competition to win
a new gen Mac Pro or Mac Pro Retina
display for your viewers 18 and under
take this into consideration
Erwin once I find three thousand plus
dollars to give away you know and Scott
Weaver writes in with things he wants to
see Brian delivering the Apple byte
shirtless well Scott here's your wish
come true
there you go all right guys that's gonna
do it for this week's show email us at
the Apple bite at cnet.com i'm brian tom
thanks for watching I'll catch you guys
next time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
