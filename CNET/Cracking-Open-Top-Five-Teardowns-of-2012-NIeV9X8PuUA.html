thousand dollar desktop we've cracked
open a lot of tech this year and as we
do at the end of each year it's time to
take a look at a few of our favorites a
humble Detweiler and during this special
episode of cracking open I'm counting
down my top five tear downs of 2012
first on our list in the fifth spot is
the nokia lumia 900 now released in the
spring this Windows Phone device was
Nokia's attempt to recapture some of the
American smartphone market unfortunately
as we discovered during our tear down
the phone's hardware just wasn't up to
par with the competition I went so far
as to call it mediocre now so why did I
include our 900 tear down on this list
because it's probably this year's best
example of why knowing what's inside a
device is an important factor in whether
you buy one or not just two months after
releasing the Lumia 900 we learned that
it wouldn't be upgradeable to Windows
Phone 8 and despite huge marketing
pushes from Nokia Microsoft and AT&amp;amp;T
including a 50-percent price cut just
three months after launch the phone
never took off like the phone's hardware
sales were just mediocre in the fourth
spot is one of the most expensive items
I've ever cracked open a seven thousand
dollar plus HP z1 workstation the z1 was
unlike any other all-in-one on the
market it was packed with high-end
hardware and designed to be both upgrade
and repair friendly it's unique stand
let the Machine lie flat for easy
hardware access and the case opened more
like the hood of a car than a computer
you can remove most of the internal
components without using tools and
despite having six cooling fans it was
remarkably quiet this machine was
definitely one of the most unique and
enjoyable cracking opens of 2012
third on our list is the highly
anticipated google nexus 7 assembled by
a sous the first Google design tablet
had solid hardware a good design and a
great price 199 dollars us as I
discovered it was also a snap to crack
open and had easily replaceable hardware
now even with the release of the kindle
fire HD ipad mini and nook HD CNET's
eric franklin still believes that
overall the Nexus 7 is the best small
tablet you can buy and I agree the
second spot on our list is held by
another highly anticipated tablet
Microsoft's surface with Windows RT
Microsoft's first Windows 8 tablet came
with a quad-core Tegra 3 processor 2
gigs of RAM and several nice features
like a micro SD card slot full-size USB
port and a handy kickstand unfortunately
it was also a pain to crack open and
disassemble as I wrote in my original
review hopefully the surface with
windows pro which is aimed at businesses
will be more repair friendly well we've
reached the end of my top tear downs
list and sitting in the top spot is
Apple's 15-inch MacBook Pro with Retina
display now unfortunately like the Lumia
900 this machine is on my list for all
the wrong reasons now like all macbook
pros the retina version is well-built
has solid hardware and its display
really is gorgeous but as I discovered
during my tear down it's almost
impossible to upgrade thanks to ram
that's soldered to the motherboard and
it's a pain to work on thanks to tamper
resistant pentalobe screws and a battery
that's glued to the upper half of the
case now this was another example of why
knowing how a device is put together and
what's inside it is critical when buying
one the last thing you want to do is
find out a year after you bought your
retina MacBook Pro that you can't
upgrade the memory well that does it for
my countdown of the top 5 cracking open
teardown

open even more of the latest tech Hine
