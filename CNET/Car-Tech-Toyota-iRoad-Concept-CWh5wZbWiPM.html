cnet.com on the floor at the 2013 Geneva
Motor Show and we're taking a look at
the car that I want to drive the most
today it's the Toyota I Road concept now
this little electric vehicle is about
the size of your average motorcycle
there's actually space in this vehicle
for two despite it being so narrow and
that's because you use a tandem seating
style the driver sits up front and one
passenger can fit behind them sort of
like you would on a motorcycle now each
of those front wheels is powered by a
two kilowatt electric motor the gift of
energy from a lithium-ion battery pack
inside the body of the vehicle the
interesting thing about this is that
unlike most vehicles that you drive on
the road today and most motorcycles it
actually does it steering with the rear
wheel so when you turn the yoke that in
the front of the driver's seat the rear
wheel kind of counter steers to kind of
suit your body around now in a normal
vehicle that's this narrow that could be
a little scary and you could find
yourself flipping over but the eye road
actually has a fifth of called active
can burn that uses little motors that
are in the front suspension to sort of
tilt the vehicle into the turn like you
would on a motorcycle when you see a
race driver sort of drop it a knee that
gives you that extra grip in the turn
when you're cornering really hard now
we've been watching the demonstrators
here just kind of whipping around in
like very very tight circles that sort
of rear-wheel steering plus active
camber give this car an extremely small
turning radius that's great for in the
city when you need to do things like
squeeze in a tiny parking spot and flip
quick u-turn now the Toyota I Road
concept is just that just a concept
there are no actual plans to build this
vehicle and sell it just yet but I'll
tell you what it is as I said the
vehicle that I want to drive the most on
the floor that Geneva Motor Show today
I've been answer one good win with
cnet.com and we've been taking a look at
the Toyota I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
