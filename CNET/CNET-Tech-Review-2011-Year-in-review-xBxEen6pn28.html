time for our 2011 year in review join us
as we examine the highlights and low
points we saw this year in the
technology world are you still glad you
bought an ipad 2 or an iphone 4s
wondering why you're still holding on to
your netflix subscription we'll look
back at a kooky camera that you don't
have to focus complain again about yet
another facebook redesign and say a
final goodbye to a beloved visionary
it's all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Molly wood and welcome
to the Cena tech review year in review
for 2011 normally on the show we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech plus offer our own unique
tech wisdom in the form of the bottom
line will kind of do that this time but
instead of a week's worth of product and
news we'll do a whole year of the most
notable gadgets good and bad and the
news stories that we saw this year now
we have a lot to get through so let's
start things off with the good the year
started off hot with one of the most
anticipated devices of the previous year
while every other tablet maker was
struggling to play catch-up and we'll
get to that later Apple came out of the
gate with the ipad 2 and crushed it
we're going to introduce today ipad 2
the second generation ipad our own
Donald bell called it predictable and
awesome with it's much thinner design
faster processor and front facing camera
plus of course the little magnetic cover
that rocked our collective tech world
for me the reason I keep coming back to
the ipad is the apps there's really no
beating the selection and the quality of
the stuff you can download here at
launch their over 65,000 apps designed
specifically for the large screen of the
ipad no one else has that and it's a key
part of what keeps the ipad fresh and
fun thinner lighter faster there's more
carriers more colors more cameras and
more apps and you'll ever need if you're
looking for the best all-around tablet
this is the one obviously the ipad 2
wasn't the only huge apple release of
the year months of speculation about
iphone 5 brought us to the big reveal in
october and it was not the iphone 5 i'm
really pleased to tell you today all
about the brand new iphone 4s
man listen to that half-hearted applause
the mass is how old about the unchanged
design the lack of 4G and all of that
but despite that initial disappointment
and of course some pesky battery
troubles out of the gate iphone 4s
turned out to be pretty darn good iOS 5
added much-needed improvements the
camera is spectacular and the voice
assistant Siri became everybody's
favorite punchline Easter Egg generator
and occasionally even assistant who's
your daddy you are can we get back to
work now in other phone stories
Microsoft got serious about its mobile
platform in 2011 and unveiled the
massive update Windows Phone mango it
didn't have Siri but Microsoft promised
there were 500 improvements in there we
like the spiffy tiled interface features
like group contacts threaded messaging
and unified in boxes and there were some
pretty impressive Bing search features
it's attractive it's usable and we
expect mango to be a contender in 2012
and beyond there are still some snags
here and there and the platform may not
be ready to conquer the smartphone world
but it is much closer than it was before
in other notable developments in 2011
Google got serious about social very
serious about social as Larry Page took
the reins as CEO he tied the bonuses of
just about every employee to social
success and took aim at Facebook with a
new social network called google plus it
took many of Facebook's favorite
features and added granular privacy
controls in the form of drag and drop
circles the key social concept of
Google+ is the circle you can create
circles for the different parts of your
life your work your family your friends
your hobbies and then to keep you from
getting overwhelmed by all your contact
social updates you can watch just what's
happening in particular circles by using
streams so if you're in the mood to see
what's going on with your family you
just check out your family stream at
this stage in the game Google+ is
getting huge traffic but Facebook is
proving just as hard to kill as it ever
was although they did themselves a
little damage we'll get to that in the
back meanwhile in other big trends of 20
it was the year of the music services
amazon spotify and google music are all
trying to win you on to their individual
music clouds amazon started it off in
march with a cloud drive and a cloud
player that lets you upload all your
tunes to amazon server and then stream
them from anywhere of course by the time
we uploaded all that music and it took a
while spotify arrived stateside with the
ability to subscribe and then play any
song anytime minus the uploading and
then just as we got used to spotify
google came along with google music
cloud storage locker streaming plus some
staff recommendations how adorably your
2000 it does have good sharing though
including one full song share with your
Google+ friends it's an abundance of
riches in the music world in fact I
think at this point I might be using
some combination of all three of those
exhausting but if you were bored by yet
another version of cloud storage and a
digital music locker Along Came some all
new technology mid-year to get us
excited about of all things cameras I
mean look at this thing hey guys Brian
song here with Cena TV and we have a
first look at the electro camera this is
the first ever a light field camera now
you see this design it's really unique
it's not a traditional camera because
this camera does not do traditional
things the light field technology and
the Lytro promises to capture all the
information in an image you don't need
to focus and then you create a full 3d
image that you can manipulate later no
matter what I take right now after the
fact I'll be able to choose what I want
to focus on um awesome i pre-ordered the
blue one and it had better ship in
February like they say and finally here
in the good we went into the year
talking tablets no surprise were leaving
the year talking tablets ipad 2 may have
kicked things off but by year's end all
we could talk about were the kindle fire
and surprisingly the HP TouchPad with
the fire announcement amazon put the
tablet world on notice announcing a
hundred ninety nine dollar device that
doesn't try to be an ipad it tries to be
an e-reader a movie viewer and a basic
web surfing device all time to emma's
and all for a hundred ninety-nine bucks
at that price I think it's a slam dunk
you're getting more entertainment
options than on barnes &amp;amp; noble's nook
tablet more screen than Apple's 199
dollar ipod touch and an ease of use
you're really not going to find at any
price now speaking of low-priced tablets
the HP TouchPad was just another ipad
competitor when it launched early in the
year in fact it felt more like an ipad
one competitor than an ipad 2 competitor
but when HP killed off the touchpad just
a few months after it went on the market
and then started selling it for 99 bucks
it suddenly became the must-have tablet
of the year it rocketed to the number
two best-selling tablet after the iPad
what a difference of four hundred dollar
price cut makes on friday after HP's
announcement that it was going to
discontinue its touch pad tablet the
company announced an inventory fire sale
touch pads began liquidating at
retailers around the country for just
ninety nine dollars for the 16 gigabyte
version and a hundred and forty nine
dollars for the 32 gigabyte version the
nation's largest electronics retailer
bestbuy reversed itself when it decided
to join the cell rather than just return
shipments back to HP I've been trying to
pick up one of those $99 touch pads for
months now I am still holding out hope
and I'm exhausted already but we haven't
even gotten to the juicy stuff in the
bad yet so before we do let's take a
quick break we'll be back with more Cena
tech review right after this
welcome back to the cnet tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at cnet TV this
week we're taking a look back at the
tech year that was 2011 we've seen a lot
of great stuff so far but it wasn't all
good news this year as you'll see in our
look back at the bad let's be honest
2011 was the year of the also-ran tablet
the motorola xoom kicked off the android
tablet fanfare in march but its high
price and buggy honeycomb installation
kept it in the niche category tablet
after tablet followed remember some of
these names lenovo ideapad k1 the Vizio
tablet the sony s tablet that was
actually kind of cool the lenovo ideapad
a10 sheba thrives 7 inch tablet the
asuste iconia tab a501 4g on 18 t the
asus eee pad slider s101 only the
Samsung Galaxy Tab line had any traction
at all but Samsung spent the whole year
fighting patent infringement lawsuits
from Apple and of course there was the
ill-fated blackberry playbook which best
did not even speak of it the top of the
PlayBook is a sour note for me there's a
headphone jack and a pair of stereo mics
that's fine but the power button if you
can see it is this little teeny tiny
thing made for baby fingers it's also
the button you'll need to use for waking
the screen out of sleep mode so you'll
have to contend with it every day
frankly I think the asuste transformer
prime could turn it all around though go
check out that review at seen at tv.com
bad tech news dominated 2011 as a
massive earthquake and tsunami brought
devastation in Japan it killed thousands
it brought the country to the brink of
nuclear disaster and the effects on
global manufacturing are still being
felt stateside we said goodbye to the
u.s. manned space shuttle mission with
final voyages by discovery and Atlantis
then again at the end of the year
scientists noticed a potentially
earth-like planet in the habitable zone
so maybe we'll be back in spacecraft
sooner than expected and crazy times at
some big-name companies HP abruptly
killed off its webOS division and
announced plans to spin off the pc unit
then the board can the guy who came up
with that crazy idea after hiring that
guy and installed meg whitman in his
place at press time whitman was still
trying to decide what to do with webos
and presumably the rest of the company
wow it was a rough year for Netflix to
first the company announced in july that
it would hike prices around sixty
percent and try to push more users
towards streaming only plans users
revolted and quit not surprisingly the
concept of a roughly seventy percent
price hike for DVDs and streaming made
people who are addicted to TV and movies
lose their minds the netflix facebook
page is filled with angry messages from
people who say they're canceling their
service I mean I'm sorry Netflix that's
just you know I love you I'm just not
sure that I'm in love with you like I
was and I guess I just think maybe it's
time to start seeing other people then
Netflix said it was split into two
companies and the second one quick stir
would handle DVDs while Netflix just did
streaming users were bolted and quit the
online streaming service will keep the
netflix name if you're confused and
annoyed from the changes Netflix is well
aware the company co-founder and CEO
Reed Hastings is responding to thousands
of angry comments on the netflix blog
after writing an apology and explanation
about the decision saying this is a move
to help strengthen the selection of
shows on the streaming service finally
Netflix announced that it was really
really sorry and would stay together
after all price hike and all users
revolted and quit Netflix said it would
continue to operate one website for both
services CEO Reed Hastings said in a
statement consumers value the simplicity
netflix has always offered and we
respect that there is a difference
between moving quickly which netflix has
done very well for years and moving too
fast which is what we did in this case
like I said bad year for Netflix also a
pretty bad year for Sony which was
hacked over and over again all spring
the worst attack took down the
PlayStation Network exposed the user
information for some 70 million people
and may have exposed credit card data as
help security analysts say this breach
is one of the top five in history
identity theft is a serious concern and
you should pretty much not trust any
email that you receive from anyone for I
don't know like the rest of your life
especially after the whole epsilon thing
a couple of weeks ago oh and no as usual
there's really nothing you can do here
except sue as part of a massive class
action lawsuit and then six years from
now you'll get a check for about three
dollars sometimes the cloud kind of
sucks it took so knee some two weeks to
restore partial service about a month to
get psn fully up and running and then it
was hacked again in September plus there
were smaller hacks on Sony sites around
the world for weeks in fact summer 2011
was the summer of the hacker anonymous
was constantly in the news along with
its splinter group losec which actually
took responsibility for the Sony hack
lil sec also defaced the PBS website
hacked Nintendo and even messed with
Rupert Murdoch the news of the world
scandal has brought the hacker group
lols sec out of retirement News
Corporation newspaper the sun's homepage
was attacked and directed visitors to a
fake article claiming that CEO Rupert
Murdoch was dead later the sun's website
redirected to lull sex twitter feed
taking a step even further the hacker
group then tweeted the name and phone
number of a son online editor and two
others associated with the company
although the group was mostly vapor by
the end of the year after increasing
international heat and multiple arrests
now we would be remiss if we didn't take
a poke at Mark Zuckerberg in our
year-end wrap up Facebook's f8
conference brought us the big fancy new
timeline and Open Graph the seamless
sharing that means that in the future
every time you listen to a song read an
article comments on a post watch a movie
pick your nose it will get Auto posted
to Facebook Oh 2012 year of Google+ and
after a sea of bad news October brought
us news that will change the tech world
forever
on October for 2011 Steve Jobs died
she is only comes around once I know
couple centuries so like this so sing
banks and rusted piece
I don't really think that words can
really describe like anything about
Steve other than just greatness it's
just right to do you know to respect a
guy who had given the world so much like
in terms of Technology and you know
rejuvenated a company that was on the
edge of disaster just feel incredibly
sad I think the world over us lost a
really incredible man and a visionary
and he will be he'll be deeply missed
he's just one of the best minds of our
generation I mean it's there's no other
way to say I mean he's so affected our
generation so and those younger than me
much you know so deeply because it's
just changed the way they've all
communicated with each other so I can't
there's really there isn't really words
to express how much each change society
it's incredible
the bottom line for 2012 r.i.p steve
jobs what's next for apple is it an
opportunity for some other company or
will Steve's legacy carry apples
dominance into the next year and beyond
it's hard to say but as the steve jobs
biography started popping up in
everyone's hands at the end of 2011 it
was pretty clear the tech world just
wouldn't be quite the same so there you
have it we've reached the end of the
show and the end of another year but
come back next week for an all-new Cena
tech review until then there are tons of
great videos available every day at cnet
TV com I'll see you next time and thank
you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
