welcome to the Apple by 4 2012 it's all
the good stuff the bad stuff and
everything inside the world of Apple and
you know we'll keep bringing it for you
all year now it's a fresh new year and
multiple reports claim that Apple is
planning an event for late January to be
held in New York but what if you just
got an ipad for Christmas should you be
worried well hold on to your butts all
things D says the event will not be
large you won't see an ipad 3 or an
apple TV but the event might focus on
education and digital textbooks now
macrumors reports that promotional video
interviews were shot with textbook
executives last a month and good reader
reports that apple is planning to launch
a self publishing program using the
popular epub format now that will all
only run on the ipad 3 okay well that's
not true but since we're talking iPad is
the perfect time to show you the
obligatory Hey look at this new leaked
ipad 3 part that looks like a red
display but I can't really tell but it
has a different connector from the one
on top so it must be a real part alright
let's take that all in now edita times
also says apple plans to expand its
lineup by adding models for the high-end
segment and the mid-range while still
offering the ipad 2 with a price point
as low as 2 99 after analysts estimates
believe the 199 kindle fire potentially
took away one to two million ipad sales
this holiday season away from Apple
keeping the iPad around just like
they've done with the iphone 3gs while
the Foresters on the market makes sense
but this is also the same digit times
that said to all new iPads will debut
this month at macworld the event that
Apple no longer participates in all
right let's just show you a quick little
how-to right now because over the years
you know I'm a big fan of those icon
characters called emoji that trick girls
into thinking you're a funny and
sensitive guy now they're available for
free for anyone using iOS 5 now and all
you have to do is go into your settings
then general then keyboards if you
haven't already add a new keyboard and
find emoji and select it now once it's
been added if you type a text message or
an email to someone click on the globe
icon to access the emoji keyboard and
they'll be able to see the different
smiley faces the custom hearts and even
farts that you
into them and you also get girls saying
oh how'd you do that and you can tell me
how that first day went thanks to your
emoji icons alright in other news Apple
TV users have been hoping to run iOS
apps through their Apple TV and over the
break developers Steven trounce myth and
the Mudkip have hacked it to run the
apps at full resolution using their own
custom home screen and a jailbroken
Apple TV now the hack isn't available
yet but it's a proof of concept and at
one time Steve Jobs did say that the
Apple TV apps or could launch when the
time is right now also Apple and Samsung
continue to go back and forth with their
patent lawsuits over the design of the
galaxy tab 10.1 and it gets Messier
every month but it's not scaring Samsung
at all after they unveiled their updated
entry-level phone called the samsung
galaxy ace plus and it looks almost
exactly like the iphone 3gs and finally
our show would it be complete without
another Steve Jobs figure that's eerily
realistic and honestly kind of scary now
the people from in icons I've decided to
make the SI figure look as realistic as
possible and come in a packaging that
looks just like the biography includes a
full Apple and partially eaten apple a
wooden chair and changeable hands now it
will sell for ninety-nine dollars but I
know one thing the real steve definitely
didn't have ball joints for wrists are
ads going to do for this we show will be
at CES 2012 next week so don't panic if
we're away for the week email us at the
apple byte at cnet com i'm brian Tong
thanks for watching we'll catch you next
time for another bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
