with CNET and this is the nikon d610
given that the d610 is nearly identical
to the d600 it should be unsurprising
that i still really like the models
design in operation I enjoy shooting
with it it's a little bit lighter than
other full-frame DSLR bodies but not ILC
bodies like the sony a7r series and it's
constructed from a magnesium alloy
chassis covered in polycarbonate with
moderate dust and weather sealing the
camera's exposure and release mode dials
both have locks one in the center and
one adjacent as with canons designs I
don't really like the lock button in the
center as I find it a little awkward to
operate single-handed that way there are
two user setting slots on the mode dial
which is nice but I prefer three also
I'm not a big fan of the tiny top record
buttons and I'm a little disappointed
that you can't program one of the
buttons on the back for this function as
with other modern Nikon models there are
two programmable buttons to the right
side of the lens viewfinder is really
nice it's big and bright with the useful
overlaid grid that's in many of nikons
dslr's you can assign one of the buttons
to activate a digital level in the
viewfinder that uses the exposure bars
which I like but I wish I didn't have to
toggle between that and the typical
exposure information and that there was
a vertical indicator as well for front
and back tilt although it's missing
desirable features like Wi-Fi and GPS
the d610 does have a full complement of
shooting options unlike the Canon 6d it
has a built-in flash while I don't
recommend using on-camera flash it's
useful in a pinch and it enables
in-camera control of wireless flash it
also gets props for dual SD card slots
and a headphone jack other features the
6d disappointingly lacks it retains
Nikon staples like time-lapse shooting
and an intervalometer plus it offers
clean and uncompressed HDMI output which
was first offered by the d800 for some
however the biggest advantage the d610
immediately offers over the 6d is the
ability to use all variations of both DX
with aps-c cropping of course as well as
FX lenses with one exception
the d610 still delivers terrific photo
quality it produces relatively clean
image data at low
and mid-range ISO sensitivities and is
very smart JPEG and noise reduction
algorithms JPEG images are generally
quite useable through ISO 1600 depending
upon the scene and lighting you can
probably push it a size ISO 6400 though
I'd recommend working with raw to be on
the safe side with the d610 nikon has
changed the shutter mechanism which
enables a continuous shooting quiet mode
which is nice and Nikon also says that
they tweaked the white balance for bluer
skies and better skin tones like most
full-frame cameras the d610 produces
photos with a nice natural sharpness and
tonality it renders a broad dynamic
range although there's a lot less
recoverable detail and clipped
highlights than with more expensive
models the camera does very well with
shadow detail though the d610 is pretty
much fast enough to handle most things
that you throw at it and it's a bit
faster than the d600 live view autofocus
is still cumbersome and slow though and
the LCD is really hard to view in direct
sunlight relatively inexpensive smartly
designed fast and with generally
excellent photo quality the Nikon d610
makes a compelling case for upgrading to
a full-frame camera I'm Laurie brunnen
and this is the nikon d610</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
