that attaches to the front of your belly
if you're a pregnant woman and basically
tracks the muscle movements it will tell
you when you're having contractions and
if they are contractions that you don't
really need to worry about that our pre
labor or if they're actually signaling
that you're going into real labor now
bloom life isn't FDA approved and so
that means it's not going to give you
any kind of diagnostic information it's
not going to give you anything more than
you would get with a normal stopwatch
measuring the time between contractions
and the length of contractions to know
whether they're actually leading up to
labor so because of its price tag of
$149 plus the slowly diminishing fee
every month after that for the continued
service of the app and the customer
service it really isn't a very
economical choice to buy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
