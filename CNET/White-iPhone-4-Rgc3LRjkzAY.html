cnet.com and it's a big day here in the
studio because we actually have the
white iPhone yes it's the white iPhone 4
we've waited so long for it months and
months and months and well you probably
waited so long that you might not even
care at this point but we're gonna show
it to you later just because it has been
so talked about and we still don't know
why it took Apple so long to introduce
this device we've heard that it could
have been the proximity sensor we also
heard a rumor on the 3GS there was some
discoloration on the white iPhone so we
never know but this device is finally
here we're gonna show it to you of
course it is exactly the same we are
showing a Verizon phone here and AT&amp;amp;T
Verizon will both offer the white iPhone
and of course the only differences will
be what network it runs on features are
exactly the same on the black iPhone 4
so it's gonna have the camera it's gonna
have iTunes connectivity it's gonna have
the iPod player it's gonna have the
browser everything that you'd expect on
that phone is gonna be there and there
are no cosmetic differences except for
the white color you will notice a line
up here the black iPhone hatch has that
as well you just can't see it because
like the skin of the phone it's also
black you have to hold it up to the
light to really see that line but that's
the only thing that's different this is
the Verizon iPhone so of course there is
that extra line here in the antenna but
again that's the only differences you're
gonna see starting with the earlier
iPhones I've never been such a fan of
the white models but I know a lot of
people have been so it's great that you
can now have the option to buy it of
course it doesn't have a unicorn horn on
it you might be waiting for that because
a lot of people call this a tech unicorn
but it does just doesn't have that
unicorn horn on the back
I thought the back looked a little
cheaper than the black iPhone it's just
a real subjective thing that I saw you
may not agree but just didn't like the
skin quite as much the upside though is
the back won't show fingerprints as
easily as the black iPhone gets smudgy
really quickly and you're not gonna see
that here now there's been a lot of
controversy over whether the I white
iPhone is actually thicker than the
black model some blogs have posted
photos they do see a difference even
though it's maybe point two millimeters
which is hardly anything and other blogs
and news reports have said it's no
difference
check the video where we actually take
the phone down to a place in San
Francisco they can measure things really
really accurately down to even smaller
than a millimeter so we'll see if that's
actually true but for right now I don't
see any difference we also heard that
the white iPhone doesn't accommodate the
standard cases or bump
that Apple's actually put out well Apple
was good enough to send us a white
bumper where she can use any bumper
you'd like and you know when I snapped
it on I didn't think it went on any more
difficult than on the black iPhone I
also didn't see a difference when I
tried using this other case that I
currently use on a black iPhone 4 it
snapped on just as easily as well so I
think even if it is a little bit bigger
I don't think it's a big deal and be
honest with you I'm sure that when you
make a bunch of products like that
sometimes there are very very slight
differences to come out of the
production line but overall the white
iPhone exactly the same as I said may
not be your cup of tea but it's finally
finally here and if you don't care and
I'm sure there's a lot of you out there
that don't well it's here anyway for you
I'm Kent German and this is the white
iPhone 4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
