I'll be back for a while so let's get
into all the good and bad inside the
world of Apple now it's impossible to
avoid the iPhone 4 fever and it all
started on launch day so let's check out
some of the action from San Francisco
that wrapped around three whole sides of
a city block
Brad Tom here with cnet.com at the
launch for iPhone 4 these people have
been here what since 3:00 a.m. or so
that's 30 hours it's very Center you
guys right for this thing the phone I
have right now is the phone I've had for
five years it's like an LG it's really
old cover fell off every time I try to
use it shuts off it can only store 50
messages and do nothing more so this guy
Chris right here was the first person in
line he's been wonderful a few days and
I actually saw some of the blog's that
he had been awaiting here he had
reserved a spot ahead of him and he
reserved a spot through a site called
Airbnb and I had actually went through
the site and took that reservation I
paid $400 for how long have you been
here
and then a minute would you rather be
here in line or doing something else so
I think the most frustrating thing about
today is that I just came here to get
new ear buds I've been here since 5:00
a.m. yesterday yeah 5 mm since yesterday
so I'm number 5 or 6 if someone comes up
to me and just told me here I'll give
you $1,000 I would give to them
but they give me like 800 I would still
do it so what are you most interested
about with this iPhone where you guys
from Alabama well we wanted to be here
for the Apple experience you know in San
Francisco so very proud to be here I
tried to pre-order couldn't get it on a
pre-order all right guys this line
extends around two city blocks I'm here
at approximately the three hour mark
that's three I'm gonna sit down for a
little while oh yeah this is set
processor booths two cameras HD video
hello yes that's the first thing I'm
gonna do I just need to find a lady with
a 4G okay you guys got your phones how
do you feel I'm so emotionally drained
we live in a loft so I'm gonna FaceTime
her from downstairs while she's upstairs
that sounds dirty oh yeah oh yeah baby
Oh next thing you know he's gonna talk
about his Oh face time yeah I know I
have issues now early reviewers are
touting the iPhone as the best phone
they've ever seen
but maybe getting their phone a week
early got them a little too excited
videos flooded the internet showing some
of Apple's new baby losing signal bars
or even dropping calls when covering the
left-hand corner with your hand your
hand it's the thing that we use to hold
phones now apparently bridging the gap
between the two antennas with conductive
material like a key or even your skin is
enough to affect the signal SJ even
responded to a customer's email saying
non-issue just avoid holding it that way
okay that's a total BS response if I've
heard one now it isn't happening to
every phone but bloggers have found a
solution
Apple's bumper case you know it's that
$29 rubberband they're selling now I
actually have some right here and they
are free now that's not all other people
are also discovering yellow spots and
bands of discoloration on their iPhone
four screens
according to Gizmodo Apple's told
customers that it's residue from the
manufacturing process and the yellow
spots should clear up in a few days
under sounds like my blanket in sixth
grade now count them up that's two black
guys for Apple on launch day and both
are worthy of some real nasty bad apples
but it's not stopping Apple from selling
an estimated 1.5 million phones in the
first day that's just ridiculous now
just think of all those people waiting
in those three plus hour lines ho
to be a trendsetter at their local
swimming pool with the all-white iPhone
4
Apple announced the white version will
be delayed until the second half of July
due to some manufacturing issues after
those people align it sucks to be you
but it might be July until you get
through that line anyways alright if you
didn't get an iPhone you weren't left
out of the party because iOS 4 was
released last week so we're bringing you
some tips that you might not know about
many of you have loaded your iPhone or
iPod Touch with the latest iOS 4 and
you're playing around with all the new
features like multitasking and folders
but there are a lot of hidden gems you
might not know about in the settings
with the latest OS you now have the
ability to turn off your cell phone data
usage while still using the phone just
for calls and text messages all you have
to do is go into your settings and then
general and then network and you'll see
the cellular data option and this is a
big deal for people who want to save
data now I'm messaging on my phone a lot
and there's a couple new features here
as well go to your messages settings and
then you can turn on the character
account function if you're on a tight
text message plan you'll be able to tell
if you're about to go over the character
limit and avoid an extra message from
being sent you also have the ability to
search through your messages so if you
don't see it just pull down to reveal
the search bar type in a word and voila
there are your messages with that word
in them and while we're talking about
search when using the universal search
in iOS 4 when you type in a word you now
have the ability to search the web or
Wikipedia for that term now let's shift
over to photos your pictures can be
organized into albums but if you sync
your iPhone with Apple's iPhoto your
pictures can also be organized by faces
and places and it's just kind of fun to
see where your pictures have been taken
on a map moving it around and looking at
all of them and any pictures in your
camera roll that you decide to email
right after you hit the send button
you'll see a prompt that lets you choose
the size of the picture that you can
send off I'm Brian Todd for cnet.com and
there's still more iOS secrets we have
for you and you might even find some for
yourself so use them wisely
thank you really smart guy now we also
have another set of tips on CNN TV so
check those out as well now Steve Jobs
told us that iPhone 3G owners wouldn't
have all the i/os for features like
multitasking but who would have guessed
that custom wallpapers would be too much
for the 3G to handle because those
intense animations just really slowed
down the user experience
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show i'm brian tong you can send
your emails to the apple by de escena
comm with your iphone for reactions both
positive and negative thanks for
watching we'll see you guys next week
for another bite of the Apple yeah no no
I can hear you perfectly fine I'm
supposed to hold it this way that's what
Steve said yeah perfect okay cool</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
