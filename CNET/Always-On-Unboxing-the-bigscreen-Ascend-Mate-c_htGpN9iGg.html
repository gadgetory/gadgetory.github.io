love a big phone yes this phone may test
my love a big this is the big of
the big phones to see the big phones big
brother you can see there's a hint we
have a phablet added tablet to compare
it to it's gonna fit somewhere in the
middle we think I think so inside this
box is the huawei ascend mate which we
first got eyes on actually I saw it at
CES yeah I saw it at Barcelona at the
Mobile World Congress i really liked
what i saw that i did too because i love
a big phone but this phone let me just
put it this way it's a 6.1 inch display
that's right yeah if taking half a foot
of vomit oh my god that should be on the
market half a foot upon I'll put a phone
inside this box uh move it there we go
holy moly that's a big phone like look
at the pound takes up every square
centimeter of space here that's huge
look at that seriously five years ago we
would make fun of people if they had
that you don't I mean that's like five
years your food is so primitive like
brutally mock this look at that the
difference the note you know the note 2
and the LG optimus g pro are basically
the biggest phones on the market right
now yeah tell nah it's almost it's
almost a full cabin godzirra okay i can
pay attention ok so here you take that
let's see what else is in the box here
whoa do I look weird it's not for
talking how many times are you able to
do this ok oh look they give us a little
recycle your old mobile phone bag hmm
cute listen no that's the one that's the
one who broke
okay what else is in here yeah take the
plastic off we have an appropriately
keeg hunt a power brick oh it is Gigante
we have some headphones which also look
comically oversized to me but maybe it's
just the theme is at this point yeah
like I think it's here look at this huge
ESP dog on the back come on yeah micro
USB charger and that is it there's some
politics about this phone then we're
gonna get to in a minute before that
we're gonna turn it on and do some specs
the huawei ascend mate runs android 4.1
jelly bean although for reasons we'll
get to later you're probably gonna want
to root it immediately and put stock
android on it it has a 1.5 gigahertz
quad-core processor and has a really big
4050 milliamp per hour battery the
company says that this phone could go
two days on a single charge I would be
astonished but we will test it that
screen really is huge 6.1 inches at 1280
by 720 it has two gigs of on-board ram a
front-facing 1 megapixel camera and a
rear-facing 8 megapixel camera I'm
thinking they could have just put some
mega pixels from the back on the front
the Ascend mate has 16 gigs of on-board
storage but it's expandable via micro SD
card slot it comes in white and black
and you'll probably only be able to get
it unlocked at six hundred dollars so i
have to say after playing with this for
just a few minutes you're not impressed
I'm not that impressed the keyboard
seems laggy the performance seems a
little bit slow and actually all of that
is fine because it's probably spying on
me yes it seems that you're not gonna be
able to get that phone because of
concerns about the Chinese government
involvement this is really interesting
cuz we got all excited about the rise of
Chinese phone makers yeah but there are
some lawmakers in the u.s. trying to ban
these phones they will not have US
carrier contract so there's no way
you're gonna get it with a discount
and like I mentioned earlier some people
are saying online that even if you get
one you probably want to put stock
android on it right yeah that's pretty
surprising so there's like a lot of
barriers to jump through but you know if
you just have to have the hugest phone
out there the good news is they're not
getting much information with that one
peg megapixel camera on the front that's
really true but they're getting nothing
you can't even deposit a check with a 1
megapixel camera that is lame</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
