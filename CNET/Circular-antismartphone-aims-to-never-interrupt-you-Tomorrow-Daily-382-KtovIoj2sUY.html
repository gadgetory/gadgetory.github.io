you out with some headlines there is a
3d printed self-driving bus that someone
has let loose on the streets of
washington DC ollie was made by local
motors and it's got some neat tricks of
its leaves there's an app that allows
passengers to summon ollie for pickup
and drop off and thirty sensors onboard
which collect data from every trip it
can analyze the data quickly things to
help from IBM's Watson technology and
then make decisions about traveling and
even answer passenger requests in the
future Ollie can be printed and
assembled in about eleven hours total
which is an impressive feat and Local
Motors plans to make micro factories
around the world to supply these little
buses to major metropolitan cities this
is the future of metro travel I think so
I mean I think self-driving cars that
you can summon I have it take you taxi
you ever need to go and then go and pick
up the next fare is really that's the
future of metropolitan travel but it's
even cooler because it seems like
they're so easy eleven hours to build a
car that's so fast so fast
that's wild it's incredible I love that
there it's actually in use that's my
favorite we don't have to wait it's here
pretty good well you have to wait at the
bus stop that's true that's a good point
well made uh if you thought to yourself
smartphones are not gonna change from
this square rectangular boringness you
were wrong check out runcible runcible
is a circular phone meant to remind
users of other similar yet more
traditional devices like the pocket
watch
not only is its shape hoping to disrupt
the marketplace its function is to run
simple doesn't have a notification
system and is designed to never
interrupt you you can make calls with it
you can take pictures with it you can
surf the web with it and get directions
with it but runcible isn't made to do
much more than that they're still in
design and testing mode but if you want
an early adopter version you can back a
runcible for $399 on indiegogo what's
use case for this thing I want my phone
interrupt me I mean I know it's annoying
sometimes but sometimes I need to get
interrupted by some people don't want
that they get very annoyed by
notifications
I think we're power users like we forget
most people have one email account they
don't have to check it all the time they
don't need to be immediately up to date
on everything and this would be kind of
a nice alternative and they have a sort
of recycled plastic backs and also I
just find that circular form factor
really yeah new form factors for phones
I think is really gonna shake things up
everything looks like an iPhone now well
and before that it you know phones look
now that their phones they look like
little TVs so it's we got it we're gonna
switch it up I like it we are not having
a long show this week yeah I'll be at
VidCon Oh moderating some panels doing
excitement so if you're an Anaheim you
can get four hours of Ashley escapa over
the weekend at VidCon you're more than
what even my four hours that's not
nearly enough oh thank you I appreciate

about the show this week use hashtag hey

poly wrote in and sent these two photos
and says hello wanted to share this
photo is the first ever selfie that
might then ten-year-old son Nathan ever
took we were at Mount Rushmore and he
saw his older brother take a selfie who
I'm guessing is on the right he has to
borrow my phone so he could do the same
I love the look of concentration on his
face I've also included the original
selfie taken by said older brother Alex
so we have Alex and Nathan here that's
awesome I like how he's trying to you
