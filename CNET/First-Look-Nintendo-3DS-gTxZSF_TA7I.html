cnet.com we've got a first look at the
Nintendo 3ds it's right here
March 27th is the release date it's
going to retail for 250 dollars three
cameras on this thing there's one facing
the user two around back for 3d photos
very cool innovation right there we've
got an SD card slot wireless
compatibility allows you to play on the
go with people around the world which is
really impressive over here is the
notification LED really going to give
you a lot of information about what's
going on with the 3ds really is going to
deal with a lot of the connectivity
Wi-Fi bass and also local sort of stuff
this will really give you an idea of
what's happening with the 3ds there's a
lot of connectivity that's automated
with the 3ds so there's really not a lot
of manual configuration that's going to
have to happen the 3ds can detect other
systems and hook those up automatically
which is really cool up front you've got
the four buttons that we're all used to
on DS systems but on the left side of
the unit is the analog stick which is
new for Nintendo portables really
excited to see how developers use that
along the bottom are three new buttons
as well the select home and start
buttons the home button will allow
to pause a mid-game look into other apps
without losing the action that's going
on in the original game we're excited to
see stuff like that
they've also streamlined friend codes
it's a lot easier now to play with
friends we're happy about that
improvement as well up top is the 3d
screen we actually have it turned off so
it's better for the camera we're also
looking at the knee maker software right
here you can take a photo of yourself in
the me maker software will configure the
character to look like you it's just
pretty cool we've never seen anything
like that before the 3ds is also
backwards compatible with the Nintendo
DS and all the downloadable DSi games so
we're happy to see that implemented in
the design as well at launch the 3d s is
going to be available in black or blue
there's also a lot of pre-loaded
software including a game called face
Raiders that takes a photo of you and
inserts that into a shooting gallery
pretty cool there's a game tracker it's
an app that tracks all of your progress
through games and reward Z there is a
physical mobility monitor a sort of like
a pedometer that tracks movement your
physical movement with the device that's
something we've never seen also included
is the ability to take 3d photos that
you view them on the 3d screen can also
watch 3d videos on the top screen really
impressive stuff that's going to do it
for us it's a first look at the Nintendo
3ds I'm Jeff Bakalar for cnet.com thanks
