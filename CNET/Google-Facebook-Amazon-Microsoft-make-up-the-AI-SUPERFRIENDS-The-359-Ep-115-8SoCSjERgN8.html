Rubin on the way hello hello 200 now
living there Breault 150 dudes cool your
horses hey I was just gonna compliment
Brian on that intro which we weren't
expecting well awesome intro and you
can't put Superfriends in the title and
not expect that yes right and we are
Super Friends you're in the room no
we're not we're not actually friends at
all what's the show ends we like walk
off in silence Roger gals gonna work how
does it deal with that to work now happy
thursday the week is flown by last show
ya God alright so we've got a bunch
stories awesome stories to talk about
we've got a I Super Friends yeah our
resident AI expert Ben will I am this
week about this week you are yeah we'll
talk a bit about this this unique
partnership with some little big
heavyweights announced late yesterday
yesterday she was just announced that
she's a little contradictory but okay
we're also going to be talking about
more explosive Samsung news but not the
note 7 something else that some Samsung
makes poor guys yeah they just break
they really can't uh so and lastly we'll
talk about tinder boost yes we're joking
around before to married men talking
about tinder yes we will gamely try to
avert one we know each other you've got
girlfriend you're you're taking that you
met on tinder no so yeah so really three
experts and tinder talking about taxes
yes I'm taking note render in case she
ever actually stumbled upon this i I've
only seen like screenshots of tender
when people like that's the problem is
like when people mention swipe left I'm
like is that the good one or the bad one
I think I don't even the bad one right
no it's like shoot the hell do I now any
swipe rights the good one anybody want
to tell us so yeah I'm sure people know
show your ignorance well look we've got
we've got an interesting angle neurona
Aaron Carter wrote up the story compared
to Pokemon goes hey hey you're killing
everybody listen I know a topic that we
can discuss those so we're well we'll
get into it as always if you have any
questions leave in the comments section
Brian our producer will pick out the
best and we will do our best to answer
them all right away let's do it all
right we'll start recording in three two
welcome to the 359 we talked about the
top tech news of the day and only the
crap we want to throw it Roger Cheng I'm
Ben Fox Riven so the big tech
heavyweights are gained serious about AI
so serious in fact that the Google
Facebook Amazon Microsoft and IBM are
putting aside their differences in
forming a partnership to push the AI
agenda so Ben is this the start of
Skynet and should I just prepare my
bunker now no dear god no absolutely not
i think so i was at an AI conference
earlier this week and if anything it
really the primary take away that I had
was even though a I sounds like this
really interesting idea and Hollywood
unfortunately has really like poison the
well with me everybody think that AI is
just gonna like kill us and steal our
jobs it's it's fodder for so many great
movies it is but we are so far from
doing that like a lot of what they were
talking about in the conference was oh
my god gee whiz we actually managed to
teach a computer to write captions for
images like it knows there's a dog in
that picture and I'm like yeah so do my
kids can we do though can we get that
you know our system what caption writing
AIA but that like super super basic
thank you yet yeah here's k here's a cat
standing in a you know next to a lamp or
something like that they're excited
about this apparently that has a lot of
like computational power behind it
however like a lot of the stuff that
they're doing in AI right now kids can
do so that's the problem is is that like
when it comes to math machines are so
much better than people but when it
comes to very basic certain things that
we can do just intuitively it's still a
long way to go so let's not get too
scared of machines quite yet all right
but you think what sort of exponential
growth and progress of AI this stuff
that's going to happen sooner than you
think it could it could and I think that
this partnership really points to that
but i think the partnership also points
to the fact that this
such a big issue that that's why they're
combining together that's like why
they're combining their powers and
becoming super friends because no single
one of these guys can do it on their own
at this I just clear this is a nonprofit
organization that this isn't they're not
colluding here they're just sort of
they're working together to kind of
person well they could be colluding we
don't know make AI seem friendlier
because right a lot of people are like
super suspicious about it all right part
of the point of this this whole
organization right to educate people
about AI but it's not about reading or
junction where chickens for a robot will
tell you why it's good all right next up
more explosive Samsung news but no it's
not the note 7 it's actually select top
loading washing machines that are now
prone to not necessary explode blow up
but there's a defect that might cause
the nuts and bolts another product of
the machine to fly out at you so so bad
ease got it man really wish for the note
7 they can't catch a break in yeah
that's that's too bad I mean it's is it
a lot of people have complained that um
you know Samsung just seems to rush out
certain technology sometimes right that
was true there were some really good
stories about how they did that with the
note 7 but with a washing machine it's
not like you need to get like the latest
and greatest washing machine so by the
way just to be fair Samsung has said
that there haven't been a report
incidents this is based off of a lawsuit
but the company's recommend that you use
mom with affected models you use a lower
speed delicate cycle when washing
bedding bulky or water resistant
materials so we'll see lastly tinder
introduced a new program boost this is
supposed to highlight your profile to
other members within half an hour it's
sort of a paid thing kind of panic to
get like an advertising how are ya feel
a really desperate for a booty call this
is what you'd use to just like you get
like a half hour like quick head so
everybody's gonna see more people will
see my so been as a fellow Barry person
what's your take on this I think it's
great you know if I won an immediate
booty call this is what I can use you
know that's sounds like a perfectly
reasonable thing
alright more about these stories check
us out cnet and Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox
Rubin thanks for listening and cut I'll
start delving into the comments I like
that in the tinder story compares it to
lure module yes yeah we did have time to
get to it during the podcast about I
think Aaron did a really good job
comparing it to Pokemon go God dismal Oh
God gotta catch them all yeah it is that
was a that was a status that was an
answer that you could actually put in as
for your status went into rolled out
tinder social mmm which is the whole
night that's a group to group dating my
group dating butts more like groups
meeting each other okay but I don't know
there was an always sunny episode about
that I guess it's like it makes it less
awkward Slyke a group of girls meets up
with music to drais or no it wasn't
tinder it was like they made up certain
apps like like group connector buddy I
need to see the episode was very very
low yeah I'm a big fan of that show
Dennis tried to do a whole group date
with a bunch of women it was just him
you know did not work out there so
Dennis yeah so in the realm of the the
AI super group yeah who do we really
think is kind of leading this charge
suspicions in the chat say Google is
kind of ahead of this game and kind of
at the front line and everyone else is
kind of like the supporting act what do
we think yeah what I would there's might
disagree on this I actually do think
Google's probably on the front line
largely because they're starting to seed
the market with so many different smart
devices that would theoretically be able
to take advantage of google system which
is their their version of a virtual
assistant you know they've got the whole
best camp the nest products they've got
the Huff Google home coming out soon
they've got phones they've got
chromecast they've got a chromecast for
TV for speakers there's all these little
elements in the home that they've
already kind of got and only really need
to do is like flip a switch right bring
a I'd all the brand they have deep mind
which is there reason right right right
so that is obviously something that is
benefiting them however plus weight they
also make loads and loads of money off
of
search right searches sort of their core
business and they could funnel that
money into AI research yeah you know
that's something that few companies can
really match right yes and Google is
obviously buzzy ER than some of those
other names but I wouldn't discount IBM
and Microsoft I think they have an
enormous amount of like engineering
power and so they have been developing a
lot of different types of AI technology
with Watson which is the IBM one that's
a little bit more business to business
so we don't tend to focus on that as
much but I think that they were
definitely sort of the healthcare
applications were watching right in
terms of like cancer research yeah and
like they're studying like weather
predictions yam stuff like that so I do
think that they have been putting a lot
of effort into maggots off did announced
a separately that they're forming their
own AI research group putting behind you
know because like two thousand engineers
into this organization really propel a I
within the organization yeah I would
actually argue that Amazon is probably a
late comer as far as i can tell i mean
like I've been doing a lot more with
Alexa but before Alexa I don't know that
they were really all that well known for
AI I really surprised you said that
about Amazon well you know given the
prevalence of echo and Alexa that yeah
but that came out in like 2014 so I
can't imagine that their team is as big
as like Microsoft or IBM or control I
might be wrong about that but it's
probably the funny thing is probably the
one that most by consumers relate to
write that Alexa's one they probably use
more often than any of the others right
even Siri really you think so who uses
three I don't know are you serious are
you serious like a basic test tell you
Siri well listen to me ok Google is
something that I'm sure a lot of people
use that's that's true yeah yeah we've
got a question not a question but Jack
in the comments says Skynet is among us
buckland eyes says 'i corp evil Corp
from mr. robot okay and dashi answer is
asking is this like the movie her yes oh
yeah if they pair if they bring this
tinder thing into the AI fold will
google facebook yeah we might be having
some mash
with all those three stories so what was
interesting that I heard about in the
conference's is that there was a I think
it was a Chinese and Japanese version of
teh that had dream that came out
Microsoft had developed this thing
called Xiao ice yes and it came up
before tay it did yeah yeah it's been
around for like two years yeah it has
about 40 million users and it's like
this chat pod and what's interesting
about it is is that it has like
emotional support functions so folks
have been known to like talk to Joe ice
for like I don't know like almost an
hour or something bad and you know I
guess it's a good listener it's not like
it's really like they're a lot lowly
ss-super it's not a super powerful a I
like some of it is just like a little
bit of like tricks of like actually
understanding like if you say this like
you know like will program it to say
that if you tried having a conversation
with Google assistant yet now on a low I
I couldn't even figure out how but it
didn't it was like well i'll tell you
the weather if i remember correctly yeah
it's not great yeah we tried Lynn you
know did you read Linds oh yeah yes you
know she tried breaking up with someone
via like that and then getting auto
responses see that's what I'm trying to
say is that like a I it sounds so scary
but it's really like there's there's so
much more to go and ultimately it's it's
like after decades of research we really
haven't improved that much of it
everybody keeps expecting it to like go
up all of a sudden but it's still taking
a much longer time than I think people
realize Thank You tech pro we love you
too okay all right right on hey so I
just got to think in the the washing
machine don't we have one of those at
the smart home I believe so should we
call and see if they're okay how I think
maybe they haven't been answering so I
don't know no no not home right the
contract this we want to know your bills
and said bourbon if you're okay just now
if way just when I ribbon there in
Kentucky yeah uh well not too much going
on in the chat today look um might as
well just get called in early week yeah
