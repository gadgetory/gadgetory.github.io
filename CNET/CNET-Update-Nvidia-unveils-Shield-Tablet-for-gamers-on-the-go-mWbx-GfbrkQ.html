to create a gaming tablet last year
razer cooked up a tablet that could pop
into a case with controller buttons on
handles it's called the razer edge it
also has a TV docking station so you can
use it with more traditional game
controllers but unlike Nvidia's android
tablet razer edge is a fully loaded
windows 8 machine like a surface tablet
