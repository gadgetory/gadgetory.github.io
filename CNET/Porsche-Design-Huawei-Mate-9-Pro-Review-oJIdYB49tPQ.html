phone might make you look twice and not
just because of its striking resemblance
to the late note 7 this is what Huawei's
mate 9 looks like with a Porsche
makeover top-of-the-line specs and now
with a sleek exterior to match inside
you'll find the same powerful octa-core
processor six gigs of RAM and four
thousand milliamp per hour battery
running the latest flavor of Android but
on the outside you'll notice some pretty
obvious differences for starters its
size the Porsche Edition has a 5.5 inch
screen compared to the five point nine
inches on the original mate with a bump
up in resolution from 1080p to 1920 like
Samsung's note 7 this version also
curves on the sides making it seem
slimmer and more distinguished above the
screen you'll notice the obvious
branding and below you now have a
fingerprint scanner which is switched
from the back of the phone in this new
Porsche Edition perhaps to leave room
for yet more Porsche branding in case
there was ever a doubt as to which one
you've had the flash and sensor have
also changed positions but the dual
camera is exactly the same what you will
have to sacrifice in this model is
expandable storage which is why it now
comes with 256 gigabytes of on-board
storage and of course there's the price
beauty does not come cheap and this
beast will set you back about $1500
that's more than half of what you'd pay
for the most expensive mate night
luckily there is another way to get the
premium design at a lower price tag
while we announced its mate 9 Pro which
is basically the same design as this one
but without the branding it's still
slightly more expensive than the
original but only about $100 more rather
than $800 more so unless you have the
matching car you're probably better off
spending on that one</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
