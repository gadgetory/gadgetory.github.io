bluetooth headphone which features
active noise cancellation and costs
around $200 online this is the successor
to the standard level on and this newer
model includes support for Samsung's
proprietary ultra-high quality audio or
uhq a bluetooth streaming format which
is supposed to offer superior audio
performance when streaming over
Bluetooth uhq a streaming is available
only on Samsung's latest Galaxy devices
while the headphones are best paired
with a Samsung phone there is a
companion level app for Android phones
that allows you to tweak the sound with
various preset sound profiles this does
work with any Bluetooth enabled phone
including iPhones it's a fairly
comfortable headphone but as its name
implies it is an on-ear model and isn't
quite as comfortable as an around-ear
headphone though it is more compact and
I liked how it folds up to fit in its
included carrying pouch like its
predecessor it also has touch controls
on the right ear cup so you can tap the
headphone to pause and play your music
or swipe to raise and lower volume or
skip tracks forward or back the
headphone worked well as a headset for
making calls if you're looking for a
headphone with heavy duty noise
cancellation this isn't it although it
does a reasonable job muffling noise
it's fairly light and it isn't as
effective as boses noise cancellation
battery life is rated at 10 hours which
is good but not great sound quality is
quite decent for Bluetooth with fairly
strong but not bloated bass and good
detail that said I wouldn't say this is
an exceptional sounding headphone for
the money competing models such as
Plantronics backbeat cents and boses
sound like on-ear sound is good and are
lighter and arguably more comfortable to
wear
still this level on pro has enough
merits to make it work considering
particularly if you're someone who owns
one of the latest Samsung Galaxy phones
I'm David Carr Noy thanks for watching
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
