the new Samsung Galaxy S 9 you're
staring at your current phone and saying
yourself how can I justify getting the
Samsung Galaxy S 9
well don't worry we've got you covered
one more thing this list could change
once we do our full review of the s9
let's get to it at number five it's the
little things the s9 features something
called a headphone jack
unlike the pixel 2 or the iPhone 7 8 or
10 samsung says the screens are 15
percent brighter which is always nice
the bezels were little things before and
now they are even smaller by one point
two millimeters and then there's that
new purple edition snazzy coming in at
number four stereo speakers the s9 is
the first galaxy s device with stereo
speakers and feature the Dolby Atmos
codec Samsung will have these speakers
tuned by AKG which Samsung owns by the
way the s9 is also 40 percent louder
than the s8 it's nice to not need a
Bluetooth speaker if you just want to
listen to your phone while you putter
around the house that's right
I putter because that's what I do and
number three it's fast inside some
models of the s9 will be the Qualcomm
Snapdragon 805 processor and our tests
with the 845 in a reference device it
performed at least 25% faster than the
Snapdragon 835 which is found in the s8
the pixel to excel and the LG v 30 again
that was at least 25% faster - should
translate into making impatient people
like me very happy number 2 Samsung
fixed the biggest flaw of the s8 in the
s9 Samsung placed the fingerprint sensor
in the middle of the device on the back
the s8 in the note 8 both feature an
off-center fingerprint sensor which was
less than ideal the centralized s9
fingerprint sensor should mean it's a
lot easier to unlock that phone of yours
and you're less likely to get your
finger oils on that awesome camera and
that number one are the main cameras on
the s9 and s9 plus each main camera is a
dual aperture device needing the
aperture physically changes in low-light
the camera will use a larger aperture of
f15 which lets in more light 28% more
light than the s8
that should translate into better
low-light shots with less noise when
shooting in daylight or bright lighting
the camera will stop down to an aperture
of at 2.4 for better exposures the s9
camera can also take slow-motion video
at a rate of 960 frames per second at
720p resolution which is kind of insane

buy the galaxy s 9 don't worry we got
