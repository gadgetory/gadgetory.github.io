helping blind students see their
classmates a dog gets a new pair of legs
3d printed pair of legs that's exciting
also nASA has a new way to take out the
space trash that's inspired by geckos
but you will not get fifteen percent off
your car insurance tomorrow daily
the internet welcome to tomorrow daily
the best geek talk show in the known
universe I'm host Ashley skele join me
as always to my right to your left
uh-huh the one and only kill anonymous i
like i like your lower third better than
mine why I don't know they're both like
jizz our names by the way in case you
haven't been trolling around on the cnet
videos that I've been coming out there's
a blooper reel up now yeah we have to
talk about the blooper reel we never
make mistakes and so we just couldn't
submit anything they ask me I'm a big
mistakes never producer Logan was like
never offer we never do yeah that's
that's true but producer Logan they
asked him he was like I'm sorry they're
just too perfect and with that let's hit
the headlines of course one thing that
we say in the show today is a total
fabrication it might have been that yeah
I'm just throwing that out there uh
we're gonna make it though you cursed us
you're gonna make a huge mistake this
episode I I'm sure I well so pay
attention I'm here aren't I no I'm just
kidding okay so our first story is
awesome super heartwarming comes from
South Korea this is the seoul national
school for the blind and they were
recently given the opportunity to let
its most recent graduating class
actually quote unquote see their other
classmates so this is awesome a company
name 3d tech made a bus of eight blind
students so they made the 3d printed
very detailed a small pond like handheld
statues of each of these classmates and
then they mounted them onto a rack about
either 8 wide obviously there's an eight
of them and then they put little name
plates in Braille underneath the faces
and so just like a yearbook picture
brought to life with 3d printing they're
able to feel the faces of their
classmates and they're able to sort of
in a way see what they look like oh
that's really touching yeah and that
they compared like says he is like the
know your nose a small it's like
everything it's like oh it resembles you
and they can remember the face of their
friends and and they are they each got
one of these eight long busts and so
they each got one they each got one so
now that have it with them for life
and and always be able to look back
fondly oh my god on all their friends
after graduation but it's really really
cool like i love how 3d printing is kind
of really at the forefront of these
these sorts of stories that are kind of
like you know we think about 3d printing
as something that could potentially be
used for evil like you see these 3d
printed guns yeah I guess that's it and
like well no there's like people who say
well 3d printing I don't know like I'm
not sure about it but then you see
things like this and it's just so
heartwarming and you're so gosh like
this is something we've never been able
to do even five years ago was it shake
the fact that somebody thought to use it
for this is yeah rentable really really
cool and they these kids in case you
just listening are so touched they were
like hugging they were recited yeah and
they were super excited to be able to
experience that and check it out so I
just thought that was such a nice way to
open up the the show this week just
really heartwarming we're in the crystal
meerut or that one it that one and this
next story are definitely wants to bank
when you're talking about 3d printing
yeah whenever you're talking in
discussion about the guns or what and
especially if anyone brings up like why
I'm not sure about 3d printing it could
be used for so many bad things and then
you say well well kid not only that but
like where the future's going so let's
get started on my story I'm not doing
not to leave your kids behind no no but
we have other other so a touch upon a
dog unfortunately was born without front
paws this is his name Oh is Derby this
is Derby the derby derby the dog was
born without front paws very sad thing
he was a rescue well his owner tara
anderson works for 3d systems and
decided that she wanted to try and you
know help him out they had already tried
you know putting it on meals and it
couldn't play with the other dogs for
you but imagine that would be really
hard to have this wheelchairs yeah you
can't really pivot on it so you can't
pivot quickly this is his foster yeah
laughter oh so serious hear the wheels
that looks cumbersome it makes the dog
like twice the size right he can get
around kind of yeah quite it's so you
know they decided to through three
systems print out some some pause for it
to have this is just like in forest
companies like lieutenant dan you got
some magic legs
yeah this is just like that except with
dogs so so they ended up going with
instead of like latches or whether they
got a loop system so that you can move
around more easily right cuz if they did
like a peg so many would be really right
and then also may be this hard to get
used to you know like it so as you can
see it's got kind of like a roundish
shape yeah it's like a better room for
error and movement they're about to put
him on him they're saying they're
starting that lower the ground because
they want Derby to get used to the legs
and they'll increase the height over
time as he gets more comfortable look at
him no I know he's got some crazy
mobility look at he's runnin runnin yeah
like trotting around I mean you can see
how he's a little lower to the ground in
the front because that's obviously
where's much gotta get used to is
getting used to it yeah the weight
distribution and whatnot but yeah
they're already on their about to print
his fourth generation of these so again
that what the best 3d printing like
moving this sort of thing and making it
more accessible to people and you know
look it's probably a lot more affordable
my previous dog is like that's the best
that's the best vest I mean that's there
you go if you're a Grinch this show
today is gonna make your heart grow
three sizes you won't need the who's
down in Whoville you just need to still
not a lot for me but I know really well
it's you know it with the same thing is
like something x 1 is it doesn't grow
yeah let's um i just have zero yeah
still see maybe point to your points you
so that's 2 to positive stories about 3d
printing what do you go i got up there
is this positive story but it might take
a little while to really put it in
action but you know i don't know if you
knew this but there's actually a lot of
space trash in our orbit like we
actually have a lot of trash like dead
satellites and I mean not like you know
McDonald's cups or anything it's not see
barge you know those like islands of
garbage out in the ocean those sad eyes
right don't play oil hail dumps all this
oil and sewage out into space uh but ya
know this is really cool so NASA there's
there's about twenty one thousand
objects orbiting the earth right now
that are that are dead not even if one
thought that nasa put their oh boy it's
dangerous especially when you have
launched you know we've all seen gravity
yeah it's dangerous to have space trash
around and so nASA has unveiled this
robot gripper
that they think can help bring in
garbage and so what they're doing right
now this is a microgravity flight that
they did and that's a 20 pound box but
it simulates a 250 pound item so they
were able to kind of grip it so what
they've done is they were inspired by
geckos who can stick to some pretty
rough surfaces yeah and the way that
they do that is it there's like sort of
these hair structures on the their pads
and so they created something very
similar to that with synthetic hair
structures on the grippers adhesive pads
that allow them to either grip or let go
which is really fastening so yeah
they're pulling this guy around I love
that and so the future in the future the
idea is that they would send a robot up
in orbit with these gripper pads and it
would go around the earth and collect
things and so it basically clean up
space trash nice space space trash
garbage man and what are we gonna do
with it when we get it back um well I
would imagine we throw it in the ocean
like we do yeah no no it's uh no I don't
know I I'm not really sure I would
imagine well some of it might be able to
be repurposed octa so so they're just
gonna send out a robot to go out there
and clean up space or what's the deal
yeah I mean I think it like this
technology I've seen it used in a couple
of different ways like not precisely
this but a very similar application
where they have people do it like the
spider Manning up the wall like it's
that gecko sort of it's like inspired by
the gecko and how it sticks to rougher
surfaces so right now like I said it can
grab the equivalent of about 250 pounds
in microgravity and then they're testing
right now the grippers on a bunch of
different spacecraft surfaces just see
how well it can grab things and they are
saying that in the future they might be
able to like you know get something and
take it to another location in orbit or
maybe if something like falls off the
ISS get it retrieve it bring it back all
right things like that so I thought that
was pretty neat and they were saying
also that it would it would potentially
in the future be used to help things
that are spinning out of control in
space oh okay yeah so that's scary so
terrifying by the way so how much was
space trash was out there again
twenty-one thousand pieces of spacecraft
take forever to clean up but the big
thing is is that like I mentioned it's
really
dangerous for launches to have to go
through these like caches of space
garbage which is really weak did you
ever think in your life that you would
be talking about space garbage like
originally a real space garbage problem
you guys stop littering don't throw out
your milkshakes or half-eaten burritos
while you're in the spacecraft like so
no no good yeah it's just really weird
that we're talking about space trash
it's one of those things where I'm like
I don't as if I were just as a person
like can't even imagine like that
wouldn't've been a thing I thought of
like wow that there's gonna be some
garbage in our orbit yeah we're that
dirty dirty space we got to clean it up
yeah clean it up all right just like I
do and fall out clean up one piece of
garbage you need to learn how to play
fallout um so what do you want you have
a hashtag of the day for that do you
want to I might try to think of our
hashtags I didn't before we that was the
big mistake I made see oh you don't you
know right you know the hashtag I think
you need to make one up right now on the
spot okay I a TT TT TT trash did you
trash okay all right what sci fi what's
ifi'd trash do you think we'd find up if
we went up into space in any series they
could be from like Star Wars Star Trek
or Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica yes
g yeah so out of them yeah lost in space
yeah like Luke's hand oh yeah there's
I'd like that I like to see that more
likes good catch it get a gripper cats
yeah and have maybe something like
Chewbacca hair trimmings okay all right
out there it does sound like that got
knocked off the Millennium Falcon
retreat I yeah yeah yep that going on um
the Apollo like that team TD trash yeah
that's your that's your hashtag GT trash
not not great yeah just came up with it
do you have a second hashtag though
because we're gonna we're gonna need
this this is the more important hashtag
on Wednesday kale and I are doing our
best of CES show or not best of CES I'm
sorry I have CES on the brain right now
yeah you do best of 2014 show I should
and what we're doing is we're asking you
also to contribute your best of 2014 so
TD best of 2014 um maybe should focus on
that yeah maybe focus on that did I
don't look like what i want is either
your best tech story your your favorite
tech story
b14 your favorite video game 2014 and or
your favorite pop culture news in 2014
the things that we cover like tell us
what your favorite thing was this year
yeah in those three which one stuck with
you definitely and we'll tell you ours
on that show on wednesday which is
pretty exciting this wood and that'll be
our last show of the year if anybody
says that blood video game thing I'm he
quits I'm gonna quit if you want kale to
quit say the blood video gaming machine
there you go on that note we're going to
take a quick break we will be right back
so don't click away and we will have
another round of backcolor Hackett and
of course your user feedback so stick
around
welcome back to the show where we've
returned hopefully that one big mistake
it's cleared now I noticed we both are
wearing what would seem like
aggressively violent shirts what is
yours Punisher no mine is a Reaper from
overwatch I got the seppälä sconce oh
yeah so this is his mask Reaper Reapers
mass cool he was really fun he had the
dual pistols and then like his special
move was like you would turn into kind
of like a phantom and you would spin
around in circles and Papa Papa Papa bow
and like shoot everybody around you to
school orchha guys have played was super
good you know maybe we'll listen maybe
I'll pull some strings get you in a
techie okay yeah I get those strings
someday someday but whenever half an
alpha I don't know when that's gonna be
um we have to talk about this back at
her hackett because Kail found it and i
found it very fascinating it's actually
got a lot of cool features so what this
is back or hackett so today we will be
discussing the uno note band um this is
a wearable lots of wearables this year
yes big year for wearables this one was
a little bit different though and I like
kind of the idea behind it this is speed
reading notifications so here's the deal
there's a website called spritz and it
lets you put in text and you it'll speed
read it to you just like this so you're
if you're not watching the show it
basically puts up one word at a time
centered and it's been shown like
according to them that you read up to
eighty percent faster it with this
method one word at a time yeah so very
interesting and so this wearable
basically just shows you the words of
your notification one word at a time
centered so that you can read them very
quickly which I like and it includes
call notifications email social media
calendar alerts and then the other thing
that's really cool is you can also get
gaming notifications so it is
connectable to steam xbox and
playstation so if you get new friend
request that's crazy you can check that
out and you can you know you can accept
a friend request so it's primarily like
a messaging type band or what yeah it's
what they call it a note band and I
thought that was really interesting
because it is kind of like it's just
like oh here's notes like here's some
notes
from this notification or hears you know
here's an email that is going to show
you one word at a time so that you can
speed read it while not necessarily
having to stop and like look okay and
you can turn up the speed at which it
sends those words to your device so it's
like you can turn it up to a certain
level and it'll be like instead of going
hi kayle nice to meet you like it would
be like hi kill nice to meet you like
wait you can speed it up or slow so this
is a way to not have to keep looking at
your phone is what yes and I think the
one thing they mentioned at the very
beginning of their IndieGoGo video is we
look at our phones like 150 times a day
and they're like we want to just want to
just acts that 86 that when people look
at their phones less yeah which is a
very noble pursuit I mean it's a very
noble pursuit of course but I'm like I
really like this idea it's neat it's
really awesome so any video and how much
how much is it well yeah what's going on
with the first early bird is sold out
but you can back it for sixty nine bucks
right now for one or two bands for 118
dollars and then it delivers an april of
next year's oh wow that's pretty soon
that's the timeline so when most
Kickstarter's and other crowdfunding
projects are like a year out or more
like this is for months yeah pretty
close yeah so it's pretty nice and and
then I think I have some stretch goals
like color colorful bands or faceplates
like different things like that so you
can go check that out and they're doing
quite well people seem to really like it
i believe it's already gonna be funded
so go go check it out there you go yeah
that's pretty neat I like I thought it
was really awesome so I say back it I
mean I'm interested I like I'd like to
I'd like to try it so I'm hoping maybe
they'll be at CES I like that it's it's
relatively cheap like it's it's easy
cheap yeah it's so it works in
everything so yeah and the other thing
is is you don't have to charge it every
day they said it will last like between
like 32 to the four days like depending
on how often you get notifications and
very cool nice so yeah like I really
like that um now that we are done backer
hackett though well thank you by the way
for bringing that to our attention
because I didn't see that and I thought
that was really cool that's really nice
um now we're done with that of course we
have what you guys have to say so it's
time for user feedback
oh you guys are so magical because last
week we asked you to use hashtag TV
figure to tell us what Oh what I'm
animated act like sort of statue you
would have thought it was too I you
really you guys are geniuses uh Leo
wrote to us and said I would have AG and
I'll figurine i would say you shall not
pass whilst topping is wooden stick
whenever you walk past it that's great
if you'd pass it anyway anyway second
gamble for the second video by sorry
Rick wrote to us and said Steve Jobs
action figure every email he would say
we have one more thing for you and this
is the greatest thing ever I bet you
like that I did well I love the idea of
him being like every time you get a
notification it's like a random rotation
of words like it's magical it's
revolutionary like I think I love the
idea of like just these little like
sound bites really funny and also i
think i should definitely program him
screaming at you at some point because
that was a stew you like to scream at
people okay yeah i don't want that i
wouldn't buy it that well no it's like
if something goes wrong like you know
you get your like warning message weird
something that's like a burnt or
whatever that it would be like Steve
being like no like the funny to me um
and then camel wrote to us and said
Nicki Minaj love her voice yeah I just
come up to your show on YouTube you guys
are awesome he's from Africa oh wow yeah
I want to know what the nicki minaj i
think the name is a reit rhea eritrea i
think i'm in that's cool that's good but
yeah Nicki Minaj I like that do I do
just do like its face is like I don't
know maybe it sings super bass it would
sing super bass well you got my hot be
running away I don't know like it could
be could be good yeah thing um Wesley
wrote to us and said definitely would
want motoko kusanagi ghost in the shell
or spike spiegel cowboy bebop yeah
finger those are good so yeah some anime
love their nice anime for all the
otaku's out there and then Joey wrote us
an email and said dear tomorrow daily I
love the idea of having a moving
high-end action figure I personally want
one of eat an ego Montoya
princess bride I want to walk in the
door and have it say I'm an eagle
Montoya you killed my father prepare to
die like the show happy holidays
sincerely Joey and it checks to see if
you have six figures on your list I
think that's it it should also have a
scanner and it's like forehead or
something where it's key you have to put
your hands up and he's like do you know
these things finish man I'm looking for
a man with six figures uh Devon wrote to
us and said I'm finally Devon Rosen said
I would have my figure be Arnold
Schwarzenegger and he would say all of
his famous catchphrases and in the
mornings when I leave in the mornings i
would say i'll be back and he would say
no I'll reebok we would keep saying that
until one of us gave up I like that he
ran through the whole scenario that's
one of my favorite email for a beautiful
scenario for us it's great but yeah you
guys had some really good answers so you
better step it up for TT trash and best
of 2014 because it's gonna get serious
yeah which is not gonna be fun it's
either be great no this is our outtake I
thought that was really good um alright
so our very last piece of user feedback
as always is our phone tog refer of the
day so our phone charger for the day
today comes from Kylie are and he took
this picture with a galaxy s3 and he
said ever since i got a nikon coolpix
point-and-shoot camera middle school
I've been trying to demonstrate how a
non professional camera can be used to
take great photos now with my galaxy s3
I keep trying to prove that point here's
my latest attempt at an artistic photo
with a relatively cheap somewhat old
camera taken while waiting for this
season's solar eclipse galaxy s3 yeah
that's like years old guessing dip the
field going there gal yeah I got it got
some depth of field happenin nice I love
this little sapling yeah like a little
sapling picking out sticking out of the
ground where everything else looks dead
it's really nice to just the position of
life and death I think he's I think he's
prayers this point we're getting deep
we're getting deeper this but yeah you
totally prove your point this looks
fantastic you win God nice shot Carly
though yeah you're officially a
favourite viewer still not my favorite
yeah that's hard tonight go easy to
impress kale not so much I'm tough to
impress um if you guys want to send in
your phone ography to be considered to
be featured on the show you can email us
tomorrow at cnet com
you can also send us your hashtag of the
day either or best of 2014 or a TD trash
and if you absolutely hate email which
so many of you young chill dude is your
kids out there you can always find us on
social media Twitter Instagram Facebook
we're at tomorrow daily and we're
tomorrow daily TV over on google+ and if
you believe in a thing called love just
let some of the rhythm of your heart and
subscribe to the YouTube either tew/cnet
or the tomorrow daily show it's true and
don't forget to if you're listening on
iTunes don't forget to give us a good
rating yeah also follows there too also
I found a really good reason for people
to give us thumbs up on the videos
because it helps us get to the lists of
like what's hot and relevant at that
time when the videos go a hot relevant
on YouTube yeah where it's like hair is
like popular things that are popular
right now things that are it's not
trending but it's like kind of like
trending oh so thumbs ups help yeah give
us some thumbs up so now I have a good
reason other than it makes me feel good
on the inside makes me feel all warm and
fuzzy vision in my in the face you're
like you're much warmer every time I
amateur I am that's not so happy all the
time because everybody's so nice on the
internet because they're being valuable
yeah they're being they're being at
humans and speaking of which will be
back tomorrow and the brand new docket
of weird wonderful awesome crazy nerd
stuff and until then vegan humans and
we'll see you guys next time
