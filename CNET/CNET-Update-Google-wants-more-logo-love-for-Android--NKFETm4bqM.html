I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update there are quite a number of smart
phones running android all with
different hardware and branding and
keeping track of all the models can get
messy there are galaxies and notes
nexuses and Max's ones and z ones and
some folks call everything a droid but
it looks like Google wants to make
things more clear for consumers a report
from Android police and geek.com
suggests that Google will require future
Android phones to show a powered by
android logo when the phone boots up and
the evidence is there with the latest
HTC One m8 it shows the logo on a splash
screen and t-mobile posted an amateur
quality unboxing video of the Samsung
Galaxy s5 which is not yet released but
it also shows the android logo when it
boots up Google's video streaming TV
stick just added a few apps and now
streams video from the crackle and
voodoo apps and are also constrained
music from our do the $35 hdmi stick is
used to fling videos and apps from a
mobile device to your living room big
screen in other video news amazon is
expanding its first original series it's
a political comedy called alpha house
amazon is making a full series out of
the 10 shows it tested for a pilot
season amazon will also produce six
other original shows all in the push to
go after netflix which as you know also
has its own original programming to see
amazon shows you need to subscribe to
amazon prime which will cost a hundred
dollars a year there's a growing trend
of using biometrics to secure your phone
the iPhone 5s it can unlock with a
fingerprint and new Android phones can
unlock with a photo of your face but
there's an updated app that gives iPhone
owners the power to log into websites
with their face it's called face crypt
and there's a free version which will
store your important financial data
passwords and documents in the app and
you can require your face for access but
the paid version which is seven bucks
takes it a step further and includes its
own brow
zur so you can have an auto fill out
your login for websites after it scans
your face and I tried it out and I would
say the free one is interesting but it's
not yet ready for prime time and it's
not worth seven dollars too often there
were error messages popping up but if
you're curious about the concept you can
also check out an app called fast access
anywhere which is for iOS Android and
Windows and it lets you unlock websites
with a selfie but it's also a little
clunky to use that's your tech news
update head on over to cnet.com for more
details on these stories from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
