headphone a stylish $80 on your model
that Plantronics hopes will appear to
younger users who don't want to pay top
dollar for Beats products it comes in
three colors white grey and dark gray
that looks more like black and is
comfortable for an on-ear headphone and
sounds quite good for the price usually
Bluetooth headphones in the sub $100
range suffer from mediocre sound quality
but I was pleasantly surprised that the
backbeat 500 sounds as good as it does
for the price it's not in the League of
higher-end over-ear models like
Plantronics own backbeat pro 2 but it's
a pretty well-balanced headphone with
decent detail and relatively punchy
meaty bass it clearly seems designed to
compete with beats solo 3 Wireless which
lists for $300 but costs around 220
online that beats offers great battery
life it's rated at 40 hours but this
Plantronics backbeat 500 is pretty solid
in that department with 18 hours at
moderate volume levels you've got volume
controls on the right ear cup along with
track controls and I also liked how
there's a separate dedicated button for
accessing Siri Google now and Cortana
voice assistance as a headset the
backbeat 500 works pretty well but
doesn't have the dual noise cancelling
microphones of some of Plantronics
higher-end headphones a carrying pouch
is included and if you want to listen in
Wired mode you can use the included
headphone cord
well it isn't all that groundbreaking
there are other on your headphones that
look similar
the well-designed backbeat 500 series is
ultimately a good value and an excellent
budget alternative to beats pricier
bluetooth on your headphones I'm David
