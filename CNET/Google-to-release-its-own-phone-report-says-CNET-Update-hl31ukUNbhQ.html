answer is yes according to a new report
from The Telegraph its sources say
Google is talking with mobile operators
about introducing a new Google branded
phone in the past google has released
Nexus phones however they are Co branded
by the manufacturers like the Nexus 5x
feature the LG logo on the back the
Nexus 6p wears a huawei label on its
rear this new Google branded phone would
be released by the end of the year right
now it is widely believed HTC will be
making two new Nexus phones for Google
The Telegraph report does not explicitly
state whether a Google branded phone
would be in the Nexus line or something
entirely different Google already makes
a handful of devices like the pixel C
tablet and the pixel Chromebook both are
high-end devices with high-end pricing
to match perhaps a Google phone would be
similar in design also the pricing could
be problematic the Nexus line of phones
is relatively affordable what a premium
phone made by Google join them then
again Google also makes a chromecast
which is remarkably inexpensive maybe
Google can make the best cheapest phone
possible the crazy thing is either one
of those options could be plausible
because Google does wild things we'll
have to wait to find out what happens
next
