here to tell you a little bit about
samsung's new smart remote for 2014 this
little guy is actually the best TV
remote I've ever seen included with a
television the real key here is that
Samsung has adopted the sort of motion
control used by Nintendo and more
recently LG with their own TVs Samsung's
motion control adds another little twist
though you can actually just rest your
thumb on the remote itself to activate
the motion control you can see here that
as long as my thumb is on it the thing
actually reads the motion control is
able to select items I take my thumb off
and it doesn't so you can actually drive
around to the regular cursor control in
this configuration motion control really
works great for typing in things on an
on-screen keyboard for using Samsung's
little remote keyboard here that comes
up that actually can control your cable
box and things like that of course the
downside is that you don't get direct
access to a lot of those commands if you
kind of person who types in channel
numbers a lot you might actually find
yourself using the remote the commuter
cable box or even a universal remote in
preference to this little guy on the
other hand if you're the kind of guy
that does a lot of web browsing for
example this remote is a godsend it
actually allows the cursor to move
really quickly around the screen you can
scroll really easily using the touchpad
so all things considered it's really one
of the more advanced remotes out there
unlike a standard IR remote of course
you don't have to aim this thing at the
screen it uses bluetooth so you can use
it from across the room or even without
having a name of the screen at all the
TV itself can actually control your
cable box by an IR blaster so again you
get full control using this remote it'll
also control other devices such as a
blu-ray player or a home theater system
but it doesn't do it as well it's a good
universal remote such as a harmony but
again if you're keeping everything
within the TV or using the TV that could
provide your control you're also using
the TV to browse your cable box this
remote works really well and again one
of the nicest most responsive clickers
I've seen I also love the ergonomics on
this little guy it actually has a really
nice feel in the hand it's got sort of a
textured backside here with just a few
buttons on here the main ones include
transport control for play pause rewind
and fast-forward there's also the little
touchpad channel up and down which you
can use to browse quickly your on-screen
program guide on your cable box there's
also a voice command button on here so
you can use this to enter in voice
searches for example to control the TV
to turn on different channels to choose
different apps and even to search for
different
ders and also program types so really
the search works pretty well it's
Universal on the flip side it doesn't
hit Netflix or Amazon instance so
Samsung has a little bit more work to do
to make the search even as good as
something found on like a Roku of course
Roku doesn't offer voice search so again
there's some trade-offs so despite the
fact this remote is the nicest I've ever
seen included with a TV overall I'd
still probably choose a universal remote
to control my own system because I have
a lot more devices but with a simpler
system so that doesn't include a whole
bunch of different devices or something
we're going to use the TV to use most of
the smart apps via the TV itself Samsung
Smart Remote is a clear winner that's a
quick look at Samsung's new
motion-activated touchpad Smart Remote
for 2014 this is included on all Samsung
TVs of the h-60 400 series and up for
2014 I'm David Katz Mayer from Cena</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
