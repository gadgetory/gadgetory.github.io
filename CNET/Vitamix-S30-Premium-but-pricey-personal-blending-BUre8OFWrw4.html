and right now we're taking a first look
at the Vitamix s30 now this device is
made for small batch smoothie making or
food prep it has a travel cup that you
can take if you want to make your
smoothies to go it also has a regular 40
ounce mixing jar for making bigger
batches
now it's an excellent solution if
premium build quality and craftsmanship
really float your boat the problem is it
has a stanley hi sky high price of four
hundred and nine dollars so right off
the bat the first thing I notice about
this blender is it's extremely sturdy
construction has a very sturdy base set
weighs 12 pounds now like pretty much
every Vitamix blender out there the S 30
has a very simple dial control so
another really really nice thing about
the Vitamix is that it has a modular
design that means you can take the blade
assembly off of one jar say this just
take that pop it over onto this the
travel jar turn upside down blend it
right there and then put the cap back on
and you're ready to go so running the
show is a 840 Pequot motor that roughly
translates to about one horsepower so
you've got a pretty decent sized engine
here that's doing all the work for you
so like I said the Vitamix s30 has a
extremely high sticker price 409 dollars
that's a lot of money to spend
especially when you can just spend $40
on one of these other travel style
blenders so one of the other things
that's not so hot about this blender is
that it's not quite as powerful as some
of the other blenders made by Blendtec
or ninja also while it is dishwasher
safe and pretty easy to clean most of
the parts by hand the blade array is a
little tricky you have to actually get
in underneath the blades and it's kind
of hard to do that so you're probably
gonna be wanting to clean it in the
dishwasher only so I'm personally very
drawn to this blenders unique mix of
premium bill qua
and power but you have to pay the price
I'm Brian Bennett foreseen it and we
have just taken a first look at the
Vitamix s30</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
