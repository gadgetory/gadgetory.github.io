and let your car find a parking space
I'm Bridget Carey and this is your scene
at update how does a free mobile plan
sound too good to be true well it's real
and it's an option for Android users
starting this summer the wireless
service freedompop will offer free
smartphone plans on Android devices
here's how it works
the free part is limited it's just 500
megabytes of 4G data which could be
gobbled up pretty fast if you're
streaming videos and music the free plan
also includes unlimited text messages
and 200 Voice Minutes a month you'll
have to be really disciplined with data
and use Wi-Fi often if you want to keep
things free but even if you want a
little more data it's still crazy cheap
freedom pops CEO Stephen Stoke host
explained to me that he's planning to
have to voice plan upgrades pay six
dollars for 500 minutes or ten dollars
for unlimited minutes and as for data to
gigs just costs $18 freedompop has
scoured the u s-- phone market for
popular android phones in lake new
condition and they'll be selling these
refurbished phones to go along with the
plans for one example stokoe said they
plan to sell the HTC EVO 4G for 150
dollars without a contract customers can
also use freedompop service on an
existing sprint Android phone so how can
freedompop afford to give away plans for
free well it buys data in bulk from
Sprint and it hopes you won't mind
paying a little more for an upgrade in
fact for those that bought the company's
wireless hotspot many do pay to upgrade
the plans the paid tiers can be changed
on a monthly basis say if you need a
little more data before going on a trip
we'll know more about this service by
the end of summer the time has come for
blackberry keyboard addicts to finally
get their paws on the new blackberry
with physical keys the blackberry q10
just landed at t-mobile stores for a
down payment of $100 and verizon said
it'll have the phone in stores on Monday
June 10th for $200 with the contract
it's selling a unique white version no
word on the launch date for the other
carriers but AT&amp;amp;T is taking pre-orders
the keyboard on the q10 is the largest
black bird
bored yet so it's comfortable to type on
the technology in cars these days can
help you parallel park but adi takes it
a step further a new audio connect
service can help you find a parking
space owners of Audis with adi connect
online service can now see a list of
parking garages and lots near the
drivers destination
it displays info on the garages prices
and hours but if the garage is already
high tech it'll even show how many
parking spaces are still available that
