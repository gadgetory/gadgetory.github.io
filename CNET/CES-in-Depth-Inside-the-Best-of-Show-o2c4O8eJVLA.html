market in the u.s. a few years ago that
was missoni that was 11 interested that
was I saw that one introduced it was
this thin and it was like a technology
demonstrator yeah but this LG machine is
for real yeah this well you know that's
not a TV this is a TV and the real
coolness is that you know you get this
great picture quality but you also get
incredible dimensions so LG is talking
about a one millimeter bezel which is
the thinnest possible thing so it's
pretty much all picture the most compact
you can get from the 55 inch TV it's
also what I'm told seven point six
kilograms so math math math hey I don't
know how much that is but like 17 pounds
something like that we do a lot of
lifting televisions in and out of boxes
so that's going to help us just as a
side note I was at the sharp press
conference and they said one of their
big focuses is going to be making their
televisions lighter which I can really
appreciate any of these things around
well I guess you know this thing's like
infant hazards you know for example
people have to attach their TV to the
units so their children don't knock them
over it so having a lighted TV I don't
know if that's more dangerous or less
fingers well as a manufacturer it's also
a lot cheaper to ship those things so
everybody you know unless you're getting
free shipping from amazon it really
doesn't matter now ty there's another
new technology that's being talked about
i think it's sony is showing this one is
called what is a crystal crystal display
i believe it is it's essentially what
you see at the baseball games you know
the huge screens that they show that the
plays on shrunk down into a 55 inch
television that seems to be the magical
number this year 55 so essentially it's
little LEDs similar to what you get
behind an LCD TV but they are actually
used to display the pictures similar to
0 lead as well so I think we need a
little technology refresher here because
we are sold all the time at the stores
oh this is an LED TV tell us the
difference between an LED TV and an LED
TV ah so LED tvs that we know are
actually it's a marketing ploy so it's
it's just using LEDs like you'd get on
the power buttons of your television for
example used to light the screen itself
because LCD doesn't
mit its own might like you got in a
digital watch you actually have to press
a button to get the thing to display but
an LED TV is actually using those LEDs
as the picture as the pixels so there's
a six million LEDs in this television
Micro Micro size and it's going to be
expensive if it ever comes to market oh
you think there's a chance it won't
absolutely you know they're dead pushing
it as a prototype which I don't think
sony has done in a long time yeah this
TVs it's basically a CES kind of you
know come check us out thing they
haven't talked about marketing this
thing at all if they do it'll be really
expensive maybe between that and Oleg's
we just mentioned is the old lives are
actually shipping Samsung and LG both
you know assure us that they're going to
come out with these 55-inch oled tvs by
the end of the year LG says you know
third quarter and Sam somewhat probably
around then as well now when I I just
got a new TV and before I did I talk to
the guys have seen it about what kind of
TV I should get and they said get a
plasma set now there's only one or two
vendors I think actually making plasmas
but one of those being Panasonic and
they're they're not stepping away from
this technology is that right why is
plasma still a thing at Panasonic well
I've the main reason we like plasma TVs
is a couple of things they have
excellent screen uniformity so they they
have the even brightness across the
screen they're also superb from off
angle so as I was explaining with the
LCDs you have this backlight issue where
they shine through to the LCD and it
actually makes the picture be less
fidelity fun of buzzy yeah you miss out
on a lot of fidelity when you sit
extreme angles plasma doesn't have that
problem that's one of the couple reasons
why we like them they're also have on a
lot of the high in plasmas like the
panasonics we really like last year they
give excellent black level forms as well
so Panasonic's plasmas again I saw those
this morning in person and they look
really good they're talking about how
they've improved a lot of their picture
quality aspects deeper blacks brighter
color and addressing one of the Bugaboos
of plasma which is energy efficiency so
you know all of these things are
supposedly better for the 2012 panasonic
line and i called the st 34 master the
best value i'd ever seen pretty much in
terms of picture quality for the money
that you're going to spend its and
excellent bargain and I think plasm is
going to continue to occupy that niche
what I can see happening is that oil
adds going to come up like this and
plasma is going to go down like this
you'll see LCD start to fill up the
lower under a thousand dollars maybe
some budget plasmas as well but I leads
probably in 2015 2016 companies like LG
is saying that it's going to be the same
prices in LCD so you think that OLED
will take up the mantle as the high end
where plasma is right now plasma will
eventually finally make it exit I I
think so i think it's the kind of
technology that's probably on the back
end of its life span i mean at the end
of the day plasma is still going to give
you the best picture you can buy right
now without spending eight thousand
dollars which is what I think these old
ads are going to cost so that's still
like a really really high end technology
as I was saying you know they're
expecting it to come down pretty fast
and there's a lot of impetus to do that
because again you get the lighter
screens you get the smaller size and you
give people a chance to buy another TV
now we're looking here at TVs for the
next year or two but just for the moment
let's say that somebody is looking for a
TV today in the sweet spot which I guess
is about 46 to 55 inches let technology
would you recommend and what's about the
price point for a really good display
good value you can get excellent guys I
would say the value price point started
under a thousand dollars for 50 inch and
up screen size so you know that's where
these some of the better LCD and plasmas
are hovering right now like I was
talking about with that Panasonic st
thirty thousand dollars that's actually
got down to nine hundred dollars for a
50-inch that we gave an eight in
performance to which is excellent and
you know one of the best pictures we've
seen so that's a pretty good combination
right there but I wouldn't actually wait
for this year's TVs to come out if
you're you can always wait you know you
know in six months it's going to be
another TV you know it's an unending
cycle so if you're looking for a TV now
probably februari when these models are
going out and then once we're going to
save this show start coming in you're
going to see really cheap tvs really
good tvs yeah so I wouldn't wait for
this year's technology if you need a TV
right now that's good because I just
bought one of those well this is just so
I didn't feel bad now for you Ray thank
you so much now speaking of weird stuff
that's going into TVs so we've got four
different technologies play technologies
we've got plasma oulad crystal LED
regular old LCD actually there's more
than
and then the different ways they like
that with the old tube so i guess the
tubes are gone edge-lit and back lift oh
that's a lot of technologies to sort out
yeah and and manufacturers don't make it
clear to consumers they basically just
say hey it's led we have a big explainer
up that list the four different types of
LED backlights that are available now
and that's actually a big differentiator
for video files who want the best
picture quality out of their led-based
LCD TVs it's good to know the
differences but you know there's still a
lot of stuff out there I think of some
manufacturers do thrive on that
confusion people just go screw it I'm
going to buy you know whatever is
expensive hence our jobs manufacturers
thank you very much for young confusing
please keep it up so we can continue to
explain things the way they can
understand it thank you now panasonic in
addition to of being rolled out with
plasmas also you said they have a dual
core TV yeah this is I so crazy you know
we went through the whole dual core was
the savior of computing then it went
into our phones last year announcing our
televisions make sure it's going to be
juicers that's our juicers yeah okay
right Android juices is going to happen
essentially what the trial would is put
it past them they've tried the 3d is
really amazing they've tried the it's
got sixty percent more black which
doesn't really mean anything so they're
going for the technology angle they're
going for okay it's about a dual-core
processor but actually what it's doing
is that because there's so much
technology in there you've got a lot of
different things like Netflix having a
dual core actually makes that sort of
process a lot smoother so do we do so we
want our big displays to be basically
computers essentially how long until
they we get Android TV what we have
google TV we do yeah yeah we have right
now lenovo go announced one a couple of
days ago yeah they have an Android TV
and a couple of manufactures are still
doing Google TV LG is actually coming up
with air google TV in the next couple of
months samsung hasn't talked about
google TV but i think they will to vizio
even said no they're going to push their
google TV to follow this year so those
things are out there you know i don't
know
not people actually want them or enjoy
them we were just talking backstage and
it sounds like the actual apps built
into the TV or not that satisfying for
you Rafe and at the end of the day you
had a blow yeah broken and it's fifty
dollars and you get the same thing and
it's you know you know to worry about it
does anybody make a really good monitor
that's just a display panel that says
you can put in your signal and we're not
going to junk it up with all these apps
which we really don't know how to make
interfaces for the last thing that
really did that was supplying akiro is
what three years ago yeah they went for
out-and-out picture quality but the
problem was that people didn't buy it
because they didn't want what was in the
straight and Australian TV eleven
thousand dollars they didn't want to
spend on it didn't have features they
want big screen they want cheap and he
can't really sell a high-end TV in this
market anymore which is a shame yeah
because the upgrade cycle is mixed up i
mean the display technology that you get
today will be good for another maybe
five years maybe 10 but you know if you
buy a dual-core plasma display or built
for anything right now that's going to
be obsolete in 18 months on the outside
technologically most of the readers that
i talked to are completely unconcerned
about those sorts of things they want
the picture quality first and foremost
you know it all these extras that
manufactures add-in are a little less
relevant i think to answer your question
you know guys can't do it they can't
build these you know these tvs with just
the monitor only because they're
competing directly on a spec sheet by
specially basis with other manufacturers
and they all have stuff built in so the
market really isn't there and guys you
know if you have 61 huffing you look at
two tvs and one is a complete monitor
and you have to take the manufactures
word for it that is pure spoil a is
excellent unless it's significantly less
expensive there's really no images for
that and of course the flip side of that
is that these tvs are the expensive ones
are you know the ones that have the best
picture quality so you know they throw
in these extra features it doesn't cost
too much to throw in dual
or all that stuff into these TVs now
there is one vendor that we haven't
talked about and aren't going to hear
from here at the show when it comes to
television that's Apple yeah is it
possible the reasons that there are all
these smart functions going into the
TV's is but people are trying to get out
in front of apple and when Apple comes
along and with their whatever it is
television if they do do you think
they'll kind of eat the lunch of
everybody who's building apps in I'm so
sick of hearing about this Apple TV this
mythical television the thing is we've
got an apple TV now it's on this show
floor it's it's Samsung that's LG to
some extent we've got these features now
and what we can participate you know
imagine is going to happen in the future
is happening now yeah we've got eating
connects if you've got an xbox you can
still do those those functions so I
don't think it's worth waiting for an
apple TV you know if you want that sort
of functionality which is still fairly
better as far as you know being able to
be sold in the work the marketplace ah
yeah you can get it now don't wait three
years I think ray for one of the things
that is a little conspiracy going around
right now is the reason why these
manufacturers Samsung and LG are pushing
out 55-inch oled is because that is the
display technology that apple TV is you
know according to rumor going to be
using so Apple is not going to release a
TV and Tyrone Oracle about this earlier
they're not going to release a TV that
has mediocre picture quality they're
going to go for something that has
really good fish quality so they're
thinking is if they do that it's going
to be ola it's going to be wow i said
when people look at OLED TVs it is wow
you know you're like wow that really
that picture really does look better
than what I have at home or what I've
seen before so if you're going to if
your Apple you want that yeah now one of
the things we haven't talked about is
something that definitely is out ahead
of the curve in terms of Technology and
that is the 4k display technology which
we're hearing about from a couple of
vendors what is 4k what does that mean
to the two to the buyer what was that
movie that came out a couple of years
ago Blade Runner they actually
rereleased a digital print that was in
4k it's essentially 4000 pixels by about
two thousand pixels essentially it's a
cinema former so you've got a lot of the
digital films a lot of 3d films are
actually Sloan in the cinema in 4k yeah
so what they're trying to do is sort of
shoehorn that into a consumer television
for no real reason and
you've got a cinema sized room in your
house you don't really need for K what
it is useful for is dividing into so you
actually get full HD passive 3d
technology yeah so that's the only real
reason you so when you go see a movie
that a digital movie that's mostly and
that's in 4k today right yes again it's
for the big screen sizes and like I said
the ability to get rid of passive TV
right now is basically half resolution
on 3d so what LG told me is that they're
actually you can get full HD resolution
to both eyes if you're looking at this
passive display with 4k resolution so
that's one little selling point but at
the end of the day these are again it's
you're not going to get any content
that's 2d 4k for the near future yeah
and I heard about where was it sharp was
talking about 8k 8k and so a que has I
think about the same amount of content
for the consumer that is available as 4k
right which is to say none if you can
get the master discs of Blade Runner
maybe you can the watch full k all day
but would there be any visual visible
this difference between 4k and AK are we
down to that to what Steve Jobs called
the retina display where that's the
limit of our resolution yeah it's really
hard to see a difference for a lot of
people between 720p and 1080p so you
know when you start talking about these
resolutions that are 4 times 8 times as
high as that it's really no pay off
unless you're on a gigantic screen or
sitting and possibly posted hey we got
to wrap up and there's one thing we
didn't talk about because I hate it
which is 3d so really briefly the state
of 3d here at CES if people forgot about
it is going to be back next year what's
going on with 3d it's going to be a
function it's going to be something you
have I don't know if they have telly
text here I'm going to straight in but
telly Texas a feature it's just like a
tick box and 3d is going to be the same
I can see passive really taking off
people don't want to pay extra for
glasses if you get six pairs in the in
the box that's good and so you can watch
a 3d movie once a year maybe so you're
going to be paying for 3d TVs anyway but
yeah I think passive is the way to go
one of those features comes along with
it yeah all right so for more great TV
coverage check out cnet com and stay
tuned what's poppin on exit 44 is coming
up next ty pendlebury from CNN
kastle-meyer from Cena thank you so much
