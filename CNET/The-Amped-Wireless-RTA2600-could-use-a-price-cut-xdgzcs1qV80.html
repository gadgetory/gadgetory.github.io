from my list now this one is the second
AC 2600 mu my mo router I've seen
rivaling the ei8 500 from Lynx's I also
have here now mu my mouse a new Wi-Fi
technology promised better performance
for mix environment where there are
multiple Wi-Fi clients of different
Wi-Fi tiers and this one here is also
one of the best router from M ones I've
seen it actually allows multiple client
to work together very well without
interfering with or another
now unfortunately though comparing
apples to apples its currents will be
higher the links is here in almost all
categories from speed to reins and
expressly in terms of network storage
when is coupled with a extra hard drive
and the mega matter was at its current
price up to an $80 is some foia dollars
more expensive than the Linksys other
than that this one here is quite a
standard router with the usual four
Gigabit LAN ports and one gigabit WAN
port on the side here it has a USB 3.0
port and that another used to be 2.0
port on the back it has four detachable
antenna now note that all of them on the
backs of the back kind of crowded still
though the router is quite compact for
what it has on the inside it's equipped
with a 1.4 gigahertz dual-core
processors and 128 megabytes fresh
storage and 512 megabyte video 3 system
memory now that is top specs but
unfortunately top spec do not always
translate into top performance now for
more check out my full review Cellcom
basically if you can find this one here
for a good deal get it and you won't
regret and it's full price that I would
rather get this links is here and you
that saving a four dollars for something
else like a good nice haircut that's
right and that's because I'm don't know
what this has been the first look at the
RTA 2600 router from my list
ya have style</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
