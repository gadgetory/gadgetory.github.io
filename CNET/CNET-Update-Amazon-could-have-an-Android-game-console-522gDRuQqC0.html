Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update amazon is reportedly working on
its own android based gaming system and
this console would have its own
dedicated controller this news comes
from Game Informer and sources say that
the console would serve as a platform
for the digital games that you can
already buy off Amazon's website there
has also been buzz that Amazon is hiring
game developers android based game
consoles are just starting to come out
now there's the Ouya which plays android
games by connecting to your TV with an
HDMI cable and it comes with a
controller for a hundred dollars all the
games are free to try coming soon is the
game stick which like the name is a
stick that plugs directly into the TV's
HDMI port and it'll have a wireless
controller it costs eighty dollars and
it will be out in about two weeks
gamepop has two models one paid one free
and a seven dollar monthly subscription
gets you access to two hundred dollars
worth of android games but that won't be
out until the end of the year madcatz is
also making something called the mojo
but there are not many details yet and
then there's the Nvidia shield which is
a different beast than these others it's
a portable system with a screen built
right into the controller it plays
Android apps and games and if you own a
computer with a graphics processor that
is an nvidia gtx 650 or newer it can
stream some full pc games directly to
the console over Wi-Fi even though it's
a bit pricey at three hundred dollars
apparently it has been selling out of
its first batch but while nvidia ramps
up production on the shield the chip
maker has confirmed to cnet that has
been also busy working hard on the
surface to the next version of
microsoft's tablet and video provided
the processor for the first surface RT
but sales of the device were pretty bad
one reason being that it didn't have
outlook available at launch but
apparently it will be loaded on this
surface sequel and switching gears to
the world of video streaming Roku has a
new trick the Roku iOS app can now
stream
videos and music stored from an apple
mobile device to your TV it's Roku's
answer to Apple TV's airplay but this is
limited because it doesn't work with
computers or other apps it's just the
music and videos saved on the iPhone
iPad or iPod Touch and for those of you
that use Google Maps app on iPhones and
androids you'll now be seen
advertisements on the bottom of the map
served up with your directions this is
Google's new way of showing ads relevant
to your search and you'll see the marked
in purple that's your tech news update
and you read up on more details at cnet
