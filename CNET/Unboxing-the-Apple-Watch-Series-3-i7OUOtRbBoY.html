Series three now this year you had two
options you could buy the LTE version or
the non LTE version and since it's the
new feature this is the LTE version
we're going to see if there's anything
different inside the box now I've bought
a box cutter but it doesn't seem like
I'll need it Apple has made it pretty
easy to open this shipping box looks a
lot like what we've seen before I'm
wearing the series two on my wrist right
now try not to damage the box you'll
notice it says what watch it is on the
front and here's the instruction manual
let's see as if they have different
bands as usual here's the other size
which is what they would include in the
previous models as well I'm gonna put
this to one side and continue on this is
the Space Gray series 3 watch with a
grey band as well the crown now has a
red button on the side which is what
indicates that it's the series 3 with
LTE now we're gonna take off plastic to
reveal the Apple watch series 3 looks
nice it doesn't seem to be any thicker
than the series 2 just at first glance
it might be a little bit heavier but
that's don't quote me on that I'm not
quite sure this is the 38 millimeter
watch face and we're gonna put it to one
side to see if there's anything else
inside this box actually yeah the wall
connector and the cable everything looks
other than that pretty much the same as
in other models I would not know that
this is the LTE version had I not known
I ordered it there's nothing that
indicates cell reception until I turn it
on which we will in a later video so
stay tuned we're gonna have more
coverage on the Apple watch you can
already check out our full review at
