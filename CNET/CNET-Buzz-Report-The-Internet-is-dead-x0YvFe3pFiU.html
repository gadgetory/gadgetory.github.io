buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
Apple App Store shenanigans the rotting
of children's brains and the problem
with iPhone bars not iPhones in bars but
I'll explain later first though it's the
gadget of the week the gadget of the
week is the amazon kindle DX now with a
lower price tag and a pearlescent
graphite finish and the same old black
and white ink that's right the bigger
badder kindle is now down to three
hundred seventy nine dollars looks way
prettier and it's shipping now I say go
ahead and get one for your museum
exhibit on the time before tablets or
school I guess it's good for textbooks
and now for the news so many people
write programs for apple's app store
what can a lesser-known developer do to
stand out well according to Apple one
out-of-the-box thinker found a way hack
other people's itunes accounts and make
it look like bajillion zuv people bought
your apps alas this technique is in
technical terms illegal so Apple brought
out its trusty banhammer how'd they
catch the developer well like most
criminals he got a little greedy over
the July fourth weekend the Vietnamese
developers book apps suddenly accounted
for 42 of the top 50 books by revenue
subtle very subtle in other news iphone
4 owners are experiencing slow 3g
uploads on the AT&amp;amp;T network in some
cities this week but wait don't pause
it's not what you think ATT says the
problem is actually a software bug in 3g
wireless gear from alcatel-lucent and
alcatel-lucent said yep that is true are
bad please do not blame AT&amp;amp;T for this
one just this one time also not 18 tease
fault apple says it has made a stunning
discovery the iphone 4s reception
problems are actually happening because
the phones miscalculate the way they
display signal bars all iphones do it
actually it's a bug so like that thing
where you drop a call when you thought
you had five bars well you didn't
actually have five bars you only had to
the phone messed it up you feel better
now right and that other thing where you
hold the iphone for a certain way and
then you drop two bars well you probably
never even had those two bars to start
with this all better makes sense no word
on when you will actually stop dropping
calls or get to hold the phone however
you want are these people for real okay
in other news this week a new study from
iowa state university has found that TV
and video games cause attention problems
for children the study was published
this week and that oh go go I'm sorry
what was I doing sad news for the
Internet it's dead according to Prince
he told UK newspaper the mirror that the
Internet's completely over and all these
computers and digital gadgets are no
good they just fill your head with
numbers and that can't be good for you
and hey weirdly free CDs of princes new
album 2010 will be distributed in
Saturday's paper edition of wait for it
the mirror of the stunt prince said I
really believe in finding new ways to
distribute my music yeah so everybody be
prepared for his next album which will
be released on Betamax and packed in
boxes of Cracker Jacks and finally let's
take a look at what's clogging the tubes
this week is the octopus that predicts
world cup winners Paul the Octopus lives
in Germany and has been predicting the
outcome of the German soccer team's
matches since 2008 Paul has correctly
predicted the outcome of all five of
Germany's world cup game so far
including this week surprising defeat by
Spain

it i think spain better send in an
underwater rescue team for that little
