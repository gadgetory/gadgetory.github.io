away I'm Bridget Carey this is your
scene that update emojis are a powerful
force in our digital culture the cute
strange little icons programmed into our
smartphone keyboards are changing the
way we communicate with our friends and
marketers want a piece of the action
Domino's now let you order pizza by
tweeting out the pizza emoji icon of
course to better understand this
technology we did a deep investigation a
deep dish investigation you might say to
order by tweet you need a first set up a
Domino's profile and something called an
easy order but if you've never made a
Domino's order before you may find
yourself annoyed the only way to set
your easy order for emoji tweet ordering
is to first place a boring old school
online order and then it saves all those
details payment address toppings as your
easy order you also have to put your
Twitter account in your dominoes profile
and follow Domino's on Twitter and then
after all that's done you can send a
tweet at dominos with the pizza slice
emoji that count will send you a private
direct message asking you to confirm
with a thumbs-up emoji and that's it in
30 minutes or less it's Pizza time some
marketers are creating their own unique
emoji icons outside of what's available
in the standard emoji keyboard Star Wars
work with Twitter to make special c-3po
stormtrooper and bb-8 icons when you use
Star Wars related hashtags other brands
are taking it a step further and making
their own sticker emoji keyboards in
similar fashion to the stickers on
facebook Messenger you can download an
app that will put animated cartoon
expressions inside your keyboard to send
to friends they'll see it even if they
don't have the sticker pack because it
shows up as a photo the company Swift
has made several for different brands
including miller beer and 1 800 flowers
and these aren't always free the cutesy
Florida Gators pack costs a dollar to
download but something to keep in mind
companies love this because they can
track exactly what you're sending to
send these characters you have to go to
settings add the keyboard and give it
full access which warns you that
anything you send will be shared with
the company so beware the mms
board which can track everything you
type with its candy color keyboard the
restaurant chain Chili's isn't using
custom emojis but tech trends have
actually influenced the menu Chili's
changed its food so it looks better on
Instagram it puts an egg wash on the
burger buns to make it more photogenic
as it glistens under the lights and
since so many of us can't put down our
phones during meals KFC is experimenting
with a new type of Bluetooth keyboard
tray you can type on it without getting
your phone covered in fried chicken
grease the struggles we live with today
I tell you that your tech news update
and there's more finger clicking good at
