that costs $99 the package includes the
system one controller and an hdmi cable
if you're here wondering whether the
odds worth the money let me answer that
straight away it's not at least not yet
as luckily that we as biggest problems
our software based we are small enough
to fit into the palm of most hands and
includes hdmi micro USB full USB and an
Ethernet port it also supports Wi-Fi
Bluetooth and includes 8 gigabytes of
internal storage games must be
downloaded however you can expand
aaliyah storage with a USB drive the
games are all free to try but most will
ask for about three to sixteen dollars
from the full version the we are
controller feels Hollow and brittle
almost like it was smashed into a
million pieces if it fell on the floor
it won't do that but it just feels that
way the analog stick can be real squeaky
and the face buttons have the rare
tendency of getting stuck under the
removable battery plate the trigger
buttons are creaky and honestly don't
really feel like triggers and aren't
calibrated with enough resistance the
interface looks and feels like a proof
of concept rather than something fully
fledged and professional and crashed on
me several times there are currently no
profiles achievements or leaderboards
and non-gaming content like Netflix and
Hulu have to be siloed it from android
apk s and in my experience aren't
optimized to work with the controller
there are currently a few apps like
twitch and flixster what's there is
extremely bare-bones if you're into
indie gaming saying that's where we are
will hold its strongest appeal every is
also an Ouya development kit so
virtually anyone can make games for it
because of this you will see lots of
small unrefined efforts on the system as
well as several Android ports you'll
also see tower phone we ask killer app
it may be difficult to tell here but you
can easily lose several hours playing
this awesome local multiplayer game
seriously once you get the hang of the
game which takes all of 20 seconds you
lose yourself however even at only 99
dot who I needs many many more of these
types of experiences to be worth its
cost you can ramp up on good games add
native music and video streaming apps
fix the bugs and build out the interface
we could have a viable console here
graphically it doesn't compare with the
xbox 360 or ps3 and the controller
leaves a lot to be desired but as
biggest problems could be fixed over the
next few months here's hoping that
happens i'm eric franklin and this has
been a first look at the oh yeah</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
