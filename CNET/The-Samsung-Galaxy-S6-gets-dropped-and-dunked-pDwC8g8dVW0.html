your weekly fix of Google Isha's fresh
from WrestleMania 31 whoo got your
attention huh for everything you can
think of that's Google now let's jump
into the show and earlier in March
Google sundar Pichai revealed that
Google+ will be split up into different
services instead of keeping them
together and pretty much killing the
Google+ we know today the split starts
now with Google Drive now giving you
access to your photos that you've
uploaded directly as the Google+
dismantling begins hangouts photos in
the Google+ stream are the three areas
they are now developing independently
you can check out the new feature on the
google drive app on android and iOS or
the web in youtube news techCrunch
reports the video giant is experimenting
with 4k video running at 60 frames per
second now it's only for a handful of
videos right now and it looks like
YouTube is slowly rolling out to feature
because the computer you're using right
now may not even be able to take
advantage of the feature you'll see the
normal resolution settings available to
you and you'll see a notation if it's 4k
and 60 frames per second the current
videos range from how paint balls are
made to volcanic eruption and a 3d
rendered demo in space now you're just
going to have to believe me that this is
real 4k video right now just like how
wrestling is real true 4k content still
isn't being widely produced on YouTube
because of the cost for the hardware all
right the daily dot reports YouTube is
preparing to relaunch their live
streaming platform with the focus on
eSports and gamey it will be part of the
new launch of YouTube live and twitch
has proven how big of a business it
really is the report says the new
streaming service will make its debut at
the Electronic Entertainment Expo or III
for short in June this year the reviews
for the samsung galaxy s6 are in and
it's a winner with its bold reimagined
design that really looks awesome and
even if the curved edges on the s6 edge
don't have as much functionality this
design is really eye-catching now the
best thing is that the TouchWiz UI has
been toned down a lot and Google's
material design definitely shows through
this
around its display is top-notch and it
will be one of the most powerful phones
this year galaxy fans are going to
really love this update and eat it up
but there's also those people who buy
one just to destroy it the s6 has
already been violently thrown to the
ground a few times and although it's not
officially waterproof this test by
techsmartt appears to show it can still
turn on after being submerged for over
20 minutes just good to know if you drop
it in the toilet and leave it there for
over 20 minutes alright acc sent out an
invite for an event upcoming on april
eighth that is anything but a secret
it's expected they'll reveal the HTC One
m9 plus which is not to be confused with
the e 9 plus or the regular ACC One m9
since you aren't already confused
already not too much is known with the
m9 plus other than it will come likely
in different colors a rounded home
button rests on the bottom between the
speaker and it will be powered by a
MediaTek 64-bit processor and gfx bench
has now revealed two new benchmarks for
unreleased hardware up to this point a
device codenamed sony e 6553 is believed
to be the new z4 with a 5.1 inch 1080p
display an octa core snapdragon 810
processor and the 19 megapixel camera
for still and 1080p video recording now
Sony's mobile blog also says they will
be rolling out android 5.0 lollipop
updates for their z3 + z2 phone and
tablet products we also showed you
leaked pics of the LG g4 last week and
its presence on the gfx bench benchmarks
revealed some of its specs including a
5.5 inch 2560 x 1440 display 3 gigs of
ram in a 15 megapixel rear camera runny
lollipop as well but if the leaks are
correct it also reveals LG will be going
with a snapdragon 808 processor and not
the 810 which has been rumored to have
ongoing overheating issues all right
that's going to do it for this week's
show you can always email us at google
issues at cnet com or tweet me at brian
Tong and i'll respond thanks for
watching we'll see you all next time for
some more of that Google isha's
