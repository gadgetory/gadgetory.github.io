switches is that it gives you control
over your lights when you're not at home
like the Wi-Fi enabled Belkin Wemo light
switch that I review a couple years ago
but this version is a little bit
different than that it costs less at 40
bucks
and it's actually battery-powered and
magnetic so there's no installation at
all required that makes this really
appealing at first glance because you
don't have to get behind this you don't
to deal with the circuit breaker you
literally just snap it and the magnets
connect to these screws here and you're
done that's really simple it also has a
really intuitive app and allows for
on-and-off controls and lets you set
timers but that's really it and that
makes it pretty limited ultimately even
though the installation is a huge plus
it's also kind of loud and it currently
doesn't integrate with any third-party
devices although amazon alexa
integration is in the works so if you do
happen to prioritize ease of install
over everything else with smart light
control this is a reasonable option it's
limited by the fact that it has
bluetooth and not Wi-Fi and that makes
it ultimately tough to recommend most
people especially if you're interested
in remote light access</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
