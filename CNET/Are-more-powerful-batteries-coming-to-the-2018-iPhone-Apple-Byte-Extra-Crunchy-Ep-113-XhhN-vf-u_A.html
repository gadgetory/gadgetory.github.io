let's get to the show hello everybody on
the planet earth my name is stephen
beach and producer for the Apple byte
extra crunchy podcast with your host mr.
Brian Tong what's up everybody welcome
to the show it is episode 113 Apple byte
extra crunchy keeping it Monty we've got
all you munchies in the chat rooms going
off right now we also want to let you
know just if you want to be a part of
this amazing show because you're the
ones that make it pop call us whenever
you want any time of the day something
pops from your mind you're like in this
you know when you do your best thinking
in the shower
I'm not saying think about it's in the
shower but you might be I know some of
y'all are like that but just call us
same type of people are the people that
are like Google sucks
Samsung sauce they're like on one
platform they don't think that there's
anything else better out there and I'm
like there's amazing shows there's so
many like legit free movies like I'm
stupid I've paid for I just paid to
watch or to rent a rival maybe like two
weeks ago and then I turned on thinks
Amazon Prime for getting the app out
late I turn on Amazon Prime videos app
and guess what's one of the free videos
because I'm a Prime member arrival Oh
bro I watched that weeks ago yeah yeah
that's on Amazon Prime it like they have
awesome documentaries - there's a lot of
great stuff on Amazon kids kids TV shows
a lot of them so I usually my boy Gil
Cabrera loves Grand Tour season two
coming out from the guys the top tier
family I mean that's that's worth
watching if you're into that I know I
think Amazon Prime was the first to roll
out the wire one of the greatest TV
shows of all time in HD on their service
as well so just kind of cool stuff like
that anyways check it out I want to know
if you guys like it or not but there's
plenty free content is free content I
don't know what anyone's complaining
about yeah
what's what's the problem here also um
updates to TV OS flew in here we have TV
OS 11.2 what does that help do the cool
thing is that the Apple TV now does
right with this TV OS the am sorry I'm
jumping around a second the Amazon Prime
video app supports 4k and HDR content
which is cool and also it is plugged
into Apple's kind of up next feature in
the TV app and if those of you are like
what is the TV app Apple has this kind
of like the watch app that queues up
apps that are connected like anything
you watch on iTunes movies or TV shows
things from like the CW app and certain
apps that are plugged in the Amazon
Prime video app is plugged in it'll show
you where you left off on your most
recent shows and videos and movies and
then you can jump into it it's weird
that they call it the TV app because you
watch movies and TVs on the TV app I
always found it just be a confusing name
they shouldn't even call it that cause
something different
yeah I don't know it's kind of confusing
yeah also no longer confusing the actual
Apple TV app is now available for users
in the UK France and Germany that wasn't
the case initially it rolled out in the
US and then I believe Australia was
getting it early as well but this comes
down to like rights in different
companies and distribution for content
UK France and Germany almost a year
after Apple announced the service it's
now available for you guys on your Apple
TV I'm surprised about that I know they
aren't happy about their own plenty of
bad apples already the other thing that
I did jump ahead to accidentally is with
TV OS 11.2 we saw a lot of software
updates this week we will get to more of
that but TV OS 11.2 brings a couple new
features to the Apple TV as well there's
this new HDR feature and framerate
feature basically in the video settings
you can select to match the original
content and what was happening in the
first run of Apple TVs about 2 months
ago when they first launched it content
that was not an HDR that was like maybe
even something like watching Batman The
Dark Knight through an app because it
wasn't an HDR it was it was trying to
kind of artificially create this high
dynamic range and the images were really
blown out it looked really crappy so now
you can actually choose for it to match
the content which is a good thing you
want to switch that on and then the
other feature you have is to match the
framerate and that's also important
because then content that is shown will
show in its native framerate that makes
a difference when you're watching you
know TV shows to movies and other types
of content whether it's on YouTube or
whatnot so that that's good to know all
although YouTube still doesn't show 4k
content on the Apple TV that they need
to fix that ASAP still cannot watch 4k
content on YouTube what are they doing
aren't they in like a little battle
right now YouTube and was it YouTube and
who was on it was Amazon YouTube sorry
my bad yeah YouTube and Amazon are
pooping on each other I mean right now
YouTube is not allowing fire TV products
to
get access to the YouTube app anymore it
basically doesn't work because Amazon is
being a d-bag and they're not selling
Google home and I believe they're not
selling the nest as well but definitely
they're not selling Google home products
which stream video so they're just like
basically pissed off at each other
because they're both dumb they should
just make it happen
but they app they did a similar thing
with Apple when they were promoting
their fire TVs Amazon took off Apple TVs
and chromecast that's from Amazon and
prevented them from being sold and then
basically trying to force people to be
like oh the fire TV platform is the only
one that's out there yeah we're smarter
than that
so people complain and then Apple TV and
chromecast and it actually notes at
least Apple TV is back on the Amazon
storefront so yeah I'm still waiting for
Amazon to get chromecast support and I
feel like that's never gonna happen
you know so I guess I have to get a fire
TV but whatever don't you have a fire
already
I have like I don't have I don't have a
fire TV but I have a Kindle and you know
I'm pry and all that stuff I'll play
you're all play you're in the Amazon you
cuz it's Chloe well I mean all of them
man
I to or you know Apple Google Amazon I'm
in all of them like a little bit in each
of them what about Netflix how you still
not on Netflix right no no but I'm
accepting Netflix Netflix gifts for
Christmas I am accepting that hey check
this out this is the first time I've
ever heard this comment in the periscope
chatroom i'll Rosato v says there's a
skunk on my head first time I've ever
heard that alright let's get into iPhone
news this one's kind of cool not not a
surprise because this has happened
multiple years Flickr posted their top
devices of 2017 based on what devices
are posting obviously the great photos
it's kind of flickers year-in-review the
top device types in 2017 number one
taking 50% of that chunk is smartphones
number 2 at 33% DSLR cameras number 3 at
12% point-and-shoot cameras well
probably isn't probably my mom
and a number four and number four at 4%
mirrorless cameras which are on the rise
without a doubt you've got like the Sony
a7 line and and up mirrorless cameras
are on the rise and are amazing but they
haven't become like buzz worthy to the
general consumer yet if you want to talk
about the top brands in 2017 using
Flickr 54% of users posting photos were
Apple 23% were Canon and 18% were Nikon
hmm so this is really just a Android in
there or Google or anything huh yeah it
didn't make that a topless and I think
the perception has been also if you
think about it it's not that it could be
Android it would be like Samsung Google
LG right they didn't clump them together
because that's not how they're
identifying them in this survey but you
know there's been this idea for years
and it was true that the iPhone had the
best camera but I think now you could
argue in a lot of different ways
different you know depending on what
you're looking for in a camera the LGB
30 arguably has the most control you'll
find in a camera the Google pixel to
camera has the best overall sensor
I even like how the pixel handles
portrait mode better than the iPhone in
many cases but it again it comes down it
just depends but look these are all
great cameras it kind of just comes down
to what you're looking for I mean you
guys in the chat might have a different
idea but at least according to Flickr
the Apple platform is the number one
used top percentage of photographers at
54% it's kind of cool that's cool
kind of kind of interesting in other
iPhone news that I wish came earlier
sim-free iPhones unlocked sim-free
iPhone tens are now available from the
Apple online store in the US this is a
big deal everyone was looking for
unlocked phones guess what they ended up
just aligning with the carrier that they
wanted and so that's how the carriers
were able to kind of benefit from that
because if you get an unlocked phone
you're buying it directly from Apple
it's not dealing with any carriers and
people were frustrated about that there
were kind of ways to go around that if
you were right technically a Verizon and
sprint phones really more with Verizon
you could essentially buy it sign up for
like a three gig data plan if you didn't
already and then cancel that plan and
then you could use that phone with other
carriers I think the main advantage here
though to let people know is the
unlocked version of the phone includes
the Qualcomm modem and we've talked
about on this show about the Intel modem
performance versus the Qualcomm modem
performance how it first was an issue in
2000 or sorry with the iPhone 7 and
there's gonna be a lot of you that say
who cares you guys are only making a big
deal about this I don't think it's a big
deal I think it's actually important to
know that once one I guess type of
version of the phone actually without a
doubt there's no doubt about it performs
better because of the modem inside Apple
has had this ongoing legal battle with
Qualcomm they complain that Qualcomm's
pricing was gout they were price gouging
them Qualcomm says Apple is throttling
down their mode of performance so it
wasn't as good and at the same time
Apple has every right to try and get
their phones similar in performance with
each other but you got to check out this
article from PC Mag they did an
exclusive with cellular insights this is
a company that broke down the
performance of the Intel versus Qualcomm
modems in the iPhone 7 and ultimately
the data came back and Qualcomm's iPhone
10 modems still outpaces Intel now what
they're basically testing here is the
speed of the LTE band for download
speeds that you have and in most cases
when as they're reducing the signal
power and basically the signals getting
weaker you'll see how the Qualcomm modem
is always just edging the Intel modem
which is alright but then when it comes
down some really really weak signals and
this is what I remember feeling from day
one when I got the iPhone 7 places where
I had one bar or two bars of signal I
was able to easily get a signal in my
previous like iPhone 6 is and all that
but in San Francisco specific
once I got to those areas with the
iPhone 7 there are times where I
couldn't even get a signal or
little-to-no LTE data anymore and then
reports had later come out that there
were two different modems the same thing
is happening with the iPhone 10 and
ultimately if you want the best
performing and it's not gonna change be
a big big difference but it does still
make a difference oh yeah it does still
make a difference the Qualcomm power to
Intel modem is part number a one eight
six five that's sold by Sprint Verizon
and US Cellular and the Intel based
modems part number a one nine zero one
are from AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile so the third
model is a one 902 is only sold in Japan
but those are Intel based modems so
that's just the bottom line I'm not
trying to like make you feel bad like
you have a crappy iPhone you don't well
maybe you do but you don't have a bad
iPhone it's just that there's gonna be
the slight differences that are
noticeable specifically when you have
when you're in a lower signal area so
just something to chew on yeah I've
definitely noticed my phone struck like
I had better reception on like the
iPhone 5 than I did with the iPhone 6 I
felt like you know like I felt like I'm
losing connectivity especially like
going across the Bay Bridge every day
and stuff like there's definitely dead
spots on the Bay Bridge that I would
notice more now that I have this phone
so yeah I mean it's hard to say but you
know this is clear representation of
that and I'm curious if people are you
know we talked about on the show and
people don't dispute us on that either
because I feel that the listeners and
the viewers are experiencing similar
things and it's just something that you
just know about and I'm not gonna get
all mad and shake my fist at Apple
because I have I'm on AT&amp;amp;T like that it
is what it is I'm gonna move on but it's
something that we should just point out
and let people know you know yeah that's
all because this is kind of like a
little more nitty-gritty inside baseball
stuff compared to what we do on our
normal show alright let's go over to
talk about Apple pay cash finally rolled
out this week very cool I noticed a lot
of people that I know haven't even
activated the actual feature
like you have to flip the switch on to
get Apple pay cash turned on people kind
of made fun of me because on my Twitter
I told them about my experience I had
never I don't care if people say shame
on you I never turned on two-factor
authentication on my phone so I had to
do that but also I did like type in my
the last four digits of my social
security number then I had to scan my
driver's license front and back and then
enter in my entire social security
number I was like what why and I know
it's because you're technically with
Apple pay cash creating an actual like
you're actually kind of trading like
they're your another credit card but it
was weird for me to be like do I really
want to do this and I just yeah yeah
that's like venmo you just like you just
log into your bank account like you
think at all like sets itself up and
like what is a PayPal is kind of similar
so I that feels weird having to put in
your social security and all that stuff
and I get it it's because you're getting
authorized for a new card essentially
that I'm not gonna really use and people
in the chatroom just said yeah no Apple
pay cash in Canada like stop complaining
but I had to put a lot of my info in
there in order to flip the switch and
then the best the funniest thing about
it is I have not
other than testing it once or twice for
fun I still have yet to use Apple pay
cash but I've already used been mode
three times oh so you know venmo if
people are used to it it's more
Universal the platform's their Apple
Capac Apple pay cash is only available
in the US and only iOS so it's it's
obviously limited right now they're
hoping to expand it but don't tell me
that iOS is gonna just Apple pay cash is
gonna take over all of a sudden I wonder
if that's gonna do like a check on your
credit report you know like when you get
a new credit card they have to check
your credit report so I'm wondering if
your credit report is affected at all by
that well if I get tonight in a week or
so and they say oh yeah sorry are bad
then I'll let that'll tell you how good
my credit report is way way it didn't
happen right away like you did it I got
a I got a st. if they like decide to
take it back or or Apple watch it this
shows like let's look and let's look in
the system I mean I wouldn't put it past
them we're gonna
revoke his credit revoke my credit okay
check this out Apple says they posted
this on their developer website oh I owe
s11 is now installed on 59% of devices
of iOS devices which is you know Apple
has always had great adoption rates I'm
going to also say if people could revert
back to iOS 10 on their earlier iPhones
they would but they kit a lot of them
can and it can be tricky and it's kind
of a pain in the ass and it's not always
it's not always like oh and you can't
just flip the switch you got to do a
couple things to even get back to that
point um but here's the thing like this
iOS 11 we've talked about it before and
I need a reinforces iOS 11 is the
buggiest
iOS we have ever seen hands down and it
just continues I'm gonna do a little
we're gonna do a little history check
and this is only this is week after week
bug after bug I talked about it but here
I can break down the bugs specifically
so you so just to put it out in a list
and you guys and gals could be like wow
this is horrible alright so we had I Oh
s 11 rollout in iOS 11 had the eye bug
that was where the letter I was auto
corrected to like an A with a space with
a question mark or an exclamation mark
and it was affecting people for a long
time so they had that bug hey guess what
they released app you know a fix to iOS
11.1 but guess what they weren't over
don't there's another one good there's
another one so then Apple had this whole
crack Wi-Fi vulnerability that gave
access to you know your network and
potential files so then they had to
update point 1.1 that so 11 point 1.1
you'd be like all right we're good and
this is like week after week some of
these were within days of each other
eleven point one point one had the it
and is bug where for some people if you
typed it in what's up Belgium if you
typed it in
it would autocorrect it to I dot T or I
dot s so guess what do we want another
patch of course we want another patch
eleven point one point two came out so
what happened with that one
I want to hear another one another one
thank you
eleven point one point two was out for
this cold weather fix remember people's
phones won't work in the cold yeah all
right
people's phones working in the cold
eleven point one point to fix that then
a new another bug popped up another look
eleven point two was released early
because there was a looping bug that
would cause basically phones to loop and
potentially crash once December the
second hit okay so eleven point two was
pushed out early to fix that bug but
what did that cause everyone's like I
got eleven point two I'm supposed to
have Apple pay cash
Apple pay cash was delayed and rolled
out later which came out this week and
the reason why is because they needed a
fix the December 2nd loop bug so they
pushed out eleven point two quick but
we're still not done we're still love
them yes what another one oh my gosh
eleven point two has this zero day iOS
homekit vulnerability that allows people
to get remote access through iOS eleven
point two to your smart accessories so
we're time I like locks lights
it doesn't stop and Apple has
acknowledged this and Apple is going to
address this in a future fix but yeah
I'm just I'm just gonna wait for the
next one dude that's because it's coming
okay good good good I still am on ten
man my wife went to eleven she's
reporting all kinds of issues and you
know the first two that you spoke about
the you know the letters the eye bugs
yeah those were like massive public
visible embarrassing bugs right I mean
like it's all over twin
I still see it like people who haven't
updated their phones I still see it
that's a huge one I mean it's so it's so
silly too but then just this whole
string of them happening at all in
succession I thought my job was
stressful but whoever's working on iOS
11 Apple probably has the most stressful
job right now
well I remember I'd like someone at my
police officer or someone in the
military or something you know I
remember a couple years ago there were
stories how about there was a mass
exodus of talent in relationship to
security and software and and
specifically bug issues and I don't know
if this is directly linked to that I I
have to assume it's part of that it's
part of having new employees that may
not be as familiar with iOS and it's
nuances look I can't do this but I to
here that list of bug after bug after
bug and them being bugs that are so
significant that you had to release an
update after update after update after
update like we had eleven eleven point
one eleven point one point one eleven
point one point one point two eleven
point two so we're probably have like
eleven point two one I hope we don't
have an eleven point two to eleven point
two three like you know it's it sounds
ridiculous it's funny I'm watching the
chatroom and Zoey
Wakasa I'm not sure where he's from but
he puts in he put in just like the bug
number it's like eleven point two point
oh one point zero one one point zero one
one one this is where we're at now Apple
world come on Apple biters you can't
stand it's depressing so I'm in a bad
apple I'm just depressed about it's like
oh my gosh this is what it's coming to

no I'm serious it's like you're like
shut it you're like just you want to
tell yourself to just shut up give
yourself some silent treatment that's
for it's for everyone's benefit all
right let's check this out I'm just kind
of some new we're always having new
future iPhone what is coming out what
could be coming out
we heard the reports from a min Chico at
digit times a couple weeks ago how the
next idea or thinking or planning from
Apple is to release three iPhone models
in 2018 that will be roughly based off
of the pretty much design wise look like
the current iPhone 10 there will be
three sizes a 5.8 inch iPhone which is
the current one a 6.1 inch LCD based I
phone and then a 6.5 inch larger OLED
model that can be thought of like the
iPhone 10 plus but we'll see what they
call it I don't know if they're gonna
call it the iPhone XS
iPhone 11 who knows we'll see we'll find
out we'll play the guessing game later
but this new report says that again from
being Chi quo that next year's new
iPhone tens or whatever they call them
could feature up to 10 percent more
battery if Apple and LG Chem are able to
deploy this one cell design battery now
we know that in the iPhone 10 there's
kind of this l-shaped battery that
enabled them to use more space and to
bring more battery life I still think
the iPhone 10's battery runs faster than
my previous iPhone 7 it just does I
think it does it's doing so many things
that it doesn't I don't feel on a day to
day that I get better battery life out
of my iPhone 10 I could be wrong maybe
I'm different you think it's it's it's
using all its energy faster you're
saying I feel like my battery goes down
about an hour or two quicker than I mean
more like an hour clicker than it
normally did but maybe just cuz you know
I'm taking a lot of selfies with a
portrait portrait mode I'm gonna blame
portrait mode but anyways this new
report because right now the l-shaped
battery in the current iPhone 10 is - 2
batteries basically they're it's 2 cells
they're saying that they could optimize
this and give us more battery juice if
they are able to create a singular
l-shaped single cell battery and that is
what the goal is for sometime in 2018
we'll see but again these are
power-hungry devices they do more than
they've ever done before which is cool
but at the same time it just give me the
juice is loose
I wish the number one innovation that I
want to see is in battery tech I want
someone if Apple gave us a freaking
iPhone that lasted three days or two
days even let's just say legitimately
two days straight I think people would
pee themselves oh yeah this battery
looks kind of funny too it looks you
know it looks kind of hacked together a
little bit it does and you want to hear
another I want to hear another rumor huh
with the iPhone 3 iPhones released in
2018 and two of them are expected like
we talked about to be OLED models with
one of them being the LCD model which we
also joked about how
lower pixel per inch and I said I called
it the iPhone blurry and people were
legitimately offended by that they
called me names they didn't like made it
yeah they're like Oh PPI it's not even
that much blurrier you guys are just
full of blue oh go back to blah blah
blah ladyboy you know I get it all I
don't even now bad oh I think it's funny
I'll I mean honestly bring it I all I do
is then I just comment on their crappy
YouTube profile pics like some dude was
like complaining about my shirt and then
he wore this like his picture was him in
a suit with like a clown tie like it was
so big it looks so bad
I just had a comment on it I'm like
thanks for the fashion advice nice clown
tie it was like then he was probably
like oh my god Brian Tom commented on my
youtube video anyways back to the show
back to and we're getting distracted by
commenters I need to focus drawers
someone right in the chat room just said
trolls with citing a source close to the
company's product designs Nikkei Nikkei
the Asian outlet says that the LCD model
could feature a metal back like the
iPhone 7 - plus I would see like
yesterday that they're talking about
going back to metal I'll bring in metal
back hey you know I don't want all that
crappy glass hey I just made that up I
don't even know what I'm doing cuz as
soon as in now it's like the Glatt the
back of the iPhones gonna be glass
everyone's like well I'm just gonna
break him yeah like what the hell now
does the metal does having a metal back
help with antenna you know catching
signals of room in the antenna I mean it
really comes down to the wire of the
intent I think the thing that a metal
back prevents though is a wireless
charging you kind of need a glass
conductive surface to be able to be like
if it's depending on the type of metal
it won't it won't be able to get to
charge through that I see hence the
glass vacuums of these devices so we
will see we will see but that's just
another rumor that's been thrown out
right now cool cool cool all right
I just wanted to do a little rest in
peace just you know pour some liquor out
for the Mack the 2011 Mac Mini is now
Apple has added it to their models of
its vintage and obsolete product list
Wow the 2011 mid mid 2011 Mac Mini look
we haven't seen a Mac Mini update I
think in almost like three years and I
Tim Cook did respond to an email a few
months ago that the Mac Mini was still
an important part of our product lineup
even though we haven't done anything
with it for three years because they
completely ignored the Mac and thought
everyone just wanted a superpower
supercharged $5,000 iMac pro that's I
that's what they're doing right now and
it clearly showed what they were
thinking and remember they had to go
back and say okay we're gonna make a
modular customizable Mac Pro in the
future when this year guess what came
out and you know this products been
worked on for at least two three years
because that's how they plan ahead their
vision of the new pro Mac was an iMac
Pro sad without any customized
availability for PCI cards for audio for
capture like everything you could think
of for high-end pro users more
expandable slots for memory so at least
for the Mac Mini we're gonna pour a
little shoutout to goodbye my Mac Mini
goodbye Mac Mini your your 2011 to some
slow fades
you're so good all right you're so good
we got it
we gave them we canvassed do proper
send-off proper setup all right in the
last story before we get to our awesome
calls y'all ready for this new emojis Oh
everyone loves emojis there's no one
that now everyone doesn't love an emojis
not yeah yet but everyone loves emojis
so check this out
the Unicode consortium published what
are the proposed emojis that will be
coming in 2018 these are not confirmed
yet they basically throw up a long list
I think even if you um I think if you
click on that link that says the
announced or whatnot I can't remember so
linked there's a second link in the
document that I have I believe
candidates for inclusion it shows a long
long list of all the proposed ones but
some of them include like a softball a
cupcake I want I have always wondered
where a cupcake is cuz I don't know if
like you guys like like the cupcake your
girl you'd be like oh why you cupcake in
me
you know close and flirty like oh I want
a cupcake you a cupcake cute yeah yeah I
want you to come watch you cupcake your
wife nice to be like be like what are
you doing like I'm cupcaking
I want to know what she says seriously
can you do that for me I want to know
should be like get away no yeah you know
I kissing on a little the cheek and I'll
be like oh what's up baby it's like Oh
what are you doing like suck cupcake in
me I don't see a use for the Swan the
teddy bear maybe the teddy bear I don't
see a use for the mango no use of the
mango the mango yeah that that's cool
but the sewing you know the other side
there's thread they they are finally
showing a redhead some love they're
gonna release a redhead their proposed
redhead emoji so all of you redheads
that were furious about lack of
representation in in the emoji world you
you should expect to get that in 2018
gingers unite and then I also saw that
you're gonna be able to spin emojis
around so you can potentially
potentially you're going to be able to
reverse the direction of them because it
kind of changes the context of like you
know like I mean I'm not joking about
but you know the gonna mode to you and
you're like blank to blank or the traine
emoji like you want to go a certain way
or the
running emoji like there's times where
flipping the emoji is very important
yeah that's innovation right there I
want to flip the eggplant a specific way
so it can be directed at a specific
person yeah
eggplant eggplant peach square score
score that's important they're pointed
in the right direction as the squirt and
the peach the sad face poop I don't know
about that one that one's looks kind of
depressing to me well the only sad thing
yeah what happened is they also have
removed some of the emojis that were
proposed and they may come back at a
later time but the frowning poop emoji
will not be part of 2018 guaranteed this
should be part of 2017 I don't even know
why you need to put a frown on a poop
emoji like really yeah is it a poop
emoji already crappy enough it is it's
pretty crappy like is that like super
crappy if you do like a frown poopoo
face the poo poo the poo poo emoji is
like it's a it's a cultural phenomenon
because I know my kids are just they
love it you know they have like little
plushy poop emoji toys and stuff yeah
it's really you know it's a big thing
there's also I don't know if you have
that initial emoji article I'll right
now but I guess if at the very bottom of
it it there's a part that talks about is
11.2 emoji changelog basically what they
did is if you click on that they change
the tumbler glass that has like some
whiskey in it or scotch
is actually scotch or whiskey oh I can't
find it what was it called again um let
me send you this right now so people
that are watching can see it right so
yeah I got it for you so basically this
this posting is showing that they
changed the tumbler glass on the ant has
been given like a more cartoony look in
on iOS 11.2 these are tweaks that
they've done it has like a bigger booty
and like a bigger head it looks like
more cartoony and then the camera that
they're using an iOS 11.2 is is less
like a canon point shoot and more like a
Leica camera it actually even looks more
like an old-fashioned camera pointed
shoot from back in the day so the globe
has been tweaked a little there's just
like little
adjustments the fork and knife have been
given a more metallic look like these
are really important things that Apple
is working on instead of all the bugs
that are what did i OS freakin 11 yeah
this is very important stuff your idea
sheen on the silverware like a sheen now
kind of congrats congrats to that Sheen
your phone doesn't work in the cold yeah
all right so I think we should just hit
up our voicemails and see what the
people got to say let's do it thank you
guys for calling we had a few good
voicemails this week let me remind ya
1-866 268 I think with the holiday
season people are like trailing off but
also we do get the most calls when huge
product launches happen but I think
there's a lot of stuff that's happening
before the end of the year I did the
iMac Pro is expected to come out by the
end of the year so let us know what you
think about just Apple in general right
now are you feeling good about it going
into 2018 or not I'm really curious
about that yeah they're also supposed to
get a big tax break man if that bill
passes okay and then it affects the rest
of the frickin world Oh fifty million
dollar tax break or something to all the
Ritchie Ritchie snow no give it to the
people the people deserve another
Ritchie's the people all right here
number number one call number one hey
Brian this is Andrew from Newtown
Pennsylvania and I've had a quick
question when is the nest going to come
to home cat you know like if or when or
give any ideas as to when it would come
yeah no it's just really annoying me cuz
I love the nest
I know it's Google and everything but
like there's no reason as to why it
shouldn't be there considering I Apple
has nothing like they don't have a
thermostat that's and my other thing is
how is the Amazon Prime what's up cuz oh
yeah I'm prime already came yeah well he
had everyone's been asking honestly the
number one question I've been asked
lately as when Amazon Prime video app is
coming out so it came out in response to
the nest obviously the Apple app works
with or Apple's iOS system has an app
but I've got assume he's talking about
voice controlling it and being able to
talk to it
look it's a Google product and I don't
expect them to make it play nice any
time soon but we'll see I mean they did
before it does work I use it through the
app but I don't I use Alexa I'm on
Amazon man I'm on the echo platform it
is by far the best for any smart home
devices so we'll see if they make it a
little more friendly I don't know I
don't expect it to though yeah Apple
Google they they don't like each other
they don't like each other
okay next call David calling from Jersey
love the show I can get the iPhone 10 if
I want I get the 256 gig you know the
one that's over $1,200 but then I was
thinking you know what I can really use
a new laptop instead why don't I get a
new laptop instead of the ice one 10-1
seven-plus works just fine so if you had
to get if you had the choice of getting
any Apple laptops right now which one
would you get within the same type of
price that a fully loaded iPhone 10
would cost I went on the Apple website
and I was looking at the different
models and you know there was nothing
there that really got me too excited so
should I maybe go outside the Apple
ecosystem and look at something else
I use it laptop for a lot of different
stuff I'm kind of a power user editing a
lot of spreadsheets a lot of research a
little bit of everything so it would
have to be something pretty powerful and
I noticed that you don't even get 16
gigs ram standard in any of these the
MacBook Pros so you know should I be
looking elsewhere what would you
recommend well thanks a lot love the
show appreciate it fine so my man
thanks for calling and love that call
here's the thing right he's talking
about a fully loaded iPhone is or iPhone
10 is around 1200 bucks the only laptop
that is even remotely close to 1200
bucks is a sorry I'm popping my ears
because they're plugged up is the
book 13-inch without a touch bar and I
thought it was really interesting how he
said you know there's nothing really
compelling on the site and I a hundred
percent agree the touch bar is not a
compelling product like if I'm gonna
drop what I think it starts at $23.99
for a MacBook Pro with a touch bar and
I'm forced to have the touch bar which
is honestly junk it's a junk feature
that is unnecessary makes things
actually harder to do it takes longer to
do things it's not responsive there's no
touch physical touch some of the
features in it are like I'm never gonna
use that to edit video so this day I've
never used it to scrub through video
it's it's weak it's it's weak and I felt
that way right when I saw it but I kind
of I was tempered with it but as I've
used it I'm like this is this is all the
lamest innovation that we've seen from
Apple's so you could look outside the
box or if you're not urgently looking
for a computer I'd wait it out and see
if maybe they kind of retract back on
this whole touch bar thing the biggest
issue with Apple's laptops as well is
because of the processor family that
they're using right now it doesn't
support the higher capacity DDR Ram so
that's why they're not loaded at 16
that's expected to come sometime in 2018
so we'll see what happens but I think it
really it's sad when the MacBook Pro
used to be literally one of the most
attractive pieces of hardware Apple ever
had and I think he represents a lot of
fans that are like oh there's nothing
really that special going on with the
MacBook Pros right now and I would
totally agree I would totally agree not
even from a power base a power user
perspective
who cares if it has a touch we're not
from a power users perspective it's not
even there with the juice either so um I
feel yeah yeah I'm actually looking at
the refurbished models and they do have
some decent models priced at 1099 so I
mean you know if you're gonna buy a new
it wouldn't be new but get a refurbished
model that's a great point
yeah and it's it's cheaper it's tested
from the factory and then they test it
again and you know when they do the
refurbishing you also have the same
warranty coverage as buying one brand
new ya and I'm seeing a lot of these
with with
the the power you know the what is it
called the screen the little what are
you calling again sorry ultimately
ultimately if you want a laptop for a
power user you pretty much have to go to
the 15 inch touch bar entry-level model
yeah you know they have some 12 inch - I
like kind of like a smaller laptop yeah
like I like I like the portability small
ones but if you're doing any type of
video editing like automatically I say
go get a 15 inch laptop in the long run
it pays off it just does it just does so
I would yeah I would hold onto that
money right now a period
I wouldn't even spend it man go buy a
Bitcoin with it ah she can't afford a
bitch geez right now for one Bitcoin
right yeah it's crazy this is crazy okay
we got one more call here we go what's
gonna be some song Tyler from Hotlanta
coming at you the guys asking about the
home pod I bought our first Google home
mini and man these things are so cheap
they're awesome I mean I'm probably get
from multiple rooms in my house well my
question is do you think that Apple
might be gearing up for a Apple home pod
mini for March to come out with the
Apple home of now the home pod itself
just thought of asked chat later freedom
freedom freedom uh you know what I think
that we we've talked about it a little
bit and someone had brought up the idea
of having a Apple home pod mini and I
think it sounds great but at the same
time why would you want to get that
because it's gonna be the most limited
voice assistant I'm sure it'll work in
the Apple ecosystem but you're only
going to at least from what we know at
the moment be able to get access to
Apple music as a native service built
into it and really of all the three
voice assistants it's the most limited
and weakest voice assistant of the three
so because of that that's just not
compelling to me right it's not gonna be
cheaper than the Google home mini and
it's not gonna be cheaper than the
Amazon echo I think you're better off
getting an echo jump people that want to
jump on the smart home platform right
this holiday season is the best time to
join there were crazy Black Friday deals
even right now the newest Amazon echo
version 2.0 normally ninety-nine bucks
it's like 79 bucks the Google home
regular station is 79 bucks and then
both the echo Docs and Google home minis
are 29 bucks a pop each like if there's
any time to give this smart home thing a
try and trust me you won't regret it
it's amazing we're now is the time to do
it and that's also I made a point
earlier that Apple is missing this whole
holiday season boat they're all deeply
discounted and people are not people
that are in the know shouldn't there's
no reason to wait for what Apple is
doing because it's not gonna be better
they're really positioning the home pot
is a sound product a better audio
product that's fine but I think people
are looking for smarter products instead
of a speaker that sounds good that has a
dumb a dumber AI than the other two yeah
that's more expensive too so Wayne it's
just not nearly as compelling for me as
a consumer when you lay all the facts
out like it's just not as compelling so
Chris Wesley and the chat room says loll
you keep turning my echo on wall every
telling Alexa Alexa Alexa don't be that
guy come on alright I know you like it
you like to just mess with people anyway
that's all she wrote man that's it that
is all alright everybody um we just want
to give you a little a heads up I
believe if I'm correct a beach just a
little early news December 22nd will be
our last show for the holiday season is
that correct that's correct for the for
2017 December 22nd will be our last show
but we're gonna record it we're
recording on the 21st right sure sure
yeah yeah 21st so you can watch it live
21st and then we will post it will be
22nd and then we'll be gone for a month
because of travel and vacation and CES
we'll return in a month after that we'll
let you guys know again but I just want
to throw that out there also remember be
a part of this show keep us alive call
us we love
I think the calls are kind of some of my
favorite parts of the show so the number
is
take care enjoy the weekend enjoy the
