Carey and this is your cnet update all
week long cnet update is at the Las
Vegas Convention Center and I'm here to
give you the rundown of what's going on
each day at the 2013 International
Consumer Electronic Show to kick things
off companies are holding press
conferences and unveiling
never-before-seen gadgets and one
company started off with a big surprise
the computer chipmaker nvidia announced
it's making its own quad-core portable
gaming console the prototype is called
the Nvidia shield but that name may
change by the time it gets to consumers
which could be as soon as a few months
project shield looks like a portable
Xbox controller with a flip-up screen
the shield has an analog joystick and
buttons Nvidia says battery can last
between five and ten hours it runs
Android so it can connect online to play
android games TegraZone games and some
pc games there's also a multiplayer
option nvidia has always just sold
processors not hardware so this will be
a huge step for the company and Fitbit
known for making personal fitness
monitors that clip on to your hip pocket
now has one you can wear on your wrist
all day long it's called the Fitbit flex
and it will sell for a hundred dollars
when it comes out this spring the Flex
is going head-to-head with other Fitness
wristbands like the Nike FuelBand and
jawbone up this is a soft bracelet that
monitors your movements sleep and
calories burned there are also LED
lights on the band that will glow when
you've hit your fitness goals navigation
company garment is known for selling GPS
devices for your car dashboard but
Garmin took things to a whole new level
by showing that it wants to build your
entire dashboard with the k2
infotainment platform aside from giving
directions it would also display web
data social media or your calendar of
course when you're parked because you
don't need that distraction while you're
driving a screen by the wheel would show
notifications on incoming calls texts
and emails and instead of you reading it
on your phone it can read it aloud to
you it'll also give you suggestions on
where to go based on what your friends
are posting about on social media
there's no plans on bringing this to a
car yet but Garmin
turu automakers here at the show and
other car makers are also showing off
other ways of bringing more apps into
your car forward is heading glimpse to
apps that work with sync applink it lets
drivers share their destinations and
routes with friends with a voice command
and Chevy will be adding the tune in
internet radio app into future cars
tuning gives drivers access to 70,000
radio stations around the world there's
also tons of news coming out about
televisions and home entertainment and
streaming video expect that to be a hot
topic this year we'll get more into all

streaming coverage and keep up on all
