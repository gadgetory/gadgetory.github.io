and it's time to break some VR so here
at CES 2019 we're in Las Vegas but we
took a little detour from the show floor
to check out the voids new experience
Ralph breaks VR which is based off the
movie Ralph breaks the internet yeah so
the void has had these location-based
entertainment centers creating different
types of experiences mapping VR into a
real world setting where you can touch
things you can interact and it creates
over a hyper real feel there's a
vibration vest and there's a Star Wars
one there's a Ralph's breaks the
internet different yeah I started with
ghostbusters and there are a lot of
location-based VR experiences that's
kind of a growing trend so we just want
to see what it's like Disney style so
I've never done this before it's gonna
be exciting to get started we had a pic
what Internet citizen we wanted to look
like when we entered the virtual world
and then we watched a little intro video
to set the story which is that Ralph and
vanellope want to take us into the
Internet to play a cool game you suit up
with a vest and backpack that holds all
the computer components and you strap on
that VR helmet Scott and I were linked
so we could hear each other talking
when the program began we were instantly
transformed we could see our hands and
each other as cartoons the small space
became this cool shuttle where we could
see a vast world through the windows
it's incredible how quickly the void
earned your trust matching the walls
exactly with what animations you are
seeing in VR so you're not afraid to
walk around action begins quickly with
challenges to keep you from getting
kicked out of the Internet and if you do
the wrong thing it feels like you're
getting zapped but it was just
vibrations coming through on the vest
the journey through the internet world
had us playing multiple games where
sometimes things went wrong very wrong
we found ourselves picking up blasters
but to us it looked like pancake and
milkshake launchers targeting bunnies
and cats the void plays with your senses
to make you believe the virtual is real
it smelled like a bakery when cupcakes
surrounded us
you felt heat when fire broke out it was
windy when we were high up in the city
and the story moves so fast you may not
see it all the first time through if you
don't look around after about 15 minutes
it was over and I was ready to jump in
and to another each of the experiences
vary in price costing roughly thirty
dollars a person you can try it at 10
different locations in the US and Canada
and if the void wants to change up the
story well they just have to change the
set around a bit I was like ready to
take it off and go like okay where's the
next theme park right I was like Anna
Disney
okay I'm at the park now I'll wait on in
Vegas and I'm not I'm not dizzy so I
could totally do it again yeah well
thanks for joining us on this tour of
Ralph breaks VR from Las Vegas see you
on the Internet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
