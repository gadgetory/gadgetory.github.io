insurance premiums you don't exactly
think tech do you but there's a coming
revolution between the mobile technology
that connects to your car and the way
they price auto insurance that is gonna
make it a tech story and that's a big
interest to the smarter as well as the
stingy or driver the idea is to share
information about your actual driving
behavior with your insurance company
this is typically done electronically if
that information shows that you're a
lower risk than your policy assumed you
would be in for a monthly premium
discount now I've got your attention
okay so where does this data come from
well in today's modern cars there's a
thing down under the dash here called an
obd2 port cars since 1996 all have one
of these and that has a wealth of data
coming from the vehicles various sensors
all the time about how you drive how
much you drive and the kind of inputs
you give your vehicle now a few years
ago some insurance companies begin to
tap into that data offering customers
the ability to plug in a custom hardware
dongle into that port that would gather
and report information about their
driving back to the insurance company
but you see insurance companies don't
really want to be in the hardware
business that's not what they do now
more recently insurance companies have
begun to take advantage of the fact that
first of all most of us are carrying a
smartphone now which has the ability to
run an app to process data to connect to
the Internet
do all the things that are behind usage
based insurance data reporting secondly
there's telematics in many cars now keys
various sort of concierge and assistance
systems that are wirelessly connected
and managed by a telematics firm think
OnStar or Lexus and forms
for example State Farm is one of the
insurers that have already launched a
usage-based discount program that can
save customers on their premiums based
on their driving mileage and or some
other behaviors now by whatever
technology this information gets back to
your insurance company and by the way
it's always voluntary it can reflect a
lot of parameters of how you use your
car what time of day do you drive a lot
real late at night when accidents are
more common how is your average speed do
you break and corner hard do you buckle
up every time all this data by the way
is typically gathered already by your
vehicle's black box what's new here is
sharing it with your insurance company
and the new technologies that make that
easy ok so you can save some bucks on
your insurance what's in it for your
insurance company
first of all this kind of program will
tend to attract low risk drivers I mean
you'd be a fool to engage in more
revelation of your driving behavior if
you're a high-risk driver secondly it
gives the insurance company more data
about their customers there's no
business out there that doesn't want
that and thirdly I think it's
interesting path toward the insurance
companies becoming providers of wireless
services in the car and it's not much of
a reach to see them as providers of
wireless services in the home after that
I mean most insurance companies don't
just insure cars ok now reality check
usage based insurance is still really
rare most folks have never heard of it
most of those who have don't really
understand it or the technology behind
it secondly there's a privacy issue here
I mean most of us are not used to
sharing data about our driving habits we
are used to sharing data about
everything else interestingly enough but
driving still remains a different zone
and third until very recently the
hardware to make this happen
was clunky and proprietary which kept it
very limited but if you look at the rise
of connected cars which are real already
and personal information sharing from
Facebook to fitness bands I think usage
based insurance as a matter of way
