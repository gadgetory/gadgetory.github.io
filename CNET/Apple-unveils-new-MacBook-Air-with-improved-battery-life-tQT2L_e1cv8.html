Air the MacBook Air answered the
question in this age of the iPad what is
the future of the notebook the MacBook
Air really gave us a direction of where
the notebook can go and its really
become everyone's ultimate everyday
notebook and that's why we're really
pleased to tell you today that we've
updated an entirely new line of MacBook
Air and these new MacBook Airs deliver
the most important feature we always
want in a portable device all-day
battery life
and the MacBook Air is based on a new
fourth generation Intel Core processor
otherwise known as Haswell ult and if
you don't know Haswell ult it's a great
processor for incredible power savings
there's more energy-efficient CPUs
there's twice the graphics execution
units so we can run them actually at a
slower clock speed to save energy and
still deliver the 40% faster graphics
performance and the Apple engineers have
worked together with the intelligent
engineers on some great low-power States
so we can do things like wake up in one
second or have standby for up to 30 days
but the biggest benefit is battery life
so here's the current generation MacBook
Air 11 inch and 13-inch the 11 inch is
now going to go from 5 hours of battery
life up to an incredible 9 hours of
battery life
and if you like that the 13 goes from 7
to 12 hours of battery-life
true all-day battery life and it helps
across your entire system for example if
you're like watching movies from itunes
up to 10 hours you can watch almost the
entire trilogy of Lord of the Rings it's
amazing and of course MacBook Air is
based entirely on flash flash is faster
up to 45 percent faster than the
previous version and Wi-Fi is flat
faster - now 802 11 AC Wi-Fi networking
now AC gets you up to three times the
performance of 802 11 n at the same
distance but the way to get that of
course is you want your MacBook Air to
talk to a Wi-Fi base station that
supports a total of an AC so we're
really happy - along with MacBook Air
announced some new airport base stations
entirely new designs there are actually
a very small base just four inches
square but extruded six and a half
inches to get wider range from those
antennas so there's a new airport
extreme that does 802 11 AC there's also
room in there for a hard drive so if a
new airport time capsule as well and
these are great base stations they're
incredibly powerful they have a lot of
cool features I'll just point out one
beamforming it even sounds cool
beamforming
can send more energy directly to an 802
love an AC device to enhance the
throughput and performance so these are
great base stations the macbook air
comes in 11 inch and 13 inch sizes and
the value is even greater than before
the 11 inch starts at $9.99 with 128
gigabytes that's twice the storage at
the same price as before and the 13-inch
with 128 gigs starts at 1099 that's $100
less expensive than before and these new
MacBook Airs start shipping today
as we have for a while now we're really
proud that we lead the industry and the
most environmentally friendly products
so we're going to make sure everyone
knows how important this is that Energy
Star 5.2 most products don't eat
people's most own arsenic-free display
glass mercury fleet free displays BFR
free PVC free and highly recyclable we
lead at this and were going to continue
to so that's the new MacBook Air they're
faster graphics longer battery life
better value faster Wi-Fi incredible
notebooks</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
