chocolates you are kind enough Greg to
let us submerse the Sony Xperia Z which
I have here my handy dandy apron pocket
multiple times of chocolate indeed we're
going to use both chocolate directly out
of Milan sure the Milan sure is what we
use to grind the cacao and the sugar
down to make the chocolate itself and
then we're also going to take chocolate
from the tempering machine and that's
the final chocolate that we make bars
out of the Sony experience D as you
probably know the selling point for this
phone is that it's supposed to be
waterproof so we obviously thought well
waterproof must also mean chocolate
proof how likely do you think it is
working here in the specter every day
that one of these phones could end up in
one of those big bats in chocolate at
some point phones have certainly ended
up in battle chocolate not here but
somewhere we're very careful so we
should get right to it and before we
start I do just want to say that I
really like the sunny Xperia Z and so I
hope it's okay I'm gonna give it like a
little moolah like a blessing okay
so first up we've got our little
chocolate container and we're just gonna
pour some chocolate on there all right
oh my goodness
watch your shoes everybody
oh my god oh sorry Sony
remind me again what temperature this
chocolate is that this is probably right
around 125 130 degrees right now okay
yes and as a phone buried somewhere in
there the phone in there should we get a
spoon and get it out
I got a squeegee for you oh there it is
oh my god this looks so cool with the
squeegee come on out so neat cook stuck
to the bottom a little bit the back is
totally unshackle it in so that's good
I'm squeezing this phone is like the
funnest thing I've ever done see this is
where once again the awesomeness of the
raised power button comes into effect
see if it comes on Oh totally
I can scroll through the menus doesn't
seem particularly worse for wear
now this chocolate is so thick that
there's really kind of no way for it to
get into ports but certainly the
waterproofness should prevent that I can
try to take a picture
cameras working fine okay so I think
test one a resounding and delicious
success okay so we have tried our kind
of raw biscuit chocolate now we're gonna
go for tempered chocolate the
temperatures a little cooler more about
like 110 degrees but it's a lot less
viscous that's meant to be made into a
bar so I think it could be a little
slippery but also get in the cracks a
little more we're gonna put it in our
container here then I'm gonna cover it
with tempered chocolate and then it's
gonna go into the freezer to set up into
a nice yummy chocolate bar here we go oh
wow that's a lot of
but not a nice thing to do to a phone
right come with me over here I want to
make sure my phone is well and truly
coated
we're going to make it into a chocolate
bar by putting it in the
Oh beautiful
we go
let's see if our Xperia Z chocolate bar
is nicely set up
oh yeah that is looking delicious it's
so helpfully right in the shape of a
chocolate bar oh yeah look at that nice
that's chocolate phone art and it looks
super tasty
very hard exactly it's really hard to
know on there it's not actually possible
okay a lot come I think there's really
only one way to break this chocolate up
and get it out of here
I'm starting to crack a little but I'm
assuming and we're just gonna have to do
like a mini drop test
give me one more
two three kind of like ice if we can
give it as many clues to it origins
okay really the key is just to uncover
our power button which I think I have
done it's like a little stuck little
little frozen slash encrusted he doesn't
really want to push who I got it
it's odd how's it doing boom
it's okay it's fine
it's on that's great but you know you're
still really a lot of chocolate on here
so I think it's gonna need like a little
bit of a back it's gonna wash it off
both new water purses like the leaves
are the things that could happen to a
nice hot water peel this chocolate back
here
oh yeah we're getting some melted I see
our screen is going a little crazy messy
stuff
as you might imagine considering it
supposed to be a waterproof bonus I'm in
too much trouble with the water here
seemingly just the chocolate in its
joints
I'd say this pretty remote is pretty
remarkable to give up on like a complete
sink map and have it just not have a
problem it could use some detailing but
all in all I think our Sony Xperia Z has
passed the chocolate test with flying
colors</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
