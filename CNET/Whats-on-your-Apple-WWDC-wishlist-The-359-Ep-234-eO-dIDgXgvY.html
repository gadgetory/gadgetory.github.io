York Studios its episode 234 of 3079
podcast and you're joining us just in
time for WWDC and in the house today
we've got Ben Fox Ruben and Roger Chang
good morning guys what are we talking
about is if anybody didn't know we're
gonna do that joke oh it's a slow news I
know I love the music I'm gonna play
just keep playing the entire time so
yeah we're gonna be talking about WWDC
if you don't know what that is that is
Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference
usually it's it's fairly a little geeky
a little wonky yeah it talks a little
bit about you know operating system
updates coding updates you know really
fascinating stuff but Nick this time we
may actually see more stuff there's
rumors about where Hardware speakers
maybe talk about augmented virtual
reality
so lots of lots of new development and
updates to some of them like the MacBook
line now yes exactly
so there there are plenty of stories
they're gonna dive into uh WWDC
actually starts up about two hours
starts around one o'clock our time 10:00
a.m. Pacific
I've seen it has full live coverage but
yeah we're gonna talk about what we want
to do it right a little bit of the
preview as long as always I get any
questions leave in the comments section
Brian will pick up the best and we'll
get to them in three minutes at 59
seconds from approximately 3:00 to
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon Apple's WWDC Developer
Conference will start shortly and well
the full live event coverage for you but
before they actually get started we want
to go through what we want to see from
the event I bet in particular you had a
you were kind of looking at smart
speakers right the serial speaker that's
right
well it should be what it's called the
serious speaker it's probably not gonna
be called that but I would be really
shocked if they ended up introducing a
completely different digital assistant
that was going to power this thing it's
gonna be Apple speaker or Apple home or
Apple's something Apple home app they're
gonna call it Apple home just like
Google home and the essential home and
the home home oh ho yeah either way this
should be a pretty big deal rumors about
this started what like well over a year
ago that the speaker was actually going
to be coming out and I think it really
is to me it shows some sort of admission
from Apple that the phone cannot do
every last thing yeah and especially in
the home you know maybe your phone's
upstairs maybe you lost it you know
under you know a throw pillow or
something like that I think it's the
idea of being able like call out to a
device like we've got we've all kind of
gotten used to call out to Alexa on the
echo speaker you know Apple tried it
with the iPhone hey Siri right right
doesn't work no one actually ever goes
hey yeah in some cases or in a lot of
cases you need that centralized
stationary speaker and that's why I
think that Apple finally decided that
they wanted to do this however I think
the rumours are this isn't going to have
a video screen it's not going to have a
screen capability which meant they're
already late to the game and they're not
going to have a major feature that
Amazon is going to come out with a
little bit later on with the echo what
is that thing called echo show yep the
echo show which is gonna come out later
this month although I guess it's it
seems more like an echo look which has
the camera right yeah that's I think
that's what the rumor says you know the
other big thing is obviously if they're
gonna come out with the speaker Siri has
to get better right like Siri is kind of
not great yes I really really don't like
using Siri and I use a lot of these um
intelligent assistants yeah because like
I write a lot about them I feel like the
Google one is probably the best one as
far as like my own testing is concerned
yeah I think Amazon's tends to do really
well I'm trying to avoid using the name
just then that trigger people's sure
that's smart speaker very nice of you
yes but I think Siri really does need to
do a very good job of trying to catch up
considerably especially if they're going
to create some sort of dedicated device
just for Siri yeah I mean it's been
really slow going the introduces things
several years ago they really just let
it use their party apps last year but it
needs to get smarter it needs to
understand you
a little bit better and it's definitely
dealt with like growing pains so next up
we want to talk about augmented reality
it's a thing that Tim Cook has teased a
he calls it sort of the it's the biggest
thing since you know phones generally
key he has had many comments about the
opportunity that comes from AR but you
haven't seen anything yet right I leave
in the comments other than comments
meanwhile you look at Google Facebook
Microsoft everyone's talking about AR is
one of the big next trends of Apple has
done anything right and there it's
you're you're absolutely right a lot of
those other companies have actually
presented some sort of hardware or
initiative or you know skunk labs
something like that Apple hasn't
presented anything to the public at all
about that I mean there's Google lense
that Google just showed off last month
right this image recognition system that
like totally makes sense is totally
useful
I can't wait actually see it but Apple
just hasn't done anything even close to
that mm-hmm yeah all right so are we on
time by the way oh there it is lastly uh
one talk about MacBooks
right yes Lee the rumor is new MacBooks
coming
I personally Rose I know I personally
just want to see a new MacBook Air like
come on man don't we about this we
talked about this last year that they
updated like the baseline version of the
MacBook Pro right and we essentially
told people like look this is your new
MacBook Air and you have to pay a lot
more money for it yeah I want to see an
update I don't think it's gonna happen
but I mean that would be on my wish why
wouldn't they do it though which is a
problem just like pushing everyone kind
of upmarket rights or like you don't
like it you got to pay up I mean so that
mean they say they have a low-end laptop
for people who you know can't afford a
lot the more expensive one it just
happens to be crappy an old $1000 is
apparently low-end I don't agree
alright for more of these stories in all
the WWDC cover check us out on CNET I'm
Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Ruben thanks for
listening all right so we've got a few
wish list errs in the chat thanks again
for everybody for coming back and for
bearing with us when we were on hiatus
there for a minute I was a nice little
break but we're so happy to be back and
thank you for all the warm welcomes back
so let's go ahead and jump right into
the comments coming in on YouTube
SEP separate us as completely wireless
iPhone no charging port yeah
well totally but we're not expecting any
sort of I phone like major hardware
iPhone announces easier is he saying to
remove the charging port completely
seems like it that's pretty pulled
that's kind of cool no that's done
that's super it could be an ex-army
aren't we eventually getting like isn't
that like the big thing that like we're
gonna get rid of all the cords from like
everything's gonna be that's like a
decade from now I don't know I kind of
like that idea
no no totally there's there's a company
out there called energies that that's
focusing on working on wireless charging
from a distance the idea is you walk in
a room and there's like a little
broadcast signal there's kind like Wi-Fi
but instead of internet signals you get
power I've heard about this idea for
years
yeah and I've never actually seen a demo
of it totally could work but I I
wouldn't actually remove the charging
port like you need to have a physical
backup like it just that's not gonna
happen in case you end up on a desert
island I suppose or anywhere where there
isn't this like energy magical energy
broadcasting station hey Roger guess
who's back in the chat ooh ooh oh my god
it is it is it it is I am so happy to
give a shout at the Christian welcome
back a Christian welcome back good to
see you good see Danny's good to see
imagine soggy good to see Matthew
everybody all of our good regulars and
all the newbies so much fun to have you
guys back what a way to kick things off
on WDC do we do Christian go back and
watch episode 200 where we did like a
huge shout out for you and I don't even
think you were there what a bummer
it wasn't the same was a bummer but you
know he kind of punched us all in the
face for that one there yeah we're
really proud of you bigger typically I
speaking alright we got a lot more wish
list to go through yeah let's keep
churning uh trust mob mu gamma mu gamma
mu by WA I'm sorry I'm buddy's name a
new MacBook with more ports and no touch
bar here oh yeah I mean totally let's
add the I mean there is but there really
does need more port there's a MacBook
Pro no with no touch bar I mean there is
a low an option me I but yes let's see
like that MacBook to me was more
conceptual than anything they were like
this is what we see um
you know laptop technology becoming a
couple years from now but it was I felt
like it was a little too futuristic the
world wasn't entirely ready for no no
I'm talking about just the baseline
MacBook you remember the one where it's
not over there Louis because there's a
baseline MacBook Pro that has no touch
bar okay so there's that none of ports
though I think that's to his disappoint
like I'd like to see more USB C port
yeah for sure
Christian gave his seal of approval her
approval for episode 200 by the way
Brandon Brandon says I would love to see
a MacBook oh no I already read that one
I apologize Chris Gonzales and several
others are anticipating the series
speaker brand they're killing it the
Siri speaker so yeah I want to also ask
people out there how excited are you
about this do you already have an echo
or a Google home are you planning on
buying an Apple speaker if it does in
fact come out because Amazon is
obviously done a really good job of
coming out with a speaker well over two
years ago they've sold millions of them
so a lot of loyal Apple users probably
have echoes in their home already
they're all gonna just throw them in the
trash right by the Apple speaker I still
think it's gonna be I know the serious
speakers a good name but feel like
they've been sticking to Apple right as
a naming convention Apple music app that
goes the Apple home I feel like it's
gonna be so happy speaker even apples
like I don't know a speaker doesn't
sound very good I don't think it sounds
like right well have they all been
abandoned the I fix is not i speaker
all right they're gonna come up with
something and drive it into our brains
with so much advertising yeah billboards
and whatever that we're all gonna say oh
yeah this is a great name eventually
we'll see yeah like the iPad we all cut
me from the iPad verse is like just
kinda sounds like the iPod you know it's
added like feminine hygiene products oh
really
first that was a big crack early on it
they like now you just think iPad iPads
no tablet yeah yeah they're very good at
making things popular just by uh yeah
constant replica the trick with these
speakers though I've just found like I
didn't actually understand the full
benefit of these things until I had one
I started using in a regular basis like
I didn't even see myself calling to a
lexicon sorry it's okay calling to
did uh for rent questions the like like
now I can't live without it especially
like when I'm taking of the kid like
it's grateful but do you have like the
echo daughter you reckon on that yeah
yeah yeah play music get that's the one
that I recommend for anybody that that
interested in get an echo yeah 50 bucks
they go on sale for 40 bucks sometimes
and I'm almost positive that there's no
way Apple comes out what do you what he
close to 50 now what do you think will
be the price of this speaker minimum
$200 minimum that sounds about right
that's very like Apple like right look
at a click the highest most expensive
products out there we'll like we'll add
a 50 bucks - how much is the Google home
the Google home is everyone yeah
it's 130 so Google because they were
late to market they came out just in
November they priced it well under the
original echo yep there's no way Apple
does something like that yeah I think
they're not try not to cut anyone
they're gonna be it's gonna be 500 bucks
it's gonna be a Liberty anybody mini I
mean I know they're gonna be alluminium
VP $500 and crafted you know look nice
but that's for sure well sure to look
wonder nobody has confused the echo for
looking nice like it's just a big
Pringles black Pringle cylinder that's
just in your kitchen right it's not
particularly attractive all right we got
a few people looking for Brian Tong in
the chat he's coming later we're just
warming things yeah we got quest this is
a poor man's Brian Jack show we don't
want charisma you came to the wrong we
got a few questions still coming up from
fan O's with sabe I scream William Boone
Pro HD Jesse Gaede men and many many
more so we're gonna keep trying to slam
through these stano's wish list says
iPad great name by the way
thanos iPad pro 10.5 inch that's
definitely the rumors right now no
kidding yeah what is the biggest iPad
that'd be a huge ball drop what is the
looks like a nine point seven or so no
no no it got a bigger one like a 12
point oh that's nothing
what's yet what's the biggest iPad pro
you're looking at me you guys are the oh
I think I like strike OH yours is you
think all the internet that I can type I
don't know I'm not that the idea is this
ten point nine is like the the kind of
big
it's in the middle but that's all
they've been doing for the past couple
of years that's all they've been doing
is making the product smaller and larger
smaller and larger and like that's
what's so exciting about the series 0.9
the way is that 12 point I can actually
a different product you know like
confirmed by Anthony Juan and several
others thanks meanwhile with saw the ice
cream says free Apple fidget spinner
instead of Apple stickers really I don't
know man I like that idea
that's a big headline people be all over
it you know if they're gonna keep up
with the trends it would be appropriate
it will ease when I give it to you know
every five minutes don't be at the
moment the Apple announces free feature
spinners like that's where the tread
dies it's just all right we're done
I like the suggested name for the new
speaker the Apple sound box thingy yes
that's way better they're marketing
people need to get on this
I have waitangi it was named that yeah
sure there's some legal issue that
probably think he's been taken already
ah a William Boone says we need a retina
MacBook Air again this is like all these
are so good but so no-brainers too like
Apple kid on it yeah MacBook Air is just
I feel like I will be very surprised if
they announce an update to it like ever
like they're loyalists have been begging
for it for forever
yeah you've got a macbook air right
there show the people the bezel on that
thing it's hideous
look at that it's night that is a very
old looking product but people really
like it it's nice and thin and it's $999
like what caring more could you want
karen says i hope they kill the air mmm
that's just old bulbs I hate that is
bold all right we've been sitting on
this question for a minute and he's been
very patient for us so pro HD what do
you think of the new rumored iPad with
mouse which is integrated within the
smart Keyboard go for it touch better
Mouse he says Mouse I think I think you
could kind of interchange them yeah yeah
I mean I think that's I think they'd
shift on this years ago like having a if
you're gonna have the iPad pro be
something that you actually do work on
like you need to have something more
precise than your touchscreen something
tactile yeah you need something tactile
exactly you know I think that touch pad
or Mouse totally makes sense I would be
down with that but that's more appealing
to me as a consumer because like the
pencil is nice but it's also nice yes
the
she's not part of your main kind of
workflow okay ice cream come on
none of these new innovations have
really pushed the iPad to get better
sales like their sales a bit I would
argue that the like the touchpad the
fact that there's the cover for the
touchpad on the surface has probably
made it more of an attractive option
feeling for people looking to do work on
their tablet right and they've been
selling fewer unit if I remember
correctly it's fewer units but they're
selling more expensive iPad so they are
actually doing a little bit better with
that business yeah it's been on pretty a
pretty consistent decline yeah yeah I
just gave min is asking about well I'm
hoping for iOS 11 drag-and-drop between
apps that's a good idea yeah that's
actually that's a fantastic suggestion I
don't know if that'll happen you know
they have continued you know I don't
know how well works kind of works okay I
guess not using it the same way I don't
use it at all but we've tried it kind of
works on the same Wi-Fi network but
having it between apps kind of nice
that's an interesting idea
yeah Danny Green points out that the
iPod is about dead with all the stuff on
the phones these days he's got a point
but you think there's still kind of like
a fun gimmicky like it's kind of like
kids mode mean the iPod like the iPod
Touch or something yeah yeah yeah yeah
the iPod touch definitely gets thrown at
kids a lot I mean I don't think they're
gonna discontinue that though no it's
one of those things where I think those
like they might update it with like a
spec bump like a little bit more memory
if they like just offer it up like it's
often times they do those spec bumps and
they don't even mention it yeah yeah
totally it's not worth it like sometimes
it's the press release right yeah DM MDK
branches off the prior comment says what
about a proper Iowa's file management
system feels overdue sure does yeah yes
these are all good suggestions yeah I
think there was a bit of a know if it
was a leak or something it was there was
a tease of Apple files so earlier this
morning I think we'll get something like
that today at today's so something like
drag-and-drop
and file management I think could fit
very well into something like WWDC yep
because it is like long your software
type of show I mean like we're talking a
lot about like these different like
hardware things typically tell me if I'm
wrong here typically hardware is not
where WWDC you
no shine now most of these developer
conference is not just Apple but all
these typically that they talk about
software they talk about like operating
ideas fake ideas but it's a little bit
recently like Google conference it is
Google home last year like it's only
been recent that that they've used the
developer conference as a platform to
talk about hardware mmm so good though
it's very exciting yes
makes it more reason to actually watch
it yeah uh out of it gets pretty wonky
in the chat Apple device process we need
split screen on the iPhone there's an
interesting thought that something I've
not heard about yet definitely they have
that people talk about that a lot but on
the iPhone touch yeah but like if you
have like the regular size and not a
plus that's a small screen to do to do
so this free it's workable I mean split
screen has been on Android for many
years mmm so I particularly like Samsung
and LG phones you know it works pretty
well okay yeah it's okay like you have a
cure your inbox in one window you can
watch a movie or something here's like I
wouldn't if they announced something
like that the crowd would go wild oh
yeah when they did split screen for the
iPad innovation yeah
with the iPad everybody was like this is
incredible this is something that you
could do on your Windows PC 15 years ago
uh yellow Matt asks do you think that
the if the new iPad pro design will give
us a hint about what to expect out of
the new iPhone I think that's an
interesting thought it's an interesting
directly does in many ways I feel like
the iPad covector usually follows the
previous generations iPhone designs
whether it's like the Shatford edges or
whatever but fern edges we're throwing
out all the old favorite oh yeah
chamfered alluminium I know I it's hard
to see that they you know hint at the
iPhone at this event yeah yeah we got
some more hardware wishes again with
like a new air pod design which I don't
think is going to happen today but now I
know that you're not alone just wishlist
what they're still ugly it's like like a
new air pod design where it doesn't like
have the weird weird things on the on
the end where it doesn't look at you
have q-tips in your ears Oh Brian I the
thing is is that people are buying that
thing yeah every time but yeah I don't
like I'm just no not that I don't like
the bit beyond as
headaches I'm just really worried I
would lose people seem to be buying them
a lot more than I anticipated
here I'll stick with the cheapo ones
that come with the phone so that's not
my how about this this is technically a
hardware wish but do we think that there
could be possibly better battery
performance coming out of improved
software wouldn't that be nice that's a
really good that's been a focus of
Google and Android for a while mm-hmm I
don't I don't know if they're gonna talk
about battery life that much that's kind
of it'd be kind of nice just as an you
know and holy we did thought if they
actually talked about how they were
making the i/o the job racist a little
bit more efficient run a little better
I don't know that's going to happen that
would be awesome if they did yeah
and before we got to wrap it up because
we're running out of time here and
they're going to be kicking off the
formal coverage out in our San Francisco
office shortly Joby Nelson says I think
Apple TV should support 8k just for
longevity Oh fine wool wow that's a that
you know you're not wrong but yikes oh
yes that also not hey that's not
happening having Apple usually actually
late to the game when it comes to
supporting new technology they like to
wait for to come sure before they step
in so I were a take a educate me for a
second does it already support 4k yeah
okay the new what happened men have been
fairly recent yeah yeah and you know
just the new one but it took a while it
would be nice I guess I don't know why
our last wishlist item item from Jordan
Apple toothbrush who I brush but my
electric toothbrush just died this
morning so I would totally be the market
turn application would be okay
yeah loopy to you but Ison would be more
likely to do like a totally souped-up
toothbrush right they will recharge yawn
yeah totally yeah all right so to close
it out let's go ahead and put down on
the table what we think our our guess is
going to be for what the speaker is
going to be cold cuz it's coming like a
freight train yeah Abbi I'm gonna be
boring say Apple speaker I'm gonna go
with Apple home even though I hate that
name Oh what your shirt you stole my day
that wasn't that I'd never know
everything I was going to say Apple
speaker you totally bought that
suggestion earlier yeah now you like
using it fine I'll go with i speaker
that's not hat I feel horrible saying it
I'm stealing from the chat I'm going to
sandbox thingy
heyi yes wait Apple sound box thing or
just sound box thingy uh you have to put
the name of the company in it that's
what Tim Cook wants how like everything
has to have Apple front of it alright
Apple Apple sound box thingy yeah yeah
that works
that's rolls right off the tongue
alright let's bring it home
that's a buddy for sticking around
they'll be kicking off like I said right
on Cisco Brian Tom yeah shortly and
they'll be taking you all the way
through WDC but thanks for joining us
