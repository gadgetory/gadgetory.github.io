couple of years has been the Dell XPS 13
is a premium feeling powerful 13 inch
laptop but that XPS 13 has been around
for a couple years and in that time we
seen a lot of great laptop designs that
are thinner and lighter and are even
catching up to that no bezel look so
maybe the XPS 13 needs a bit of a
rethink and that's why we have the new
XPS 13 two in one that slightly awkward
name tells us that this is a hybrid PC
sometimes called a two-in-one
which shift between laptop and tablet
modes by rotating the screen back on its
360 degree hinge but even if you never
fold it back into a tablet it still
works perfectly fine as a clamshell
laptop now at first glance the XPS 13 2
&amp;amp; 1 is close to my platonic ideal of a
modern laptop it's slim this little
wasted space on the compact body and it
has a few high-end features that help it
stand out such as an optional
fingerprint reader a dual lens IR webcam
and of course that great edge to edge
display it's not gonna be as fast as a
standard XPS 13 because it's got a lower
power processor made especially for
super thin laptops and tablets but I
found it work great for office tasks for
HD video and even for little gaming now
there are a few sacrifices compared to
the standard XPS 13 you're swapping two
full-sized USB ports and an SD card slot
for two smaller USB seaports and a micro
SD card slot this is now my go-to XPS
model and because it starts at 999 it's
a great starting point for anyone
looking for a mainstream laptop or
hybrid there's just one more thing that
drives me a little crazy about it the
power button is just a tiny sliver on
the right side edge it's hard to hit on
purpose but surprisingly easy to hit
accidentally
