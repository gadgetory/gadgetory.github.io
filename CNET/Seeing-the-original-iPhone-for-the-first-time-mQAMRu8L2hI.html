CNET from the Macworld show floor in San
Francisco well we're here today to do is
to try to catch a glimpse of the new
Apple iPhone you can see it's behind
glass this holy object is surrounded by
eager onlookers and we can't actually
touch it
I can barely catch a glimpse of it
through the crowd this is as close as
Apple says we're going to get today in
fact even in the near future you can see
other people craning their necks to
catch a glimpse of this holy object see
Jobs introduced it today during this
keynote speech at Macworld as saying the
first Apple is going to introduce a new
phone new iPod and a new internet
communicator what I ended up doing is
saying no everything it's an all-in-one
product with the iPhone that's available
in a four and eight gigabyte
configuration the four gigabyte is $499
and the eight gigabyte is 599 dollars it
has a touchscreen interface no keyboard
that is an on-screen keyboard if he says
it has something like a five-hour
battery life while in talk or playing
video it had two orientations you can
flip it around as horizontal it's
vertical it has a pretty decent even
superior web browser for this type of
handheld device it's part number that
was a partnership was singular it's only
available with singular that has a very
nice email interface it does a graphical
HTML email Google and Yahoo have
partnered with their respective
officials showed up today at Macworld it
has a pretty decent even superior
implementation of iTunes you think that
like you would in an iPod to your iTunes
library
new headphone earphone microphone
combination two little earbuds so that
we're used to but with a microphone and
a switch alongside Apple is apparently
taking orders today but it's not going
to ship until June this is Declan Keller
