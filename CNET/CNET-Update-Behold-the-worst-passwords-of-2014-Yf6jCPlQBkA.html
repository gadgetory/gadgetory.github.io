just throw away your computer because
you don't belong on the internet I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your scene
that update cyber attacks and data
breaches are practically a weekly
occurrence these days and yet even
though we've seen some horrendous hack
attacks in the past year people are
still using some of the absolute worst
passwords ever the password manager
service splash data published its annual
list of the worst passwords by compiling
more than 3.3 million leaked passwords
from 2014 to find the most commonly used
the top two continued to be 123456 and
password also on the top 10 worst list
qwerty dragon baseball and football new
in the top 25 list this year is Batman
but I'm sorry to break it to you Batman
can't save you from cyberattacks picking
a common word or sports team or a number
string is the worst thing you can do
because these are the first things
hackers try when cracking accounts you
also shouldn't use names of your kids or
your birth year all those are easy to
find out our desks instead create a
password that's a combination of two
uncommon words mixed with some numbers
and symbols that way it'll help you
better remember maybe you want to pick
something quirky from your childhood or
funny word your mom used to say to you
just stay away from common words of
course another problem is using that
same password on multiple accounts but
soon you may not have to memorize so
many passwords a report from juniper
research says that in the next four
years we'll be relying more on mobile
apps that use fingerprint scanners and
facial recognition software to get
around complicated passwords the
research predicts that this year mobile
users will download 6 million apps that
are equipped to support biometrics in
other news nintendo announced that it's
ending the club nintendo rewards program
it's going to replace it with some other
type of loyalty program in the future
customers earned points for purchases
and redeem them for small tokens like
ringtones or shirts and Microsoft's
going to soon reveal more details about
the next operating syst
Windows 10 at an event on wednesday
Microsoft's going to show off how
Windows 10 works on desktops tablets
phones and how it connects to the xbox
one it's designed to be much less
annoying than Windows 8 by bringing back
some familiar navigation features from
windows 7 that means it'll have a start
menu and it will actually look like a
desktop computer when you have the
keyboard attached and then you can have
a touchscreen tile thing when it's a
tablet we may likely also learn about a
whole new type of internet browser
that's separate from Internet Explorer
