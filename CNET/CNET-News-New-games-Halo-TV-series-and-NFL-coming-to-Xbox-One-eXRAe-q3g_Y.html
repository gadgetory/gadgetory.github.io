forts of motorsport 5 running on Xbox
one
it's gonna be the master
uhg see ya let me share a glimpse of the
future of gaming from a studio that
invented the hallmark gameplay technique
bullet time and garnered numerous Game
of the Year awards with Max Payne and
Alan Wake this is quantum break do you
think it's safer we're going you have
Payton I do okay sweetheart let's pack
it in hey what is it that makes you so
different are you sure you wanna know
pretty sure
I'm thrilled to announce a live-action
halo television series created in
partnership with 343 industries and one
of the best storytellers of all time mr.
Steven Spielberg congratulations to the
entire team on the tremendous work going
into the future of Xbox I wish I could
be there with you today in person but
like all of you here today I've been
playing games for decades and I even
started playing pong in 1974 and over
the years that experience has exploded
from the simple pixels upon two worlds
that are as immersive as is certainly
more physically interactive than those
portrayed on the silver screen and those
stories have gotten more compelling at
the technology has certainly improved
and so for me the Halo universe is an
amazing opportunity to be at that
intersection where technology and
myth-making meet to produce something
really groundbreaking but now it's time
to see it all come together the gameplay
you're about to see is running in engine
on the new xbox hardware this is the new
generation of call of duty on the new
generation of Xbox this is the world
premiere of call of duty ghosts
it's been 10 years you start to forget
the things you should remember and you
can't stop remembering the things you
should forget
we've always had the power not anymore
oh we have is each other
we're ghosts fighting for something they
can't be killed soldiers stand against
their enemies the ghosts
altar
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
