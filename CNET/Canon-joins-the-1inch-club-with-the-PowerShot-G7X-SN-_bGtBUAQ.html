we're taking a look at the brand new
canon powershot g7x canon has decided to
join the 1 inch sensor brigade dominated
by the likes of the sony rx100 this is
actually a slightly smaller sensor that
it was in the older g1x cameras so it's
one each census CMOS apart from that one
inch sensor the key features of the g7x
is this 180 degree flip up I guess kind
of selfie screen it's 3 inches it's a
touchscreen as well on the top of the
camera you get full manual controls
there are two dials here there's one
obviously with your full PASM controls
and then there is an exposure
compensation dial as well I mentioned
that 20 point 2 megapixel CMOS sensor
inside that's the 1 inch but in front of
that is a four point two times optical
zoom lens with full is and the aperture
range is quite generous so the maximum
range is f 1.8 2 f 2.8 at the maximum
extent of the zoom now when you turn the
camera on and start to play around with
features you'll notice that canon has
carried across this rotating lens
control ring in front right here now
this can be used to control your
aperture and shutter speed as well as
ctrl to zoom depending on what mode
you're in for the connectivity junkies
out there you get Wi-Fi and NFC so you
can easily transfer photos from this
camera to your smartphone or tablets
there's a9 blade aperture so you get
really smooth out-of-focus areas or
bouquet and also you get 60 p video
recording with full manual controls and
that's also in mp4 this has been a first
look at the brand new canon g7x if you
want to find out full specs and many
more details head over to the first look
over at cnet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
