perhaps the most competitive sector of
automotive right now with the facade up
against a court Camry Fusion Malibu
Optima Sonata
Altima yikes let's see how they do as we
drive the 2014 Passat SEL premium and
check the tech you're gonna see a theme
come over and over again that makes this
car distinctive and that is it's got
beautiful design not audacious not
swoopy not stand out but mature quality
German looks and that's a key part of
where it stands out in the market we'll
see that inside as well
now inside look around for the money
you're not gonna find a more handsome
car in a kind of a timeless high-quality
look on the market anywhere I don't
think anyone hits this level of really
nice design now because we're in a
fairly high trim Jetta it comes with an
LCD touch based system with navigation
scene it basically before it's nothing
terribly new and it's certainly not head
of the pack among the things that are
key once you go to enter a destination
you must do it by the touchscreen which
works by the way while you're moving
that's controversial but the voice
command button over here does not drive
address entry it's just for the phone
system that's a little out of touch with
today's technology and today's road
safety sensitivities I also find the
system at times very laggy as you bounce
between either media choices or the map
and the navigation sometimes it's very
crisp and moves along well other times
it seems to get lost for a moment I'm
pleased to Howard they've gotten rid of
this crazy planets around the Sun in her
face they used to do where everything is
a little ball around a center or makes
no sense to me as information design
this is better
it's basically stacked rectangles and
such but it's more organized the other
screen in this car is the Little Helper
screen between the two analog gauges and
that's this crunchy looking Jaggi
black-and-white LCD that just seems de
classe and what is otherwise as I
mentioned are really beautifully done
cabin so this is where VW falls down
they've done such a great job with the
physical not such a great job with the
virtual you can hook up VW carnet as
your apps support it gives you OnStar
like crash and safety stuff along with
remote
access to your car and some boundary and
speed alerts you can keep an eye on your
teenager it also brings along an
enhanced level of Pio eye technology for
destinations but in general there are no
media apps going on here nothing you
actually like no Yelp no open table no
Bing search no Google search that's just
not available here your media choices
are fairly comprehensive I've got an SD
card slot down here if you really want
to use that we've got the ability to go
from AM and FM and satellite radio all
under band right here in addition to the
SD card for other media you've got a
hard drive you know I'm not a fan of
those and thing called the MDI a multi
device interface is this cable here it's
a big VW Audi thing I currently have the
iPod cable you could buy other types of
cables to interface to your device I
would happily trade this pigtail
arrangement though for a good old
standard USB jack and unload some of
this stuff I don't care about like the
SD card and the hard drive we have
fender audio in this car which is fender
brand that it's a Panasonic audio system
and it's got a punchiness to it that's
kind of the rubric around it being
fender I feel it sounds fine it's not a
stand out in the market by any stretch
but it is an upgraded audio system that
you won't be disappointed with Bluetooth
calling has a nice set of memory presets
up front and center on its main screen
and of course we have bluetooth
streaming as well nice touch with the
bluetooth streaming is that when you
turn the volume all the way down which
is often laggy
it goes into pause mode and then when
you turn the volume back up which is
very natural it undoes pause then goes
back to play at this trim level and
almost all levels of current Passats you
get the rear camera thrown in for free
no up no extra that's nice it's pretty
basic
no trajectory prediction no multiple
views but it's a way to look out the
back now under the hood here we've got
some big changes in the facade it used
to come typically with a two and a half
liter inline five gas engine been way
downsized
1.8 litre inline-four but now with turbo
charging and direct injection a
thoroughly modern motor the numbers 170
horsepower same as the much bigger
outgoing engine 184 pound-feet of torque
seven more than the larger outgoing
engines that's a nice win a car that
weighs 3,200 pounds now gets up to 260
in 7.8 seconds about a second faster
than the outgoing car while delivering
for 34 mpg in this configuration
front-wheel drive only by the way which
is going to be a problem for some
drivers now on our SEL there's one
choice on the gearbox some Passats come
with a 5-speed manual this guy only
comes with a six-speed Tiptronic with a
pretty standard gate no paddles on the
wheel if you want to shift yourself you
leave it and drive and kick it to the
right to get your column mounted
shifting or pull it back to sport mode
for an automatic but more energetic mode
now just as our Passats
screen interfaces are a bit dated so is
it's complete lack of any driver
assistance tech don't go looking for
lane departure warning blind spot
indication forward collision warning or
even adaptive cruise control first thing
I notice in this Passat is just a small
amount of diesel engine noise coming in
through the firewall problem with that
is this isn't a diesel so that's not
good when you're really on the throttle
the engine has a nice growl when you're
going down the freeway it's basically
inaudible but around town when you're on
and off the power whoo it's got kind of
a bad diesel note there really blows up
the otherwise very tasteful styling and
environment of this car now the power is
Jekyll and Hyde sometimes the power is
right there ready to go and this is just
a great Torquay smooth thrusting car
other times you catch it absolutely
flat-footed you go to the pedal you want
some power now to pass or do something
and it's like the engine was shut off
for part of a second notice about the
transmission in this car you've got the
drive mode as I mentioned a shiftable
mode in a sport mode but you don't
really ever blend shiftable and sport
which i think is kind of unfortunate
what I would like is to go to sport mode
and then have my paddles up here for
shift ability but you've got to get a
different trim level Passat to get the
combination of paddles and automatic I
hit this car high marks for its handling
I think it's a very well struck balance
between a sporty feel and
like active feel and excellent ride
quality it does both I think very well
if I had to nitpick the handling at all
it's the new ish for this car full
electric power steering which i think is
it's over assisted almost all the time
they need to dial that back or make it
more intelligent at higher speeds
okay pricing uh Passats pretty easy VW
is doing a lot of trim level pricing now
not so much
Alucard options so an SEL premium is
thirty to one delivered it does well as
a handling car and is one that has
excellent design inside and out not so
much as a technology standard-bearer as
you saw you're missing a whole lot of
app integration connected car features
and driver assistance technology you buy
this car because of generally excellent
VW handling in an everyday sense not so
much because the power delivery and not
because it's a technology showcase but
it's got excellent German design</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
