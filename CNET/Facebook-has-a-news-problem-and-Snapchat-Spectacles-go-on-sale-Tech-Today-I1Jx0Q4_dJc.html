that matter right now it's no secret
that Facebook has struggled with its
news algorithm in the past and in the
wake of new criticism that Facebook's
faulty algorithm has increased
circulation of misleading or flat-out
fake news stories the company is now
doubling down on improving ways to
eliminate misinformation and although
Facebook does not consider itself a new
site a recent pew research report found
that sixty-two percent of adults get
their news from social media you won't
be buying snapchat spectacles online or
in stores just yet instead they're
currently only being sold through
traveling bending machines called a snap
bot and right now there appears to be
only one you can track the snap bot
using a map on the spectacles website of
course this is only likely to be
temporary but for now coming across a
pair of these will be based more on luck
than anything else finally the Google
daydream headset reviews are in critics
seem to have a mostly positive reception
to the new VR headset with many praising
its ease of use and a solid included
controller however the fact it only
works with pixel phones and currently
suffers from limited app support will
keep many from recommending a purchase
for now
can you save the date with the latest by
downloading the cnet tech to the app in
the Apple App Store</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
