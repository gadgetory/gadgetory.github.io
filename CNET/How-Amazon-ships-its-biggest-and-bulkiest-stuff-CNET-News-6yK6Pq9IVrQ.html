would want we might sell it this is a
industrial restaurant - Basin stainless
steel sink and this would be delivered
via like a scheduled delivery we're here
in an Amazon Fulfillment Center in Fall
River Massachusetts south of Boston
what's special about this location is
that it handles big and bulky items one
of the weirdest things that I had never
seen before was a 70 pound bean bag this
bean bag was so large it had to go on
its own palate rich Anna who runs this
fulfillment center showed us some of the
quirky and heavy items Amazon ships from
there including this javelin like you
would still offer two-day shipping for
something like that yeah this is not too
big this is the pool stool you put in
your pool and you sit on it that's
exactly what it is and there's a table
coming soon and we will sell it this is
a kegerator for a home brewer it's got
some cooling coils to chill your beer
life-size supreme edition shadow trooper
costume this would be a custom box light
saber barbecue tongs I did not know this
existed and there's a button that gives
them lightsaber sound effects
another section of the warehouse
includes the custom packaging machines
where teams of workers measuring cut
packages specifically for items that
don't fit the regular size boxes it's
stuff that ordinarily doesn't fit any of
the preset boxes we have so after the
Pickers pick the item and the first
person on the line measures the item
with measuring tape or this preset
measuring measurements there it's
usually a lot of bigger stuff or weirdly
shaped objects so we see a lot of
grilles car seats we see a lot of those
the custom boxing machine runs 24/7 and
can make up to 200 boxes an hour we want
to be that one place you can go to find
anything that you want and if there's
somebody out there that wants to buy an
Easter Island statue we want to be able
to sell it to them
Amazon selling all this random stuff may
seem a little strange but it's part of
ecommerce company's efforts to get you
to buy anything and everything online
