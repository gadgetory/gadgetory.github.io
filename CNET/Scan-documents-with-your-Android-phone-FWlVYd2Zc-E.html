that stuff made from trees still lives
on at some point you'll have to sign a
contract of rental agreement or your
taxes and get it to the person who needs
it and face it fax machines are all but
extinct if you don't own a scanner or
just want a faster way to get documents
scanned and delivered here's how to do
it on your Android phone there are
plenty of apps that will let you scan
and deliver documents but my personal
favorite is handy scanner it's free easy
to use and you can grab it from the
Android Market to get started tap the
camera button here and grab a document
you want to scan position it so that it
fills the screen and make sure the
document is in focus when it's all set
capture it and continue the process for
any other pages you might have now drag
the red dots around the document so that
it fits snugly tap the arrow when you're
done and it'll correct the perspective
this will fix any weird angles and make
it look a lot more like the original now
check the document and decide if it
needs any tweaking you can tap this
button to select any filters like
enhancing the color or this print ready
option that will make it look a lot
better for printing when the document
looks good tap this arrow here and
you'll be asked to give it a name decide
what to call it
tap ok and it'll process the sheet now
all you need to do is send it on its way
tap the doc and select the JPEG button
here you can decide if you want to send
it to yourself for printing or directly
to the person waiting for your signature
you can also use Handy scanner to scan
your receipts and track your expenses in
any case now you have a faster way to
scan your documents and reduce the
paperwork on your desk for a cnet.com
