welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk-show in the known universe
i'm jeff kannada and you are watching
one of our shorter daily episodes on
thursdays we deep dive into all the news
you see here so be sure to check out
those but right now let's hit the
headlines when you think of futuristic
robots you usually think of humanoid
forms automatons human communication
well this is none of those things no
this is a multi-function robot that
looks like your pet snake that's the
project MIT tangible media group is
currently working on it's called line
form and it's a soft robot that looks
kind of like a super smart snake and
Arduino mega controls the dozens of
servo motors on board and its skin is
actually a spandex tube covered in
sensors that can detect touch in the
video MIT shows offline form changing
from a wrist wearable that offers haptic
feedback to a phone with multiple forms
to a responsive flashlight and even to a
device that could constrain motion and
replay specific movements there are
other uses shown up in the video
including manipulating vectors and using
the robot as a ruler and a shape guide
the best part of the paper though public
reaction to the robot quote one initial
observation is that the large line form
can startle users when it quickly
changes form unquote yeah I'm sure it
will also startle users when it
strangles them in their nightmares
tonight line form no down line form bad
blind form all right I have to tell you
about Ford's drugged driving suit before
the smart snake kills me Ford unveiled
its drugged driving suit recently it's a
companion suit to the drunk driving suit
it created about a year ago and aims to
show young drivers the dangers of
driving under the influence of drugs
strategically placed bandages and
weights slow reaction
and balance headphones play random
sounds to increase distractions and a
tremor generator makes the driver's
hands shake to complete the suit vision
impairment glasses add tunnel vision
flashing lights and colorful auras to
distort a driver's perception Ford
believes using suits like this in its
driving skills for life program will
help young drivers understand just how
dangerous driving under the influence
can be even if they think they feel fine
that program is actually free and you
can learn more about it on their website
I want one of those suits just for
Halloween alright you've heard about
powdered milk and you've heard about
powdered sugar but how about powdered
blue a team of researchers at the Osaka
Institute of Technology have developed a
new kind of glue that starts off in a
powder form there are actually tiny
beads of liquid inside a layer of solid
particles each bead is a few millimeters
wide and the glue works by pressure
activation so you pour in some of these
little glue beads and when you smash
them the adhesive is exposed to whatever
surface you're trying to glue together
so why powdered glue the research team
thinks their glue could be used in
repairing or assembling objects that
require adhering parts with complicated
shapes because you pour the spheres and
have control over where they're placed
gluing together weirdly shaped parts or
getting glue into precise locations
inside a product would likely be helpful
just don't store them next to your
dippin dots also note to self glue is
not food alright it's Monday that means
it's time for crowdfunding today we're
discussing crowdfunding for a 3d printer
that claims it's going to be the fastest
one on the market this is the nexus ridi
and x1 next the 3d says this is the 3d
printer for everyone from hobbyists to
professional makers next is biggest
boast over other 3d printers is they
claim the NX one can print very fast one
minute for every centimeter in height
the company claims it's up to 40 times
faster than other 3d printers on the
market it's Wi-Fi enabled and uses a
standalone OS so you'll be able to
control it from a PC tablet or
smartphone a special cartridge system
supposedly makes refilling resin tanks
easy so this might be a good choice if
you're new to the world of 3d printing
there's just under 30 days left in the
campaign and they're a little over a
third of the way to their goal of a
hundred and seventy thousand bucks if
you want in you'll have to shell out at
least one thousand four hundred and
eighty eight dollars but if you miss the
earlybird you'll be paying 1,700 for a
standard-issue NX one man I am ready for
3d printing but 1,700 bucks is a little
steep it's not gonna go mainstream until
they can get that price down all right
speaking about getting down let's get
down to some of your photos with
photogra for the day
today's photographer of the day is Jimmy
who took this picture on an iPhone 6s
plus
Jimmy writes hi Ashley and Jeff my job
sometimes takes me across the country
and I took this photo on my iPhone 6s
plus white on the coast of Oregon I hope
this photo brings you some Zen and an
otherwise busy day you have my
permission to use this photo Thanks
well thanks Jimmy I can always use a
little more Zen in my life if you want
to be our photographer of the day send
your photo to us you can send it to
tomorrow at cnet.com always remember to
give us permission to use your photo and
let us know what device you took it on
we love hearing that
hey that's gonna do it for this episode
of the show thanks for watching you can
always follow us on twitter i'm at jeff
