world I'm Bridget Carey this is your
cnet update we now have a closer look at
the world at the edge of our solar
system NASA released the very first
close-up photos from the surface of
Pluto taken by the New Horizons
spacecraft during its flyby on Tuesday
this was taken just below the heart
shape area a hundred and fifty miles
across and it shows substantially sized
mountains 11,000 feet high there's still
lots of data being downloaded but
there's already a discovery so far there
is evidence that this icy world has
geological activity to produce these
mountains because there are no impact
craters in this image now they are
hunting for things like geysers and cold
volcanoes very cool stuff we'll get more
info Friday we also have a detailed look
at one of plutos moons Sharon and in
other news on planet Earth Apple has
upgraded the ipod touch for the first
time since 2012 the refreshed models now
come in new colors shades of grey and
gold along with a bright blue and pink
those colors are now available in the
other models the Nano and the shuffle
but it's the touch that got a hardware
update giving it similar parts as the
iphone 6 with an 8 megapixel camera a
64-bit processor and a motion tracking
chip but it's still the same 4-inch
screen the ipod touch starts at two
hundred dollars for the low-end 60 gig
model same as before amazon's big primed
a birthday sales bash failed to live up
to the hype for many shoppers to mark
the site's 20th birthday amazon
announced it would host more sales than
Black Friday for Prime members but one
does not simply invoke the phrase black
friday because if you do crowds will
expect make a crazy electronics deals
amazon did have some electronics on sale
like the Roomba and a few laptops and
headphones with discounts 250 some sixty
percent off but they were scattered
throughout the day and sold out of
inventory almost instantly and some TVs
didn't go up until later in the
afternoon most notable tech sales were
for Amazon's own products like the
Kindle but sold out very quickly and
weightless also filled up fast many
shoppers took to Twitter to complain
about lack of
interest items comparing the selection
to a garage sale because all that was
left to comb through worth lightning
deals and those tend to be random
assortment civ oddities like vitamins
knee braces some dish detergent either
way Amazon did get more people shopping
then they may have on a Wednesday but
just think of how different things were
20 years ago when this website only sold
books here at cnet we dug into the
archives and found this video from a
news report in 1997 two years after
amazon launched here our employees on
the warehouse floor handpicking books
and packing them themselves just think
now Amazon uses robots that can assist
with 300 orders an hour that's it for
this tech news update and there's always
more at cnet com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
