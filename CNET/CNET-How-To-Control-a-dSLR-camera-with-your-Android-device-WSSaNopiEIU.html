DSLR camera is the fun you can have by
augmenting it with accessories and one
of the most useful accessories is
probably something you already own an
Android device when you pair a DSLR and
an Android your shooting options grow
and you can do things your camera can't
do on its own
for starters you get a big screen look
at the viewfinder helpful for checking
focus and composition and when you're
shooting those photos can be reviewed
and even shared right away through your
phone there are other useful features
too like a tool for time-lapse and HDR
this is definitely geared towards
photography enthusiasts but anyone with
the DSLR camera and an Android device
will geek out over this here's how the
setup looks you'll need the DSLR
controller app installed on your phone
to find out if it's compatible with your
devices you can either look it up on the
developers website or download the
remote release app if remote release
works DSLR controller will work too if
you're good on that front connect a USB
on-the-go adapter to your phone which
you can find for a few bucks online now
into that goes your cameras USB cable
and finally switch on that camera if
everything is right DSLR controller
launches and you'll see the live
viewfinder show up on your phone screen
now let's dig into some of the features
that make DSLR controller awesome
for starters any controls you normally
have on your camera are available here
on the side you can fine-tune the focus
with manual focus adjust the white
balance add a grid to guide a certain
ratio or follow the rule of thirds and
you'll see the battery indicator along
with a photo count at the bottom just
note that obviously the features you see
here correspond to whatever shooting
mode you're in the app really works best
when you're in manual aperture priority
or shutter priority once you've tweaked
those settings to your liking
take a photo by tapping to focus and hit
this shutter button on the right there's
a little latency but that's to be
expected with this set up at any point
you can view the photos you shot by
tapping the play
button here if you launch this settings
menu you'll see even more tools and
options ones that aren't available on
your camera for instance you can set up
a time lapse usually you'd need an
intervalometer to do that but here it's
built right into the app you also have
automatic HDR along with a mode for
focus stacking but my favorite feature
is one that takes this whole setup to
the next level
Wi-Fi pass-through I can connect this
phone to another phone or tablet
wirelessly so I can move around freely
it's great if you really need to get
some distance away from the camera for
those self-portraits or maybe a photo
booth or if you're in a shoot and want
an easy way to show your clients photos
to do it install DSLR controller on the
second device then connect both devices
to the same Wi-Fi network now on the
wired device head to settings and open
this Wi-Fi pass-through option launch
the app on the tablet and a few seconds
later you've got a wireless remote and
as you can see you have access to all
the same controls available on the wired
device if you end up using the setup
often you might want to consider
mounting your phone to the camera or the
tripod somehow and don't forget to bring
extra batteries for your camera and for
your phone for more tips on how to use
