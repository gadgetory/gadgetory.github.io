on John Mary we're here to help you
evaluate your geek entertainment options
this week The Hobbit gets a director of
course iron man and a hot new fantasy
DVD release and we'll finish up with a
road test of two online TV games lost
and Battlestar Galactica are they worth
playing will tell you but first let's
start with what's in the theaters
the big release this week is iron man
starring robert downey jr. as anthony
edwards stark in the film imagining of
the Stanley comic creation Stark is
captured by terrorists in order to build
a Mixel for them is it better to be
feared or respected I say is it too much
to ask robo Jon Favreau swingers
directed the future and has plans for
two sequels and I think it looks cool
what are you building stock
also at this week red belt a David Mamet
fight movie that also looks cool super
cool even sort of karate kid for adults
Mike Terry is a jujitsu master who shuns
the fight circuit until a cabal of movie
stars con him Tim Allen makes an
appearance as the evil movie stop train
people to fight I train people to
prevail finally Peter Jackson has named
Guillermo del Toro as director of The
Hobbit movies the hobbit takes place
before lord of the rings of course and
Jackson has broken a book into two
movies del Toro directed Lee critically
acclaimed pan's labyrinth and is not
related to Benicio okay let's move on to
TV with the Speed Racer movie just a
week away nicktoons is speeding or
racing to premier Speed Racer the next
generation on Friday may second also
Family Guy fans should know the season
finale airs Sunday May fourth on Fox oh
yeah you're my Chinese Louis we owe you
an apology last week we did not remind
you that supernatural return to the CW
on the 24th but don't worry you can
catch the episode ghostfacers on
cwtv.com and then watch all the new
episodes Thursdays on the CW it will not
happen again and finally what's out on
DVDs the golden compass the movie
version of Philip Pullman's book is
available for purchase or rental now on
DVD and blu-ray
and just to feed the Indy fever a bit
The Adventures of young Indiana Jones
vol 3 is also available on DVD for a
hundred eight bucks out are you kidding
me with that and now let the games begin
sure mario kart in GTA 4 will keep you
busy this week at home but what about
when you have a few minutes at work
Molly and I each took an online game
from one of our favorite shows for a
test ride that's right i pimped out my
Raider in sci-fi coms join the fight
which is actually a competitive social
network who knew they even had that when
you sign up you decide whether you're
human or Cylon and you fill out a whole
facebook or profile then you get a
series of tasks that you do on behalf of
your team and these tasks are like work
you have to design an emblem or write a
motto or make a propaganda poster and
then you can win points so that you can
buy stuff to further pimp your Raider or
Viper and then of course you win points
on behalf of your team overall it is
strictly for the extremely hardcore fan
I just do not have that kind of time
yeah mine wasn't so much time consuming
as it was sort of boring the lost game
was okay it's a kind of a fancy version
of hidden pictures remember highlights
magazine it's like that except prettier
you scroll around it's a nice flash
version of the island so that part's
kind of cool you get to see like
Sawyer's tent and the bottle of scotch
and the smoke monster clicking on things
allows you to pull up some hidden gems
each gem gives you a video clip and some
of them give you even more one gave me a
preview of the next week's episode and
another offered to enter me in a contest
to win something overall really just a
time killer let's finish off with an
email from Jeff in Cincinnati who wrote
in about that Scarlett TV show after
doing some research I found out it
wasn't a TV series but a series of TVs
made by LG and Mike was right LG had in
fact perpetrated an elaborate hoax on
all of us and Tim Alessi LG's director
of product development and advertising
confirm the joke to the Associated Press
on Tuesday yeah thanks for the tip off
mic we'll try not to be fooled again
and that's it for this week everybody
thanks for watching you can send us your
email suggestions questions to geek pop
at cnet com that's right we'll see you
next time bye bye bye
