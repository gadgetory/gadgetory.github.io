finally have our first lick at Samsung's
next flagship phones I'm Jessica's all
court for CNET and this is the Samsung
Galaxy s4 now looks very similar to the
Samsung Galaxy s3 that came before it
has the same rounded shoulder design
however it is different it is thinner
just a little bit it's a little bit
lighter and the back is also straighter
comes in two colors this frosty white
color and it will also come in a black
shade for now this does have a 5 inch
Super AMOLED HD display 1080p so it's
Full HD it runs Android 2.2 jellybean
that is the most recent version has
Samsung's TouchWiz interface on top of
that as well
Samsung has added a lot more gestures
and features on to this phone you can
move your hand across the screen with
some of these features enabled some of
these things are what you've seen in the
Samsung Galaxy Note tablets and
smartphones one of those is air view
specifically and that's where you can
enable this and because this phone
doesn't have a stylus you'll actually
use your finger just to hover over so
you'll be able to preview certain things
we'll be able to preview pictures
preview videos you'll be able to look at
tabs with just your finger hovering
instead of committing to opening it all
the way there have been a lot of rumors
about eye tracking and one of the
implementations that we see here with
the Galaxy s4 is called
smart pause so if you're watching a
video and you look away from the screen
the phone will detect through the
front-facing camera that you've averted
your gaze and it will pause your video
for you and resume your video when you
look back if you've got your own
separate pedometer or Samsung wants you
to toss that away and use its s health
app instead it can track your calories
burned and your calories in when you
tell it what you've eaten like the HTC
One a competitor Samsung's Galaxy s4 has
an IR blaster in the front that will
boot up an app you can control your TV
using it things like volume and even
playing on-demand
shows there are a ton of new camera
features on here
some of them have been borrowed from
other devices there's just a bit of a
difference in the interface so it's much
more visual there are also more modes on
here as well it will support LTE and
wireless charging we here depends on the
different market requirements so I take
that as a soft yes battery is 2600
milliamp hours and there is 64 gigabytes
of internal memory so overall there's a
lot going on with this phone we have the
updated specs that we were expecting the
look and feel is definitely more
evolution than revolution it looks very
very similar to the galaxy s3 before but
different enough that you can tell it is
a brand new phone so stick with us we'll
have much more to come I'm testing it
all Curt from CNN this is the Samsung
Galaxy s4</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
