volkswagen shows these all nudes golf
that's their hatchback compact car this
year in Geneva we've got the GTI version
now as usual with the GTI the
performance version of the golf we have
a 2-liter turbocharged engine but this
year they've actually increased the
power this has 217 horsepower and 258
pound-feet of torque that's good for 6.5
seconds to 62 miles an hour but now VW
is also going to offer a performance
version that raises the horsepower by 10
227 horsepower although it still has the
same 258 pound-feet of torque that's 6.4
seconds to 62 miles per hour the GTI can
be had with a six-speed manual standard
or their 6-speed DSG the dual-clutch
automated manual VW also made some
changes to the steering system they're
using this progressive electric power
steering system but you'll actually
change the screen ratio depending on how
fast you're going now that's the new GTI
but we also have the new GTD that's over
here this is the diesel version of the
GTI books Leggett has had this car
around for a while but only in Europe
there's a chance they're going to bring
it to the US now with the GTD we have a
2-liter turbocharged diesel engine that
des 182 horsepower and 280 pound-feet of
torque that's a pretty typical
difference between a diesel engine and a
gasoline engine here we have a lot more
torque a little less horsepower but also
less acceleration with us as well 7.5
seconds to 62 miles an hour but the top
side is 56 miles per gallon the GTD has
the same transmission options as the DTI
and the same steering system that's that
progressive ratio electronic power
steering system now we don't know books
wagon is going to bring the GTD to the
US yet but there is a chance this year
that they might I'm wing penning am here
at the 2013 geneva auto show
