powerful Snapdragon 820 processor two
rear cameras and a unique design this
design features a battery that pulls out
from the bottom bezel in addition to the
benefit of being able to switch out your
battery this also allows you to attach
other accessories to the handset there
are only a couple of accessories from LG
that you can use with the g5 in this way
one of which is the cam plus the cam
plus is basically a camera grip that has
physical buttons you can use to control
the camera there's a toggle button that
launches the camera app zooming dial a
shutter button and a separate button for
video recording attaching the component
is easy enough you just press the button
on the left edge and pull out the chin
detaching the battery does take a bit of
wrangling but once you remove it you
hook it onto the grip and snap that back
in the cam plus does add bulk to the
phone so you wouldn't keep it on your g5
all day but it makes it easier and more
comfortable to hold while you're out
taking photos the tactile buttons are
also reminiscent of your typical
point-and-shoot though I found the
toggle button too small to use
comfortably so I ended up just launching
the camera from the touch screen anyway
I imagined the camp closed for someone
who's determined to get the most out of
their g5s camera who knows we'll take a
ton of pictures and also want an excuse
to use the handsets modular design as of
yet LG hasn't announced any pricing or
availability for the campus or any of
the g5 of their accessories the phone
itself will launch in early April though
so look for these products after that
date</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
