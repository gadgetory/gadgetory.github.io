CES in Fabulous Las Vegas today I'm
taking a look at this the sony bravia x9
hundred a it's another 4k TV from Sony
so I signees already showing off some 4k
TVs before but now it's making them in
some sizes that are a bit more likely to
fit inside your living room right here
is a 65 inch version but Sony's also
making a 55 in tradition so being of a
4k resolution this screen has an
absolutely astonishing number of pixels
specifically 38 40 x 2 160 it looks
really good it's extremely colorful and
as you'd expect it's really really sharp
now this TV also does passive 3d that's
not something that Sony's traditionally
been too into but it thinks that passive
is going to be okay for this television
because of that really really high
resolution so it thinks that when you
half the resolution watching 3d you're
not going to lose too much detail
passive 3d has some other advantages
because the glasses are a lot cheaper
and they don't require batteries being
generous sort sony is throwing in four
pairs when you buy the TV now there's
not actually very much that you can
watch in 4k at the moment so Sony's
baked upscaling into its latest effort
that means that if you're watching a
blu-ray disc for example it'll up the
resolution to 4k I've seen some
demonstrations it looks pretty good
upscaling is never perfect hold on for
the full review where we'll be really
putting it through its paces the
exciting new technology even extends to
the remote control Sony's got NFC
technology inside the remote so if you
have a smartphone that has that near
field communication technology you can
tap your phone against the remote and
put what's on your phone on the TV
that's pretty useful if you've got movie
stood on your mobile for example if your
phone doesn't have NFC then you can
still export the view onto the TV using
Wi-Fi screen mirroring now the design
here is likely to prove divisive
personally I'm not really blown away by
these chunky bezels but Sony's packed
really really massive speakers into the
side of this display so you never know
it might have really good built-in sound
now there's no price yet but expect this
to be extremely expensive even though
it's a bit smaller than sony's existing
4k TVs it's coming out in the spring so
we don't have very long to wait to find
out exactly how good it is and how much
it'll cost for kate's really interesting
I think it looks really good personally
I think it's a bit more exciting than 3d
has been in the past so this is
definitely one to keep an eye on on the
west way for Cena at CES and this is the
sony bravia x9 hundred a</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
