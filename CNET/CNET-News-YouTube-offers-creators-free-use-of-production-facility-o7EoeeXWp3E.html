a video production paradise built
specifically for the more than 1 million
people who regularly upload videos to
YouTube in today's video I'm going to
share with you some of my favorite
fashion one thing that we found that has
been an impediment in the past too many
YouTube creators is that they don't have
a big stage that they can work on or
they don't have a fast edit machine that
they can work on so that's available
this is YouTube space la a forty one
thousand square foot facility with seven
stages a control room 20 editing areas
and more a lot of creators are used to
watching their videos on a screen of
this size but here at this YouTube space
and they can see what they look like on
a much larger screen the space offers
not just equipment but expertise ranging
from workshops to residences and
month-long labs focusing on categories
such as comedy or beauty we also have a
team of engineers and producers that are
based here that are here to help you
learn more about how to use all of the
equipment here and understand some of
the techniques that will without an
extraordinary amount of effort allow you
to increase the quality of the videos
that you're making YouTube says while
they offer technical advice they refrain
from creative critiques leaving the
content in the hands of the partners
what we also do is we've left this stage
up and are allowing all these different
beauty channels to come and spend time
on the catwalk and shoot videos that
they want to shoot the cost for all of
this if you have a channel on YouTube
that's really the price of admission
this crash course in video production is
completely free though there is an
application process and requirements
include that partners have at least
10,000 subscribers and a hundred
thousand views per month creators must
pay their way to Los Angeles however
YouTube will continue to grow if we
continue to make good content available
for our audience that's something we
really believe and we saw this as an
opportunity to step in and show that we
were investing in the source of the best
content
platform which is some of our best
creators is actually really big this
summer time la is one of 150 partners
who have used the facility she and her
husband and partner moved from the east
coast to Southern California hoping to
grow their fashion channel Eric and I
would like to take this on full-time do
something that we love because we're
coming from a we're coming from a
background where you know we do taxes
and finance it's not that fun so here we
get to be more creative and we're hoping
to do this full time so far 400 videos
have been created here including some by
stars like actor Matt Damon and singer
Robin Thicke neither close to reaching
the billion views of Gangnam style but
you never know when the next viral video
will be born buncombe non-stop in Los
Angeles I'm SI me das cnet.com for CBS
