appliances and right now we're taking an
up-close look at the GE Profile PHS 9
20s f SS induction range this $3,200
range and oven combo certainly doesn't
run cheap so what do you get for all
that money
well first off it's a very lovely and
handsome looking appliance you have
stainless steel all over the front you
also get a state-of-the-art induction
cooktop has four main burners as well as
a warming zone right up here down below
is a convection oven that uses true
convection has its own fan and heating
element to provide faster baking and
roasting times and not only is this GE
range compact it's only 30 inches wide
it also has a very stylish slide in
design that will give you that built-in
look along your kitchen countertops even
though this control panel is sleek and
attractive and very stylish it has
confusing burner controls it's hard to
actually tell which burner is operating
is on and at what power level it is
running at induction ranges definitely
don't provide a lot of tactile feedback
as far as heat and light and sound so I
definitely want to have some sort of
indication about what's happening on the
cooktop itself all you have are little
symbols and small text on the front of
the panel and that's about it you also
have to consider that the convection
oven while it cooks evenly
it definitely has been on a small side
it's only at 5.3 cubic feet in capacity
that's definitely a little bit smaller
than the 5.8 cubic foot capacity ovens
that tend to come in higher priced
ranges and oven combos that we see this
GE range also doesn't have a lot of
extra features as far as presets cooking
modes the ability to split the oven
cavity or other snazzy little abilities
that set other ovens apart so that's
something you want to think about
especially when you're going to spend
around $3,200 on this
so when it's all said and done this GE
induction range definitely offers lots
of power and cooking performance
especially considering the price but if
you spend a little more you definitely
can get more features and greater
usability from competitors such as
Samsung I'm Brian Bennett for seenin
appliances be sure to check out my
review of this oven as well as other
ranges at cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
