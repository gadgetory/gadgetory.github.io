outsmarting mankind I'm Bridget Carey
this is your CNET update googles
artificial intelligence division
deepmind created a computer that
achieved what no one thought a computer
could do beat a human at the most
complicated board game the ancient
Chinese game of go this is such an
impressive breakthrough because go is
unlike any other game for a computer to
process computers began to beat humans
at games back in 1952 with tic-tac-toe
then it master checkers in 94 and in 97
IBM's deep blue won at chess against
champion Garry Kasparov and in all those
situations the computer is using a
brute-force method of computing it's
looking at every single possible move to
calculate the best play but a computer
cannot do that with go this 2500 year
old game of black and white stones has
too many options to consider all the
possible moves the goal is to surround
more territory on the board than your
opponent but there are more possible
positions than there are atoms in the
universe that's ten to the power of a
hundred and seventy so the artificial
intelligence must find a balance between
recognizing the important moves but also
just plain smart without knowing all the
outcomes it's sort of like our intuition
Google's system called alphago took on
the current european go champion fan
huai and beat him five times in a row
who I said that Google's machine did
make some mistakes it gave him
confidence there but in the end he
couldn't beat the machine next up
google's alphago will travel to south
korea to battle the top go player in the
world but it's not all about games this
AI processing power could be applied to
real-world problems like helping humans
tackle questions in medicine experts
didn't think computers could do this for
another ten years
so every other tech store you have today
just won't be as cool in comparison but
we can get through this without being
mean to the other stories right all
right
so PayPal's venmo can now be used to pay
for things in other apps that means the
same app you used to pay back your
friends can now pay for online purchases
not quite it all
works with two apps game time and mantri
I don't know what the heck Amun tree is
and I don't know if I want to know and
there is some Apple news the company is
recalling some models of its AC wall
adapter sold with Macs and iOS devices
because of a shock risk it's not for the
plug sold in the United States or the UK
this is for outlets in Europe Korea
Australia New Zealand Argentina and
Brazil that's not the only recall
Microsoft is recalling some surface pro
power cables for overheating problems
yeah Google does win all news today
that's it for your tech news update you

studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
