this is the same Instagram we all know
and love but it moves at facebook
headquarters in menlo park california
instagram CEO kevin systrom touted the
new features of instagram the popular
photo-sharing app facebook bought last
year for 1 billion dollars it's the same
screen but now you've got a video icon
on the bottom right the new service lets
you capture and share 15 seconds of
video with the ability to string
together short clips there are 13 new
video filters and the ability to pick
which frame from the video pops up on
your feed but the most significant
advancement is something dubbed cinema a
way to stabilize shaky video this is the
normal video and this is cinema gorgeous
stabilized video for your iphone now you
have the power of cinema in your pocket
this changes everything and I'm excited
to bring you cinema video and Instagram
is taking direct aim at Twitter's vine
app which lets users easily capture and
share six-second looping videos since
introducing the service in January vine
has already hit 13 million users and has
attracted advertisers and celebrities
this is interesting move for facebook
because it doesn't have a social video
component that's very strong yet and
having twitter buying a vine and having
binding a very popular product it's
probably opened their eyes to that by
beefing up instagram facebook is trying
to leverage its more than 1 billion
users and grow its mobile usage to cash
in on mobile ads instagram is really
Facebook's like biggest mobile product I
mean Facebook's I'm working harder to
transform itself into a mobile first
company with its own apps and stuff but
when they bought Instagram Instagram was
basically like the way they got into
mobile so this is really important for
them in terms of developing that
presence Instagram is launching the
video service today on iOS and Android
