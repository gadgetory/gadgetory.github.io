update garmin has announced a new in-car
navigation device the HUD it projects
turn-by-turn directions upward onto the
windshield into the driver's line of
sight there's no screen this projector
just sits on the dashboard and
automatically adjust the brightness of
its projections so drivers can see it in
direct sunlight and at night HUD which
is short for heads-up display will sell
for a hundred and thirty dollars when it
goes on sale sometime in the summer and
you'll need a thirty dollar app on your
smartphone though to power it the HUD is
meant to reduce driver distraction a
time where many people are taking their
eyes off the road by getting directions
from their smartphone screens Facebook
is rolling out graph search to all users
in the US some were able to get an early
peek in January but this new way of
searching is rolling out to everyone now
it lets you narrow down results with
phrases such as searching for my friends
from Florida who like pancakes if you're
looking for a deal to popular mini
tablets are cheaper than ever amazon
just cut the price of the kindle fire HD
tablet to 170 dollars and as for the
competition at barnes and noble well the
Nook HD+ is listed for a hundred and
fifty dollars but don't be surprised if
you see the nooks price go even lower
because Barnes &amp;amp; Noble has said it will
no longer design and produce color
tablets it will instead partner with
third-party manufacturers when it wants
to make a color tablet in the future and
if you want the popular samsung galaxy
s4 without a contract
metropcs is now selling it for five
hundred and fifty dollars up front but
it's only coming to a few big markets
for the time being looking ahead this
week you can expect Nokia to announce a
new windows phone with a crazy good
camera nokia is having an event in new
york on thursday to show off the Lumia
1020 it has a 41 megapixel camera yeah
41 megapixels the camera will be similar
to the one in the Nokia 808 PureView
which was never marketed before to North
America because it ran on the unpopular
symbian operating system that's your
