akhtar technology is infiltrated every
part of our lives and now I won't stop
until you are assimilated resemble one
of the board today we're taking a look
at the top 5 weirdest wearables what
define something is weird let's say
either makes people look at you oddly or
it makes you question its existence very
easily now this list is about stuff that
was actually available beyond the
prototype stage let's get to it for
number 5 we're using the Wayback Machine
to look at an old wearable that I
actually own it's the fossil wrist PDA
from 2003 it cost two hundred fifty
dollars at the time and it ran the
popular palm OS that also powered
personal digital assistants like the
Palm Pilot really digital calculator
watches were relatively successful with
a nerdy crowd but this thing was a
special kind of parody and a small
resistive touchscreen the clasp housed a
tiny flip out stylist so you can hit the
tiny targets if you think SmartWatch
wearers get weird looks now imagine how
people looked at me as I was poking a
tiny screen with what appeared to be a
trick to find email look crazy the whole
concept of VR headsets could easily
qualify as weird wearables there's
something incredibly antisocial by
placing a blindfold over your eyes it's
more insular than putting on a pair of
headphones let's specifically talk about
the samsung gear vr you clip in a galaxy
note 4 in it and then view the screen
through the headsets spherical lenses
and experience virtual reality it's
supposed to be pretty cool and Samsung
even made a version for galaxy s6 line
in theory it's kind of clunky since you
need to use your own phone but at least
it currently exists compare that to the
other VR headsets from oculus HTC and
Sony is still not available at number 3
is ringed by log bar it's a Bluetooth
ring that works with your phone and let
you control things with the wave of your
finger the wearable is a product of a
successful Kickstarter campaign and
people actually receive their rings
unfortunately people were less than
happy with how brain worked or didn't
work the demo videos may have over
promised what ring could do right away
snazzy labs call it the worst product
ever made also ring is a bit chunky so
maybe the functions would be better
served by a wristband
maybe something like the Falmouth my own
the narrative clip is a little clip
above camera that takes a still picture
every 30 seconds answer number two weird
wearable because you clip it on and you
get some interesting viewpoints in the
world what does life look like from a
lapel or a belt level you had the clip
you'd know the clip also doesn't have
any video or audio recording
capabilities and doesn't sync to your
phone it syncs to your PC a new version
of the clip promises to fix all of that
who knows maybe the clips actually
awesome after all if you don't to whip
out your phone to take pictures you
could just enjoy your life and then
review it later thanks for the foot and
the number one weird wearable is google
glass introduced in 2012 it was made
available in 2013 the google glass
explorer program for $1,500 featured a
camera to take pictures video even live
stream glass could recognize voice
controls and show you information in
google now like cars as a nerd i was
rooting for this thing look at it a
computer that attaches to your head I
might be biased because I'm already
wearing glasses what's more and more
piece of glass to look through glass is
no longer available and it is reportedly
being reworked by the head of nest Tony
Fadell otherwise no one is one of the
fathers of the ipod did I leave
something out is the ring weirder than
glass let me go on twitter i'm at ayahs
