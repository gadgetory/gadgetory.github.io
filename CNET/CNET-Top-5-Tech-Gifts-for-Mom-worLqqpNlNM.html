where every time you and Tom need he
counts down another hot CNET list I'm
Molly wood though and I'm taking over
for a very special top 5 Mother's Day
edition I asked you all on Twitter and
Facebook to tell me what you thought
your tech savvy moms would like to get
for Mother's Day this year now with your
suggestions and a couple of my own let's
count down the top 5 tech gifts for mom
coming in at number 5
GPS apparently your moms have a tendency
to get a little turned around while
driving I'm not saying I do that but I
do travel with at least two GPS devices
all the time at number four everyone is
in favor of a flip Video camcorder or
any one of those little handheld digital
camcorders because digital cameras are
so last year this year mom is all about
uploading her HD video clips straight to
YouTube obviously coming in at number
three the iPod Touch your moms have
expensive taste but it is a pretty
perfect gadget for entertaining both
moms and toddlers trust me on this one
at number two the Kindle 2 was a major
mom suggestion in fact one of you even
said you mean there's something other
than a Kindle to just make sure you also
give her a coupon for several hours of
uninterrupted reading time okay but
before you find out what else there is
besides a Kindle let's check out the
best of the rest of the ideas you
suggested for Mom all right it's time to
find out what you suggested as the
number one tech gift for Mom this year
at number one a digital picture frame oh
I agree this is a great gift for moms as
long as you load it up with photos
before you give it to her that's the key
trust me and that's it for this edition
of top 5 Tom Merritt we'll be back next
week with another list and a prize to
give away for this week though your
prize is your mother's love I'm Molly
wood and thank you for watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
