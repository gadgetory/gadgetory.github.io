time I'm just saying it's a writer
because a it is in your ass also the mms
like obviously patrick's day oh thank
you mean lantern yes yeah i got to
support the core yeah also irish we
didn't if you didn't know that's a
little known secret yes the entire core
irish yeah that's they're just fighting
an intergalactic potato famine that's um
you have just returned from South by
Southwest I have indeed I hate my body
weight and brisket and lived to tell the
tale hey that's the way we do South by
Southwest I was gonna ask like the
important question today would be
exactly how many pounds of barbecue did
you eat oh man I'm not much of a math
guy but i would i would say the amount
was medically inadvisable um i ate quite
a bit of barbecue while I was down there
because who knows when I'll be back
that's kerala for someone with the
southwest I decided I was gonna have
ribs for every meal which is why I've
never been back to South place almost it
was delicious yeah but all that protein
and I way to go Oh both muscle in his
weight again but you are not there just
to see and you know yes delicious foods
you uh you saw and did other things I
said a bunch of stuff yeah so Nerdist
geek and sundry and Amy Poehler's Smart
Girls of the party we took over this bar
on Rainey Street called Bangerz sausage
house and beer garden highly recommended
it's a great place we turned it into
sort of a pop-up saloon so all weekend
long we had panels performances all
sorts of fun stuff and then that was a
big place where I did a lot of that
after mentioned BBQ eating nice and on a
scale of one to ten how nice was your
floozy costume oh man it was a saloon it
was I'd give it like a strong seven I
don't want to oversell myself
like it was hootenanny appropriate very
appropriate all right that's what I was
hoping to hear that's Texas style
exactly appropriate attire or any bar
fights uh who I hope not unless uh
something went down after its like the
talent show by hell yeah Oh killbot beat
up jake gyllenhaal hit rash she gets
upset about yeah she's like cellar door
that's the most beautiful phrase no I
will fight you so did you get to see any
any of the films that were showing or
any I did I did get to see a couple cool
films and some cool TV series that are
making their premier awesome TV was
really big just here at South by exactly
TV was huge this year at South by and I
got to see an interview the cast of two
of the ones I'm most excited for which
is preacher coming to AMC I'm scared I'm
scared it's good is that you sure good
okay it is not a hundred percent the
comic oh now you're scaring me but the
walking dead is not a hundred percent
the comic I don't like that show but it
feel it it's so much better than walking
dead and i love the walking dead like it
it walking it took six years to get good
but uh the preacher right off the bat it
filled me with confidence it's funny
it's gross it's violent all right dark
and i think that anyone who's worried
their fears will be ass waged once that
actually debuts on may twenty second i'm
very excited to see it that comic is
beloved to me and is one of those ones
where I was like please just don't mess
it up don't ever touch it so you're
making me feel good you can tell that
Seth Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg really
cared about the source material yeah and
some of the action in there like you
know I feel like a lot of uh you know
comic book TV shows it's kind of like
stutter stop action this some of the
scenes in that super fluid very funny I
can't wait to see more so you saw the
first episode of saw the pilot jacket
interview the cast about it awesome yeah
yeah oh man I'm vicks and you said may
20 seconds on David yes unfortunately
there is no mullet for Jesse custard
yeah well some things had to be
modernized a little bit awesome well if
you liked preacher most the other show
because he said there were two outcasts
speaking of throughout the speaking of
The Walking Dead Robert Kirkman another
comic that he has its sky bound in Image
Comics called out cast him in Paula's
aceite really fantastic story about this
guy Kyle Barnes who is plagued by
demonic possession as whole
life and then he you know sort of starts
experiencing this on a larger scale in
his hometown she has to team up with
this troubled Reverend and together they
have to put a stop to it before it's too
late to troubled Reverend show oh yes
exactly like yes that's the hot nature
sparkly vampire yeah troubled redford
and this is a but it's more about like
the main guy Kyle played by a patrickv
you get from almost famous yeah and it's
directed by adam wingard who did your
next and the guests so it's got a strong
horror route to it and it's really
creepy really gross and one of my
favorite comics right now so I think
people are really going to dig it on
Cinemax debuts june third so you have
plenty of time to add that to your cable
package Cinemax getting in the game yeah
Big Show's mr. cohesive the mix that
they did yeah it's fantastic setting up
their game big time yeah that's another
show that girl she damn weeds they had I
mean they've had really good shows it's
just I think a lot of showtime wasn't
weeds show to show time I'm sorry but
Cinemax with the Nick and stuff I think
that they are kind of a dark horse in
the sense of we don't really we don't
really hear about all the great shows
that are happening there but there are
really good show go on over there yeah
it's like HBO's weird cousin yeah like
that weird cousin that shows up at the
family reunion and by the end of the
night you guys are best friends again
but at the ferg at the beginning you're
like I don't know if I like that guy
yeah they didn't mind Amish thing with
when I was younger and goldfish in your
peoples sandwich just creeping me out I
was younger they used to still be the
weird cousin but they were the weird
cousin that like made everybody
uncomfortable because they showed too
much yeah and I'm glad they've kind of
moved beyond these skinemax amazing
family barbecue yes so whose cousin
Annie yeah not a hooter nanny yeah when
we said floozie we didn't mean floozy
all right oh boy okay so TV like those
two are your favorites movies always
have been a huge part of South by since
they out of the film festival I've heard
a lot of good things about a lot of
movies getting out of South by like
midnight special what did you see that
was your favorite and also like what
were the other movies at you said you
just thought were so great and that
people should definitely check out when
they go wide release I think one of the
best things to come out of the festival
is a movie called don't think twice and
it's mike birbiglia
keegan-michael key a bunch of super
talented people it's about an improv
comedy troupe in New York City and one
of the excuse me one of them lands a gig
on like a Weekend Update style thing on
their version of SNL and it's about how
that one person success sort of tears
that group apart because it's like what
happens when someone else achieves your
dream right and it's just it's really
good Mike Birbiglia you know ever since
it ever since you started making more
like narrative-driven features like
sleepwalk with me really been crushing
it in that one I think is gonna surprise
a lot of people specially a little too
close to home for us well I mean because
it probably that showed the movie that
we're writing about Chris Hardwick yeah
I gotta just take that off the table now
I guess I know Oh God well even like not
to get not to get super weird on
everything that Chris Hardwick yesterday
was like complaining about 11 ish out of
you what is amazing yeah for people who
don't know it's basically like over in
England I think for ITV they're making
essentially just a ripoff of @midnight
called at 11 ish yeah they just took the
@midnight font and made it Boulder
Highway earlier yeah exactly yeah show
you like eleven fifty nine or so and 30
seconds yeah my lab finish so funny I
just say it's a bold move literally
maybe because they made in international
waters they can get away with it yes oh
yes I see Captain all right yeah it's
their actual pirate actual sea-faring
international water hahaha I like it
okay so that was one of your favorite
movies what else was good there cuz
interactive was there to you get to
check out any interactive so I did not
really get to check out a lot of
interactive stuff one of the coolest
things I saw that was there for
interactive was Star Wars and Disney
they built a life-sized hi fighter what
like down the street from us hey we like
yours just walking down the street when
you go get inside it food trucks
unfortunately no you're not without your
pilot's license oh well I gotta get that
I get down there so only John Boy hey
guys allowed pretty much on earth oh
yeah does you hear in a pilot he just
yeah they just older it's a storm
trooper Cameron maybe like honorary
pilot's license yeah Popo decides to
like swap sides in the new movie yeah
and maybe we'll see ya yeah he might get
one for sure the I yeah you gotta have
on
those the helmets with the big you know
things here you can't have a regular
stormtrooper helmet yeah the black young
man with like a like dolo mask in there
and stuff you get to have all it yeah my
god it's just like in top guys exactly
on you gotta get ripoff thing I can't
breathe like it's no you gotta have that
but it's exciting and cinematic then I
want to see that shirtless stormtrooper
volleyball scene high five percent how
come nobody has made that that web video
yeah there's that I think we need to
write that parody exactly after we're
done with Jack I TV hands off hahaha how
dare you don't you amazing what's a
terrible Top Gun knock off though
they'll knock off that yeah airwolf
above weapon yeah sky pistols I like it
okay so we have covered South by
Southwest I feel like we have a good
idea of some of the best things out of
the show I'm very excited about those TV
shows us hey I'm too after hearing I was
worried about preachers well and after
hearing from a couple people who saw
that pilot they were just like it's good
you think you can trust Seth you can
trust it like you can you can trust them
yes Evan and Seth have it locked down
like they get it they understand it they
love it it's made it's a labor of love
yeah trust and you would never know that
Dominic Cooper and ruth negga who play
Jesse Custer and tulip respectively are
British you would never know yeah
alright alright Justin gilgen you know
he's Irish because I supposed to busted
me yeah let's be really are he's not
faking it they got a real Irishman I
just want to see if they're really gonna
do our space at some point they do
really without spoiling anything you'll
already it's all happening yeah all
happening it it yeah your life is gonna
change me alright so I over at Nerdist
what are you guys doing what are you
doing on Dan cave right now what's the
what's the thing well I'd fun with this
through for South by Southwest you know
it's a weird city full of weird movies
and Boston weird exactly yeah thats that
is their their mandate mm-hmm so i
celebrated that a little bit with some
of the most like WTF worthy movies ever
made and that was a lot of fun to
research that episode because you just
like its i tried to skirt book between
like awesomely bad movies and I just
deeply strange movies yeah so you have
like samurai cop which is just full of
like terrible wigs are mad acting like
bizarre choices then you have like holy
motors which is like very well shot very
thoughtful but also like incredibly
off-putting and weird weird yeah yeah um
so if anybody had to pick one summer
blockbuster to see this year what would
having seen none of them having so but
you seen any news but you have a good I
think you have a good sense of what's
gonna be good and what ya gonna be so
good and this is a really intense year
for blockbuster films yeah a little bit
and it's expensive to go to the movies
and before you answer yes if you don't
say civil warrior kicked off the ship I
well but say whatever you want but just
know that look I apologize to all those
who have warned the logo on my shirt
before but I have to agree with Jeff
civil war captain america civil war okay
I was lucky enough to visit the set last
year in atlanta georgia at Pinewood and
everything i saw there has filled me
with so much confidence in everything
I've seen since all the footage all the
trailers Pete's Peterman the brand-new
costume Peterman's in the movie yeah
with his little Skrillex scrawny teenage
voice like hey everyone ha ha ha ha big
excitement they did the thing that I've
been trying to beg them to do in a
spider-man movie up till now and that is
animate the eyes yeah I can't hold a
functional I like their functional they
look like they're shudders like camera
shutter yes that like open and let in
more light and clothes and also give him
an expression which is nice exactly
especially after Deadpool you know it
doesn't have to make logical sense it's
just one of those like your little comic
book trappings that like adds a lot
exactly i mean you're not contriving to
rip his mask off every year and it's
yeah totally yeah so I think we I think
