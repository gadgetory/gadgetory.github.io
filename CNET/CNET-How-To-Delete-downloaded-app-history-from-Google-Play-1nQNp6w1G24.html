how-to contributor and today I want to
take a look at how to delete your
downloaded app history from the Google
Play Store we all do it we download as
many apps as possible we get a free
promotion or we see around the map that
we just want to try out and we learn
that they're not that good of apps and
we end up deleting them and we'd never
intend on ever using them again the
problem is when you do delete an app
that you want to later use maybe you
accidentally deleted it kid deleted it
when they're playing with your phone or
for whatever reason and you go back into
your download history the list is
clogged with all these items that you
never intend on using again and you want
to get rid of them a while back it was a
couple months ago Google updated the
Play Store that enabled the feature to
delete your downloaded app history and
this is how you can go about doing that
so we'll launch the Play Store hit the
menu button we got to get to the main
screen hit the menu button go to my apps
then you have the apps that are
currently installed on your device any
updates or just a list of apps that are
just installed but you could scroll over
and then you'll see a list of apps that
you've downloaded in the past and as you
see you scroll through and you can see
which ones are installed the free apps
that you've deleted will have this
Universal no icon next to it and when
you tap on it it'll ask you if you want
to remove the app from my apps which is
your history now when you do that and
you hit OK as you'll see the list
refreshes which if you're going to go
through a long list of apps it's going
to take you a while to wait for the list
to refresh each time so what you could
do instead is tap and hold on an item
and it selects it and you can select
multiple items that way then you just
tap on the icon up here to remove the
apps from your list and then you're not
having to wait for the list to refresh
multiple times so once again this was

delete apps from your downloaded list in
the Google Play Store make sure to join
