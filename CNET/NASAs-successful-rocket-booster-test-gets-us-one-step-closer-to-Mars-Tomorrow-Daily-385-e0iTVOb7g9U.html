welcome to tomorrow daily the best ski
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley together and i'm jeff cannata and
we're here to deliver your recommended
daily allowance of headlines you
recommended daily allowance as they say
NASA celebrated a major milestone in its
ongoing journey to get people to Mars
the space agency tested one of these
solid rocket boosters that will be used
to launch a deep space rocket towards
Mars in the future the boosters will
make the Space Launch System rocket the
most powerful we've ever launched into
space and this marks the second test
nASA has done on them the booster didn't
actually fly anywhere as it was tethered
to the ground but it did kick up a lot
of smoke and dust out in the Utah
deserts burning for a total of five
hundred and forty-five seconds the
previous test was to heat the booster
and this was to test its performance at
cooler temperatures NASA plans and SLS
test flight in late 2018 and we might
see an actual crew launch in the SLS
between the years 20 21 and 20 23 which
is not too far off let's go to Mars I'm
ready let's go to Mars go Tyler oh man I
love it it's happening it's really
happening and they're not that far away
no it's it's so much closer than you
imagined it to be that's five years from
now minimum maybe seven and we might
send some people to Mars by 2030 that's
the goal is Mars 2030 though what they
want to do it so good job guys and a job
the booster test went great you've heard
us talk about the void before the VR
theme park but the void is no longer the
only game in town zero latency has been
developing a free-roaming VR experience
for years and last August it opened its
doors to the public in North Melbourne
Australia it's been such a success that
Sega is partnering to bring a version of
its zombie experience to a Tokyo
amusement park called joy palace they
use modified headsets and other props to
help immerse you in the action and the
entire experience is completely tether
free since the computer powering
everything is inside a backpack you slip
on at the start of the game
the experience costs around 65 bucks
last an hour and zero latency is looking
into expanding into other countries
around the globe like right here like
Jeff's living room backyard exactly i
think you could just zero latency if
you're watching a setup one right in
this studio room plenty of room plenty
of and we got the enthusiasm i think
this is going to be a big going forward
i think there's gonna be a lot of these
kinds this is the new laser tag yeah
this is the new laser tag and i think
its cool the way they describe how you
know just like going to a movie this is
a separate experience you can have VR at
home it just like you would watch a
movie at home but this would be on a
much grander scale and that's why you
want to pay for that experience 65 bucks
though it's a little power and that's
cool but it's it's a little steamy being
tether free and the guns in is so cool
looks so much fun it looks like so much
fun I would totally do it I'm in oh I'm
definitely in time me up Oh what do you
wanted to talk about on thursday i mean
either of these stories is really great
i love the idea of going to Mars and you
know me and v are so your call well I
think that we should let you guys choose
and you can by using the hashtag hey TV
sounds good to me also if you want to
comment on either of these stories and
let us know what your feedback or
impressions or whether you'd rather go
to Mars or rather be in a vm use minh
park rather go to Mars in a VR amusement

hashtag hey TD and then we'll
incorporate your comments on Thursday
