that they are not free to turn
separately one or the other as to slide
so engineers had to find a way to
connect both rear wheels to the engine
without sliding and slipping on turns
the device which makes this possible is
a part of the rear axle it is called the
differential because it can drive the
rear wheels at different speeds
now before we talk about limited slip
differentials let's get a quick
refresher on differentials here's one
out of a vintage Alfa Romeo good because
it's fairly simple and can get us down
on the basics the idea about a
differential is to allow the two in this
case rear drive wheels to turn at
different speeds while going the same
direction that's important in let's say
turning a corner where the outside wheel
is going to cover more distance at the
same time than the inside wheel it has
to turn faster if it didn't do that
either the inside wheel would have to
slip or these gears in the middle would
take a beating a differential allows
these two to operate somewhat
independently power comes in here from
the cars drive shaft here turns this
which operates a pinion gear that turns
the ring gear which turns planetary
gears which then turns bevel drive gears
that turn the axles of the output shafts
now here's where this whole assembly
falls down as miraculous as it is if one
of these wheels loses traction the power
or the torque goes to the path of least
resistance and spins that wheel the one
that's not getting any grip well the one
that does have grip sits there getting
very little or no power that's just not
a good thing so whether your car is
slipping a wheel because of a poor
surface or because of lifting during
cornering or just because you're
standing on it one wheels lighting up a
standard or open differential tend to
put the power in the wrong place when
there's a lack of grip that's where a
limited slip differential comes in it
limits the slip that is natural to a
basic differential if a drive wheel
loses traction the differential sends
power to the opposite wheel or axle with
the best grip or the slower moving wheel
or axle a front wheel drives have this
same function but it's built into their
trans axle transmission assembly on the
front of the car now we could spend
hours on the details of how these work
internally but basically there are
several types
Gared differentials use spring loading
and a more complex pack of gears than a
standard or open differential like we
have here clutch or plate limited slip
differentials use those kinds of parts
to engage one output shaft or the other
based on wheel
resistance if a wheel spins its clutch
or pressure plates loosened to send it
less torque viscous coupled limited slip
differentials rely on disks in the
differential spinning in silicone fluid
that gets either Gravier or less so
based on that friction of spinning and
electronic limited slip differentials
are controlled by the car's computer
it reads wheel slip and then commands
clutches electronically to tighten or
ease up their engagement on one wheel or
the other and within those four major
methods of doing limited slip there's
also another layer some that will sense
torque and others will sense wheel speed
to make their decision about what to
alter so now you know when you get a car
that has a limited slip differential
it's got some kind of technology built
into this power split device that allows
it to sense when a wheels lost traction
and send more power or torque to the one
that hasn't it helps you with
performance traction and safety</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
