gentlemen I am Eric Mack your host and
today I'm back at home in New Mexico
back in the offices of my hometown
newspaper the taos news our friends and
journalism joining me from Texas also
today is fellow Cray of minion Danny
Gallagher and alive in the cnet studios
in San Francisco are the rest of the
crew its kills the atoms Bonnie Burton
Jeff Sparkman and behind the controls
Lord Commander Stephen Beecham how's
everyone doing good awesome excellent so
last month micron robots but this time
around we're going to go beyond our own
dimension and you are halloween show a
little early this year it's kind of a
back to school scary stories show we're
really excited to talk about the
upcoming Evil Dead Ghostbusters and Twin
Peaks reboots and the new spin-off of
fear the walking dead among other things
and then later we'll do a little monster
myth debunking of a famous Scottish
monster you might know and an alleged
ghostly figure on Mars and finally wrap
it up the growing amount of evidence
we're eating in the matrix whatever it
just happened included high desert Danny
scream is he okay there was a class 3a
entity that's just watch every room in
my car my mic and made me dial 9 oh yeah
oh that sounds like a cat well now that
the cat and the go straight out of the
bag yeah dad I'd have to talk apartment
complex I'm late I'm I'm not order are
you drinking straight vodka dude so I
think Danny is really excited about the
Ghostbusters reboot and what we go ahead
and just start with you Danny and you
can tell us about your wardrobe choices
of late you don't the patch in there
this is yet so
oh you getting some music I like this
and fun music I was waiting for that
music that I've heard for entire week
the last week in july i decided to
challenge myself to something you know
the new Ghostbusters reboot is coming
out and despite it what I think is
really some unnecessarily negative
response to the fact that not just the
fact that it's a female cast that it's a
reboot which I kind of don't like but I
mean I want another Ghostbusters movie
obviously so anyway I decided to I
actually have a uniform that I made for
Halloween it actually looks pretty good
and decided to wear it for an entire
week in the middle of July I love this
this is great look at this footage how
did people react when you went to like
the grocery store and things I have no
idea what this guy reacts yeah he's
object in trouble and I'm talking oh
we're showing you shopping in target
right now yeah you're shopping at Target
that was a funny party kind of started
as like a why am I doing this kind of
thing which is pretty much every every
reason you know everyone like why would
you do why not give it a try so but it
kind of it kind of became this pseudo
Stanford Prison Experiment uh we're uh
you know III did this mainly cuz I'm
extremely socio phobic I don't know if
that's the associate foe however you
want to put it and this was kind of a
way of like drawing attention to myself
without like setting myself on fire he's
felt he's be slightly less visible when
I was my friend to Don he done here is
who he has a camera I don't know and it
is but it looks exactly like an iphone
someone we went ok was they usually well
they usually won't let you film and
target cuz they're worried you're gonna
do a competitor or something so right
maybe you but they just didn't that was
a funny part was like the first couple
of days nobody was saying anything to me
well the way the first person I saw just
looked as I walked out of my apartment
just went like Hello
see you if you lived in San Francisco by
the way I'm just saying you should move
here cuz that no one would mind people
would be like okay totally normal it
would be totally normal that was it then
you get dressed right cuz your reaction
yeah yeah I grew up in a weird said I
grew up in New Orleans where I saw all
kinds of crazy stuff and nobody badan
and I you know the locals didn't bat an
eye I thought here and you know Garrett
anukul uh Texas you know i get i get
beaten up or run out of town or made fun
of nobody cares nobody care by the third
day I was I went from Monday being like
totally frightened to even leave my
house to Wednesday being like indignant
like what nobody looking at me why is it
somebody robbed me yet what does I'm
done and that's what I got with my
friend it done and I'm like I need to go
to the store and then go to the park or
go out in public and just try to draw as
much attention to myself as possible so
it was kind of a weird I wouldn't say
I'm cured of my social phobias but it
does kind of show you that like you know
all those thoughts you have there just
in your head and there's no way to tell
like what someone else is thinking about
you or unless they actually react or say
some things I almost kind of make care I
almost think you should do it again when
it's closer to the movie release because
there's a whole generation of people
that have never seen ghostbusters I know
it's hard to imagine but there's kids
that still don't know the joys of ghost
busting so yeah that was a thing like it
was all guys might like I I should have
figured that Ghostbusters hasn't been
around in a while and it was mostly like
adults that responded kid I had one kid
who responded in the funniest way he
asked me why I why i captured his dead
grandmother but it led to my favorite
line in the in the peace and the
craziest conversation I've had ever had
in my life is at this point I was just
like acting like a Ghostbuster like I
might as well just play the part and
have fun it kind of said to love I you
know if I let your grandmother go gotta
let her grandmother go oh my god I love
this so much this is this might be one
of my favorite stories ever on cnet that
you decided to do this
and put yourself out there cuz social I
mean a lot of people have social anxiety
I don't have social anxiety have crowd
anxiety so I don't like it when and so
that you know really works in my
favorite comic con yeah well I just
don't like large crowds of people
surrounding me and I can't see an exit
uh but it's you know I think this is a
great idea for people who want to kind
of like get out there and try to
overcome some anxieties when it comes to
being around yeah you're doesn't really
hear people admitting that they might
have trouble cosplaying you know oh I
made this amazing costume and I just
want to be really brave about it I can
admit that I kind of feel silly being
half naked in public or something you
don't know I never really hear anybody
talking about that so that was kind of
interesting I actually wore a wonder
woman costume for a whole weekend um
mainly because I couldn't find my
clothes I was is a real Wonder Woman
costume and I was I think I don't
remember was i think it was in New York
or something and I just decided at New
York is one of those places to were no
one shocked by anything and I just I had
to go get laundry I had to get my
roommates laundry I had to like do all
the stuff that was just normal like
banal boring stuff in a wonder woman
costume luckily I was pretty fit then as
always in my 20s but I just remember the
coolest thing that happened was a little
girl came up to me and asked me to help
her find her lost kit kidding oh and I
was like oh my god she thinks I'm
actually Wonder Woman this is so awesome
is so much better than cuz I'll tell you
catcalling is a lot worse when you're
just as one dirham and then when you're
dressed like a normal girl so i got my
like share of skeezers but i'm hoping
that you didn't get cat call did you get
cat called by some ladies looking to
ghost no I think you did it on it not
anyone I didn't peg no actually I I kind
of its I don't I don't know how much you
want to know about this um like I said
the suit was extremely hot so when the
day I the video I shot in the park with
ad on it was over 100 degrees c and i'm
in a school and I mean I'm wearing as
little as possible underneath not that
you needed you
yeah which it you know I got elbow pads
elbow pads are the worst cuz they just
chew up your arms and these are the
action think the ones in the movie or
gray and kind of bulkier but you know I
couldn't find them and and and I and
SWAT boots um which look cool but are
the most uncomfortable shoes on the
planet ladies I understand you now just
be just be squat boots eyes hot at three
inch high heels basically I'm just glad
you didn't choose to cosplay as a storm
trooper cuz I'll tell you right now that
armor and that heat in Texas you would
not that's not a good combination so and
then 3x storm trooper they do they do
actually yeah I don't whistle here's
some fire its start when it's storm
troopers it's all sizes clone troopers
is the same size right yet to remember
if you're gonna stick to star wars canon
they all have to all clones are the same
size but stormtroopers can be ladies as
we know with upcoming Star Wars um so it
could be any size I don't think it
matters I think about sighs what matters
is how much armor or polyester are you
willing to wear for a story and so I
think this should be a regular series
where we make you wear different
costumes oh this is my help so pretty
soon we're gonna run out of costumes in
smell okay now on to your day you're not
your Franken from I'm glad that you know
I'm glad that you wore this costume
because maybe Kelsey can chime in on
this too the thing that I always hated
about costumes with franchises and now
that we have an all-female cast for this
upcoming Ghostbusters and their costumes
which I think we're revealed in another
scene that article that shows that
they're pretty similar to the ones that
were in the movie I'm just so glad
they're similar to the ones that were in
the original movie and they weren't
those stripper versions of ghosts like I
know you know yeah ghostbusters yes so
they're just saying and there's it
happens every Halloween where there's
really slutty and I don't want slut
shame let's just say there's stripper
like versions of every franchise costume
out there and they're called sweet
sensations from rubies rubies is the
number one costuming company and they
have
this ghostbusters costume for women that
that's i would say more like a bikini
like it's not exactly the i mean if you
just did Ghostbusters sexy costume it's
a google search you'll find with the gym
I'm doing this for work incidentally if
you google it is it's a stripper you
yeah there it is yeah well is that it
yeah I mean no um there's a proton pack
one for another one and then there's a
sexy slimer costume which is even more
disturbing so and I think they're on
amazon to the sad Belushi in my head
right now yeah so I I want to commend
you I want to say thank you for
cosplaying in the dead of like so much
heat going on in in Texas right now and
you cosplayed for the sake of a story
that's you should get a Pulitzer for
this this is this is hardcore journalism
happening right here this is I I was
impressed and entertained so thank you
all thank you I mean so Danny how are
you how are you planning to top yourself
what's next i'm a job but yeah well
what's next what costume is next please
later I won't be hey Darth Vader say
Darth Vader okay yeah I'm gonna wait
till like winter and then I'm gonna go
to like main dude Arthur honest like
like it I mean it gets kind of cut we
get I don't know where everybody else is
but we get snow I hear like maybe five
inches a year so yeah if I do something
i think i may do this lucky Ghostbuster
costume yeah no inter time yeah yeah no
I mean I look heavy enough in this cut
that was a thing like I wore this it
just real Qui I don't want to dwell on
this too much but there were a lot of
fat jokes out there people a lot that
comment no it's fine I love being
roasted so I didn't care but I kind of
didn't realize it till I looked at the
pictures and the video cuz I thought
this thing was bulky and apparently it
shrinks there's something I don't know
here's the thing never build never read
the comments Danny I can't stress this
enough yeah really cuz this is something
I had to avoid reteach myself yeah I'm
not calling anybody out look I
I'm I could you know I'm I'll you know
I'll bust jokes with the with the bet I
bust get it yeah no I mean I'll Rose
people as much the necks of them but I
was like man why did it take me a week
to realize that like this the suit kind
of it's not like a wet suit but it's
it's kind of like if they made a wet
suit out of like shredded wheat or
something a little bit but it sucks in
at other points so i don't know i think
i look i did to quote an iconic fashion
man i will say that as Tim Gunn would
say you made it work Danny okay made it
work and now you have my respect because
honestly I couldn't have done it and it
would have drove me crazy to hear all
the comments for people yelling at me
and and I would have done it if I was
actually ghostbusting I feel like if
there were some haunted places did you
go to any haunted places while you were
dressed like oh no I mean I wanted to go
to places where I would not fit in okay
so that like if I went to a haunted out
which I personally I'm kind of scared of
those things I'm scared of those no no
we get down to ever say they'd follow
you home hey so you are a freak no go to
Oh Danny but but now I wanted to go to
places where I specifically wouldn't fit
it like I think if I'd done in another
week I would have gone to a church DMV
oh yeah sure yeah uh I would have gone
to uh what's it would be a good one
would be the ultimate I wanted to go to
the live like whole foods for some
reason haha yeah whole food there's a
whole I want one I wanted to do that I
never got to cuz we needed a third
person was I wanted one person to wear a
sheet as it goes and then we go to the
library and we just run and chase each
other yeah we just I just I just it's
like me and it's like Preston lacy and
we man and jackass except a buster and a
ghosted him to get back here you know I
just I wanted to do that but we never
got around to you should try to crowd
control you should see if you could
actually get people to like leave the
room because we told them to and that
could all right everybody hahaha I'm
standing at the side of the road holding
the Ghostbusters I should have just
stood in the middle of the road just
been like you know all right oh yeah
just you know what I feel like at this
point the way the news is going in the
world is headed
we're going to need a Ghostbuster soon
so just keep the costume handy you never
know when you might be helping recruited
by local police or something for help
during a situation yeah if I'm work by
local police then just give up a little
bit dark maybe shake whatever they can
hey how come the sexy Ghostbuster
costumes aren't called ghost busty Oh
daph like seriously I'm when I googled
sweet sensations Ruby by the way HR I'm
doing this for work yeah I'm getting an
actual page so i amused addict I want to
transition to something cuz I think
Danny's inspiring me to do a story for
seen at and if we can transition to the
Twin Peaks news I think by Homer I think
what I might do is I might spend a week
as log lady and see if anyone asked me
about the log that I'm carrying for a
week and I'm just gonna have the log
talk for me so when I go to the store
what I do anything I'm gonna be like my
log says I don't have to talk to you
anymore and I'm just gonna I'm gonna
take it to dinner parties I think that
this could be a thing might actually go
so i will leave the house okay i will
leave I won't your display guy yeah if I
can learn how to speak backwards I'd
like to be the little guy in the dreams
for a week and be fun yes you still open
if I keep her oh okay yeah yeah yeahs
decide if riac you sense albums out
there it's going to baffle the
Millennials out there who I've never
seen Twin Peaks they have no excuse it's
on hulu it's on netflix it's also may
not a porno it's been available for DVD
for the last I don't know how many years
pretty soon we're gonna have a talk
about battleship potemkin so hang info
yeah I'm gonna go and by the way that
population saw never changed that's not
it's kind of like the Cabot Cove
population sign from Murder She Wrote it
should go down you should have barbs
upon from mcdonalds and just reversed it
should actually be in chalk at this
point so they started shooting the new
one where are they shoot out there
shooting in September they started yet
so they're shooting in September cuz
there was a whole rigmarole of what is
David Lynch gonna be involved is he not
going to be involved mark frost was
always
those are the two original creators and
David Lynch's you know the the iconic
director that's done just some crazy
movies and if you have if you're not
familiar with them I highly suggest you
just look them up and watch everything
he's ever done and then you'll
understand completely why this is so
exciting but Twin Peaks is one of those
pivotal TV shows that either loved it or
you hated it and I remember when I
watched it in high school my dad saw an
episode with me and he's like what the
hell is this my dad's used to like calm
procedurals like my dad's were weird
thing for him was the law and order
episode about vampires like to them that
was the weird thing but when you watch
Twin Peaks you have to remember it's
like a surreal dream nothing really
makes sense you're going to dissect it
for ages all the characters are
memorable weird and quirky there's so
many great quotes and there's just so
many great things happening there's only
two seasons before this before this new
show time show and some people say the
second season was pretty bad but I had
loved both seasons I just thought it was
quirky and weird and the whole premise
is that you're trying to figure out who
killed this girl named Laura Palmer who
was like a high school prom queen and as
the show goes on you find out these
weird things about her that are just get
weirder and weirder and weirder and
weirder friends weird things about her
parents were things about like all the
the population of twin peaks from the
adults and the high school kids and the
music goes grades by julie cruz and she
did the singing but then Angelyn and i'm
going to ruin his name he's Italian
Angela Angela bal de mentee I think I'm
gonna say that that's he was the there's
Kyle MacLachlan as Dale Cooper he did
the music for it now Kyle MacLachlan is
the only one of the original cast that
has confirmed they've confirmed he's
coming back as Agent Dale Cooper and I'm
not going to say anything about him
because if you haven't watched twin
peaks I don't want to spoil it for you
but you should go back and watch the two
seasons of twin peaks it aired so you
can get caught up because this is 25
years later because in the show Laura
Palmer when you see her in something
called the Black Lodge which is kind of
like this dream state area she says I
will see you again in 25 years and sure
enough 25 years later we
get a new season of twin peaks and mark
frost is also writing a book that's a
novelization that's supposed to catch us
up and what's happened with all these
characters in that twenty five year span
so that's supposed to fill in some gaps
so if you're really a die-hard Twin
Peaks fans you should rewatch both
seasons then read this book that's
supposed to come out soon I don't know
when it's supposed to come out I think
it's this year and then you'll be ready
but they haven't started filming till
September I just wrote an article last
week that said they're going to they
officially said they're they're filming
in September it was supposed to air 2016
but then I got pushed back because David
Lynch said he didn't want to be involved
and then they brought him back and
there's all this is he or isn't he going
to be involved and so they pushed it
back to to 2017 but then during the
Television Critics press event that
happened last week the head of showtime
set up while we're hoping for 216 and
there's going to be familiar faces they
didn't say who and big surprises which
is a no-brainer because it's david lynch
so i don't know what's gonna happen i'm
actually working on an article right now
for seeing it listing all the characters
i want to come back and why and all the
characters i don't want to come back and
why and luckily there's a lot of
characters that died during first and
second season but as we know in Twin
Peaks people can come back to life and
visit the living if there if this Lodge
situation still happening and then
there's like demons and stuff so I hence
why it's scary that's what we're talking
about this by the way wondering because
this was supposed to be our scary show
um it's it's a creepy show it gave me
nightmares I had to watch this in my
college dorm in the laundry room the
rickety scary laundry room in the boiler
room area of my dorm because it was dawn
did you watch it with creepy janitor too
high note yeah and here's the thing i
watched it that way because it was on
our monday nights and as we know what
else is on a monday night and what
college kids want to watch is this a
tone Monday Night Football oh right
right that's enough
I was I was a CU Boulder I went to
university colorado boulder which is all
football people so it's basically like
me in the rickety scaredy one bulb
basement watching this super scary show
and I could hear screaming above me
because there's football players
watching Monday Night Football on the
nice big screen TV in the nice warm
lobby of the dorm so really they did you
a favor oh my god I had Bob nightmares
he's like the scary like demon character
and Twin Peaks I had Bob nightmares
forever so I'm just saying I'm a heart I
don't know if you can tell I'm a
hardcore Twin Peaks man that's hard no
no also if you're in London they're
doing a twin peaks dinner experience oh
yeah that I wrote about interesting so
any of our London viewers are named for
London reporters I hope they go cuz I
want to see what it's like to basically
go to a twin peaks murder dinner I want
to know like you yeah I would imagine
like there has to be some level of drug
taking it off just to replicate the show
like yeah we're gonna sneak Ellis the
mashed potatoes and it's gotta be okay
it's gotta be some I mean obviously
they'd have cut they'd have coffee which
is a staple in the show and some pie hi
all right let's know much yet you can go
to the double our diner in outside of
Seattle where they filmed a lot of twin
peaks and they have it it looks like
that diner and they have all this
memorabilia up and stuff and you can get
a coffee cup I have a twin peaks coffee
cup so I I'm just saying them I'm
excited for the old fans like me who
super love the show and I'm excited to
see what new fans might think of it
Millennials might think is just lame I
have no idea but I love it so I'm you
need to understand though they need to
understand the boat without Twin Peaks I
feel like there is no loss there are no
be like mega shows of the last 10 years
where there's an ongoing mystery this
was the first one twin peaks was weird
because the whole season the whole first
season it was building up to figuring
out who killed Laura Palmer and you
still didn't find out at the end you had
to wait until second season and um the
other thing about this too was it was so
weird and bizarre it really did set the
stage for other weird and bizarre TV
shows to the point now where every time
there's something like wayward Pines or
before that happy town or like you
mentioned lost people just people kind
of
compare it to twin peaks or they compare
it to David Lynch type of cinematography
and storytelling and it's just it is a
really bizarre TV show and I hope that
it's going to translate on Showtime I
did read that it's going to be filmed as
a movie and then they're cutting it into
nine episodes interesting so it is going
to be continuous so we'll see I am
excited I'm looking forward to it and if
anyone in the casting is listening I'm
available for any kind of extra work but
I am I am keeping my fingers crossed
that one of the pivotal characters pedal
weird characters called log lady will
show up and she's this woman that
basically she her husband died but his
spirit was captured in a log just a
piece of wood that she carries around
and talks to and she chews gum all the
time and puts gum underneath tables
she's just a wacky character so I'm
looking forward to this sorry that's my
wrath that's my rant rave so between
twin peaks and ghostbusters I mean I
think we're big fans but neither of
those are coming out for a while and one
thing that's coming up in just a week is
the the most shameless spin-off I've
ever seen which is the fear The Walking
Dead spinoff which I believe it's
basically in the same world but we're
going back to just after the zombie
apocalypse and and joining a different
group in Los Angeles is that right yep
that's it that's what else excited for
this I mean I'm pretty excited just
because all right I've heard of more
shameless spin-offs yeah I could be
honest I guess it's true yeah there's a
lot of cables that are like to know I'd
like to know how much time they spent on
the name that's chilly yeah yeah wait
which one the fear of walking dead oh
there's your peers Rick were they like
so that's season 6 trailer for that's
coming up I'll chime excited for it cuz
finally Rick is like saying you know
what I'm in charge shut up whiners
finally finally he's saying hey do you
want to live come with me kind of
situation oh this is different this is
just get no more Rick different groups
welcome to suburbia can
I don't think you know so Rick can you
should oh this is the one I was looking
for I'm sorry yeah that's that's season
six that's coming up of walking dead
this is the new one yeah you're the new
one is next week and then season six of
walking dead is in October right it's
like a dude running for his life
I feel like I'm listening to the
old-timey radial version yeah this is
kids why you need a belt this is why you
should have a belt kids yep all those
guys that were there jeans down to their
knees this is why you need a belt
zombies yeah where you know are you
everything I mean are you know my
brother was actually mocking me
yesterday because I've never seen it ah
I'm not dude I don't know Gill to watch
I'm not gonna zombie shame you Jeff I'm
just saying there's plenty of operation
I get like one hour of sleep at night I
know zombies we all have 24 hours in a
day it's just how you decide to spend
your life whether you want to be
productive or watch a lot a like I just
watched an episode of Adam 12 that's
great just so I could see what the
actors who did the voice of Gina on the
Superfriends look like Oh cuz I was
curious should I dress of all the
obscure shows we mentioned so that's due
up later let's do got Murder She Wrote
yeah that's not obscure that's not your
that's a classic manager to do to this
to this generation Adam 12 yeah that's
alright the Millennials there's a week
that's what we coupee Diaz for kids get
operator Kelsey what do you think what
do you think about walking dead nothing
whatsoever I'm not a zombie person
except for Zombies Run which I'm
obsessed with but that's my only zone I
don't know I will do I feel like maybe
we're all going through zombie OD like
maybe there's we went through the
vampire like Twilight OD right yeah I
fall burn out on vampire I know it's a
zombie is this zombie fatigue like is
this something that's treatable I can't
have zombie fatigue sounds woody I mean
I'm yeah yeah like zombies to me where
what got me into her and supernatural
stories and I I haven't watched I
haven't kept up with the walking dead in
fact I kind of put myself in a corner
after the fur cuz the first season ender
was so bad that I'm like I don't wanna
yeah I don't want to know that it could
get worse after this and so for a while
I didn't watch it and then I picked it
up again and realized it it got better
like when the governor stuff came in and
all that others I actually got but I
feel the same way I feel like it was
more like talking dead like they just I
wanted everyone I want all the humans to
die because honestly it was just I felt
like I was
watching a horrible episode of Oprah
where couples just never got along so
and there's always that one or project
runway but with a death element you know
because and no one could like a free
like project dead way I would watch that
if they were like designers and if your
design is it good like it like if
michael kors says no I hate this then
you die like after Heidi says Evita Zane
it's like you just get attacked by
zombies you just drop through a hole i
would watch that I will say that I the
only thing that's going to get me
excited for walking dead and any spin
off is if they did it from the view of a
zombie like if maybe the point of view
with a zombie so it's no dialogue you
just see them running after humans yeah
and but you see the life what is the day
in the life of a zombie like I mean what
those those guys just crawl around all
day but do they they hear a sound and go
towards it do zombies fight amongst
themselves but they just grunt like it
was the indie movie that did that there
was a girl yeah there's a lot of movies
at Dubai you know that was quite large
ahead Nicolas holder yeah warm bodies
Fido even shaun of the dead at the very
end they show you the life you know what
nick frost's life like is a zombie
really sorry oh well come on I know it's
but I agree why don't know I won't tell
you anymore guys speaking of simon pegg
we just did actually yes can we just
take a quick poll our fastest on bees
okay with you guys no won't be so bad
fats are fast no I have a different
reason I have the definitive reason to
end that argument okay so I the word
zombie I don't know the be Greek I think
it's greek root word that zombie comes
from literally means sleep oh I thought
it was a Haitian word or maybe it's a
Haitian work either way either way west
african for zombie is come from it comes
from my word meeting sleep or a typist
or sleepwalker that was that i think is
the term so you know unless unless
unless jackie joyner-kersee i actually
had this question a while ago can
zombies ride bikes because it's all
muscle muscle memory
so I was wondering if it Lance Armstrong
becomes a zombie can he chase you down
here to me with a bike become zombie and
still can ride a bike we know he's
definitely juicing okay also I also
think zombies can attack with segways
cuz you just have to lean in you don't
actually have to do anything on the
Segway you just lean lean yeah okay I ok
might the master of segues and so we
talk to you mine really made a yahoo
joke you don't want to talk about evil
dead but no yeah you look evil dead
where are we with that I didn't know if
any of us had covered that yeah we cut I
think we covered it on the site I'm
super stoked for this evil dead TV
spin-off they happy too because everyone
involved is the original people so we've
got Bruce Campbell obviously Sam Raimi

little crossover talk because we just I
just did this article about the xena

lot of it here's the thing let me know

Necronomicon X mortis The Book of the
Dead
certain passages with a lot of footage
from the original Evil Dead 2 right no

is okay young Bruce it was pretty it was
pleased still pretty sorry no offense
mr. Campbell I just love this cuz now i

first comic book convention he said the
long line for Bruce Campbell and all
these people dressed as zombies and had
fake chainsaws and stuff and he's like I
don't remember this episode of burn
notice with the dead people my dad he's

life and you're hot as hell you know
they were Jewish right I did not said
something Troy made those dumb crosses

Bruce cambo and couldn't Tarantino to
team up on something cuz i might be not
hard I don't think that's a difficult
team up honestly here's the thing so you
think sam raimi done that sort of a
sequel yeah personally I I don't know I
here's I I love Bruce Campbell he's he's
Bruce Campbell I mean there's a movie he

help a town rid themselves of demons but
he plays himself like I think that he's
so in tuned with his audiences fandom

so great I make super excited for this
so come how have you ever seen this have

I think for Halloween my daughter wants
to see it awesome I don't know yeah I do
it well you know I saw Exorcist when I
was seven I turned out though is his
13th when I is five yeah me too i saw
right movie when I was oh I'm sorry I
thought I yeah its 1970s parenting yeah
well we got about 10 minutes here to
move on to a few real monsters uh real
monsters in air quotes over the course
the last few months we could've been
keeping an eye on the Loch Ness monster
as we do for you here on crave keeping a
on the real monsters of the world and
unfortunately for Nessie fans around the
world it seems that the Loch Ness
monster may have been catfishing us all
these years I wrote a story a few weeks
back one of the premier Nessie hunters
in the world after 25 years he's decided
that he thinks the Loch Ness monster is
really a giant catfish a delicious
catfish I mean but a giant catfish
ladies think about it is a little scare
of his life huh yeah that's dad in like
the like the early language he gave up
everything moved to walk nest to hunt
for Nessie full time and after
almost 20 years he's decided that all
the evidence points to this being a a
very large species of catfish that was
introduced probably around the early
1900s for fishing and they can they can
grow to like in men's sizes and the
Victorians wanted a bowl cleaner for
their for the law might implicate does
this catfish have a long neck I mean I I
feel like wasn't Nessie's supposed to
look more like a brontosaurus and less
like at long john silver's platter like
the famous like wrong neck photos like
from the early 1900's have been debunked
a while ago clearly I need to catch up
where are you elodie beers sorry I
thought it was I thought that was it's
kind of like the Bigfoot photo right
where he's like in the forest I guess
that that's not real either this is fun
Santa most famous one yeah that's the
one everyone knows that looks like a
catfish sticking his arm out or yeah
yeah it's just an arm I hope an arm Eric
one of your Commodore suggests but um if
what happened was Nessie was devoured by
the giant catfish which mending is wrong
oh my god catfish are terrifying which
will then will be devoured by a shark
tornado as we learned from shark
sharknado 3 that it can go into space it
can go into Scotland it can go anywhere
so I'm cuz sharknado was a real thing
right that's oh yes okay blue legit I
remember that being an issue when Shark
Week was happening that you'd start to
get all these like fake shark
documentaries popping up and people
going oh this is amazing cuz it's on
Discovery Channel or history channel or
wherever and you found out now this is
this is a reason that history channel
has the ancient aliens does it
necessarily mean it's real you know I
lived down the road from george RR
martin who's in santa fe and so i can
confirm that the reason the books are
not done yet is because he was
decapitated by a flying track Oh ain't
that always the way though I thought
they should have killed him in a red
shirt wedding but that was just me
wasn't that a billy idol song yeah
that's a billy idol rich
so it's a catfish anything else do we
know how it tastes do we know what it's
named chip what you know what's
interesting is about a year ago I think
there was a picture from Apple maps of
Loch Ness that cropped up that um you
know appeared to show the Loch Ness
monster some people said it was actually
looked like the wake from a boat but it
does kind of match the outline of this
same species of catfish so we may we may
have settled that one once and for all
um be ironic if somebody found something
like this with Apple maps how ironic
well they all the drivers were directly
missing together yeah they wanted to
they wanted to like drain the lake I
remember that they wanted to send down
some like underwater drones it sounds
like a you free I'll be right back I
gotta go drain the lake what Danny I
think you're training your dragon what
what Danny we're sorry we're neglecting
you what we saying I'm trying to I'm
trying to really force this joke so
brace yourself okay okay i think that i
think the pics are we you know one time
I think it was a log at one time it was
we said it was just a catfish one and
now it's a boat I think what we're
missing is that Loch Ness is a
shapeshifter yeah like he can that's not
a joke that's real I would I don't
believe that I I mean that's if i
learned anything from X Files
shapeshifters didn't take any shape
hence the name what's the name yeah I
agree with that I mean or could be an
alien I think there was one episode of
ancient aliens that thought that Loch
Ness was an alien so if there wasn't
there will be in about a week no what
other monsters do we have to debunk
errors we got one more Monster and then
we gotta run I did a bit of monster
debunking myself earlier this month you
may have seen but something going on the
internet it was a picture from the Mars
Curiosity rover that appeared to show a
woman in like a flowing dress standing
on a rock on the surface of Mars as
usual it's a black-and-white grainy
photo but there's this figure that those
look like a woman with long hair in a
dress and so that went around
the UFO conspiracy sites and Huffington
Post and all over the place and so I
called NASA to get their opinion and the
guy the guy at NASA was like right you
know we get this call like every day
yeah he said he hadn't heard about it
you know we get snotty said we get some
kind of call along these lines somebody
thinks they see something in a photo I
mean cuz there's dozens of photos that
come back from although the rover's like
every day and people are always going
through it with a fine-tooth comb and so
you know wall I was waiting to hear back
from a scientist which actually still
haven't I went through some of the other
photos from the same day from the same
spot that this photo of an allegedly
strange woman was taken and he my paper
no worries even if you can scroll down
to the very bottom I posted another
photo and it's a photo of the same angle
of the same spot on the same day on Mars
but it's taken from just a different
camera that's a little higher up on the
rover so it's not and so you actually
get a little piece of the rover's wheel
in the shot which means that if there is
a woman on Mars she's about two inches
tall all i care to say the rubber ran
over her it would be unfortunate yeah i
love these shots because there's such a
Rorschach test I think I see I'm pretty
sure I saw jalwa or at least RTD to
someone right I thought it's funny that
people project gender on to this little
figure you know I mean so it's somebody
in her it would be Marcia somebody's in
a row what's up what's toward about that
you know me are Jedi wear robes Marcia
Marcia Marcia why is it always Marcia
yeah I love this stuff it's like the
Jesus in the toast turns out it's really
Bigfoot there's a lot it's Nessie yeah i
just wanted that phone here's all the
assets still getting calls about this
always gets calls i think it's amusing
that they answer them you know they
still did you know they shuffle this off
on like one point I honestly thanks
detective I honestly think that's old
hat nASA has a division for this because
when I was I when I was like eight I
wrote them a letter asking them I think
it was an ET came out I asked him if
they had any internships at NASA for
talking to aliens and helping them get
home and
wrote me this nice letter back saying
that you know there's no UFOs there's no
you know that the galaxy is big but we
have not come across any aliens it was a
big you know conspiracy theory letter I
thought but no but that's to an
eight-year-old yeah it was to an
eight-year-old but I thought that was
sweet ya know that's what I think they
have they must know i canna version they
must have a full customer service
division just dedicated to UFO people
and kids doesn't happen to have leg i
turning the press officer Ian Aykroyd
what's that but what if i want i see you
know you you said you wrote to NASA by
ET i did the same to dan Aykroyd um last
notice how I was 26 he sent you to
Austin haha and a Christmas cola vodka
yeah I I spoke to actually the press
officer for for Mars exploration at NASA
and I called him I the answer the answer
the phone and I you know I told him what
i was looking into and they're loose up
there was a pause on the line kind of a
sigh and you just want what ya know it
could be an astral we're not doing this
you know we just to be I just want to
commend you Erica's we may be the only
blog that actual and when I'm a blogger
legit news site we might be the only
legit journalist that decided to
actually ask NASA for their opinion yes
sir we did this recalled FAC fact
checking where we actually call NASA and
people that would give us a straight
answer or at least the right one on what
this is as opposed to just reblogging
when everybody else is blogging so thank
you for taking the time to actually call
NASA that even though they gaped and
discussed at you on the phone at least
you got a lately yeah Hawaii you like to
climb yeah very nice yeah but what I
mean what's really amazing to me is you
know this the the page on NASA and I
like I said anyone can go look at this
image and people go comb through and
look for funny things but like you know
on the same page where this image was
found with the woman you know like five
images down is the one that I looked at
that's the same thing but with a wheel
and it they actually give a perspective
yeah you know so I mean everything out
there you know people
thank you for very very tiny woman is
rubbing it that's probably got like
cause of what why there 2 inch women on
North Hollywood haha oh this is awesome
I think I think we're gonna have to
leave it there wait can I one more thing
so I wrote this story last night because
I knew we're gonna do a horror theme so
I it's called goth box and it's one of
those subscription mystery boxes that
you can get the Kickstarter campaign to
help us like get off the ground just a
box is a box of awesome guy it is it was
my nickname in high school oh it's a
gloomy box full of goth stuff and the
cool thing is is I think it's the only
one of its kind cuz usually you get like
loot crate or narwhal unicorn bacon
whatever there's always some weird geeky
box um that's out there for geeks but
nothing for Goths and wait and I guess
what's in it can I get so uh yeah
adderall sir black eyeliner so ashes me
the ashes of ex-boyfriends like unicorn
tears no no it's it's got like it could
be good it could be customized for
different Goths so if you're like a
steam punk goth or if you're true no God
yeah I'm spare if you're like a geeky
like if you're gonna kind of got that
likes to craft if you're like the kind
of guy that likes you know just
straight-up horror and you just like you
know like vampire stuff so it's actually
they send you a little questionnaire and
you say what kind of goth you are and
you that's a sample of one of the things
that could happen in goth box for you
when there's like goth candy got jewelry
I have one like-for-like Visigoths yep
they have dirty yeah exactly yeah it's
for guys or girls so they they have it
gender specified if you care about
gender specified your stuff so you just
don't end up with a bunch of jewelry if
your deed but there's there's some cool
stuff here so I interviewed the creator
of the goth box about why she thought
that there should be a goth box and she
said Goths deserve mystery boxes too and
they need cheering up and I was kind of
organic bubbling and I know and I'm a
I'm a goth even though I'm wearing color
right now I'm doing this because my mom
says I need to wear more colors I don't
look dead so I'm wearing
rainbow sweater right now but I am goth
and I am getting this box because I
think that Goths deserve a little bit of
Wednesday Addams to show up at the door
stone you have to wear certain clothing
just give you very good yeah gosh that's
pretty guy and I forgot yeah anyway
sorry I wrote this story I wrote the
story today and you can check it up on
sina and you can check out the
kickstarter but i wanted to just slip
that in there before we left because I
actually did i stayed up till three in

spooky stuff to talk about clearly I was
wrong but you're welcome internet

you everyone for for washing today we're
gonna have to wrap it up we'll have to
talk about the matrix next time that's
actually something I'm still working on
anyway so we'll learn in a future crepe
