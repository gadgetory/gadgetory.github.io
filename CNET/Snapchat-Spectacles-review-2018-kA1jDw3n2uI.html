spectacles the sunglasses with a camera
inside like the first version these
glasses record circular video for
snapchat there's a single button that
starts recording in the case doubles as
a charger so let's dive into what's new
in version 2 the big change is that they
now take photos as well as videos you
just have to press and hold the button
on the temple now the field of view of
the lens has actually reduced a little
bit so it's now 105 degrees rather than
115 degrees so this means you'll
probably get slightly less in your shot
but it should compensate a little bit
better for that fisheye effect so things
won't look so warped but the big deal is
that they are water-resistant now snap
hasn't told us exactly how
water-resistant they are but they'll be
fine for splashing around in the pool or
taking to the beach and overall the
design is just lighter so the
electronics have been miniaturized the
temples are smaller and it just feels
lighter on the face
meowww do dual microphones make audio
clearer than version one and glasses
wearers can swap in prescription lenses
clips now transfer in HD and that
process is a lot faster thanks to a
Wi-Fi connection when you want to look
at the photos and videos the only way to
do that is through snapchat once they're
transferred you can rotate the phone
around to view all parts of the image
and then share them out of snaps or
export them but photos and videos will
have white borders around the edges
here's the thing you actually can't film
yourself with spectacles unless you hold
them out like this which doesn't look
great sure you can pull out your phone
but that kind of defeats the purpose
photo and video quality is totally fine
for viewing on snapchat with colors
looking nice and punchy like many
cameras with small sensors things look
best in daylight images in low light so
it'd look great but then again if you're
wearing sunglasses at night image
quality probably isn't your number one
criteria
snaps hoping to learn from the mistakes
from version 1 because they only sold
two hundred and twenty thousand of them
then making them much easier to buy from
the website rather than vending machines
these actually cost twenty dollars more
than the original version and if you're
anything like me one hundred and fifty
dollars is a lot of money to spend on a
pair of sunglasses I mean they're not
designer sure they look nice but in the
back of my mind I'm always thinking I
could have used that money to go towards
like a real pair of sunglasses a real
designer pair so the question is does
having spectacles and making use
snapchat more or less now snaps hoping
that the answer is gonna be more I found
that when I've been using these and the
previous version of spectacles I was
using them a lot when I first got them
but then over the period of about a
month or two I just stopped using them
and in turn I just started pulling out
my phone instead and really over that
period of time since the first
spectacles and this version I actually
used snapchat a lot less as well
turns out I'm not alone from snaps
latest earnings report the company has a
slowest rate of user growth ever and
some of the most exciting things that
snaps working on like AR games called
snapper balls are still tied to the app
itself so the bottom line is spectacles
are a lot of fun to use but they're
expensive and probably priced out of the
reach of most snapchatters not being
able to record longer clips without
constantly pressing the button is
annoying as for privacy it's still a
huge gray area even though the lights
flash to show you're filming you're
still going to capture audio and video
of people that probably didn't realize
they were being recorded and once the
novelty of sunglasses wears off
sometimes it is just easier to pull out
your phone to record a clip that you can
watch everywhere
rather than just snapchat
