service too many times paying by credit
card table side and your mug in 3d we're
not talking coffee here it's the queue
what's going on hope your day is just
awesome I'm rich demuro with Cena TV and
this is the cue let's check out your
must click moment travelzoo throwing the
dice with an interactive ad campaign in
the Vegas Airport travelers walking by
the huge ads see real time travel deals
and oh yeah their image is projected
right into them there's also a huge slot
machine where you can pull a virtual
lever I'll do anything in that airport
to try to forget how much less money i'm
leaving with moving through the view
getting out of a cell phone contract
isn't easy unless you're with sprint and
you love to call customer service The
Wall Street Journal reporting that about
a thousand subscribers were dropped
after they called for help 25 times a
month that's 40 times more than average
the company sent letter saying the
customers had a month to find someone
else to carry their calls and hear about
their problems they won't have to pay
any early termination fees now I don't
know about you but I dread calling
customer service once a year can't
imagine once a day your face in 3d
gizmos got it and it could land you in a
taco bell commercial the fast-food joint
teaming up with the avatar builder and
the MTV Video Music Awards you upload a
picture of yourself and gizmos animates
it in creepily realistic 3d add some
audio and your audition is complete
three lucky uploaders will get their
virtual mug on national TV in a 30
second taco bell commercial now if
you've ever felt like a waiter has
forgotten about you once you hand over
your credit card you'll appreciate this
next story now it's taken a while to
catch on but some restaurants are
finally testing tableside card readers
seems like we're getting used to doing
pretty much everything ourselves these
days two companies now competing for a
spot at our dinner tables verifone has
the VX 670 while hypercom has the blade
both resemble those grocery store credit
card check out systems when you're
finished with your meal just swipe and
go this could also make splitting checks
a little less painful finally the site
in an award worthy quasi conflict of
interest eBay
has opened up kijiji to the u.s.
classified market yes it's the same ebay
that has a twenty-five percent stake in
craigslist the original classified ads
leader kijiji means village in swahili
the site offers free classified ads in
more than 300 cities around the world it
first launched in several countries back
in 2005 kijiji says they have 17 million
users no mention of ebay on the site or
paypal or rent com or stubhub but there
is an ad for a JetBlue brand ambassador
