that little fan oh nice move yeah see
that's actually not supposed to happen
these flying robots which are being
developed by scientists at carnegie
mellon university are actually designed
to help in search-and-rescue missions
the idea is that for any emergency
situations were very dangerous
situations you don't want people to go
in so things like during a fire when how
the fire is progressing when you have a
nuclear reactor accident you want to
know the radiation that was inside the
building Oh sound far-fetched I was
sudden yeah a little bit but this kind
of research is being done all over the
world as scientists try to figure out
how to make robots swarm autonomously
what could go wrong when you were
investigating the helicopter design did
you actually have to sort of study how
helicopters fly none of us are actually
mechanical engineers oh oh so what we
did was that we went to the store and
look for the funnest toy really like but
you bought like remote control
helicopters and yes we took all their
together now we took out all their
circuitry I'm putting our own that's
awesome now these robotic helicopters
have radios gyroscopes and compasses
inside so they can sense objects around
them and each other the idea is you use
the gyroscope to stabilize the rotation
so you don't want your helicopter
spinning out of control you want it to
sit straight and track in a particular
direction that's what the gyroscope does
do you think you could build a
helicopter now ha that is a very good
question
synchronized and targeted and listen to
that that sound is kind of ominous
that's the slightly terrifying vision of
tomorrow Oh see if you hit it in attacks
what about today with these helicopter
bots work when I put them to the test so
how many can you get going at once right
now like directing them to fly right
into the palm of my hand oh also cue the
ride of the Valkyries music they're
coming at me oh god are you sure though
I'm in charge I'm not in charge I am in
charge we're taking the show on the road
me and this me and this helicopter robot
are going to Vegas the technology still
has a long way to go I mean what i saw
in development was pretty impressive but
the notion that hella bots will be able
to autonomously swoop into a burning
building and eventually save lives
they've got a little work to do but
looks help dramatic so I know you say
it's disposable but it's not really this
