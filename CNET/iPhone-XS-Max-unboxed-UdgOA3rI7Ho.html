going to unbox it it starts a 1099 but
we have the 512 gigabyte version to
review which costs fourteen hundred and
forty nine dollars that's a lot of money
let's see what's inside the packaging
very similar to other iPhones designed
by Apple in California this is where all
the little bits of paperwork art hello
they say there's no instruction manual
for an iPhone but there is this is all
the basic interactions you do with the
face ID equipped iPhones
SIM card tool by the way the new iPhones
support and Isom as well as a nano SIM
so you could have two SIM cards at once
your fine print I'll read that later and
two stickers as always if you'd like
some more stickers to add to your Apple
collection here it's the 10s max in gold
6.5 inch screen size roughly about an
iPhone 8 plus in terms of hand feel the
finish here stainless steel and glass on
the back Apple says that the glass is
supposed to be more durable the phone is
now a little more water resistant 2
meters for 30 minutes IP 68 stake off
that backing
very satisfied and the phone looks on
the back kind of like an 8 plus on the
front kind of like an iPhone 10 inside
same 5 watt iPhone charger that there
has been for a long time no larger fast
brick and as far as fast air pair
recharging who knows that has not been
announced yet also included earpods
lightning headphones but no 3.5
millimeter headphone adapter anymore you
have to buy that separately per phone
that costs over $1000 would have been
nice to throw that in
and last but not least the lightning
cable these phones still have lightning
cables for now so that's what's in the
iPhone 10's backs pretty minimal
packaging and pretty minimal contents
inside let's turn it on
Apple also gave us an iPhone 10's max
leather case in blue to try out let's
open this up carefully that's how you
open up an iPhone case box
let's get that on and now the most
expensive iPhone that I've ever seen in
my life is a little better protected
this is the 10's max and this is the
littler 10s this one has a 5.8 inch
screen and this one has a 6.5 inch
screen for more all about the iPhone 10s
check out my review had seen it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
