com and I'm here with the Knox NS seven
hundred fazer headphones Knox is a
swedish company so there's a little bit
of a scandinavian design here though
these are a fairly generic headphone in
terms of the look you've seen this look
before it doesn't a nice finish to it
this kind of soft to the touch finish
these are a comfortable lightweight on
your headphone in terms of a sound
profile there really is an immediacy to
them they're stronger in the mid-range
so you hear those vocals and they really
pop yeah they're an aggressive headphone
so if you don't like that type of sound
I wouldn't recommend these but if you do
like that kind of in-your-face sound
these are a headphone that certainly
delivers that experience this does have
an inline remote with a microphone in it
is an apple friendly inline remote so it
may not work with a lot of the android
phones out there at least in terms of
all the functionality they are a hundred
dollar headphone so pretty affordable I
wouldn't say these really distinguish
themselves from the other hundred eller
headphones out there I wasn't incredibly
enthused about them I do like knocks
in-ear earbuds Sal headphones a little
bit better so a ok but not great
headphone from Knox these are the Knox
NS seven hundred fazer headphones thanks
for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
