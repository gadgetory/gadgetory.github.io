you've probably lived most of your life
under the assumption that eating bugs is
bad or at very least gross but these
aren't your garden-variety crickets
these guys were raised at a farm in
Austin Texas run by the Aspire food
group aspire uses data automation and
robotics to produce crickets that are
sustainable to grow and safe to eat the
idea is that crickets have more protein
iron and calcium than beef and take less
time and fewer resources to produce but
how do they taste
we've got a few bags of whole roasted
crickets and flavors like spicy hot sour
cream and onion and totally taco to find
out alright so I'm gonna start with the
sea salt and vinegar I really don't get
much sea salt or vinegar I get a whole
lot of cricket
totally taco
totally taco
if the taco were made entirely of
crickets and nothing else I think spicy
hot anyway pepper is good so all right
I'm not looking at it too much it's not
hot at all
really a slain need to be if it says
spicy got hurt me hot good Jesus does
you'd still see his eyes I'm about to
eat this whatever look him in the eyes
and then he's gonna go right in sour
cream and onion oh god there's so nope
I'm just gonna stick with no in general
yes but like none of these excited me
enough flavor-wise to want no I mean I
there are so many other options for like
a healthy snack I can have sunflower
seeds I can have popcorn I don't feel
the need to have crickets so would you
eat cricket jerky drink a cricket
smoothie maybe even take a bite into
some cricket avocado toast
well 80% of the world's nations are to
eat bugs so who knows this could be the
next big food trend it's crunchy
sorry I had a cricket head stuck in
between my teeth</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
