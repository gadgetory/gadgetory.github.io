in constrained environments without the
use of an external motion capture system
are typically limited to slow and
conservative flight as a consequence
almost all of this research is done with
rotorcraft in the hover regime in the
robust robotics group in csail at MIT
we've developed a fixed-wing vehicle
capable of flying at high speeds through
obstacles using only onboard sensors the
vehicle is equipped with an inertial
measurement unit and a laser range
scanner all the computation for state
estimation and control is done on board
using an intel atom processor similar to
what is found in a commercially
available netbook we designed a custom
airplane to carry the sensing and
computation payload while still being
able to maneuver in confined spaces our
platform has a two-metre wingspan and
weighs approximately 2 kilograms at any
given time the laser can only see a
two-dimensional picture of the
environment laser scans are depicted
with yellow points representing
obstacles and blue representing free
space even with a pre computed map
individual 2d scans don't contain enough
information to uniquely determine the 3d
position velocity and orientation of the
vehicle to overcome this difficulty we
aggregate successive scans and combined
laser information with the inertial
measurement unit to perform state
estimation another technical challenge
is efficiently generating trajectories
for the vehicle to follow the
complicated vehicle dynamics create
substantial computational difficulties
in determining a path to fly from point
A to point B to overcome this difficulty
we use an approximate dynamics model
that makes it easy to map the control
inputs elevator rudder aileron and
throttle to corresponding XYZ
trajectories we start by connecting a
set of high-level waypoints with line
and arc segments we then use our
approximate model to construct
dynamically feasible paths by
parameterizing an offset from this
underlying trajectory here we
demonstrate the accuracy and reliability
of the system flying through a parking
Raj in places the parking garage is less
than 2.5 meters from floor to ceiling
creating extremely tight tolerances for
our 2 meter vehicle our algorithms
allowed the vehicle to complete a 7
minute flight through the environment
traveling at over 10 meters per second
or 22 miles per hour covering almost 3
miles of distance and repeatedly coming
within a few centimetres of obstacles</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
