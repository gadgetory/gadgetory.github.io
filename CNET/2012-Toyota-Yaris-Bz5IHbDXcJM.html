trailer has one important characteristic
in common they're just fine when you got
real essential basics to get covered
let's go for a run in the 2012 Toyota
Yaris se and check the tech
now the Yaris like the Nissan Versa
recently got a dose of organic redesign
shape that looks like a ball a putty
that was shoved in a latex glove I'm not
a big fan of that school I like cheap
cars to look simple and kind of handsome
but so be it the RS is available in
three trim levels and two body styles
there's an L trim level mostly suitable
for like messengers and people who carry
blood supplies around real basic stuff
then you've got the le and the SE which
is the sport or special edition that's
what we've got here and you can get a
Yaris in three or five doors well well
here we are in the Yaris now the thing
that really inexpensive cars tend to do
and often not do real well is try to
hard inside to look like something that
isn't plain that usually goes bad on a
budget but they keep doing it
here is a aftermarket looking head unit
that's actually very Scion style but
this is the upgraded unit because we're
in SE if you get an L you get a real
basic head unit with just four speakers
we have six speakers and a little nicer
rig that brings us an optical slot right
here for discs AM an FM radio of course
satellite radio is available notice we
have aux and USB we'll get to those in a
moment HD radio also interesting on a
car this popular and low cost that makes
the radio folks very happy I'm still not
sure a lot of consumers know what that
is or care now by the way the HD radio
and the bluetooth streaming are part of
this upper grade head unit the base unit
wouldn't have those and finally here are
some Bluetooth hands-free calling
buttons which is also integrated into
this unit now I mentioned aux and USB
are interesting I'll give you a little
time to find them take a minute take an
hour take next quarter you still won't
find them they're in here up and under
way down there up in the north 40 but
even better than that you'll find this
in the glove box of your yards from a
surplus sale at a closed State
it'll for the mentally insane I'm pretty
sure this is what you used to strap
people down during violent encounters
with the attendant no it's not that is
it the hell is it it's a tire tie down
belt apparently when you get a flat you
stow it behind the back seat and carry
it around like some kind of odd family
heirloom I don't get that what you will
find that it truly is from the Soviet
era is this gear box that's a four-speed
automatic kids you have never seen that
before if you're under 30 what that
means is it has four forward gears
that's all not even one for every finger
such things do exist but they typically
haven't since the mid 80s do yourself a
favor and get this guy with the 5-speed
manual well there it is one and a half
litres of four-cylinder sitting
sidesaddle nothing too fancy about it
except variable valve timing but what
doesn't these days but this little basic
engine does the basics well 106
horsepower 103 foot-pounds of torque
modest yes but the car only weighs what
2,400 pounds yourself it gets up to 60
in a little over nine seconds that's
actually kind of notable for a car at
this price point to be sub ten seconds
at zero to sixty it's a good benchmark
MPG on this guy is thirty thirty eight
almost in the vaunted forty club and
that's with the manual gearbox which we
don't have if you go with that soviet
automatic we do have you lose three mpg
on the highway that's substantial
okay let's roll in the Yaris see it does
what little cars often tend to do the
power comes on willingly you can tell
immediately without coming on forceful
there's a difference okay so about that
transmission now it's only got three
plus one gears to work with right but
you would think it's shifting a lot more
gears because it's always shifting but
that's because the gear jumps are very
present because it makes big jumps or
drops between cogs you really notice
them more and they're a big event that's
really where this kind of a transmission
is going to bother you is you'll be in
the wrong gear a lot more often and the
cars to correct that a lot more often so
in all it's just pleasant little high
riding springy light input
transportation think about it all of
those things are basically everyday
Pleasant on a day-to-day driving basis
that's why this car sells so well okay
Yaris is a cheap car but not the
cheapest thing you can buy it's nearly
fifteen base for an L with destination
rolled in you can add another three
grand almost to go SC with all the
niceties in the tech that we saw on our
car and of course the choice between
three and five-door as well as that
four-speed automatic and a five manual
are key things to test out in person
