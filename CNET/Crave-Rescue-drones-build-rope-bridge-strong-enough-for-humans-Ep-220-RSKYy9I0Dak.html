just happening this week on scene at
scribble the bro ball is simply a
football with a speaker embedded inside
I know what you're thinking why why not
football is fun music is fun so why not
marry the two into one interesting
device the bro ball is a product from
invincible audio and is touted as the
only durable waterproof Bluetooth
speaker designed as both a speaker to
play music and a football to play catch
the bro in bro ball stands for bringing
rhythm outdoors and that is just what
they have done with this product the
Bluetooth speaker has a range of up to
50 yards and has excellent sound quality
according to the product video and can
float and be submerged in the water
without damaging the speaker the ball
has even been dropped from a high atop a
few buildings and survived according to
the video the bro ball is currently
seeking funds on Kickstarter to start
production and can be yours for the
pledge price of $59 and on
if you plan on purchasing pepper the
emotional robot from the Japanese
company Softbank you must sign a piece
of paper stating that you will not have
sex with it
according to a report on Daily Mail calm
the creators of Peppard the emotional
robot have forbidden users from using it
for sexual purposes creating sexy apps
for it or reprogramming at the stock
people pepper sold out almost instantly
when it went on sale in June so I'm sure
that this comes as a major bummer to
some who bought the robot and goes
against crave writer Bonnie Burton's
beliefs that sex robots are the future
and should not be banned did I mention
that she's married to r2d2 make sure you
read Bonnie's crave piece on the subject
then you make the call should humans be
able to have sex with robots yay or nay
researchers have successfully programmed
drones to autonomously build a rope
bridge that can support the weight of a
human being a research team from ETH
Zurich worked in collaboration with the
Institute for dynamic systems and
control and grim Osseo color research to
program a swarm of drones that could
potentially save lives in the near
future the rope bridge was built by the
drones and ETH Zurich flying machine
arena and was supported by scaffolding
on both sides of the room that acted as
the anchors for the drones to secure the
rope bridge to the drones use a special
spool of rope attached to the bottom of
their frames and communicate with an
offshore computer that processes
algorithms and translates them into
commands which is then transmitted back
to the drones helping them with the
building process once the rope bridge
was complete the researchers tested it
out with their own bodyweight to show
that the bridge could potentially
support a human crossing in a
life-or-death situation flying drones
are currently being studied for how they
can best be used in search and rescue
operations and so far for me this is
definitely a step in the right direction
alright guys that's the show thank you
