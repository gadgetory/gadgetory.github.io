thing is awesome i'm watching you guys
right are you blown away it's a
greatness you can handle it next time
I'm skype in a little too far that's
experiment this is really neat that's
the first time next time we'll have a
phone or not it says Martin on the phone
and a picture of you right I could be
like a smile like working here yeah okay
we could add like another thing in there
so you could see me look at all tired
and angry and laundry list listen the
laundromat always all we have now though
is is just a post it will a post on Jeff
Campbell that's all really or even
better oh there we go Martin on the
phone they're all we can do right now
right this is it right did I you know
Edmund ship ever you know this is what
we're dealing with now this is web 3.0
right here
okay we're so advanced so Martin tell
Zelda about Internet superstar people
who aren't up on the podcasting internet
superstar is it's the best show the air
that has ever seen no offense you guys
are you sure are you no no sorry we
gotta take this one outside the show I
did this other show for revision 3.com
called infected and it got cancelled
they brought in this new CEO named Jim
Louderback Jesus big pecker he canceled
that show and like I think people in the
office were kind of afraid I was gonna
like hurt myself or something oh yeah
does acting all the spot I think my sure
I things like you could do this new show
you have to do it all for vision 3
property no resource what's our so she
could show my mom's backyard shed right
and like though the whole goal of the
shows it's going to make me and Internet
superstar the way that I'm gonna achieve
that goes by interviewing real internet
superstars like your canes on days and
nano a caucus and tom green and Chris
Carter you know all those being all
those wackos so but it's not working so
far not anywhere you're mean that
superstar at all see what you gotta do
is you get on the valleywag that's our
approaches to you know show a little bit
of nip yes I'm gonna say hello we had
some nip showed you well my gosh you
guys about value a couple times it was
very excited what did you do did you
kill someone did you I was it I was in a
marijuana party I don't do it right
there but I didn't know that it was a
marijuana party it was it was the launch
party for pounce you know that thing
pounds yeah yeah a lot of parties are
just so happened that they run out this
guy Dennis Peron south Jesus huge
marijuana actors in San Francisco and
just pot plants everywhere I mean that's
awesome mix big bud oh man Wow Jeff
second just a little taken aback he's
like real and it just sounds like he's
shaking right now it's like a fun time
ok a good party yes I want to go hang
out that guy little and maybe so we want
to ask the question that everyone wants
to know I mean I'm sure you get asked
this all time your tech TV alarm you
were on the screen savers and then
subsequently unscrewed out that give you
a llama so uh I mean just going to air a
little bit of frustration I mean for I
know you probably are a billion times
people yeah yeah
always comes up like the four times
anyone's wanting to interview me but
it's true we had this great show up here
in San Francisco called unscrewed and
then we're all excited because I mean
you know comcast bought tech TV and they
moon I was sad for all the people they
didn't bring but I me and my crew we
were we were we're sold out five man
yeah downtown to the Stardust rodeo Los
Angeles big glitter bull think our show
down there and we're down there for like
I don't know maybe not even two months I
think and then it canceled it yeah they
are they all through did everyone you
know people had homes and families they
sold their home they left their families
behind in some cases into town necklace
and the biggest pull the plug on the
show it was raining we're back to the
ratings are good like you know was just
a mystery we don't want to do this we
don't like money or goodness we just
like to read about what I don't really
isn't about gaming and we think the
television about video games as the
future and that's the great part is now
you haven't really panned out yeah
that's what that well now you watch you
know whatever attack of the show and
it's like oh yeah there's video games oh
PS there's lots of other stuff that's
not video games mostly going on the way
yeah you still be on my show I'm talking
about exactly now but you know what
there's a lot of I wish them the best if
there's a lot of cool people who still
work at you for yeah and the nincompoops
who cancel my show anything to do it at
they've all long didn't fire yes
everything God such a good friend to
work down there and I wish them the best
I hope the day they finally figure out
how to do what they're doing yeah we're
going our show doesn't work the same
fades yeah we're hoping that you know
when we do get the big time g4 will
hopefully won't buy us because we all
know how awful show is the show is so
bad we would have no shot so it's cool
least at least that they you know they
were initially interested at least you
know it's I'm done yes but you guys you
guys were talking with g4s all right no
don't start that up and yeah what uh
yeah I was great in the movie down LA
which for me was great because you know
in this business does eventually have to
move down there anyway no yeah exactly
tried they built a really awesome studio
or so those those two things are good
don't you things are good everything
else and I'm not so much so speaking
speaking of things are terrible maybe
some terrible ideas apparently there's a
story going on CNN today about students
who would like to bring guns to school
themselves Jeff Bakalar what do you
think a fuckload you have the original I
love how you guys come to me right yeah
I mean that's what you're good at just
don't understand where the mentality
enters where it's like hey I know how to
solve this problem gun we need more guns
okay wait wait wait wait students like i
did this craters no no college kids is
seeing the example CNN has is like a 20
23 year old sophomore well that's that's
that's comforting a 23 year old
sophomore were you imagine when i do
without doing when I was 23 I know it's
about hey come on come on Cynthia wasn't
no I was gonna say that I actually I
read I i was really disheartened the
other day when i read something in CNN
uh you know Virginia Tech was like body
it was couple months ago raise yeah what
you read the bed that's two and six yeah
what is it well as I said I read this
article about how it could have been all
preventive students were allowed to
carry guns the class really a little
thought like what happened because a
student get the gun well I mean the big
issue i'm from utah right so there is a
big issue the only state in the country
that allows guns on school campuses is
in utah so many people are there's a
consistent like there's a consistent
battle between like both sides saying
gun shouldn't be on campus God should be
on rapist and you know I've heard these
arguments a ton of times realistically I
don't really know the answer i'm not
going to claim to like have juntos it's
at any iteration if you allow guns peep
the people who are gonna bring guns to
school don't really care if there's a
law or not yeah that's concerned alike
well i was gonna try and yeah you know I
actually I was in college and I was
really diggin on this girl right and
then you got a gun and shot her no no no
it was just odd cuz I was like oh you
know how you doing blahblah blah like
what you do today she's like oh yeah
went down to the sheriff's office to get
my concealed weapons permit I was like
all right that's
where'd you go Homer say concern Florida
i will just go in Florida I'm school in
Utah Martin where you in a school like
England didn't you uh for a little bit
yeah the mainly mainly cornell
university's core no there's no good on
England you know I'm bring i bring my
glock to revision3 off and you're
looking he donated rose camera fida
patrick norton i do to you help us a cab
just rolling your phone nothing's gonna
happen yeah and sir revision3 you've
been there how long have you been a
revision three four now I look Jesus you
know I kind of started doing them a show
for them back in 2005 yeah but I
officially like you know became a
full-time employee now that I don't know
much August I grew back upset oldfag
down here san francisco from LA did you
a call yet did you get to meet Veronica
yet Barack Veronica Veronica Belmont
she's mad we've met like you know before
maybe I don't remember the most about
that pot party dude I want a Veronica
bhama shirt right now get all the
internet votes right there no yeah yeah
p errands all excited about veronica
belmont now she's uh hosting that show
tekzilla with patrick norton you know
come learn how to install something on
your computer thanks for sure it's great
uh so Jeff you also brought this other
story in Florida yeah I just you know
look this this happens all the time
some lunatic thinks he's seeing
something and it's just you know a
coincidence of life alright so what's
this so what's the door so in in in
Florida the Florida Hospital Medical
Complex in orlando some loony some guy
took a picture thinks there's Jesus in
it yeah so you want to bring up the
larger well okay the larger he seems
like how can we punish these people no
no no okay okay so what we have actually
doesn't flip over to my screen flick oh
my god all right hold on three here it
is
I bring it up oops sorry let me or me I
soon I got it it's cool uh so this is a
picture right there can you see that in
the circle yeah a highlight so I whoa
that's a picture Jesus it does look kind
of real though if you look at it yeah
yeah looks like every other bizarre
reflection will find you no come on look
the comparative there's a beard there's
a nose eyes and they're spitting image
of our Lord and Savior exactly this is
right car look Jeff it is pretty you
know what it's convinced you've
converted me yeah I see to Jesus isn't
here now yeah I see that too actually
where's nothing no no it's like it's
like and white Jesus over here how
that's so if you click the image there's
something else going on on the left i'm
gonna click the image right let's see if
i can oh also what this looks like uh-uh
I don't flash running not only that this
image appeared then vanished according
to witnesses so they took the picture
and then it was gone let's yeah let's
tell them that the tooth fairy's not
real even so this reminds me though in
Florida it seems like these cases always
come up to remember like six maybe five
years ago there was that thing in st.
Petersburg where the panes of glass
click the Virgin Mary yes remember that
yes so while i was there i was in
florida for a while why was there some
like okay it's one thing to be like this
is not real this is lame whatever but
it's another thing some guy drove by
with a slingshot and shout out the
Virgin Mary good yeah good good how is
that good how is it good so people can
move on with their lives man okay what
if it is maybe like you Randall what
would have had been the Virgin Mary like
in a Paula Duke yeah I was gonna say
what if I took a and it looked like
Bert you think you know what there you
have yourself an attraction there charge
on five dollars for how much absolutely
firm whatever it or take away whatever
it takes whatever lady the other day she
opened up a box box of fish sticks to
feed her huge family and six of the fish
sticks two of them at a time refused and
like he's real
shitty listen crosses yeah oh I thought
that was a psychology she would not eat
the fish sticks laughter see that should
put those up on ebay but let's give
these people free Medicare because they
need they need it nice how do they get
dressed in the morning do you I don't
know why I'm all I'm saying is I care
what lets you believe what they want to
believe it's all sure sure just stop
looking everywhere because you'll see
just just close your eyes means I think
what it is it's like the numerologist
people who are like oh well if you take
September 11th date you had 17 minus 36
and then it's like 666 you know yeah we
can all God's pretty little shorter
hospital one this was kind of a
different case there's a horse of a
different color Jesus Susanna Barack
Obama icmr and Sergeant the background
look you're right that hospital yeah
after the wii party man we're going to
take a quick break when we come back
more stuff with martin sergeant on the
404 and some other stuff figure what's
going on see you after the break
yeah did you hear today's buzz out loud
yeah Tamara was all camo we stopped
babble hating tamale was all hey Tom
shut up your Linux Eddie oh em gee
that's how I rock yeah CNET's butts out
loud subscribe it vol cnet com
hey this is Jeff from Philly and you're
listening to the 404 we're the only
deity that we pray to is a flying
spaghetti monster wow that's like so
apropos today it is dude it makes its
perfect like I think that happened it
makes just as much sense our fans are so
clairvoyant it's true they call it if
you want to call an 866 404 cnet is the
number how you can get in a hold of us
or you can email us to 44 at cnet com
hit us up on facebook on Twitter I'm
sure like someday we'll have a page in
revision3 and I'm just gonna have some
guy down the street like party oh yeah
so guess what time it is guys we have
done this in a while I know it's been a
while causing the public today I'd pay
you to dance my dad against Ron what's
going on buddy I just calling to see if
you want to do shake shack again next
week and no news yet on RD Laing they're
saying that serious has taken it into
their hands since he has an anger issue
so I just thought you'd want to know
that later so fairly the 448 6x four for
Cena is not only like this for four
voicemails also join was mine so you
know who's Ron a and then what's going
on our drama buddy I've had four
companies go to shake shack we go to the
station shake shack in New York is like
Madison Square Park yeah it's like a
really it's a really good hamburger
place where people go it's like it's
integrates like expensive more selection
in and out if you want to pay ten
dollars for a burger go down to shake
shack but it's a good ol be worth it
ever i do something where they they do
something different yeah to the burgh
that's good so anywhere grow this Artie
Lange yeah I'm not a big tall guy
co-host of Howard Stern yeah but my
buddy Ron you know it's a big hat which
one fan so supposedly Artie Lange like
walk down on the show last week I'm out
of here and that was good man you're
waiting all day to do that
ah you should've warned me I yes had
already gotten over to man up and down
I'm just gonna but you know I can't have
anything else open but god I'm so so
like the clock doesn't know what
happened so he he got he went crazy in
an obese rage and you why you say obese
ray because did he like I like his role
okay I like already like a lot but he
blew his enemy is a metric tons yeah and
could he beat you up with his stomach
like he just whipped it around like Ford
about I don't know what he could do he
could do a lot he could eat me he could
eat you definitely up but yet you know
he's a really funny comedian and you
know it's scary man he's walking down
that same path is a couple other
comedians and I don't want them to did
he go to South Africa want to get off at
a rest stop or something Martin you find
that to be a problem I know you're kind
of like a comedian yourself do you find
the pressure of Hollywood to get to you
it really got me even shave your head
and I got so big down there I just blew
your head to it San Francisco as fast as
possible yeah I also what was a very
light weight doesn't make any sense
because it was like he got in a fight
with his assistant yeah yeah that's why
quit the show why would he destroy his
assistant I don't know I think it
doesn't make I think there's more to
this story maybe when I eat him
something happened with the assistant
was claiming that already wasn't paying
him so I'm regard so I just be like oh
like right out on the show he like threw
water at the kid and then they almost
got into a fistfight and that's a big
no-no radio trying to get on through a
lot right yeah for sure I feel bad at
all yeah does he like wit all the drugs
