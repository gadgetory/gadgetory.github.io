really great way to get a nice even look
for your portraits and also your
close-up photography it helps to give a
nice shadowless effect on your subjects
face and also gives a cool halo effect
in their eyes but traditional ring
flashes or ring lights can be expensive
especially if you only just want to
experiment with a technique I'm going to
show you how to make your own DIY ring
light using tools that you hopefully
already have at hand like a big screen
monitor or a TV what you'll need is a
camera that gives you exposure control a
tripod and that big screen that I
mentioned you'll also need to make sure
that your monitor or TV can display an
image on it
step 1 download the ring light image
from the how-to article on CNET or you
can make your own what you'll need is a
black background and then on that you'll
need to draw a white circle and inside
of that a smaller black circle step to
display that image on your monitor or TV
fullscreen turn the brightness up all
the way you can if the blacks start
turning into a bit more of a gray dial
the brightness back a bit and boost your
contrast step 3 put your camera and
tripod in front of the screen in the
middle of the center black circle you're
going to want to crank up the ISO
sensitivity to around 1600 or 3200
because you'll be shooting mostly in the
dark turn out all the lights and
position your subject right in front of
the camera so the ring light is
providing all of the light onto your
subject to position yourself or the
subjects you might want to use a camera
with a flip-out screen turn on autofocus
and then take a few shots trial and
error to see exactly where the light is
falling the circular ring light works
best for the most even look but feel
free to do things like triangles squares
any other shape you can imagine this DIY
ring light isn't exactly the most
portable solution out there but it's a
great way to get bang for your buck with
gear that you already own
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
