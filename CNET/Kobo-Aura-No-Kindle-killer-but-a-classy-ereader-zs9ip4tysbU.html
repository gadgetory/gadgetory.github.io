the Kobo aura an e aqui reader that
competes with the kindle paperwhite the
first thing you think when you look at
it is that it's screen is smaller than
the paper whites but it's really an
optical illusion the screens are both 6
inches and the auras just smaller than
the paperwhite and weighs a little over
an ounce less Kobo which is a stronger
presence in international markets than
in the u.s. describes the aura as having
an edge to edge screen and what that
really means is that it simply looks
like the screen you'd see on a tablet
with no elevation for the border
surrounding the display the layer that
covers the display has a matte finish
that helps cut down on the glare
especially compared to the reflections
you can get from the glass covering the
display on your typical tablet I really
like the design overall there's a grippy
finish on the back and Amazon would do
well to emulate the auras smaller form
factor like the paperwhite the aura also
has a built-in light and it's good
though not as good as the one in the
second generation paperweight I also
didn't think the device as a whole is
quite a zippy as the paperwhite even if
they both run on a 1 gigahertz processor
aside from the smaller design where the
aura has an advantage is in the memory
Department you get 4 gigabytes of
on-board storage compared to the Kindles
2 gigabytes and there's a microSD card
slot for adding additional memory Kobo
has also managed to virtually eliminate
the flashing you typically get with
Yankee readers it used to be that the
display had to refresh every five or six
page turns but with the aura or you
rarely see the screen flash I'm not
going to get into all the Auris features
in this video read the text review for
that but i will say that overall the
reading experience is quite good and
kobo's come a long way in a few years
improving its user interface and
bookstore and adding some interesting
extra features where the aura doesn't
quite measure up to the paperwhite is
the screen itself paperwhite has better
contrast and the text looks crisper on
the screen the auras light also has a
slight greenish tinge to it the
paperwhite slight by comparison is white
and more natural-looking in the end
despite the auras design
it's hard to choose it over the
paperwhite particularly when you factor
in its higher price point of 149 99 that
said it's still a very good e-reader
it's just not as good as the competition
