McLaren p1 of said
first of all what is a p1 it's a lot of
things mid-engine rear-wheel drive
carbon-fiber plug-in hybrid active
everything supercar unless a
carbon-fiber I mean carbon-fiber
everywhere the tub the superstructure of
the roof all your body panels in fact
there is no engine cover to speak of not
one that you lift use tools to take it
off when it's time for service otherwise
stay out of there and McLaren tells me
if you remove even the largest carbon
fiber panel on this car the rear
clamshell you can still pick it up
easily with thumb and forefinger it's
all about lightweight super stiffness
and high-strength
you're gonna think I'm nuts but the most
revealing thing I did is not drive this
car but wash it when you get your hands
all over this body structure it is so
foreign I kept thinking of marine
structures and fish looking for a bunch
of seat controls you have one
fore-and-aft that's it
directly ahead of me is an all LCD
instrument panel not that novel today
but I'm surprised how unbusy this one is
it doesn't choke you with a whole lot of
information and unusual for supercars
this one's got a pretty up-to-date
comprehensive head unit it's kind of
like a baby Tesla in its orientation it
is a touchscreen as you can see media
choices are pretty comprehensive
navigation is pretty digestible and this
is very forward-looking for a car like
this you got a decent app suite
including a web browser also rather
Tesla ask and tune in for radio stations
streaming and podcasts so unlike some
super high-dollar high-performance cars
you're not going to be sitting there in
the 1990s in terms of cabin tech but now
one of the stuff it really matters in
this car let's get to our power train
control starting back at the wheel
you've got your paddle shifters these
will move with the wheel by the way
they're not stuck on the column which is
kind of surprising you can pull this one
for a downshift or an upshift but they
track together on the wheel or two
buttons you'll find in no other car
unless you drove a Formula One car DRS
is the drag reduction system it's going
to feather out the rear wing to reduce
drag down a straight when you really
want to halt and then you let up on it
and it plants you down again we'll try
that later and I pass is their acronym
for electric boost you can do it on
demand or let it happen automatically
then I get this car to really come alive
you have to first put it in active mode
now you're digging into the performance
on the left is your handling control
normal sport or track on the right as
your powertrain control with the same
three settings manual button here puts
you in manual shift mode of course the
arrow button over here puts it in full
aerodynamic mode race puts you in the
most aggressive mode entirely in fact
you have to go through two confirmation
screens that tell you you're on your own
it gets the car super low it puts the
wings super high it sharpens up all your
responses and it takes off all of yours
ability control and finally the boost
button down here is interesting when you
hit that you now take the electric motor
out of the equation and it only comes on
on-demand and that's when you get back
to the iPass button the last thing I
want to show you are some electric
controls up here by the starter button
this mo does as you might imagine puts
the car in electric-only mode it can go
about six or seven miles battery only
and of course the plug-in hybrid you can
hit this button here to put it in charge
mode you've got a door overhead where
the charging port is takes about two
hours do a full charge offshore power
but of course the car will reach in its
own battery along the way the way it
does that's interesting it does not have
brake regeneration
it has coasting regeneration McLaren
does that so that the brake feel is
always the same and never polluted by
having a regen apparatus getting in
between you and the pads
now back here under glass is the secret
sauce to our powertrain with the
emphasis on power
it is a 3.8 liter twin-turbo v8 the
engine has 727 horsepower the electric
motor adds 176 the v8 engine has 531
pound-feet of torque
the electric motor adds 192 totaled up
in engine math you've got 903 horsepower
722 pound-feet of torque and all of that
goes out through a 7-speed dual-clutch
transmission to the rear wheels only
interestingly not all wheel drive your
results are stunning 0 to 60 in 2.8
seconds the p1 weighs just over 3,000
pounds its MPG is 17 for a slightly
better 18 mpg II but who cares that's
while the turbos are still getting down
to business it's a different kind of
power more than you've ever known before
because of that whole four-30 electric
motors have
and what McLaren tells you it's actually
quite interesting is don't worry about
running this car all the way out take it
up to the redline every single time
between the gear change you actually run
it in the mid-range to mid high of your
rpm and it's all there wide open on the
back straight just get on it the next
thing you notice is this incredibly
intelligent suspension then we love
damping
as well as handling an active sleeve are
rolled of course going through the turn
11 hairpin there's no bubble anymore
than going through a very mild turn okay
now get the whole barrel tasty l'épée
100 in a race mode I've done that
amazingly on my own
I have a very good friend have seen that
on cars a little over a million dollars
what I want to try in particular is to
hit the DRS on the fastback Street and
get a feel for what it's like to have
that little extreme car and you gotta do
a complicated thing here I got a ship
with ripe
they got his hand a good 10 miles per
hour to my previous best neck speed
and I'm not even good at this v1 like
most MacLaren's reserves its last
surprise for the ride home we're
dropping in an auto mode and settling
back gives you an amazingly liveable
streetcar that wouldn't really be
fatiguing to commute in if you wish to
turn your office colleagues a particular
shade of green okay let's say I've
convinced you you want to buy a p1 here
comes the heartbreak they're all long
sold I only made three hundred and
seventy five of these guys this is
number 106 for example but the p1 really
demonstrates extremely well is the
existing knowledge of carbon fiber
technologies that we've known about but
merge that lightness and strength with
this stout talk of hybridization and the
extreme active Aero management and this
is an amazing package it also proves run
the cusp of an amazing error or cars
