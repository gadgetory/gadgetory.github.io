seen more than a hundred cities in the
US get these rentable ductless motorized
scooters and we're seeing a lot of
accidents rack up in emergency rooms
over the past few weeks I've been
talking to doctors in emergency rooms in
several major cities and they say
they're seeing the rate of these
accidents happen anywhere from maybe ten
a month to ten a day well I've heard all
sorts of stories and a lot of people
they just kind of lose control the
scooter because they don't quite know
what they're doing and other incidents
I've heard is that people's brakes
haven't worked I've also heard incidents
where they push on the throttle and the
scooter just keeps going a lot of
doctors are saying most of the injuries
they see coming in are people without
helmets a lot of people renting the
scooters are tourists they're not
traveling with helmets or people just
going about their day-to-day lives
they're not carrying around a helmet and
this is contributing to a lot of head
injuries that's part of the problem with
the scooters there's different laws in
different states different cities so
people don't really know what the rules
are
some states require helmets some don't
in California it used to be the law that
everyone had to wear a helmet but one of
the scooter companies Birds back to bill
to get that helmet requirement taken out
and so starting January people won't
have to wear helmets in California
so scooter companies say safety is their
top priority
they have stickers on their scooters
that say people should wear a helmet
bird one of the scooter companies gives
people free helmets they'll send them to
them in the mail if they ask for them so
when you signed up to rent one of these
scooters you have to click through
agreements in the app and basically
those agreements are taking on full
responsibility for what happens with
that scooter so it absolves the student
scooter companies of any responsibility
or liability so if you get hurt it's
your fault and not the company as these
accidents rack up a lot of people are
actually trying to sue the scooter
companies because you know when your
brakes go out down a hill there there
has to be some responsibility taken so
this is such a new technology none of
these cases have been heard by a judge
or been in any court yet so it's gonna
be really interesting to see how it
progresses and how the law is kind of
shakeout and if those terms of agreement
really can have affect every single
doctor I've spoken to says you should
definitely wear a helmet when riding
when these scooters because it can save
your life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
