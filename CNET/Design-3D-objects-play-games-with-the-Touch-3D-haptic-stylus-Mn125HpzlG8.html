at CES 2015 checking out the 3d Systems
Touch 3d stylus the stylus works two
ways right now first you can use it to
create your 3d designs so you pick it up
and you use it as a stylus to mold the
clay in a 3d program called cuba face
sculpt then as you're playing around
with it and pushing the clay you'll
actually feel the resistance of the
stylus the whole thing is that it
provides haptic feedback but what 3d
systems wants to get us really excited
about at CES is using this for gaming so
what I'm standing in front of is a game
much like Jenga where you can actually
grab the stylus and find your block then
you can use the buttons on the stylus
and as you're kind of finding the block
you want the closer you get as you hit
the actual wall the stylus will stop you
because it's giving you that haptic
feedback you'll also feel the resistance
of gravity and some games can even
incorporate vibrations so once you grab
your block you click the button you pull
it out and if you did it right then you
stuck it right on top and you continue
playing this game actually works on the
oculus rift they've got a partnership
going on but the touch 3d stylus isn't
just for oculus they want developers to
incorporate it into gaming consoles and
PC games so there's a lot of potential
here it's just a matter of developers
getting on board and designing games to
go with this product whether you're a
game developer an early adopter or you
want to make it really easy to create
your own 3d designs you can buy the
touch 3d stylus right now for $4.99 for
