sporting a hoodie and hipster glasses
but Satya Nadella is far from a new face
around the office after 22 years at the
washington-based company nadella is
being promoted from the head of the
cloud and enterprise group to chief
executive officer he really is an
accomplished technologist and he knows
the corporate culture and he's going to
be able to mold all of that together as
he finally figures out where Microsoft
needs to move nadella will inherit a
company trying to figure out its place
in a post-pc world while Microsoft
continues to profit from windows and
office software the company has
struggled to compete in mobile windows
phones have a small fraction of the
market compared to apple and android and
for us and what's going to define
Microsoft going forward is a
mobile-first cloud-first what Microsoft
founder Bill Gates will take on a
different role at the company as a
technology advisor I'll have over third
of my time available to meet with

define this this next round of products
working together and that list of
products may change as nadella takes

outsiders to carve up the company to get
rid of the consumer businesses primarily
Bing and the Xbox business Steve Ballmer
steps down Tuesday nadella's role as CEO
is effective immediately in San
Francisco I'm Kara Tsuboi cnet.com for
