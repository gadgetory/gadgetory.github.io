their digital cameras and using their
smartphones for everyday photo captures
and why not my iPhone has a great camera
is always with me
and I can share my photos instantly I'm
Sharon Vaknin frisina and today I'll
show you four Photography tricks for
your iPhone the iPhone the latest
software it lets you snap a photo using
the volume up button it's convenient but
what's even cooler about this is that
you can plug in your iPhone headphones
and use the volume up button here to
snap a photo as well that means that you
get super steady shots and you can mount
your phone on a tripod and use this as a
remote shutter release now let's talk
about lighting and focus when you're
taking a photo you can tap the screen to
set the focus and exposure for any
object but when you move around those
settings change so to lock those
settings tap and hold until the blue box
pulsates and this message shows up here
now as you move around those settings
won't change you might have seen a new
grid option on your iPhone's camera tap
options turn the grid on and hit done
now with this grid you can use something
called the rule of thirds some people
believe that if you align objects along
these horizontal and vertical lines or
along these intersections you can create
a more pleasing photo so with this
flower I'll put it on this intersection
tap to focus and now I have a more
interesting photo than just placing it
in the middle once you take a photo you
might want to crop it to change the
composition iOS has that tool but here's
an even easier way to do it open your
photo in the photo gallery and pinch to
zoom to change the composition now hold
the home button and tap the lock button
to take a screenshot now your cropped
photo will show up as a new image in
your camera roll
so there you have it four simple tricks
for taking better photos on your iPhone
if you take any great shots send them to
me on Twitter for cnet.com I'm Sharon
