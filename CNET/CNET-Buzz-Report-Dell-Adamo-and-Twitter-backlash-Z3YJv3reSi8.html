report the show about the tech news that
everybody's talking about this week
iPhone news Twitter lunacy and unicorns
but first it's the gadget of the week
the gadget of the week is the dell adamo
it's dell's new high fashion ultra-thin
laptop it's got a 13 inch screen a
brushed metal lid and keyboard tray a
very modern design and a
two-thousand-dollar price tag it even
ships in this kind of lucite case that
makes it look like a museum piece and
you can kind of imagine that Dell wishes
that they had a time machine right now
because between the chief netbooks and
the collapsing portfolios this is the
laptop that just kind of screams I just
got my bonus check from AIG it's really
pretty though and now for the news this
week it's Twitter backlash now that it
seems like literally everyone has
discovered Twitter everyone hates it and
here's why George Stephanopoulos gave us
an object lesson in how to ruin a cool
thing by trying to interview John McCain
over Twitter 140 characters per
question-and-answer presidential debates
have more substance than this twitter is
becoming a threat to jury trials because
jurors are posting updates not only
throughout the trial but in one case
after they've decided on a verdict but
before the judge has announced it that
one might end in a mistrial the coach of
the Milwaukee Bucks had to ask his
players not to Twitter from the locker
room during games after forward Charlie
Villanueva sent a note during halftime
about how he was going to try to toughen
up in the second half and then of course
there was the story about how David
Prager of revision3 twittered and live
streamed while someone broke into his
apartment instead of calling the cops
what is the deal does Twitter turn you
into a crazy person is Twitter a public
menace should we have a crackdown will
we start seeing Twitter free zone signs
everywhere we go here's my theory you
know how alcohol makes people act like a
holes because it's like all of a sudden
their inhibitions are gone and there
aren't any barriers between their social
facade and their real terrible idiotic
or narcissistic personalities that's
Twitter
it's the long island ice tea of the
internet just don't tweet and drive
that's not safe and the other big news
this week came from Apple who else buzz
report correspondent Mollywood was on
the scene so I'm standing here at the
apple campus of Cupertino I'm actually
practically in the street because they
threw a press event and instantly kicked
us out of it but I'm not bitter anyway
we got a look inside iphone 3-point oh
let's check it out so we're adding
search to all of these applications but
we didn't stop there we're adding
support for mms push notification in-app
purchase cut copy and paste yeah you
know you're drinking the kool-aid when
you're clapping and cheering for copy
and paste but once the software comes
out and the phone finally does all the
stuff that's supposed to do plus all
these extras I think you can all stop
dithering and just go get one fine my
soul is dead iphone take over a complete
okay let's have a look at what's
clogging the tubes it's cornified calm
cornified calm is the number one unicorn
and rainbow service worldwide giving
websites Sparkle around the world check
it out it will make your day
it's just easier to read all that bad
news with unicorns and rainbows
everywhere sparkly and that's the buzz
report for this week everyone on
Mollywood and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
