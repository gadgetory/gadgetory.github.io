from the new MacBook Pros by now you've
seen the thinnest lightest MacBook Pros
with that touch bar and touch ID but of
course there are downsides here's what's
missing at number five a big redesign
take a look at those new MacBook Pros it
kind of looks like the older MacBook
Pros that design dates back to 2012
Apple keeps tweaking the design and this
is just another evolution if you're
shelling out 1,800 bucks for a new pro
how about a great new design at number
four MagSafe one of the cooler things
about map books was a mac slave
connector the idea was if you flipped
over your power cable the cable would
pop out without dragging your laptop
down well enjoy your laptop hitting the
floor now at number three a lightning
port for lightning headphones so if you
go all-in with Apple you'll have a new
iPhone with its lightning headphones
there is nowhere to plug these into the
pro you would need an adapter for that
to work and number two an SD card reader
if you took video or photos on a DSLR it
was simple to take the SD card out and
pop it into your Mac considering the
MacBook Pro is geared toward people who
are probably dealing with video - seems
like a mistake and the number one thing
missing from the new MacBook Pros is a
regular USB port or USB a the new map
approach feature for thunderbolt ports
using a USB C style connector so if
you've got anything that uses USB a like
a thumb drive or a lightning cable
you're going to need an adapter oh yeah
the same holds true if you have anything
with a HDMI the older Thunderbolt that
used mini DisplayPort or those SD cards
Apple has a tendency to live in the
future until we get to a world full of
USB C style accessories enjoy your
dongles if you've got feedback I'm at I
as on Twitter I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
