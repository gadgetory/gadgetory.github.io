second generation and it costs two
hundred and thirty dollars we just got
it in so we're gonna open up the box and
see what we think
get out of this packaging
all right so as you can see it's quite a
bit bigger the display is larger I think
the first generation had like a
seven-inch screen this is a 10-inch
screen
diagonally so it's quite a bit more
screen real estate and that's awesome
because it also means there's no ugly
speaker on the front the first
generation had kind of that boxy speaker
grille and the design almost looks like
a mini projection TV ad so this is an
improvement
I like the screen better you can also
see on the back it's covered with a
fabric so it's still kind of deep it's
not really a flat display but the stuff
is covered with a fabric that looks
pretty good it looks a lot like what we
saw in the Google home speakers and an
Apple home pod so I like that
as far as controls go you've still got
your volume and your power buttons on
the top there and you've still got ports
and power in the back so this one also
has an eight array microphone set up
just like the first one they're a bit
different than they were so you can see
they're arranged a little differently
and the front camera is still a five
megapixel front facing camera so now
that we've got it out of the box we're
gonna take it into the cenote smart home
and test it out
right off the bat one of the things I
really like about the second geneco show
as opposed to the first is the way it
handles smart-home commands so on the
original echo show if you say something
like turn off the bedroom lamp okay you
just get an okay and nothing shows up on
the screen you don't really get any
indication that something has happened
but in the second generation I mute this
one turn on the bedroom lamp you get a
display that shows you the name of the
device and then you have this little
power button and I can even turn it off
and on with the touch screen if I do
something like a set of lights that have
an adjustable brightness turn on the
living room lights you get a toggle bar
where you can select a brightness level
so that's something we didn't see in the
original echo show and so far I really
like it there's also a new lights and
more icon in the drop-down menu so if I
swipe down here I'll see this light bulb
and if I touch that I get a list of
lamps plugs and switches that are
connected to my platform and that's not
something we saw in the first generation
echo show and so far I think it's a good
addition
so here we've got the second gin and the
first gens side-by-side and you can
already tell there are some pretty
significant differences the screen for
example is a whole lot bigger
it's 10.1 inches diagonally versus the 7
inches of the first generation and it's
720p so you're getting a better
resolution sound quality also got an
upgrade the new echo show features dual
2-inch neodymium side firing drivers and
better bass if you listen to the sound
comparisons we did you can definitely
tell the difference
something else that's different about
the second-generation echo show is the
way you can see youtube videos in the
first generation there wasn't really any
native integration and there's not this
time either
but there is a workaround amazon's added
the firefox browser and amazon silk
browser to the echo show if you say
something like open firefox
here's firefox you'll get a browser and
you can tap to view a mobile version of
youtube site if you ask her from video
results in general you'll get clips
provided by thing and this workaround
isn't perfect but it's better than what
we had before which was no YouTube
integration at all for all the
improvements on the new echo show there
are still a few things that are
disappointing and maps as one of them
for instance if I ask where's the
closest Starbucks I found a Starbucks
it's six point five miles away on
Taylorsville Road in Louisville business
hours for this location are not
available how do I get there at the
moment traffic to Starbucks at 1:00 to
6:05 Taylorsville Road looks good the
fastest route takes about eleven minutes
via KY 1531 and KY 1:55 so there's no
map displayed here and there really
aren't any directions either and Alexa
can't send those directions to your
phone so while she tells you how long
it'll take to get somewhere you really
won't have a
got anything else and given that it's a
smart display that's something I really
wish that it had after spending some
time with the second gen Amazon echo
show it feels much improved from the
first version the screen is bigger the
sound is better and Amazon even added
some smart home controls when it comes
to YouTube Amazon added browsers so you
can access the site in a sort of mobile
version and for all the ways the Amazon
improved the echo show there are still
parts of it the feel underwhelming
visualizations for things like maps and
directions still aren't there and it
leaves me feeling like there's still a
lot of untapped potential if you'll use
your echo show for monitoring cameras
answering the doorbell or even cooking
in your kitchen
it's a capable smart device at the same
230 dollar price tag as the original but
if you're looking for a more
conversational assistant native YouTube
integration and more informative visuals
I'd still recommend a google assistant
enabled device like the Lenovo Marcus
