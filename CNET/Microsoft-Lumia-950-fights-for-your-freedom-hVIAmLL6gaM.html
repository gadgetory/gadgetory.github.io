it's microsoft's epic attempt at making
the plastic dependable lumia 950 into a
force as powerful as your pc or TV you
start with something like this display
doc or this hdmi dongle set it up on
your phone and voila you can access all
the stuff on the lumia 950 from a larger
screen why is this cool will imagine
your road warrior working on Microsoft
Office dogs in the office and also on
the move or say you want to show your
friends photos of the trip or a video
clip without you all hovering around
your tiny screen with a little software
and hardware you can control the
contents of your phone using your screen
as a remote or you could also use a
wired or wireless keyboard or mouse the
main thing you need is the bigger screen
the idea is admittedly really cool and
it all sounds great in theory but in
practice set up and use weren't quite so
simple and I'm honestly not sure how
often I'd use it luckily is the first
phone with Windows 10 software the Lumia
950 is more than just continuum alone
it's also got a cleaner interface that
looks pretty spiffy and an accurate iris
scanner that unlocks the phone when it
Pierce deeply into your eyes it even
winks at you the phone itself has a nice
large display that's not so big it
breaks your hands and a terrific 20
megapixel camera that takes bright clear
shots and fights low-light doldrums for
all it's worth it's made of plastic and
not metal that you can pop out the
battery and pop in a storage card both
of which are becoming more rare so
Cortana voice assistant and offline maps
are also great too this isn't the phone
that Android and iPhone fans will run to
it just doesn't have the apps including
native support for Google services but
fans of Windows phones are in for a very
nice treat with some of these thoughtful
touches in Windows 10 learn more about
the Microsoft Lumia 950 and my full cnet
