for episode 304 of the 359 podcast if
you can believe it and in the house
today full house Alfred Inge Roger Tang
and David Katz Meyer with terrible
posture hey guys are we doing the bad
posture show yeah this is me she's not
watching that's why 3:59 got away with
bad posture for like 4 minutes
remember when we were audio-only and
people didn't see us yeah but then I got
crap all day for those days anyways
let's focus yes focus people so we're
gonna be talking about the Amazon fire
TV the new Amazon fire TV is what we've
got David on to talk about that how it
stacks up with the competition you've
got Roku you've got Apple TV chromecast
so there are a number of options out
there David's gonna be around to break
it down for us and the next step
Kaspersky is both the US government's
holding hearings tomorrow to discuss
Kaspersky and its possible involvement
with Russia and all that controversy
there's a lot to break down there to
unpack fortunately Alfred wrote an FAQ
and will be able to explain this whole
beef it's all kind of confusing to me so
Alfred you're naked you're naked you're
gonna need help I feel like we're gonna
need more than 40 minutes for this but
we'll try to do it do it about two
minutes if you can as always if you have
any questions about these topics leave
them in the comment section and Brian
we'll get to the best or pick out the
best we'll get them in three minutes in
59 seconds and here we go for the
recording of the podcast we'll see it in
a couple minutes submit your questions
and comments and I'm sure David Katz may
I'd love to hear from all of you here we
go in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
alfred hang the reviews for the new
amazon firetv are out and we have
special guest David Katz Meyer to break
it all down for us
how's it going thanks for joining us
same time so I mean bottom line the
Kindle Fire sorry that was on fire TV
it's an easy mistake
okay Amazon fire TV is out let me the
review you did the full review yeah what
do you think it's really good but not as
good as Roku so it's it's it's pretty
easy this year there's actually two $70
4k HDR streamers wrote
and Amazon fire TV that really compete
for the exact same person somebody it
has a 4k HDR TV wants a new streamer and
you know basically has to go which one
do I like so I always say with the
Amazon with this one in particular it's
really about voice and being able to
like if you have an echo or a dot in
your house you can sit there and say
Alexa play transparent Alexa play
stranger things whatever it is and it
will turn on you know what turn on TV TV
is already on it will switch and and
launch those apps and play those things
with just a voice command you know and
you pick up the remote that is freaking
cool um
how accurate is it it's pretty accurate
I mean it's as accurate as any search on
Amazon so if you know sometimes the
words don't work very well if you have
the wrong word but in general you know
it works and you know there get just
getting better at it like all the
selected stuff there's some limitations
but in general that's a really cool
feature be used with all that you still
say the Roku beats it out yeah well Roku
interface is just cleaner with Amazon
you're basically staring at a whole lot
of Amazon videos Amazon ads Amazon
promotions that just got under my skin
after a while like I want a nice clean
interface like a phone yeah I want an
interface I can I can customize like a
phone move my apps around go into the
apps get their interface and you know
see what I want to see without too much
you know fuss and bother and Roku still
the best at that they still the best 4k
selection of apps and they have a new
feature on the remote so you can
actually control the TV volume and power
with the remote included with the box
and that's really cool all right thanks
next up you may be using Kaspersky
antivirus software but did you know it's
in hot water with the US government
Alfred youyou broke down this dispute or
this this issue between Kaspersky and
the government what's going on yeah it's
been a long six seven months for
Kaspersky in the US this all kind of
really started around July or June or so
when Bloomberg had released a report
talking about how Kaspersky had ties to
the Russian government about how all the
things that they were doing implied that
that you know there they must be working
together in one way or another a month
before that FBI investigators actually
questioned several Kaspersky employees
working in the US and then in recent in
the last two months there have been
reports from the Wall Street Journal and
The New York Times talking about
Israeli hackers caught Kaspersky Russian
spies using Kaspersky software to steal
secrets from the NSA The Wall Street
Journal broke that story in October as
well talking about how NSA secrets were
lifted from a employees computer in 2015
using Kaspersky software as well so it's
there's a lot of espionage going on
right so the bottom line should I dump
my Kaspersky software so the thing about
this is that this is more about like
nation-states and this is you know kind
of a Russian spy you know their
equivalent of the FBI using their like
hacking tools for these kinds of things
and specifically targeting individuals
because it's extremely hard to hack an
antivirus yeah
and it's targeted attack so if you think
that you know there's a reason for the
any like Russian spies to want to take
your family vacation photos or anything
like that yeah they're my kids super
cute then yeah you should probably you
know be careful when you're using
Kaspersky software but you know the idea
is that these are very focused this
taxis aren't like widespread attacks so
it's one of those things where you have
to consider are you a target of you know
right Russian espionage and if the
answer is no I would assume that it's
safe to continue using the software to
block out ransomware and many other
things at it because it is still a
fairly high rate it still once
antiviruses yeah so all right that's all
the time we have for more of these
stories chicks on CNET I'm Roger Cheng
I'm Alfred I'm David Katz Meyer thanks
for listening Alfred I understood none
of what you said trying to break it down
and give us a big info-dump so there's a
lot to process a complicated story I
think the main takeaway is that
Kaspersky antivirus is still a really
good software company countries around
the world still use it Germany continues
to use it and they even publicly stated
you know despite all these allegations
and reports
there has been no technical evidence
being put out there about this and
they're still continuing to use it in
September the Brazilian armed army
signed a new contract with
burski and Interpol which is kind of
like a European like police force I
guess oh yeah
it's sort of an international place well
yeah they recently signed an agreement
to continue you working with Kaspersky
for it's like cybercrime
operation I guess in the u.s. though
there's gonna be I have to imagine this
to be a chilling effect for just yet
even normal customers right look they
see these headlines they yeah kind of
equated with Russian spies you know it's
at that point even if it's highly rated
you gonna start looking shopping around
yeah they're gonna have a lot of trouble
basically getting their reputation back
up to par in the US and in Western
Europe which is about 60 percent of
their market oh wow and you know I think
the idea is you know even if they are
one of the best there's still multiple
options out there for you right so it's
one of those things where why should we
stick with this when there's like
concerns about it I mean I will say the
I mean having the government kind of on
your back about something like this
that's a huge negative impact I mean I
bring up the example wall way which the
US government a few years yeah several
years ago basically said well you're not
allowed to sell any network equipment
cuz we have concerns about security the
company but basically government made it
clear like we're not talking about
phones but while we still has struggled
to sell phones here that brand is pretty
much non-existent even though it's been
pretty successful around the world here
in the US having that blackmart from the
government and it is like it's a death
son so yeah I think I think a lot of it
has also been discussed behind closed
doors it's kind of like first surfaced
when Senator Marco Rubio kind of brought
up during an intelligence hearing he
asked the head of Cyber Command and
somebody from the NSA basically would
anybody recommend using Kaspersky
software unprompted they kind of just
brought it up out of Norway which which
is kind of their way of getting it open
to the public without revealing that
much like I just like something from a
closed hearing just bringing it out
front like out of nowhere so that's the
thing a lot of these issues that they
have are really behind closed doors and
that's why there's not that many
technical details out on it and that's
also why Kaspersky yesterday had offered
basically were allowing third-party mom
of our source code of our updates and
things like that right from an
independent source and so they can let
everybody you know like what are the
issues with our company without you know
you know trying to defend their name and
and all this like controversy
surrounding them okay
Ryan well the questions yeah let's stay
on the same topic here coming in from
imagine soggy
can we talk about AVG do we need to find
a new free antivirus program and if yes
which one
I wouldn't use AVG eyestone that me
personally why is that they're just not
that highly rated okay on there
Kaspersky did offer a free antivirus and
anti-malware for me I just try to
practice like safe security measures and
I'm like using Windows Defender which
yeah is free and I also just like I'm
like very paranoid all of a lot of links
that I open so I'm like already extra
secure on that and then I'm also like
not on my desktop a lot right is the
thing actually I do use Kaspersky for
actually my license is expired so I was
using the free one is it just as
effective yes oh yeah I'm right then but
didn't you say you were worried about
your kids photos me yeah yeah there's
that I'm sure the Russian government
really wants to the idea is that you
know I talked with a security expert in
my story talking and she was basically
saying if somebody's trying to hack you
they're not gonna do it through like
your antivirus because that it's
extremely difficult to do and they're
gonna get you through other means that
are much easier like I don't know
sending you like a phishing link or you
know something at you trying to get you
to click on that like it's like buying
your social number from experience yeah
Equifax Agrifac sorry sorry experiment
yeah well Experian had its own issues a
few years back you know they're not
completely innocent here right right
yeah well the point is that there
there's like multiple measures out there
and you know I think your antivirus
which is a prime target but it's also
like pretty hard to hit that's the
bottom line is your antivirus is
probably fine but you're screwed either
way cuz they'll find another way yep
yeah yeah just to put a positive spin on
it
not antivirus I'm just Pro healthy if
I'm trying to be PC here's our healthy
viruses out there - that's the
optimistic way to look I'm Andy I like
it what I'm anti Monte Phi don't protest
all right
here's a good question from Assad isn't
that the same what the CIA FBI are doing
the same with Google Facebook Apple and
Microsoft systems as far as I'm assuming
like partnering monitoring goes yes I
think part of the idea is you know we do
it too so as far as like spying on other
countries and using hacking measures
bourree I mean I think that was one of
the big like things that you know
Kaspersky had kind of brought up in
their argument when when their software
I had detected the NSA hacking tools so
the story goes is that the NSA employee
brought NSA like files home on his home
computer it's already a big no-no yeah
and that's how the Kaspersky software
picked it up because the tools were
hacking tools so it was basically oh you
mean our antivirus packed up this
malware that your government of like
agency wrote like basically the idea is
like it did its job the question is okay
but how did it get from this antivirus
to in the hands of like the Russian like
government like that's like okay we get
step a two-step you about how did this
end up in like the Kremlin yeah yeah but
yes the the US government also uses like
a variety of hacking tools and
leveraging like tech companies so yeah
it's exactly the thing we all suck yeah
all right one more on this topic from
imagine soggy but if it's true about
Kaspersky wouldn't they be able to
create a profile about us to target this
information which Artie is known for
doing yeah but they're not in the line
of sending out this information yeah
this is less about this isn't party
nation this is more about actually
securing animation stealing information
so it's it's sort of the opposite got it
all right let's switch gears back over
to the Amazon fire TV
I'm sure David's relieved hey guys still
here
James favorite burski
do you know if the new fire TV supports
dual dolby atmos high-quality audio yes
it supports high quality audio is in
regular dolby it also supports at most
the issue is that the Amazon fire TV
doesn't have any apps that support Atmos
yet so Vudu right now is kind of the
main purveyor of Atmos that's on roku
right now and Roku stick also is that
most oh no although there's a new thing
called movies anywhere you may have
heard yes so we talked about that a
little bit movies anywhere is a really
cool thing if you own movies that
actually paid for movies movies yes I
thought I have about 500 DVDs at home
that's true I have I have DVDs in a big
IKEA bag to Walmart and and did this to
digital you could make those into your
new Vudu library oh so there's a thing
called movies anywhere that links your
owned movies of course you can probably
just get sign-ins from Vudu Google Play
and even Apple iTunes the mother lode
people paying for money movies so movies
anywhere allows you to link all those
accounts on the backend and then on the
front end which can include any of those
apps or Amazon you can just go in and
watch anything movie so many other
services so on fire TV which lacks a
voodoo app and a Google Play app and
obviously iTunes it can still access
movies that you bought on those other
services thanks to movies anywhere a
wonderful new service nice little very
very bad I mean I feel like I feel like
we should take turns answering questions
on each other speeds pronounced
experience yeah so there's the Atmos is
there yes just not support it Matthew -
are the - in the chat asks does the fire
TV play YouTube if so will it do a
better job than my Google home at
playing the videos I want for the life
of me I can't get my cuckoo home to play
my watch list yes but I think you're
talking about voice control you're
saying hey okay google play videos about
silly cats I don't know what videos
you're looking for
what words they have in the spoken
commands but often if you have you know
words that trip up systems it'll trip up
anything whether it's you know Google
home or Alexa but the fire TV won't play
Google of it
YouTube videos it will play YouTube
videos directly if you if you use those
voice commands so you can say play
videos on YouTube but and as will the as
will a Google home so that works but you
know whether one is better than the
other recognizing your voice
historically I found that Google home is
better recognize your voice if you're
having trouble with Google home commands
playing videos by a chromecast don't
expect better performance from fire TV
don't go out and buy a dot and a fire TV
expecting to get better cat videos from
without having to use their house that
the voice command work tonight if I say
like play orange the new black mm-hmm
it'll know to load up Netflix or what
like what if like how does it know which
video service tool it all depends so for
example Amazon is obviously favored as
always right so if you say transparent
or man and a high castle or whatever
that works great if you say orange the
new black or you know a Netflix show it
will it will actually call up the search
result for that show you have to and
it'll say you know watch on Netflix is
get generally the default and then you
say Alexa play so it's a two-step
process firing into yeah so it's still
up in the air and this goes back to a
lot of these walled garden things
whether that's Amazon's follower that's
Netflix is fall for not building in the
hooks but long story short all of these
things have these kind of little
barriers unless you're using their own
sort of service and Netflix is you know
kind of famously independent in terms of
things like but there is a there is a
YouTube app on that right yes yeah so
the issue is what you can use the voice
commands to play specific videos yeah no
it works you can and and it just
sometimes takes a little bit more of a
command so you know you have to you have
to be a little more specific sometimes
you have to say on YouTube or whatever
it is you know you can't just say play
crazy cat videos and it'll work but if
you did say like no that is one day
there's no way to a default for those
commands to be YouTube but if you said
place Amazon so they probably won't do
this play crazy
videos on YouTube it would know it would
load up honestly I didn't test that no
crazy crazy cast nosy cat cats videos
I'll go back and do it that's a massive
playlist you guys can check it out
it's me going crazy pull my hair out
acting like okay what's up next
let's just spend a couple more minutes
on Amazon yeah Josh Buddha says well not
technically Amazon but streaming video
Josh Boyd uh I'm moving into an
apartment that has a Smart TV and I'm
bringing my Google home is it worth
bringing my chromecast yeah that thing
is like the size of a put it in your in
your coin pocket in your pants so yeah I
totally bring it I mean I assume he
could probably also gift it to somebody
I think is it gonna be redundant to have
a smart TV and a chromecast so the
question there yes because the whole
thing is Google home if you're if you're
into talking to your TV and getting it
to do stuff Google home plus chromecast
works great the Smart TV probably
doesn't work with Google home unless
it's a late-model Sony with Android TV
and then it kind of doesn't work as well
as chromecast so yeah that's the issue
is you know the the the the Smart TV
interface is always going to be behind a
chromecast or at Amazon fire or Roku in
general so you know trust in those
little plug eeny dongles more than
you're gonna trust in you know some
interface designed by Samsung in 2014
but is it really only so like you can
talk like talk to the TV like is that
the only like real added advantage well
chromecast is really slick in a lot of
other ways you know it has great app
support via phones you know it's it
loads quick you know sometimes the Wi-Fi
is better than on a smart TV so yeah
again with an older Smart TV chromecast
to run circles around it you know
provided you're okay using your phone to
call it videos all right we got one more
and it's a David's favorite question
what do you think is the best out of all
the streamers out there money is no
object money is no expensive one so the
most expensive one is Nvidia shield and
arguably the
I mean pricier than Apple TV yeah yeah
so it's well they just Nvidia released a
version that does include a game console
for $20 less to match Apple TV's price I
would not buy that because you know game
consoles another 20 bucks but anyway
that's a great box does pretty much
everything now a voice commands agreed
on because it's built in Google
assistant that would probably the one
that I would buy second very close
second place is Apple TV just because it
has Dolby vision it annoys me that it
does everything in HDR but you can kind
of get over that and I didn't ding it
hugely in the review but those two are
are your gold plated streamers and
they're both really competitive and they
honestly serve different markets so you
know Plex people add a lot of files
quote-unquote that they want to stream
shields great for that gaming shield
does all the apps it's got great voice
with Google but apples a really slick
interface and that the remote is great
on there the voice is really good with
Siri blah blah blah so those two are
your your gold-plated ones and you
always tell me anytime I'm asking about
it that you are you favor Roku yes as
far as budget yes so again if I have all
the money in the world ice I still might
use my Roku you know at home I have
access to pretty much any stream where I
want and I still use Roku so the idea
with Roku is that it's super simple and
it kind of does everything you want so
anytime when you're streaming you're
basically like so what do I really want
to do with this thing and it's really
the only pure play like Roku really only
makes these boxes right there they're
not trying to get into this they are
this and TVs which is a huge growth for
them but yeah they're they're
specializing in streaming and they they
don't have an axe to grind they don't
still want to sell you videos like
iTunes or Amazon or angle so right cool
before we wrap it up let's just address
one there's a couple of people in the
chat we're kind of curious about what
the current status of crack is oh it's
still that rampant on the streets it is
1988 after all so what where are we
standing what's the latest development
oh the crack multiple companies have
released like patches for them so if you
want if you know the next time you get
you're a little like update prompt you
should probably it's not useless yeah
most likely a security up
I at Google and Apple if both said that
they were releasing them in the upcoming
weeks so if you've got a notification to
update from them yeah definitely do that
new Apple TV beta is for crack they're
saying that's coming out like tomorrow
the next day yeah so yeah like I said
it's very hard to keep track of all the
smart home stuff yeah that could be
affected by this but like I said as soon
as you got a prompt to update you should
that being said though there's been more
developments about like how the attack
actually works and like hacking and
antivirus it's like extremely difficult
to do and it's also a targeted attack
like it's not a mass attack like ransom
that's what you local right yeah weird
spreads from like one thing to another
like somebody has to basically say like
I'm definitely going after Alfred or I'm
going after Brian on this and I'm going
to stand outside of his house they're
gonna be severely disappointed what a
laptop and you also have to know that
they're on wpa2 like Wi-Fi yeah and then
you also have to know like like at what
point the vulnerability like words it's
it's a lot of factors so I feel like
it's the Kaspersky argument again what
unless you think you're somebody that's
going during a high-value target yeah
yeah
which none of us are it's a massive
corruptibility that's still a obstacle
course to get through what you're saying
yeah we're so mean we're so
insignificant that's sort of our
protection that and like a lot of
companies have already kind of patched
this so yeah this is not an invitation
for anybody to try to hit me with this
yeah we're we're you disappointed you're
really relevant yeah but I am saying
it's very difficult to do and it's
mostly like targeted attack though again
though update your systems anyway yep
exactly
always and write that note all right if
you like to anything you saw or heard
here check us out on CNET our podcasts
also available on iTunes today's
stitcher SoundCloud Feedburner and
Google Play Music I'm just tired guys
