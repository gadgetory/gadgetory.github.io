and we're gonna take a look at the Sony
HTC t5 50w this is a soundbar home
theater system from Sony and it's
currently selling for around $400 now
the first thing you'll notice with the
Sony is that while most systems consist
of just a wireless subwoofer and a sound
bar with sony also has a separate head
unit that powers the system and also
handles AV switching duties it's
actually a fairly large box and around
back you'll see it's packed with
connectivity especially for a sound bar
there are three HDMI inputs three
digital audio inputs and an analog audio
input
now that's way more connectivity than
you'll find on a typical budget sound
bar although you really don't need all
those ports if you end up using your TV
as a switcher and the downside of the
head unit is that it adds bulk to the
whole system which kind of works against
the idea of a sound bar in the first
place now the sound bar itself is
surprisingly heavy but it gives it a
heft that makes it feel solidly built
there's really nothing else to the sound
bar which is really quite thin and
there's a proprietary speaker cable on
the back that needs to connect to the
head unit the included subwoofer has an
interesting look with the gap in the
middle to keep it looking from just a
big black box the sub is Wireless but
surprisingly the wireless functionality
isn't exactly built in sony includes two
wireless cards and you'll need to
install one in the sub and one in the
head unit it's easy enough to install
the wireless cards but it's a little
strange that it's not built in the
remote is actually pretty cluttered for
a sound bar there are tons of buttons
for all kinds of functions that have
nothing to do with the sound bar itself
which can make it pretty intimidating if
you're not a techie the idea is that you
can use the remote to control other
devices in your home theater but you're
better off buying a logitech harmony
universal remote if you want to do that
now the sony is a premium price sound
bar so we were expecting premium sound
quality and we didn't quite get it with
this system the main problem was that
the blend between the subwoofer and the
sound bar wasn't quite smooth so we
could always hear a gap between the two
components movies just didn't quite have
the impact we were looking for and music
wasn't much better
it's not a bad sounding system overall
but the cheaper higher SBE v4
Slim's sounded better with pretty much
everything we throw at it so altogether
the sony HTC t 550 W doesn't quite live
up to its premium price tag although
it's worth considering if you need a
sound bar with a lot of connectivity I'm
Matthew Muscovy AK and this is the sony
HTC t 550 w</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
