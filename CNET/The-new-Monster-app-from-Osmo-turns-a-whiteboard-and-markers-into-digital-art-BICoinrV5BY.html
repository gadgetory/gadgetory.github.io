releasing digital toys as you don't want
to lose the physical aspect Osmo has
been merging digital with physical for
around two years but the next edition is
monster which combines drawing and a
digital character all-in-one this is one
toy that I wish I had growing up to save
the LEAs monster by Osmo is available as
an application for iPads and works with
the Osmo base and mirror essentially
these act as a dock for the iPad and the
mirror clips over the camera allowing it
to look at the whiteboard in the box
you'll get a few chalk markers a
whiteboard a carrying case and an eraser
cloth a good thing to note is that these
tools will also work with Osmos previous
release Newton and masterpiece
applications which prior to this you
just used a pen and paper for mo the
monster is the star of the show along
with whoever is playing the game upon
starting the game MO will greet you and
will have some questions or requests for
you like to draw a favorite fruit or
even a friend the camera will pick up
what is on the whiteboard although the
quality of the skin definitely depends
on the lighting in this way your drawing
will then appear with mo as he does some
magic with it to ensure a few hours of
gameplay each show will have different
questions being asked monster a retail
for $49 and is a great addition to the
Osmo liner with that being said the cost
of entry gets a bit higher as a starter
creative kit which includes the base
mirror plus $79 by itself you can expect
future updates with more content and no
additional cost in the future as well as
a creative starter kit for $79 later
this summer
