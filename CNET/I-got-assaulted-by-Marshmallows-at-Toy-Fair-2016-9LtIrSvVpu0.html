they got all kinds of toys for little
kids and big kids I'm a big kid they
gotta have some toys for me right let's
go see what they got
here was something I thought was really
cool this is stick pot and it's a
stop-motion do-it-yourself animation
system where you can buy this little kit
that comes with a green screen and
little figures and it can teach you how
to make a stop motion animation comes
with an app you upload that stuff put it
up on YouTube and people can comment on
it do whatever you want with it starts
at $25 I checked out the marshmallow fun
company they've got a marshmallow
blaster and a marshmallow bow and arrow
cheetah bow and mallow it's like a bow
and arrow but it's a bone mallet it
shoots tiny marshmallows they're fun and
they don't hurt and you could eat your
ammo I'd like you to attempt to shoot
one of those into my mouth is that okay
that's okay yeah and if I choke I know
CPR she knows CPR Oh Oh is the
marshmallow blaster it shoots a
marshmallow 50 feet in the air I'm gonna
shoot it up and try and catch in my
mouth ready set oh guess what koliko is
back they've got the cliq Oh chameleon a
brand new platform for video games
honoring the 8 and 16-bit generation
they want people to develop new games
for this console doesn't connect to the
internet nothing fancy like that it's
going to go for one hundred fifty
dollars but first they need kickstarter
funding and that starts februari 26 i
also went to the bleacher creatures
booth and guess what they've got the
likenesses of some of the presidential
candidates there's Ted Cruz Marco Rubio
there's no Trump he wouldn't allow the
likeness but I guess Hillary with that
hair maybe come on this is how you
should hold the world's smallest vacuum
this is a booth but naughty people with
naughty toys you can tell by the thong
stools
then I went by the neck booth they've
got licenses to games and movies we all
love first thing I had to do was check
out the contra likeness and check this
out donatella from the 1990 Ninja
Turtles movie are you serious how good
does that look and finally I checked out
the Dark Horse booth they've got game of
thrones likenesses really detailed
figurines honestly I was just pumped
because I finally got to see what the
names of all these characters are I can
never remember there's too many of them</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
