wireless noise cancelling headphone and
first noise cancelling headphone of any
kind available in two color options has
got that sleek sophisticated design that
BMW headphones are known for with some
metal parts and ballistic nylon on the
ear cups they feel quite sturdy and I
liked how their memory foam equipped ear
pads adhere magnetically and are easily
replaceable
they cost $400 and are comfortable to
wear though they're not as light or
quite as comfortable as Bose as quiet
comfort 35s like earlier BMW headphones
the PX comes with a quilted carrying
case and a cable for listening in Wired
mode so you can plug into an in-flight
entertainment system it's worth noting
that this headphone charges via USB C
and as battery life is rated at 22 hours
with Wireless and noise cancelling
turned on that's right there with
competing models from both Sony and
beats on the back side of the right ear
cup there's an integrated remote and I
liked how the middle multifunction
button is raised higher than the volume
controls which lets you operate the
remote by feel alone BMWs adaptive noise
cancelling isn't quite as strong as the
noise cancelling on the bose qc25 but
using the free companion app for iOS and
Android devices you can toggle through
three levels of noise cancellation based
on the environment you're in which is
nice to maximize sound quality you can
turn off noise cancelling altogether
through the app or by hitting a button
on the right ear cup and you can also
adjust the level pass through sound so
you can hear people talking to you
better the other feature worth
mentioning is the auto play and auto
pause feature if you pull an ear cup off
your ear your music pauses and then
resumes as soon as you put the ear cup
back on your ear the P X's drivers are
the same angle drivers previously found
in BMWs $900 p9 headphone and that angle
design is supposed to create a more
convincing soundstage overall I did
think this headphone sounded pretty open
and had good clarity and natural
sounding mids the bass goes deep but I
wouldn't say it's super punchy or highly
defined so no it doesn't blow away the
competition rip Sony bows and beats but
it does sound excellent for a while
noise cancelling headphone and is a
strong contender in this price glass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
