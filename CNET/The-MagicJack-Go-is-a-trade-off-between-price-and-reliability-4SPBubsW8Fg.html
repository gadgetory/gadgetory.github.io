their late-night commercials the
magicJack NGO promises to be an
affordable option for unlimited local
calling throughout the United States and
Canada while it is cheap at $59 with a
free year of service performance is not
an area where it shines setting up the
unit was easy but getting it to make it
connection to the internet was not once
you get through the not so smooth setup
process you can make calls from a
computer application or through a
traditional handset magicJack will also
let you take phone calls on their mobile
application for iOS and Android it's a
very simple design to it that allows you
both to receive and make calls you can
even set it to give you notification
when calls are coming in plus the
application allows you to add time for
international calls and you can use it
to text as well it's important to note
that the magicJack requires a high-speed
data connection but even when testing on
a fiber line it didn't know his work
call quality was an issue especially
when trying to use the mobile
application over LTE I experienced
several drop calls and ones that went
through weren't that clear a remedy that
worked for this was restarting the unit
but when you were out on the go and
trying to use it this can be quite
frustrating for the price you can't beat
the magic out especially when you
consider other VoIP solutions are priced
at around $99 even better matichek
provides a year of free service and
after that it comes down to less than
three dollars a month in the end it's
one of the most affordable systems like
this but not the most dependable you'll
have to decide if it's worth that
trade-off
