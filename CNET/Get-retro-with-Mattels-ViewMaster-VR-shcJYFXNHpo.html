touch of nostalgia on the side the
mattel viewmaster might be just what
you've been looking for taking its
design cues from the stereoscopic
viewers that arrived way back in the
1930s the V monster is essentially
either a well-made version of Google
cardboard or downmarket gear VR
depending on which way you look at it
it's essentially a plastic case and
needs your phone to work but the good
news is it accommodates a broad range of
phones such as the 5.7 inch Nexus 6p the
old-school viewmaster reels have made a
comeback as well although you don't slot
them in you just aim the viewmaster at
them and the app recognizes what you're
looking at the actual VR experience is
pretty similar to other Google cardboard
style virtual reality infotainment apps
and of course it also works just fine
with the actual cardboard app but the
design of the viewmaster means you can't
wear headphones with it so you are
limited to the sound coming out of your
phone unfavorable comparisons to gear VR
are likely not only because of the
headphone issue and the fact that
there's no diopter so you can't change
the focal distance of the lenses that's
not quite fair as the viewmaster costs
just thirty dollars in the US or fifty
australian dollars which is a third of
the price of the gear VR the Mattel
viewmaster is definitely aimed at the
educational toy market and it's a fun
functional VR viewer that you shouldn't
be afraid to let the kids play with</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
