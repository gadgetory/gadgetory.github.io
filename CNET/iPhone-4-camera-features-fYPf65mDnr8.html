iphone 4 so what we've done is we've
gone from a 3 megapixel to a 5 megapixel
sensor but we're using something that
has been shipping for a while and larger
cameras but it's fairly new to
smartphones and that is what's called a
backside illuminated sensor it's a way
of getting a lot more photons to the
sensor by getting some of the wiring and
stuff out of the way in addition to that
when most people increase their
megapixels they make those pixels
smaller when you make pixels smaller
they capture less photons what we've
done is as we've gone from 3 to 5
megapixels we've kept the pixels the
same size 1.75 microns and so they don't
capture less photons per pixel and we
have more pixels we've got a 5x digital
zoom built into the camera app of course
what we pioneered tap the focus and
we've got an LED flash built in and the
pictures that we're taking off this are
pretty remarkable of course you can do
portrait and landscape you can see the
digital zoom right there and these are
pictures that are taken right off the
iPhone 4 they haven't been touched in
any way
it shows you it shows you what kind of
quality we're able to get so we're
really happy with the the photos we're
taking with the iPhone 4 we think we got
a great camera built-in but that's not
all because the camera also records HD
video that's HD video at full 720p at 30
frames per second so it's real HD video
now we pioneer and tap to focus for
still photos we now have tap the focus
video and we have built-in video editing
for trimming your Clips right on the
phone and one-click sharing to share
your photos and the LED flash also will
stay on to illuminate scenes for video
recording</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
