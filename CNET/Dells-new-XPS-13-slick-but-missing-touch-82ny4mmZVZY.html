looking at here is the Dell XPS 13 now
we looked at this laptop last year and
at the time when ultra books were a new
thing the XPS 13 was a bold really nice
design from Dell in a very compact form
you're talking about a laptop that is a
smaller footprint than a 13-inch MacBook
Air and very similar stylings as a lot
of vulture books do but you have a
really nice look for Dell or really for
any Windows laptop the drawback last
year was the fact that for the price the
XPS 13 had a lack of certain ports it
also had a subpar battery life compared
to others and didn't have the it had an
okay scream it didn't have a great
high-res scream well now in 2013 this
laptop which we did see at CES is
available and the nicest part of it is
that it has a 1080p display and the
1080p display looks really nice bright
sharp vivid great from any angle
wonderful but there's a problem with
display and that's this it doesn't have
touch now some of you may be celebrating
that because maybe you don't like touch
on the laptop but the fact is you know
you don't need to use touch on any
Windows laptop Windows 8 it's nice to
have and when a laptop lacks it it just
feels like a drop feature and this
configuration is not cheap you're
talking about $1600 yeah for a 256 gig
SSD eight gigs of ram core i7 processor
nice specs but still that's MacBook Air
territory and high-end ultrabooks and
it's a lot to pay when you're leaving
out touch aside from that the
improvements are nice you're gaining
about a half hour plus and battery life
not tremendous and you are getting newer
Intel processors the third gen so you're
not looking at anything that's you know
brand new coming down the pike but you
know nice upgrades you know for the
landscape right now you're still not
getting a lot of great ports you're
getting two USB 3.0 mini DisplayPort and
that's it no SD card slot no Ethernet
and no HDMI because this is targeted at
small businesses and business Fulke
business
Travelers so that's probably a bummer
the one I am most disappointed by is a
lack of an SD card slot because come on
this thing could have fit one but you
see that's literally the same styling as
last year very sleek nice metal soft
touch design slightly better battery
life the price and these configurations
does start at $9.99 but you're not gonna
get the 1080p screen $13.99 is where you
got to go to get the 1080p display and
really that's the biggest reason to
upgrade on this but I'd say without
touch a little bit of a deal-breaker
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
new Dell XPS 13 2013 edition
