that is short for notifications of
course it is awesome for a party
for waking you up from a nap and for
helping you go Zen but the thing it
isn't so good at in my opinion is what
it is actually made for and that's
notifying you every time you receive a
message or alert on your iPhone or
Android phone okay let me be clear
the naughty does exactly what it's
supposed to and in the beginning having
the lamp light up when you get a
Facebook message or text or email is
really helpful especially when you can
keep your phone somewhere else and just
use the light to get your attention but
then all those blinking lights become
really annoying really fast and they
won't go away until you pull out your
phone and open the message all right
right the good news is that the finer
details like the apps you want to
include and the colors you want to see
are all up to you so you could go in and
narrow it down to only one or two apps
that you're naughty pings you about and
call it a day or if you're into mood
lighting or a party light you could also
get the palm size device and use it for
one of those secondary purposes even
though I am a sucker for colored
lighting I couldn't handle all that
constant blinking so when it comes to
naughty I've got to say no</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
