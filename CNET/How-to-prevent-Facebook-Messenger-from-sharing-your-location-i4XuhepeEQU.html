how-to contributor and today we're going
to take a look at how to disable
Facebook messenger from sending your
location automatically this could be a
big privacy concern for some people
while others is just a real big pain
constantly remembering to tap the
location icon during a chat to stop your
location from being sent so if you don't
know what I mean here is an example so
we'll start a new conversation and as
you can see the location icons lit up so
to disable it you would normally tap on
it and now the message won't send your
location along with it but there's no
real way of disabling it permanently
within the app at least on the iPhone so
what we're going to do is we're going to
come back out we'll go into settings
location services and then scroll down
to messenger and all you have to do is
turn that off now the messenger app on
your phone will not be able to access
your location whatsoever so even if we
start a new conversation that's
automatically turned off where in the
past you'd have to go and turn it off
each and every time you started a
conversation or sometimes each time you
entered that same conversation you had
already turned it off for now let's take
a look at what the process looks like on
Android alright so now we have an
Android device here we're going to go
ahead and open up Facebook Messenger
start a new conversation and as you can
see the location icons lit up again I
would have to tap on it to turn it off
and because Android handles location
services app by app basis and it's a
little differently there's not a
system-wide setting like there as on iOS
we're going to tap on the menu icon and
then go to settings and in here you can
see location services is an option tap
on that and then we'll uncheck that box
what that will do is permanently disable
the Facebook Messenger app on Android
from accessing your location in any
conversation so we'll go back start
another conversation and as you can see
that icon is defaulted to off now once
again this is Jason Cipriani was seen at
how to hopefully we're keeping you a
little bit safer by showing you how to
disable Facebook messenger from sending
your location
automatically thank you for joining us
