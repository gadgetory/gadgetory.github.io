performing slate and like most Samsung
tablets it's packed with software
features but starting at $270 it's a bit
overpriced for CNET i'm Xiomara blanco
and this is the samsung galaxy tab for
8.0 I really like the tablets 8-inch
size and design the textured back is
comfortable and gives it some grip
support but it's plastic build feels a
bit cheap the capacitive buttons on the
bottom bezel are easy to accidentally
trigger which can be frustrating if
streaming a long video but they're not
as intrusive during gaming browsing or
reading the right edge houses the power
button volume rocker IR blaster in micro
SD card slot with the microUSB port on
the bottom edge and headphone jack on
the top the single speaker on the back
is easy to block when holding the tablet
but at week and tinny audio discourages
its use the Samsung Galaxy Tab four
houses a quad-core processor 1 gigabyte
of RAM and 16 gigabytes of internal
storage with a micro SD card slot that's
expandable up to 64 gigabytes it's
performance is impressively smooth but
not very fast large apps and games take
a few seconds to launch
but they run smoothly once loaded the
split screen function is one of the
highlights of the tab 48.0 allowing you
to easily multitask with the apps
available to use in the split-screen
mode are limited and it's a super simple
version of what you can do with the
higher-end premium sleep however the
tablet consistently performed smoothly
while multitasking but again not the
fastest both of the cameras on the
tablet are unimpressive there are no
manual focus options and photos are
usually fuzzy at full resolution with
the dull and washed out colors the 1280
by 800 pixel resolution screen is a real
weak spot for the tab 4 8.0
HD video looks fine but it's far from
the super HD resolutions other tablets
are sporting the TouchWiz interface
looks typically vibrant and colorful but
the screen brightness is also on the
dull side the split screen function is
useful and it's slow but steady
performance matched with a comfy but
cheap feeling design is forgivable
however at 279 it's still a little
overpriced you can find a faster
performing tablet with a sturdier build
at a lower price point once again I'm
Xia Marmont go for Sina and this has
been the Samsung Galaxy Tab for 8.0</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
