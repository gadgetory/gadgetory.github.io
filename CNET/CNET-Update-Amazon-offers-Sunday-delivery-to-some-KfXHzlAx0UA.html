on Sunday I am Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update amazon made a deal with
the US Postal Service to deliver
packages on Sundays to customers in New
York and Los Angeles and it'll expand
Sunday deliveries to more areas next
year starting with Dallas Houston New
Orleans and Phoenix we don't know the
details of this deal that Amazon made
with the post office but it doesn't cost
extra for customers to get a package on
Sunday if it's ready it'll be at your
door that means if you have prime
two-day shipping you could order
something on friday and get it sunday
and it starts right away on november
seventeenth amazon will also offer
sunday delivery to london using its own
amazon trucks later this month keep in
mind it's not for all merchandise when
you check out it'll say if the item is
eligible for sunday delivery this
program will certainly give amazon a
competitive advantage and if it boost
profits for the post office it might
expand sunday deliveries for other
retailers if you wanted a custom-made
Moto X smartphone you don't have to go
with ATT anymore all major US carriers
are offering the personalized Moto X
phones through the moto maker website
which was something previously only for
18t customers this phone is currently
one hundred dollars with a two-year
service contract and it'll be upgraded
to Android 4.4 KitKat in the near future
customers can pick from different color
back plates but we're still waiting on
those wood design options that Motorola
said would be coming this year the wood
designs will cost extra keep an eye out
for a sister phone to the Moto X being
announced Wednesday call the Moto G
Motorola is hosting a press event to
show off the phone Wednesday but someone
made a mistake and on Monday the phone
was accidentally listed for sale on
Amazon's UK site for delivery on
Thursday November 14th before it was
taken down the blog pocket-lint
published details of the moto g's
description which revealed it will have
a 4.5 inch screen quad-core processor
and the ability to pick different color
back plates it was listed at a price of
100
in 60 pounds which is about two hundred
and fifty dollars the magazine at
Flipboard has updated to serve as a type
of shopping catalogue instead of just
being a place for news articles users
can create custom magazines of items for
sale online and list the items alongside
price tags and links to purchase it the
tool is similar to how Pinterest works
and some companies will promote their
own catalogues that's your tech news
update but you can get more details on
the show blog cnet com / update and
