trying to remove one more danger from
the driving equation humans we think we
can expand this autonomous driving mode
to other not just a two-lane highway we
can go into streets and junctions and
more complicated situations Volvo is the
latest company to unveil a self-driving
car scene it's Tim Stevens hitched a
ride and experience the technology
firsthand I notice that you had to
manually change around this spell unlike
other car makers working on autonomous
driving Volvo is taking a different path
they're basing this technology on
sensors that are already in production
cars today there's really nothing bigger
advanced that's not already available
today that enables the functionality
that Volvo is putting in place that
means it's a lot cheaper than the other
solutions that companies are working on
and certainly a lot easier to put into
production but it's still a work in
progress currently the cars can't merge
or change lanes and they can only be
driven autonomously on a single highway
in Volvo's hometown of Gothenburg Sweden
it doesn't have the vehicle to
infrastructure communication that's
going to be required basically so that
the city can send messages to these cars
and let them know where there are
emergency vehicles or road construction
and so that the car can change lanes and
get around them in advance but that's
definitely something that will be in
place before these cars are made
available to the public Volvo did
demonstrate a nifty self-parking feature
made possible with a camera and
ultrasonic sensors on the bumpers if
Volvo stays on track a hundred of these
self-driving cars will be ready for the
public by 2017 with this autonomous
vehicle tech Volvo enters an
increasingly crowded space this is not
one of those things we have a lot of car
makers sitting on the sideline saying
now this isn't like diesel vs hybrid vs.
electric where they've all gone
different directions everyone realizes
this is a major trend that is coming
societally and logistically we're going
to need to change the way we drive and
basically do less of it ourselves as a
society Google's self-driving cars the
most autonomous of all the driverless
vehicles have logged nearly 700,000
highway miles and are now cruising city
streets Ford has developed a vehicle to
vehicle communication system to help
avoid collisions while Audi's adaptive
cruise control
sure can navigate the road when the car
speed is below 40 miles per hour what's
good about self-driving is long we
reduce fatalities reduce accidents
reduce the cost of insurance make better
utilization of roads much better
utilization of fuel on and on and on
what's bad about it is a single thing on
that list I like to drive fair point but
when you're stuck in traffic or hunting
for parking plenty of drivers will
gladly let technology take the wheel in
