I'm scene that's karna tsuboi joined by
senior writer Seth Rosenblatt hi now
Seth a recent report came out saying
that 13 of the most popular routers that
we all use at home are now known as
easily hackable tell us about this study
so the research firm independent
security evaluators out of Maryland put
out this study where they looked at the
most popular routers available or some
of them and they determined that using
very common to semi common security
hacks they were able to infiltrate the
routers and that could be very serious
absolutely serious because when you're
at home you think you're safe mhm and
therefore doing your banking and your
shopping and absolutely the information
the other issue isn't just for home use
that it's that a lot of these routers
are used by small businesses obviously a
lot of credit card information going out
over those two absolutely so the other
part of this study that was a little
disconcerting basically said that
there's nothing that we can do about
this or very little late there is very
little that we can do the study put a
lot of the onus on the router makers the
router vendors saying that they really
have to start paying attention to
security and if they don't they're
leaving their customers which basically
means all of us out on a limb but at the
same time there's not a lot of incentive
for these router makers to update their
technology that quickly right absolutely
one of the big problems is that even
when the router vendors do the right
thing and they put out a firmware update
there's no automatic firmware update
process so you still have to go to their
website download the firmware installed
on the router yourself and one thing
that independent security evaluate errs
road was that they think that that the
router vendors should make this an
automatic update process hmm well it
seems like the other part of the
problems that these routers are
typically very cheap mm-hmm and they
last for a long time and Security's not
necessarily a selling feature absolutely
and it would cost them a lot more money
to invest in security and to invest in
the kind of features like Windows has or
OSX for mac has where it's automatically
updating I'm sure we've given these tips
a million times but
about some very basic tips of what you
can do to browse a flea browsing safely
is when we're talking about router
hacking there's not much that you can do
because your internet signal is being
intercepted at the beginning but things
you can do or use two different browsers
for your financial and mission-critical
browsing such as emails going to your
banking site and use a second browser
for casual browsing I prefer using
Chrome and Firefox but there's a lot of
good browsers out there and what about
changing your network name and password
as frequently as you can okay changing
network name and password is a good idea
it's a very good idea if you can on your
router to change your admin password as
well if you can use a password that has
spaces in it do that that's more secure
than using one long word that has
multiple characters in it and and you
know unusual characters also some
routers let you change the username from
admin to something else if you can do
that that's also recommended yeah just
extra steps for the hacker staff to get
through absolutely thank you so much SEC
