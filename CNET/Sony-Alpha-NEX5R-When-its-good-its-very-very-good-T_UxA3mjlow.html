the nex-5n the interchangeable lens Sony
Alpha nex-5r delivers similarly
excellent photo quality and somewhat
improve performance over that model
though it looks about the same the
addition of the control dial and a
function button make a big difference in
usability and it's streamlined shooting
for those of us who like direct access
controls for everything the menu system
still gets a little annoying and now has
the card sub menu rolled into setup
which makes it quite tedious to find
important options like card formatting
and Wi-Fi setup the Wi-Fi features are
pretty basic though most competitors
offer the same you can upload to
Facebook or Sony's plain memory service
or you can transfer directly to your
phone there's also a remote shutter app
that lets you use your phone or tablet
as a larger screen but all you can
really do is snap the photo also new is
the ability to download and install
proprietary apps but the whole operation
seems to offer more benefit to Sony than
to camera owners for instance the free
picture effects Plus app duplicates the
effects in the camera with the exception
of adding watercolor and illustration
but both of those are built into the NEX
f3 so they took them out to put them
into the app the photo quality really is
quite good with clean JPEGs as high as
ISO 400 and for the most part usable
images as high as ISO 3200 depending
upon the scene Sony's image processing
is so well done that I really couldn't
get better noise reduction at any ISO
level by processing the Raw's though
shooting raw still helps for recovering
highlights or shadow detail colors look
relatively accurate the sony doesn't
offer a neutral color option and the
camera renders a nice tonal range the
video has some artifacts notably
aliasing and moire but the low-light
tonal quality looks better than average
and there's less color noise than usual
as well it's not the fastest camera in
its class but it's certainly fast enough
I find the interface feels a little
sluggish though and the LCD is really
hard to see in direct sunlight it tilts
but you really need a flip-out or EVF to
compensate and bright situations
the design of the 5r feels especially
suited to street photography and I like
shooting with it as long as you're
considering it for reasons other than
the app support or wireless capability
it comes highly recommended I'm Lori
groanin and this is the Sony Alpha
nex-5r</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
