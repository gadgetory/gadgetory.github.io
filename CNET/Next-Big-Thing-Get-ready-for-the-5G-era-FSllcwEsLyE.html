imagine have just made the jump to a 4g
phone or maybe you're just about to but
here comes the next thing already the
buzz is on about 5g now first off as you
might imagine 5 G's expected to be
faster much faster but I'm not real
comfortable quoting any speeds right now
because you know how it goes we've been
promised pie in the sky many times with
3G and 4G what the lab speeds are then
we get out in the real world and it's
nowhere near that so yes there are some
theoretical benchmarks out there we can
compare right now but let's let the
speed thing percolate a while the next
constantly hear a lot about is 5g having
lightness so it will be faster able to
handle great big thick content like
streaming 4k high-definition movies but
on the other hand will also be dead
reliable it's expected on very thin
skinny bits of data the kinds of data
streams that little connected home
modules pass back and forth for example
but with absolute robustness in fact
many expected under the 5g era the
biggest growth of connected devices
within it is actually going to be those
things that never really faced a human
machine-to-machine devices the so-called
Internet of Things then there's the
concept of special lanes built within 5
g this has to do with what they call
signaling what gets priority first
because it needs to get there on time
for example the future wireless
connection in a self-driving or
autonomous car he needs a much higher
priority than the video stream
connection coming to your kids iPad in
the backseat of that car so that really
important things that have to get there
on time to allow a service to execute
well will be given priority and other
things that can buffer and no one gets
hurt will actually do that and related
to all that is layered pricing right now
if you think about it you basically pay
the same price for data for a 100k email
attachment as you do for a hundred k
worth of video streaming although that
video streaming is in theory a more
valuable service because it has to
arrive on time to avoid video
degradation and buffering 5 G's expected
to have this kind of layered data within
it and the ability to sell it at
different tiers within a single
connection that could allow carriers to
do a lot of interesting things with
pricing still kind of hard to predict
finally there's a concept of
multi-homing and that means it can
harness all the other available wireless
around it pulling in two and a half g
three
g 4g Wi-Fi Bluetooth and assigning the
tasks to whichever one is available the
most robust and the most efficient
either based on energy use or cost those
are the high points of what I'm hearing
in the 5g discussion it's early right
now but it's trying to get really busy
out there in terms of expectations and
predictions you've got some time to
absorb it though the consensus is that
none of this rolls out commercially
