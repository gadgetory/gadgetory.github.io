for CNET and if you're a fan of compact
cameras with long zoom lenses you're
gonna want to check this out
it's the Nikon Coolpix P 510 and it's
lens goes from an ultra wide-angle 24
millimeters to 1,000 millimeters that's
a 42 X zoom now what can you do with a
lens like that
well you can take pictures of no not
that one
squirrels you can take pictures of
squirrels or ducks or the observation
deck of the Empire State Building from
10 blocks away well you get the point
it's very long lens unfortunately while
the camera shooting performance overall
is very quick when the lens is fully
extended focusing can be very slow and a
couple times while I was shooting video
it wouldn't focus at all that said
pulling the lens back some still gives
you quite the zoom that also lets you
set a starting focal length for when you
start up the camera along with that
tucked in as a bunch of manual controls
for color noise reduction and sharpness
which is great for anyone that likes to
fine-tune the results and you get a lot
of shooting modes for snap shooters as
well as more advanced users full HD in
slow motion video capture all kinds of
great settings other hardware features
include this nice 3-inch LCD a secondary
zoom rocker on the lens barrel and
built-in GPS for geo-tagging photos as
for photo quality it is much improved
from its predecessor the P 500 but still
a little lacking in its higher iso s
so not the best for low-light but still
very good overall but really it's all
about the lens so if you want to be the
one in the room with the longest zoom
you'll want this I'm Josh Goldman and
that's a nikon coolpix p5k</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
