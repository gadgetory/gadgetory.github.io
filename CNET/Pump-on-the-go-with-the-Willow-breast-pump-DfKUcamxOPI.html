a life changer for new moms the willow
is a hands-free wireless breast pump
that is worn inside a bra it eliminates
some of the biggest annoyances of
today's suction pumps which can be noisy
messy and keep you tethered to one spot
with power cords and hoses and I'm well
familiar with the struggles of
breastfeeding and pumping I myself am a
new mom squeezing in pumping sessions
between reporting on CES where willow
has made its debut using a discreet
hands-free pump under my clothes would
be a dream each one of these plastic
teardrop shaped pumps sits inside a
nursing bra over the breast and the milk
is pumped into a doughnut shaped bag
hidden inside the unit a one-way valve
keeps the milk in the bag without it
leaking so when you're ready to take out
the bag you won't spill any of that
liquid gold
say goodbye to bottles dangling from
your bra or needing to lean forward the
willow can be used lying down the app
keeps track of how much milk a mom is
expressing from each breast and each bag
only holds four ounces the pumps going
to automatically stop before it gets too
full not only does the willow let you
walk around but it's also pretty quiet
the creator's say that early test moms
have used them while doing errands like
grocery shopping or commuting on the
train it's also easy to clean with just
two parts to wash that our dishwasher
safe made of bpa-free plastic battery
life will only get you a day or two
before you need to recharge a double
pump set is expected to go for around
four hundred and thirty dollars that's
about twice as much as some of the more
basic models out now the special milk
banks are also going to add up willow is
expected to price its bags at 50 cents a
pop whereas typical bags just cost
pennies and hold more but moms may not
mind dishing out more money considering
that multiple pumping sessions can take
hours out of your day giving moms more
freedom and dignity is a big deal but
we'll have to wait until the spring for
it to arrive and to put it to the test
ourselves</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
