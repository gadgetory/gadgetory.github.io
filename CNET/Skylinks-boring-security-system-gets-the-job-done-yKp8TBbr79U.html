the sky link net alarm system starter
kit this is a 150 dollar kit that you
can purchase to put up sensors around
your home and monitor what's going on
while you're away if something is amiss
if someone comes in and they're not
supposed to the alarm will go off a
siren will sound and you'll be notified
by a smartphone push notification now
the system doesn't offer live monitoring
it's not a system that will call the
police on your behalf like simply say
for ATT if something goes wrong if the
alarm goes off you'll get that
notification and it's up to you to
decide whether or not to call the police
of course that also means that the
system costs a lot less you won't have
to pay any monthly fees and there are no
long-term contracts to sign you just buy
the system and use it as you see fit the
system itself consists of a centralized
hub this thing here to plug that into
your router plug it into power and
that'll be the brains of your system
controlling all the sensors and
monitoring everything it's also got a
110 decibels siren built right in so
this is the thing that's gonna make all
the noise when things go wrong you get
to open closed sensors you put these on
the frame of a door or window and
they'll let you know when that door
window gets open you also get a motion
sensor you can stick this on a table you
can stick it up to the wall whatever you
want
it'll keep track of when people are
coming and going and let you know when
it detects motion finally you get a
keychain remote that'll let you turn the
system on and off right from your keys
as you come and go you can also arm and
disarm the system from the smartphone
app where you'll also find controls for
all the sensors you can dictate exactly
when you want them to notify you if they
give you push notifications only during
an alarm or all the time that's all up
to you that's a nice feature I like that
about this system when I tested the
system out of my apartment it was snappy
and responsive all the notifications
came through as expected they didn't
take long to get to my phone so I liked
that quite a bit for a small apartment
small home I think this could be a good
kid however testing it out in a bigger
space here at the CNET appliances
offices things were a little more
sluggish everything still worked I still
have confidence in the system but it was
slower so maybe not the greatest system
for a larger home you can also add extra
sensors to your system a la carte style
including
some sky links existing hardware which
will turn lamps on and off things like
that it's kind of dated though so I'm
not sure that I would go that route
all in all sky link net does the job
perfectly well doesn't look that great
doing it but it does cost less than
competitors like eye smart alarm and
certainly less than competitors that
charge you a monthly fee so if you want
minimum coverage I think this is a kit
that merits consideration thanks for
watching check out my full review at
cnet.com for seen at appliances I'm Rui
