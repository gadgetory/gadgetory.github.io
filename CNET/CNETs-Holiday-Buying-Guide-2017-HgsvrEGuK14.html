already been scanning for deals all day
ok good so I'm ready for this great
let's do it let's hear it well when it
comes to deals though we have to talk to
Rick ok with our very own deal wizard
coming in on skype from Detroit mr.
cheapskate himself
Rick Broudy hey wow I got I got elevated
from maven to wizard I'll take it yeah

so just go on twitter and and ask us
because we are going to be giving you
special breaking CNET only deals that
you're only gonna find right here on
this broadcast ok so make sure you use
hashtag see that live but first let's
talk about all the hottest holiday gifts
that are out there this season my panel
of gift finders and deal finders what
are the best holiday gifts this season
hmm
televisions they are yes they are really
if you want to make somebody's day 2017
holiday buy them an OLED TV yeah just
because that's what you do that Santa
has in his pack guys that would make by
15 of them you know all the wait list is
so long though maybe he gave me good so
why is it that like TVs have the biggest
I feel like that is the gift to get
right like that's a little substantial
except for like the Lexus in the
driveway but you know that's the TV is a
nice
second place for that right on okay Dan
we're gonna go the opposite direction
not the $1,500 to $2,300 TV I think a
lot of people are getting the
inexpensive smart home devices like the
Google home and the echo and the mini
versions which are both about thirty
dollars I think pretty much throughout
the holiday season and they pair very
well with other inexpensive things like
philips hue smart bulbs they can get a
nice little smart home eco system going
for you know fifty or seventy-five
dollars it's like a baby step into the
smart home world for 30 dollars Trojan
horse of smart home and then you get the
smart bulbs and then you don't remember
what life was like before you were
talking to your lights yeah I feel like
though with all the smart devices they
kind of can't give them away though
right I mean I know everyone's got like
an echo dot or you know the Google home
thing but I feel like right now there's
they're almost at the point where like
they just want them in your home there's
a glut yeah they want to get it in your
house as at the entry point and then
they want to sell you the light bulbs
and the voice shopping and all the other
accessories and the fancier Bluetooth
speakers to connect to them and get you
hooked on that amazon shopping life
right and who is it now I don't know but
Berger what do you say we toss it to
Rick all right Rick what do you get for
us well first of all I want to be on
David's gift list because he's given out
big fancy TVs Dan I can get my own
$30.00 dot thanks thanks for nothing
yeah so you know regular cheapskate
readers know that I'm all about the
drones and one of the great deals that
are going on right now is on the DJI
spark which is kind of one of the big
drone success stories of this year it's
very compact but it has all these super
advanced features it has Follow Me mode
and obstacle avoidance and all this
great stuff it's very portable and
normally up up until now it's been
basically 500 bucks just about
everywhere lots of stores have it on
sale Black Friday and Cyber Monday for
399 but right here we're given an extra
20 bucks 20 bucks off thanks to the
folks at well BOTS all you need to do is
apply promo code Rick 20 that's me all
right CK 20 and you'll knock it down to
379 which is the best price I think I
have seen on the spark ever oh my own
coupon code that's when you know you've
really
the code Bridget it's $10 more
that's excellent so what so you think
right now is like the right time to jump
into to drone life if you want to go
something higher end you know normally
you're talking seven eight nine hundred
a thousand dollars to get something
really fancy this is less than half the
price to do that and this drone I think
will ants will fit the bill for a lot of
people now that being said one of my
favorite products of the year I have it
right here
is the tech boy tibi 802 and this is
just a little indoor drone for fun for
people who are just getting started for
kids or whatever and you control it
using this little puck this little mouse
that you just it's gesture controlled so
you pivot it goes this way and you pivot
back it goes this way it's super easy to
fly it's like 25 30 bucks the best thing
the best thing ever see that that's
where I'll get started on a drone at
least it but like is this or is it rare
to see sales on drones like this or I
mean it's now the time to dive in if you
are on the fence about drone life right
so the spark is rare to see on sale like
I said it's been $500 since it debuted
earlier this year 399 and then 379
that's a great deal I would jump because
it may be a while before we see a price
that low again this little guy that I
was talking about this this tech boy is
very frequently in the anywhere from
twenty to thirty dollar range so if
you're just looking for something as a
gift to give to somebody this this is
awesome I can't recommend it highly
enough I love this little guy okay what
else you get oh my gosh well so I would
be remiss if I didn't we didn't talk
about Amazon let's just do this real
briefly because I think everybody kind
of knows at this point what Amazon has
to offer but but the tablets the tablets
you know you've got the the Fire HD 10
which is currently 99 bucks you've got
the HD 8 which is 50 bucks and then
you've got the fire 7 which is 30 bucks
there's just amazing deals and the HD 10
in particular Dan's got it right here on
the table with us yeah I mean for that
amount of money given that this is a
newer generation model faster processor
high-resolution screen
Bittan Alexa I mean it's just it's
madness that you can get this much
tablet for this little money and
actually target is doing 15% off
site-wide today meaning that in theory
you could get the Fire HD 10 for 85
bucks and I think they're out of stock
but I think you can still order it so it
might be worth and look even Amazon it
looks like is now backordered on this
and I can understand why I mean that's
that's a no-brainer
no I was gonna say like I feel like that
for I mean for me I'm a new I'm a new
parent and that's something you can just
give to a small child and not really get
heartbroken when it inevitably gets
shattered I have a one and a half year
old that's exactly what I do with the
fire seven which is only like 30 bucks
now on sale early somebody ride a it was
like really cheap so that's our airplane
tablet for loading up all those Disney
movies and it's like who cares
it was just like 30 bucks you know and
they have the kids version that comes
with like a rubber bumper and like a
no-questions-asked replacement thing
right but this reviews a couple of
months ago and a hundred fifty bucks it
was really good at 99 bucks it's really
really good especially if you use Amazon
Prime video a lot of Amazon services the
only thing is if you want to use Android
apps that are not in the Amazon App
Store you have to jump through a few
hoops to get to the tradition but you
can do what you can you're basically
hacking your tablet but most of the big
games and apps are in the Amazon App
Store but it's mostly for like reading
books and watching videos and some basic
webs and that's what you do the most
with the fire because I always wonder
like what are people using these for
that's what it is it's basically a
portable you know streaming TV thing
right as opposed to the next step up in
a tablet which is like an iPad which is
at least 300 bucks to get into that
maybe a little bit less during a holiday
time but for a 99 bucks something that's
almost as good not quite as good but in
the same ballpark is that 9.7 inch iPad
yeah it's great
it's have always been on the top of
people's like shopping list when it
comes to our CNET surveys we do a
holiday surveyor and it just came out
today that tablets went down a few
notches especially with millennials it
was like lower than four or something
like that so it's maybe tablets you know
are kind of seeing a time where people
aren't as giddy as maybe other phones
are bigger yeah laptops are smaller the
tablets in the middle of getting
squeezed they're becoming more specialty
items for specific things like
sitting on a plane watching Amazon Prime
videos yeah how's the battery on them
you know the battery is not terrible
watching video is actually a pretty low
stress thing for battery on most
products and you'll get a good amount of
time just doing streaming videos as
opposed to playing games right and at
that price I don't even care if I leave
it on the plane exactly and it's a
reasonable higher grade for the next
passenger right it's a communal tablet
that's supposed to be there someone will
call security and say there's a
mysterious you know electronic things
thanks a lot all right Rick we're gonna
come back to you in our next segment but
for right now I want to jump on Twitter
and see what is happening again please
use the hashtag CNET live and you can
ask us for all types of buying advice
even if it's not tech even if you just
have someone you want to buy a gift for
we're gonna we're gonna help you out hey
I'm just throwing that out there
all right maybe Dan can help us out with
this first a first one from Chris on
Twitter asking I'm looking for a new
laptop ideally 13 inches lightweight an
SSD and under 700 I mean you're not a
miracle man that's millennium one that
everyone's super interested in I do have
one right here that's a little bit more
but I think a really good deal and
that's the current generation surface
pro from Microsoft that's usually $9.99
and they make you buy this keyboard
thing which is really the best part
about it separately for more than a
hundred dollars right now you can get
the base core i5 version of this plus
one of the keyboard things for $8.99 and
they've also got some deals on the
surface laptop if you want to go much
less expensive than that I saw that one
of my favorite Chromebooks the Acer
Chromebook R 13 which is one of the
longest battery life laptops we've
tested it collected at more than 13
hours on our test which is a pretty
tough test is a hundred bucks off at
Costco right now and maybe a few other
places it's usually 389 now it's 289 now
that's a Chromebook but 99% of what you
do I got a facebook usually anyway with
a Chromebook and it's got a touchscreen
and it's got one of those 360 hinges
that's a great deal
yeah does the end that surface that has
an SSD
oh yeah I mean almost any laptop except
for I can't I'd be hard-pressed to think
of a laptop you could buy our now that
does
not have an SSD unless it's one of those
weird just bulky office laptops so last
Christmas I got my mom a Chromebook and
she's the most tech Luddite person and I
was afraid she wouldn't know what she
was doing but immediately she's like you
know going on using using Facebook using
the Internet and everything loves it and
then she busy to me recently she's like
I love this thing I was like yeah I was
like 300 bucks
very difficult to mess up a car but
that's the size that no that's and of
just from personal experience I have
friends who have been really nervous
really intimidated by kind of investing
in that Chrome ecosystem but it's really
not a huge that's really all just in
your facebook and everything else you do
exactly all right really cool let's see
if we can find another question here
I've got something coming in well here's
a here's maybe dan and I we can have a
crack at this coming in from a Gattis
wants to know the best 24-inch monitor
deal just for general computing I feel
like I mean you know I have an acer at
my desk that I really like but I know
they make a lot of sub 24-inch monitors
that you could probably get for under
$200 that really you're gonna do what
you needed to do especially if you're
not worried about latency and stuff like
that yeah they make a lot of good
monitors I think Dell also does a lot of
good monitoring for gaming these days
and they have a ton of various Black
Friday into cyber monday deals on their
site they're even doing cyber monday
door Busters like limited time stuff
like on every hour during the day so you
could find something good there if
you're super you know anxious about
getting just a 24 inch monitor and and
you don't have these prerequisites that
are gonna have you finding like special
ports or special you know specs about
that pretty much any of these sites are
gonna have some kind of discount so you
know you'd really ship it right monitor
totally I mean that makes 4k monitors
yeah boy just go with that sort of you
know brand and you're gonna be well
served with that all right please keep
these questions coming we're here to
help as you can see we have to take a
quick break but when we come back their
play more deals out there we're going to

hey welcome back to the CNET holiday
buyer's guide we are live my name is
Jeff Bakalar here in the CNN New York
studios along with our gang of experts
Bridget Carey Dan afternoon David Katz
Meyer and via Skype from Detroit it's
CNET cheapskate Rick broy d'you like
being called a cheapskate okay well I
should be used to it by now it's been 10
years since I agreed to be called that
in public
you're a brave man we're here gathered
to help you find the best products and
deals this holiday season now if you've
got a specific question specific buying
advice hit us up on Twitter right now
just use the hashtag seen it live and we
will figure out a way to answer your
question I want to know what other deals
rick has yes because he seems to like
have a stockpile of them and I want to
know all about that right so before I go
any further I wanted to mention
something that everybody should be doing
today Cyber Monday and pretty much every
other day of the year on any deals that
you're shopping for is to use a cash
back service you know we talked about
the Amazon stuff if you go through a
site like Ebates or top cashback or be
frugal before you head to Amazon they're
literally offering eight percent
cashback on most of Amazon's stuff right
now so that $100 tablet you're gonna
save another eight bucks just by
purchasing it through a cashback service
so Rick how long does it take to get
that cash
well it's not gonna try it but I was
always thinking like how am i how many
hoops got to jump through know the
number of hoops he jumps her to get it
is next to zero I you literally start
your shopping at that site then click
through to Amazon shop like you normally
would so you don't get the cash back
right away it's usually the payout is
roughly every 90 days but every you shop
you do this all the time a little bit
starts to add up and add up and by the
time you get your payout now you're
looking at 10 20 50 bucks that you would
have not had otherwise it's it's
no-brainer
no strings use it rajat but how many
toolbars on my browser do I have to
install your toolbar
I'm very anti toolbar myself I do use
the Ebates toolbar which is kind of nice
because it pops up immediately to let
you know what kind of cash back offer is
available wherever you happen to be
shopping but if you're anti tool bar you
don't need to use it it's people are
very suspicious of these things and I
get that but I have used them for a
couple years now without incidents of
always getting my money back it's great
I really especially today
because a lot of the percentages are
higher because it's Cyber Monday that's
really good advice appreciate that Rick
we're going to come back to you in just
a little bit I want to pivot over to
David Katz Mayer Dave let's give you the
spotlight for once in your life okay and
I want to talk about how important it is
to pay attention to TV deals
specifically because they're probably
the best products that you should be
buying right now so what is on your
radar for pretty much the best
television deal / home entertainment
going on on this Cyber Monday so we'll
talk about we'll start the high end and
and that's because that's where you know
discounts or sometimes even far between
you think about Black Friday Cyber
Monday you think about you know $79
32-inch TV you're gonna fight somebody
to get what these are you know the deals
that I like are the ones where you can
you can buy them you know any time
obviously and the price is as good as
it's gonna be all year and probably
until next year because that's what the
tini cycle works right now the TVs are
is cheap is there ever gonna be until
basically 2018 Thanksgiving time and
later so the first one is an LG OLED and
if it'll be there's no oo LED technology
is the best picture quality ever tested
spectacular image quality and that all
the old ads basically have the same
picture so you can buy the cheapest ones
kind of st. pictures the most expensive
one so the cheapest one now is the
cheapest has ever been $1500 for a 55
inch and 2300 for a 65 inch and those
are really expensive but you're in
buying a TV great TV you're going to
keep it for a long time you're gonna
watch it you know eight hours a day or
whatever and at the end of the day it's
I think it's worth it at this point to
step up and get that I just want to
sneak in a personal recommendation yeah
I cannot explain to people watching how
freakin amazing this television looks
yeah if you play a lot of video games
myself like Dan and Bridget and Dave I
mean I you sometimes have to peel me
away from it amazing it really there's I
just can't really put it into words what
it's like plan a 4k HDR video game on
one of those bad boys okay that's the
and it makes it makes everything pop
regardless of you know video games
movies you know you're watching we have
a Price is Right
just just special price is right yes
it's so good did Drew Carey amazing but
it's the black levels it's the contrast
is the brightness it's the colors it's
the pure perfect off angle it's
everything comes together it's it's
really the best picture we've ever seen
and so anyway this team is the one to
get and if you have the money if not
save up a little bit but let's say you
don't want to spend you know fifteen
hundred dollars on a television so you
go yes you can get a perfectly decent
LCD based television Vizio is right now
the best bang for the buck they've been
getting great reviews from me for years
the M series is my favorite right now
Editors Choice Television I've seen it
the 50-inch starts at 500 bucks so
that's the cheap as it's been all year
and a great television does 4k does HDR
look spectacular you know it's not gonna
get as good of a picture as OLED yeah
but you're also gonna save a heck of a
lot of money and it looks really really
really good so there's there's a lot of
other TV deals out there I still like
these best for example there's a Roku TV
the TCL Roku TV is even less expensive
than the videos in general there's they
have a 65 inch for 650 for example which
for that sized television with Roku
built in is great great Smart TV and
streaming for that kind of thing and
they make a great secondary television
maybe about that size - you know if you
just want to augment your TVs around a
house you want to get one you know for
another room they're a great choice
because they got that that Roku built-in
with all the streaming apps
yeah the TCL TVs kind of impressed me I
was playing around with one in your lab
yeah that Roku you know sort of
operating system you've you just know
how to use it out of the box and I feel
like a lot of these televisions maybe
they're not the most user-friendly when
it comes to the menu systems and whatnot
but that TCL really kind of blew me away
with like oh this is just a big old Roku
with a screen inside yeah yeah and it's
guy and they puts the inputs right at
the same levels NetFlow
ya know so any it shows you live
previews in it you can name all the
inputs it's just a dead simple operating
system kind of thing again for a parent
or grandparent that wants to get into
streaming and Bowler can save a lot of
money doing this oh this is great I mean
it really so this you know those TVs
that have been great you know again
really simple really inexpensive and
this says you don't to connect another
device to them you got the same remote
doing everything it just makes it so
much easier to use um I want a pivot
real quick into a specific Twitter thing
for you because now that everyone knows
you're here and you're live everyone's
got questions don't worry Dan there's
playing stuff where that came from but
for you specifically and off the top
here and I know you know why this
question I don't know if it's a hundred
percent accurate but this question came
in from Luke and he says hey gang why
isn't Samsung that aggressively in the
OLED market well it's mainly
manufacturing yeah they didn't invest
years ago in building big screen no lies
no I don't know people know this but
Samsung makes more tiny phone size o
LEDs anybody else they dominate the
market with iPhone 10 and everything
else you know but when it comes to large
screens its LG and they're the ones
invest in the factory to create 55inch
65inch it's 77 inch large screen ohlet's
so that's the main reason samsung
decided to make an investment a while
ago and continue their LCD production
for whatever reason and you know now
they're kind of paying the price I mean
they they they still could them maybe
they can make that investment you know
now or a couple years in the future but
they're not going to catch up to LG for
a while right they kind of set the bar
pretty high for quality and price so
that's really kind of tough to see to
navigate right maybe if you're building
new factories takes a while to make
enough TV stick to catch it yeah and
that kind of leads into another few
questions we got if OLED is the kind of
TV you want to buy but LG is too much
money is there any sort of wiggle room
in between of like I know a budget oh
that doesn't exist but what kind of
advice you have for someone who's
looking for something like that I would
definitely say a good local dimming LED
based LCD like that Vizio that I talked
about and at 500 bucks for
you know a 50-inch TV there's a really
really good TCL Roku TV local dimming
one that you're talking about Jeff and
you saw back there in the TV lab yeah
that's 600 bucks at Best Buy great
television I mean the Parrish
warleggan's look let me TVs is really
really good yeah and that's what I'd
recommend and there's a big gap between
those two and there's plenty of high end
LCDs Sony makes a good one
but you know they're they're bang for
the buck I like the T seals and the
Vizio 's and then if you're really going
to splurge the LG ohlet's excellent
buying advice I want to go back into a
few more general questions on Twitter
don't forget please use the hashtag see
that live hey Dan hey yeah this is from
Andrew what's a good laptop that's could
be on sale right now for gaming and
video editing I feel like those two
things kind of go hand-in-hand when
you're talking about graphics cards and
processing power do you have some sort
of maybe mid-level recommendation for
those two things you know it's funny I
actually do have a great really
inexpensive gaming laptop I was going to
show you guys right really new it is
right here I always love it when things
are brand new and they're better than
the previous version and they're on sale
which is happening here with this
Inspiron 15 7000 from Dell so it's not
part of the Alienware line which is
Dale's real gaming line instead this is
their Inspiron line which is usually
pretty boring and great but they make
this cool black and red gaming one it
started last year and it was okay it
gave you a pretty good graphics card in
a video 1050 this year it's got a 1060
which is really what you want if you
want to get into VR sure and just you
know mainstream games at 1920 by 1080
which is full HD resolution so this guy
starts at 999 and for that you get an
Intel Core i5 well today it says eight
that is that is true that is the cyber
monday sale that's going on right now
Nvidia 1060 card I think it's got eight
gigs of RAM it's got a 256 gig SSD which
is not huge for games sure but you know
you download them you delete them you're
redownload of steam or wherever and that
core i5 but the fact that you can get
that Nvidia 10 64 899 now on sale is
pretty fantastic if we've been playing
around and testing this laptop and you
know what it's pretty darn good and it
fixes the main problem with last year's
model which was the screen was not great
this year it's better yeah the greater
screen you've ever seen on anything but
for a regular you know 15 inch 1080
screen it's pretty darn good I mean in
considering that kind of processing
power in this relatively reasonable
package is not it's great you know
usually you think like oh I have this
big hunk and laptop that I got to carry
around for this kind of stuff this is
not unmanageable it's not and we've seen
a lot of super slim gaming laptops like
the zephyrus from Zeus right and a few
other ones but they're very expensive
$2,300 $2,500 and and they're very very
slim and very light but you're paying a
lot for that it's pretty cool it's just
maybe slide this closer to here okay
going down to this break
I think for gaming you are we all
figured out years ago that if you're
going to trade between the CPU and the
GPU invest more in the GPU and I'll get
more gaming bang for your buck and the
core i5 is fine frankly I agree I 7
maybe a little too much you can get this
for a couple hundred bucks more you know
there's a step up and get ones on sale
also but this is that $9.99 now
currently $8.99 base model excellent
alright you can always find cnips
see net seam maps what's that you can

short break up next we're going to talk

just cool there
hey welcome back to the second half of
CNET's
holiday buyer's guide live show my name
is Jeff Bakalar and joining me is
Bridget Carey no Dan Ackerman hey now I
like that and David Katz Meijer oh just
the glory of game against mark and of
course via Skype it's a Rick Broyden hi
guys hey don't don't worry we see you on
the TV we're gonna we're gonna come
right in to you very soon don't worry
Rick stand by we're going to talk about
deals and laptops for the next few
minutes but keep those questions coming
right in again hit us up on twitter
using the hashtag seen it live okay so
Rick ready to come back to you what else
do you have that is pretty cool today
that we need to check out right so
there's two things I want to make
absolutely sure we get to and they're
two of my favorite gadgets really the
first smartwatches
I love smartwatches I don't know why
they're not more popular if for just for
notifications alone to have something on
your wrist that lets you know when
you're getting a call a text message or
whatever is not something I'm willing to
live without anymore
so for Android users in particular this
is also iPhone compatible but for
Android users in particular tech rabbit
has the Verizon where 24 Android where
2.0 SmartWatch on sale for $99.99 but
you can knock another 20 bucks off of
that if you use coupon code TR where 24
so for 80 bucks you're getting a
SmartWatch that was three hundred and
fifty dollars literally as recently as
about six months ago this particular
model was discontinued by Verizon that
was kind of introduced quietly and
decision just continued quietly it's a
pretty high-end model it's you know
doesn't have everything it doesn't have
a heart rate monitor but it's it's got
most of the good bells and whistles and
you know it's it's 80 bucks now and so
you get a dip your toe into the
SmartWatch waters for cheap that's not
too bad for someone who maybe isn't sure
about smartwatches normally they're like
over $300 generally speaking here your
average Apple lots for example yep
you're you're gonna be paying in the up
upwards of $300 or more
so I love stuff like this and I
especially love that this is new and not
even refurbished so we need a Verizon
customer to use it this is by Verizon
but do you mean excellent question not
you do not but actually this watch is
LTE compatible so if you are a Verizon
customer and you do want to use it
without a phone you can do that mm-hmm
alright what else you got first there
Rick the excitement over there is
powerful I don't have a SmartWatch
because I'm already getting so many
dings but you guys but I mean I guess
it's not we want to say it but we kind
of hate smartwatches Rick I know you
know I gotta be the champion here for 80
bucks you can't hate a SmartWatch for
for 350 bucks I get the I get it I get
it so to give it a try
all right I I'm the only person in the
world who has an Android phone so I'm
actually going to take note of of what
you got there for us what's what's next
though alright so next another one of my
favorite products and again you guys are
all gonna roll your eyes I bet is a
digital photo frame though tell us about
this deal from 2011 I never closed my
laptop Wow as gift items go for the
grandparents for you know for the
parents for anybody who likes to look at
photos in a traditional brain format
these things are the best you get a
continuous slideshow of great of all
your friends your family and what's
wonderful about these is that they're
Wi-Fi connected you can hook them up to
your to your Facebook account you can
email photos directly to the frame all
of the hassles that used to be
associated with these products are gone
so Knicks play has their newest model
which is called the iris it's an 8 inch
frame and as you can see in the photos
it's lovely I mean it has this beautiful
silver frame it's really and yeah and
you can get it in a couple other colors
as well so normally 200 bucks they are
running a sale for 30% off but the
cheapskate is here to bump that up to
34% off a little extra sugar for ya so
Tina the code seen at 34 brings that
down to one
$31.99 it's a great gift item we have
one in my house my relatives all have
them now as they love them so stop
rolling your eyes wait we're not I
promise
is it the kind of thing we're like if I
give it to my mom I could just put
photos on there that maybe will surprise
her cuz I could just log in and just
upload anything even though I'm not in
the house so complicated you can
literally email new photos to the frame
and they will just appear as if by magic
and if mom is connected to Facebook or
any number of other services that use
photos new pictures will appear
automatically they just get sucked up by
the frame you can add to it via an app
very easily so it's it's they've become
much easier to use because I remember
you know back in the day when these were
like the hot thing to have I wrote like
the resolution was all janky but you're
saying times have gotten better oh my
gosh yeah and the hassle of adding new
photos to those frames it was it was
obnoxious that's why everybody hates
them but what few people know is that
they have evolved and gotten much better
beautiful screens beautiful frames Wi-Fi
the whole nine yards so I'm really I'm
very fond of the product category if you
know right on I appreciate we're just
having fun with you there yeah I
appreciate that we're gonna come back to
you in just a little bit
mr. Dan Ackerman it is your turn sir and
I have to decide which gift I got for
you to return the Smart Watch or the
digital photo frame what we're gonna do
Dan is we're gonna talk about getting
the best bang for people's buck when it
comes to deals for laptops so we've been
getting a lot into like specific uses
but is there anything else that you've
got for us buying advice in general
maybe speaking that you can lay on the
two things to keep in mind are you see a
lot of these you know super sale deals
especially from Black Friday through
Cyber Monday cyber week where like oh
come to the store get this like fully
featured looking 15 years like yeah like
$200 usually these are not the brands
and parts that you want if you get one
of these super cheap ones even though it
may seem like a good deal you might be
disappointed long term by something that
you're just not going to use a lot and
then you're going to spend
to replace it earlier than you normally
would exactly dad said there are not
often a ton of discount on super super
super high-end laptops especially big
high-end gaming stuff we looked at a mid
price gaming laptop but for super
expensive gaming stuff you may often get
instead of a discount they may throw in
some extras lenka Origin PC there's a
big gaming PC company that we both know
and they have a whole bunch of deals on
their Black Friday / cyber monday pay
with but it hasn't pulled up right there
where you can buy a very expensive
desktop or laptop instead of X number of
dollars off they'll throw in a free 250
gig really fast Samsung SSD is a very
long list of plus more yeah like free
shipping on a big desktop that can count
for a lot or an Amazon gift card fifty
bucks for a bunch of free new games like
Wolfenstein 2 or the new assassin's
creed there's nothing I mean that's you
know you're hundreds of dollars of games
like you add a bunch of these things up
and it's instead of having X dollars off
you pay regular price on super high-end
stuff and you get one hundred extras one
even goes with a $50 Amazon gift cards
like yeah yeah
totally down with that and then at the
at the you know high-end premium non
gamer style you can get some pretty good
new laptops for a decent amount off one
of my favorite new ones actually is this
guy right here this is the the HP
Spectre the 2017 edition which has a
cool new ceramic white look and I
thought this was really a great Lee I
mean look how thin that is that's pretty
how light that is
and that's a core i7 laptop this is a
pretty isn't that nice brand new little
char $12.99 now it's down to eleven
twenty nine term HP so that's that's
like a hundred and eighty dollars off
the usual price on this and then its
sister product The Spectre X X 360 which
means it's got the hinge that folds all
the way back I think we have the special
Rick might have a special deal on that
if I can get my myface ID to let me
invite the spectre x360 I just I just
learned about this it's normally 1249 we
got it right there it's 950 right now
for cyber monday but if you use the code
he's ready for the code CNET hp50
not damn 50 like Rick's code
50 bucks off so it's 899 now and these
are two very impressive you know new
high end laptops pretty damn good I want
to get into some specific questions
about laptop buying from Twitter if
you'll if you'll allow that let's go
okay the question probably that's
dominated a lot of this stuff is like
well where can I get the Apple deal lay
it out there for everybody is getting a
discounted Apple product even a thing
especially on something like cyber
monday it is possible but not as easy as
it is for a lot of other brands we were
talking about Black Friday deals last
week we noted that one of the really
good deals was a Best Buy actually had I
think a hundred bucks off like the Mac
the classic MacBook Air which they still
make even though it's not the most
modern look as you're feeling macbook
and they had some good deals on imax as
well if you go over to Apple site they
occasionally have things in like the
refurbished area of the site that
available at good discounts but I saw
once again today on Best Buy they've got
the 13-inch MacBook Pro the base model
which is $12.99 which is great for a
macbook pro it does not if the kind
without the touch wear with the
traditional function Kiro don't frankly
yeah exactly a lot of people a lot of
people prefer it usually $12.99 Best Buy
has it for 11:49 right now so 150
dollars off for a new MacBook which is a
high demand item that's probably about
as good as you're gonna get new out of
the box not use not reverb not last
year's model right and your student
discount that's back that's about a
student discount yeah just hold on to
that dot edu email address it's the only
life advice yes I'm on Twitter was
asking about like are there any yeah
what other Apple sales are there and and
someone was asking about like well is
there an iPhone sale today at Verizon
because they saw an iPhone se on sale
and should they wait and I don't know if
Rick can chime in on he's ever seen
specific phone sales past cyber monday
but the only other phone sale I saw was
t-mobile has a BOGO with buy one new
iPhone get another free that seemed to
be the big deals this year with a buy
one get one free that sometimes went up
to the iPhone 8 which was actually
pretty impressive and the new Samsung
phones obviously I
Activia second line on those though that
solution is alright we're all gonna get
a family plan together right alright
Rick what do you think about that with
Apple phone discounts right so the thing
I tell people you know with all the hype
with like Black Friday and Cyber Monday
is that for me in my world every day is
Black Friday every day is Cyber Monday
and I want to remind everyone you know
we're just about to pivot into the
holiday shopping so there will be
additional sales if you missed something
today I'm pretty certain you'll see
something similar maybe even a little
better as we get closer to to Hanukkah
and Christmas you know there's no
guarantees but but there are always
always deals I promise yeah there's one
I saw I was just telling these guys in
break there's an Apple product - speak
of the devil that's actually on sale
that's a pretty indirect deal so right
now DirecTV now is offering a deal where
there are live TV streaming service they
replace your cable television so they're
great for court cutters 35 bucks a month
is their base package so you prepay for
months which is 140 bucks you can get a
free Apple TV 4k which is never
discounted that's what a brand-new 4k
streaming box that's 180 bucks so just
do that and set your little calendar
reminder for months in the future and
you get $40 off the Apple TV 4k and you
also can use this DirecTV now service
for you know that for months so that's a
pretty cool deal and again it's it's one
of these things that's kind of a
backdoor deal right you know you can
still get a pretty good discount so
there are ways to find it you just gotta
really be willing to you know that's all
where you go Sabres gonna say what do
you think about streaming services for
gifts I mean if you just wanted like
maybe you know III don't really buy TVs
for people but maybe I can soup up their
TV and make it smarter or they just give
a better experience there's a couple
things there so obviously with the
streaming service you're gonna say hey
mom I'm gonna buy you Netflix for three
months or I'm gonna buy you Netflix for
you know a year whatever it is that that
works out good but the eventual they're
gonna start paying for it themselves or
you know they're gonna have to share it
with whoever one of the things that I
like to say is instead of that just get
them like a Roku or one of these little
streaming devices that's really
inexpensive and and let them experience
for themselves what it's like so
Roku has a deal now
for example on their Express Plus which
is a little thing looks like a streaming
stick but it's not cheaper than heck
it's 22 bucks right now at Walmart and
that thing actually has an analogue
output because that with the red and the
yellow exists except except for you know
your crotchety uncle they refuse to get
rid of that television in the family
room and and all the sudden that TVs
transformed with Netflix and everything
else Roku is also as a deal on their 4k
streaming stick now just $20 off as an
Editors Choice best streaming product
for 50 bucks so and that has everything
for khd are the kind of thing you could
buy now even if you don't have 4k TV and
be set for when you can't afford you
know a you know one of the newer
televisions in new year - excellent all
right make sure you keep an eye on
cnet.com slash
that is Rick's domain that's where you
can stay on top of all the deals that
Rick has spotted we're gonna take one
more break and we'll be back to wrap
things up with some extra goodies in the
world of gaming and a lot more deals
we'll see you then stay here
we'll be past my daddy was always saying
to me if you want things to change get
out there and be the change
if anyone can bridge the gap between
that community in the police it's here
you and they got this together
SWAT Thursdays or stream with libel and
demand you just saved a woman's from
being tortured it's okay
I'd call it a good night's work
you can run but you can't hide

their own wisdom of the crowd
CBS Sundays
hey thanks everyone for sticking around
if you are just joining us we're in the
final block of the scenic buyer's guide
joining me Bridget Carey den Ackerman
David Katz Meijer and through the magic
that is Skype mr. Rick Broyden oh
wave I'm Jeff Bakalar and what we're
gonna do right now is take a few more
questions on Twitter let's get to the
feed again if you have a question please
use the hashtag seen it live so I want
to get into a little bit of gaming stuff
because that is my direct wheelhouse a
lot of the questions coming in are
asking what console should I buy are now
given the the deals that are out there
there's high-end game of game consoles
right now and sort of the ones that have
been around for a few years so I guess
like and Dan and everyone feel free to
chime in I feel like the best console
maybe to get right now is probably the
legacy ones your s yeah or a ps4 it's in
a slimmer model right now I know for a
fact that the ps4 slim which Maria has
asked about here is only two I'm sorry
only $1.99 today on Cyber Monday that is
an insanely good deal in my penthouse
the PlayStation 4 what a lot like 500
bucks it was way more than that yes $400
so you know you're talking about a
massive discount with a gigantic library
of games I really can't stress enough if
this is your first foray into the
current generation of games $200 for a
console with such an amazing library you
really can't go wrong on and 1s is 189
which is the lowest price ever
that's the lowest price everybody and
that thing plays 4k blu-rays you know
just in case you care about that but you
know obviously the games and everything
around there so yeah price are better
never unknown yeah I you know I think
like the Xbox one X and the PlayStation
4 Pro you're not going to get really
much of a deal on right now plus that's
the higher end stuff you you really need
a 4k TV to
take full advantage of what those
consoles have to offer so I think right
now for this season the real sort of
sales the real discount and bargains are
within those legacy consoles but VR Dan
is having this sort of you know how are
you I was just say to people whether
it's the HTC vive or the oculus rift it
was so complicated to put these things
together some of the computers and they
were so extensive I sure it was like
having a boat or like a swimming pool
someone else should have you should have
a friend who has one I don't use it but
you don't have to look through the
trouble of owning it but now I've got
the I've got the PlayStation VR right
here that works with that $1.99
PlayStation 4 also works with the
PlayStation Pro but this is down to I
think $2.99 now in different bundles and
goes up from there if you add the the
camera and the controllers and games and
things like that and then the oculus
rift the thing to kick all this off
right was something like 6 or $600 it
was just a lot of set of dollar signs
plus $200 for controller yes that came
out a little bit later now the whole
thing this thing and the set of
controllers is 350 which is just
unfathomed a dropped into 399 and then
for holiday time 350 and frankly quality
wise it's fantastic it works with fairly
inexpensive computers now like that Dell
Inspiron 99 one we just looked at
anything with a you know Nvidia 1060 or
better and it's just a great experience
and the vibe is discounted too but not
as much now a lot of people asking about
specific games here and there you can
find for newer games at least you can
find roughly 5 to $10 off some of the
biggest releases of the holiday season
like Assassin's Creed origins
Wolfenstein 2 but there really isn't
necessarily and you guys can speak to
this the gigantic sort of sale on the on
the brand-new game that Mark IV that
though on the PC side sure through Steam
and other guys new games whether it's
Wolfenstein or Assassin's Creed definite
discounts going on at least in the past
week right and frankly on the PC side
games get discounted awfully quickly yes
it's almost disturbing how quickly a
brand new game that somebody's put use
of their life into and million tens of
millions of dollars and all this
in four weeks it's 25 760 bucks yeah
it's good for us gamers short-term not
good for making new games in the long
term yeah when I talk to though only
cares about the switch I mean I mean at
least in terms of like parents looking
for their kids or you know just like
interested and everyone's buzzing about
it but that I don't say all right you're
probably not gonna find a Nintendo
switch on sale but I mean it's or even
fun to find a lot of places right yeah
you can actually find one we're before
you couldn't even find it that's right
okay very good
well I mean it is fantastic it's tough
too they're ready to pull the trigger
right I mean I was thinking about it
it's heart right now I'm a commuter and
you know it's like a ride plainest thing
on the on the on the train you know I
just wish talk about Skyrim on that
thing Tyra replayed at least four times
you know but now fifth and obviously the
marketplace Skyrim on PlayStation VR now
I can't have to buy another version of
it right that's the problem but yeah and
obviously Mario I mean like Oh play the
heck out of that game so you know I know
bottom least a good thing is you know
when the switch first came out there
were all these bundles that packed in
junk you really didn't need but now it
seems like you know the stock is
catching up with the demand and if you
do have to get forced into a bundle
maybe you're not you know having to buy
or spend extra dollars you're really
just getting the full price for
everything else as a switch by yes I'll
ask you the expert James best gaming
expert on the planet yeah Lachlan well
they weren't that's fact that of course
so when when can when is the price on
the switch going to go down when is the
first price drop on its own people don't
want them as much anymore that's what
will happen this thing is the hottest
console that they've had since the
original Wii it out sells a lot of the
other consoles it is very high in demand
I don't think that's happening for at
least a year if not more okay yeah so
sorry to bum you out that switch but
guess what cats it's worth it all right
just make sure you get the extra set of
controller so you can do the four
players split-screen on Mario girl we're
just family same room activity yeah you
can think of can I get a deal
hashtag Rick
so it actually has discounts yeah I go
out to Rick Rick if you don't have a
deal on the switch you have to have
something you could help us out before
we have to say goodbye you know just
just use the coupon code Rick I'm
Shirley the universal coupon cash back
so yeah actually let me circle back to
something David mentioned in the last
segment which was about streaming
services Hulu is running a deal right
now you can get the limited commercials
plan for $5.99 per month instead of
$7.99 per month so and that's for your
first year so over the course of that
year you'll save 24 bucks which is
enough to buy that Roku Express plus for
22 bucks there you go that's pretty done
and $2.00 left to spare of course I'm a
$2.00 off to spare you think about that
we did some math nice arithmetic we're
doing everything here on the show Rick
is there anything else you want to close
it out with or you feel bad I think of
gift ideas let's talk about some old
school school streaming and that's the
movie theater right I know that you like
to go to the movies or you know someone
who does I really think the gift of the
year to get for that person is a movie
pass subscription you guys know movie
pass yeah can you explain for people who
might not know right so movie pass costs
10 dollars a month and for that 10
dollars you can go to you can basically
get a movie ticket every single day of
that month so you can literally go to
the movies every single day if there
were actually that many good movies to
see and so but you again it's a
subscription service so it's 10 bucks a
month but you can buy this for someone
for 3 months 6 months 12 months and
you're basically giving them carte
blanche to go to the movies as often as
they like and I just I think it's a I
think it's great I mean it's literally
the price of one movie ticket you know
gets you into the movies 29 more times
in a given month amazing I thought not
every theater was going to participate
in time I thought so they say I think in
excess of like 90% of theaters accepted
and really what you get from movie pass
is just a kind of regular debit card so
a theatre would really have to work hard
not to accept it because it works just
like a debit card does you just you go
you buy your ticket using this thing
they're none the wiser you know there
are a few limitations on what you can
see like you can't go see a 3d movie you
can't go in the fancy D box seats or
anything like that but for the most part
it's a pretty easy experience excellent
all right Rick we've got time for one
last one do you have one you want to
give us before we must say goodbye oh my
gosh I have to say goodbye okay so
phones let's talk about a phone deal so
the hot phone earlier this year was the
Google pixel and if you are not really
hung up on the pixel - you don't mind
going back a generation daily steals has
the original pixel and it's new not
refurbished it's unlocked for 449 for
$49.99 with a coupon code that I'm
hoping will put up somewhere it's cheap
skied pixel with all the vowels taken
out oh wow okay extra ten bucks off an
already good deal
maybe we'll tweet that or something okay
excellent
