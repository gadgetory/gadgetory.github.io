facelift in its relatively young life
but the real remodeling has taken place
under the hood let's drive this 2012
Edge Limited with the little 2 litre
EcoBoost motor and check the tech ok
normally we start these videos inside
the car but the best tech story in this
guy is under the hood because this edge
is a 2.0 liter EcoBoost motor 2 litre
inline-four sitting sidesaddle the kind
of engine you expect to find in a very
small car like a focus or something not
in a two ton crossover SUV what they've
got going on here is Ford's EcoBoost
that's two key technologies it's twin
turbo charging so the turbo charging is
optimized for different parts of the rpm
band and that's an important Achilles
heel to overcome with turbos and
secondly direct injection that means the
gasoline is scored at under really high
pressure right into the cylinder right
by the spark plug that allows the fuel
to be metered precisely you don't waste
any and to be sported in there right at
the moment the detonation wants to
happen so you're not getting any kind of
a sloppy burn this also allows the fuel
to remain cooler relatively when it's in
the cylinder before detonation this is
important when they design engines
because it lets them have a higher
compression ratio the ratio of which the
engine the piston and the cylinder
compressed that air and fuel before it
explodes
by doing that you get more power out of
the gasoline you use but the trick is
you tend to get spark not that
detonation sound that a bad engine has
by having the cooler fuel charge you can
get around that all of this adds up to
240 horsepower 270 foot-pounds of torque
that's a big torque number out of this
little mill it moves this 4000 pound
beast which by the way is about the
heaviest in its class up to 60 in about
eight point eight seconds not bad we'll
see how it is on the road but the key is
the mpg number they get 30 highway out
of this combination that's
psychologically really important when
you're marketing a car 30 is one of
those big numbers 21 City and as we're
gonna see the combined real-world
average it's quite nice let's go inside
first okay I know the first thing on
your mind is does this vehicle have the
upgraded MyFord Touch that'll shut me up
from complaining about how slow
and complicated the other version is the
answer is no so I'm still gonna complain
a little bit this is the outgoing
generation of my Ford touch that is just
too busy and responds too slowly to
touch commands Ford knows they've got a
new version coming I've tested it out on
the Auto Show circuit and it's much
crisper we'll see that in a couple of
months that said you're also gonna
notice here a lot of touch controls this
won't be changing these are the kind of
things that you just put your hand over
no button actually moves they're
capacitive I believe I'm okay with these
I don't need this kind of convenience on
something as simple and positive as
climate control I still like a knob for
temperature and maybe another one for
the fan this just seems needlessly
delicate for something that doesn't need
delicacy it needs positive feedback and
an easy grip so here's this gearbox that
is the only choice on the 2-liter
EcoBoost it's a six-speed automatic
period notice the gate PR nd L kind of
going back 50 years right no paddle
shifters no shiftable section no
shifting rocker on the side this is a
very straightforward automatic
transmission we'll see how it plays out
on the road the key to this engine is
what gear you're in all cars these days
seem to be programmed to seek top gear
all the time it's really infuriating but
that's one of the key ways that get mpg
out of these things as we run them along
at 1,100 rpm when you're cruising on the
freeway sometimes lower with this engine
because it's small displacement and it's
got a spool up to create its power those
top gears can get in the way and make it
feel really leaden until it spools up
changes a gear or two and then off you
go
it's not turbo lag so much as it is mode
lag this transmission is part of the
issue it's a very standard six as we saw
if it had a sport mode or was programmed
a little more aggressively to hop down
to gear this car would get much snappier
but that would probably shave off those
few mpg that separate this guy from the
v6 so it's probably not a point to be
made all in all the car drives well it
does not feel that the engine is
overmatched just needs a little thinking
what I like driving it regardless your
payoff is right there on the MPG display
i got between 23 and 24 mixed real world
driving moving to tons of big tall
square metal around with a two-liter 4
ok let's take this guy and doll it up
seen that style first of all I'm gonna
go with that 2-liter EcoBoost 4 looks
like a pig on paper as we saw it drives
a lot better than that in real life
the MPG boost over the v6 is not night
and day you're not gonna save enough to
buy a house with the matter gas you
don't use but it's an important
threshold that it gets to in real world
and Highway mpg in terms of the cabin
tech I'm gonna go with that 301 a
package to get navigation dual panoramic
roof the keyless the better lights all
that stuff but I'm not gonna do any of
that until let's say early q2 of 2012
when this guy comes out with the new my
Ford touch firmware that is key the
early edition I saw is a whole lot
better and that really makes this car in
terms of a central screen interface</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
