dishwasher back from greatness don't get
me wrong this $600 GE is a very good
dishwasher especially for the price
despite these spoons and it's not a bad
cleaner really yes those spoons are
gross but that's one spot of the
dishwasher after a very stressful test
with the silverware basket position
Keith one of the cool things about this
dishwasher is how many places you can
put the silverware basket and really
wherever you put it or any of the other
dishes you throw in there it's gonna do
a great job of cleaning all of it
especially if you scrape your dishes
we saw some redeposit of spinach and
chili but again we're very stressful
with our tests scrape off the bulk and
it'll do a great job for you and for a
$600 dishwasher is this ge has a lot of
features you can wash bottles on the
bottle wash jets you can wash just the
upper or lower rack one at a time if
you'd like and the countdown timer is
really helpful really almost everything
about this ge matches models that cost
twice as much that's why I recommend it
despite those gross spoons it's a good
cleaner it has a lot of features what
it's missing is that instead of a
stainless steel tub on the inside that
tub is plastic and the controls are on
the front as opposed to hidden on the
upper lip which has become more stylish
if you can live without those two style
based features this bargain dishwasher
will give you a lot of bang for your
buck</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
