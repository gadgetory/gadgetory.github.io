tuning in to the 404 show i'm jeff
bakalar i'm justin you and this is the
show where it's not you to us it's like
breaking up with the varsity captain of
the football team yeah you know even
when you know it's the right thing it's
still still hurts it hurts because you
know a lot of things in life are like
dating the high school football varsity
quarterback yeah well you know it is
it's just like that you know you go the
whole semester you have the great time
of your life but you know come
springtime you're just gonna get your
heart broken right you know what I mean
but then there's hope because you'll
know that you're going to college after
that there's all these new prospects
it's gonna be good there's so much to
look forward to in life is what we have
to say welcome to the 404 show ladies
and gentlemen thank you for tuning in
we've got a plenty of things to talk
about in today's fine program my phone's
not on vibrate everything that's
fantastic and professional on a level I
can't imagine it's Flag Day have is it
lag days really absolutely what is what
is what is like the origin of flag day
you know I don't know what you don't
know what that came from no just all I
know is that you have to buy a flag or
you just like you just know that it is
today yeah jun 14 oh that's that's
completely worthless information um like
I said great story today a lot of
interesting things I want to talk about
leading up the pack I and people are
gonna be shocked cuz we usually don't
talk a lot about Apple okay but I want
to talk about app we don't ever since
Wilson left we really did stop talking
about side from the keynotes yeah aside
from the big news where we're sort of
contractually obligated it feels like I
want to talk about the latest macbook
pro and why you should definitely if you
are considering buying one you should
max out that Ram right away it offers up
to 16 gigs of ram buy it because guess
what you are not upgrading it yourself
ladies and gentlemen the new macbook pro
with retina display is arguably the
least accessible and repairable product
ever conceived by man right the free
King Ram is soldered in like with a
soldering iron like metal will uh you
know wheeled into other metal and
there's no available memory slots no
dams for no there's no empty dims where
you can just pop in New dims and I
thought the dims are the chips
themselves Dems are the gyms in the tent
okay anyways you can't upgrade to SSD
either you can't upgrade the hard drive
as well okay because it's like this
proprietary Frankensteinian creation
that only fits in this macbook pro with
the retina display uh fix it iFixit org
is an awesome sight that basically tears
down every new product that comes out
they give each product a repair score so
on a scale of 1 to 10 10 being the most
reparable is that the right word yes
terrible rebel repairable yeah the new
macbook pro got a one out of 10 meaning
it's you'll need the freaking jaws of
life to open this thing up they could
barely they could barely get the
batteries out of this thing yeah it's
insane how lockdown it speaking of the
battery there's all these weird
trapdoors knew that I think Apple
probably did you try this booby traps in
case you want to take the battery out
its shoes out envenomated has it hot oil
slick there it's scary man it's glued as
opposed to screwed into the case like it
was before you just take it out with a
screwdriver but now it's glued so when
you pull that up you are sort of at risk
of uh of breaking the trackpad cable
that's attached to it right I mean any
they do that you screwed you're screwed
even Indiana Jones would have a hard
time making his way in ennis think it's
tough it's not meant to be opened up the
the Wizards over at iFixit did it but
again like I said they couldn't get out
the batteries arm you know so i guess
its food for thought you know the big
story for someone like us yeah like in
our industry that you know I've always
been up for upgrading my like Ram I do
that every two years I had a couple more
games right sure but do you think that
the majority of Apple customers will
care about this arm I mean the average
lifespan for a laptop these days is what
like three four years if that's the case
I'm due for a new one yeah I've had my
macbook now for almost four years arm I
think upgrading the ram was the reason
I've had it for four years and you're
right it's a big thing um you know and
it's not talked a lot about and reviews
either which kind of pisses me off right
this is a big component you're spending
2,200 bucks at the minimum right you
gotta know the down the line I mean you
know the way things work so my macbook /
I need to put knew I needed to double
the ram I went from two to four and that
was in 24 months I wish I had done a
little bit more research before this to
actually compare the prices of the
memory that they sell as an upgrade as
opposed to you whatever you can get off
of like new way right now because I
remember in the past it was always way
more expensive to get it Oh throughout
first oh yeah I mean though you knew
that you could replace Italy although I
was looking at the store yesterday only
cost you two hundred bucks double the
RAM from eight to sixteen spending
twenty two hundred bucks pay the extra
two hundred dollars and double your
frickin ram you're gonna need it you are
SSD i'm not sure what do you know what
the price increase is a lot i think it's
a lot i don't know it's like 400 bucks
or something despite a bunch of USB keys
or you better yet I mean I don't know
man the more and more I'm thinking about
this computer it's awesome but it's it's
just too much of an investment yeah we
did have a caller chime in about um you
know we shouldn't be complaining about
the price but we'll get to that later on
when we do voicemails but um you know I
don't know it's it's tough it's a tough
justification I'll tell you that yeah
just think about your future before you
buy it yeah man you know think about it
before you dive right in it's a big it's
a big deal one of our favorite websites
reddit is going through a little
controversy of its own just recently the
website which is completely fueled by
community just announced that they are
banning a few high quality domains or
reasons that they call cheating
basically gaming the reddit system to
maybe have their articles appear on the
website unfairly and these ink just like
little rinky dinky Bob Joe's website
this is businessweek com this is phys
org this is sciencedaily com and the
Atlantic com so that's what's listed in
the in the in the subreddit ban
domains on reddit uh really big news and
interestingly enough in you know the
sort of um fashion of reddit this story
made its way to the front page with the
title WTF common reddit right so it's an
interesting thing I mean it's sort of um
to me it's like all right this is kinda
I don't know if it's the first strike
it's a foul ball you know it's like we
sort of knew this was coming one Conde
Nast bought read it though right I mean
they're huge corporation they own
multiple publications it makes sense
that they would want to eliminate the
competition from this website I yeah
yeah but they're not being eliminated
for reasons of competition to being they
eliminated for reasons of what they're
calling cheating Ryan ways to sort of
circumvent and gain the system to have
an unfair advantage compared to all the
other websites in the world yes in the
back story at least on the Atlantic I
remember there was a story about this
guy Jared Keller I think okay anyway in
in the past he was an editor at the
Atlantic and he was found out on the
website that he was posting his own
articles as well as a bunch of other
articles from things like the Atlantic
wire and all their other offshoot
websites should we call that's the whole
death oh yeah you shouldn't be allowed
to post your own articles no it is
explicitly stated in the rules of reddit
I wish I'd brought the page up here but
I may have broken the rules yeah it says
so if I write an argon I can't promote
my own stuff well here I'll read you
this exact rule says it's not strictly
forbidden to submit a link that you will
benefit from yourself okay or to a site
that you own okay it's not forbidden I
don't seen it some but you should
consider yourself on thin ice if you're
doing it a lot because then they'll
think that you're trying to gain wide
only done it 100 thousand times yeah I
mean I think if the the cardinal rule
for reddit is you should be reading more
than your posting if you do the opposite
then you're definitely trying to astro
turf and i think that's what the trendy
right or which sort of makes sense yeah
um no I thought uh I thought you meant
you can't do that all I think you got
strapped all things I've done it like
twice yeah so this guy Jared Keller
would they found that he was posting
Atlanta clinks at least four or five
times a day that's bad and uh you know
that's obviously profiteering off read
it because he doesn't even know how to
get around
I don't have a buddy who who was
contracted to tell me too I mean social
media managers really need to be better
about ya hiding their tracks do a
salesman and chairman goes imagine if
Twitter did this what these imagine of
Twitter prevented people from you self
promoting kidding that's what was for
all the accounts are shut down you're
over yeah be over for them but that was
John he created a pseudonym for his
reddit account that was the same as his
OkCupid profile handle and that's how
the redditors what is wrong I came to
seek some people think like the internet
is not connected like all no one will
ever draw the connection between my
okcupid profile my reddit profile right
wrong google search a simple google
search will render those results do you
think there's even such a thing as like
okay so read it supposed to be like the
democratization of links right and for
the most part whatever is cool should be
on reddit yeah like autonomously sure i
don't know if that's even possible
anymore i mean there's always gonna be
self-promoters that they can on the side
people that create multiple handles
we've seen that in the past hmm right
like I don't know if you getting scared
I'm getting scared i think it's the
beginning of the end for reddit you know
gotta be a new one that has to come out
smell it on you we're scared i'm scared
you're scared for ready to create my own
reddit you should um yeah you're right
and we said this this basically I knew I
don't know what I don't know if there
was an exact moment when you knew like
this might happen what happened to dig
might happen to read it um you know
wasn't like a redesign read it hasn't
really changed the way the sides look in
a very long time for the most part but
yeah man I don't know it's it's a little
upsetting to think about it's really up
to the you know I respect writer for
doing this but I think it's also up to
the community yeah right the committee
is so huge now that break ourselves can
police it yeah so I don't know I it's
good that they're actually doing
something if you love something set it
free yeah that's what you have to do
with reddit poor reddit poor reddit
alright champagne problems burrito bot
this is this is something so awesome and
you know 3d printers are all the rage
these days ja they really are kind of
silly where we have one in the office
it's kind of well they haven't yet
produced anything that you can take
off your desk and actually use I just
don't like a doorstop or colleague of
senior editor rich brown has won his
office anything prints out these little
trinkets but there is nothing abuse
there more or less paper weights yeah
but that's what he that's those are the
things that he is choosing to to print
out if you forgot a supermodel you still
a lot of cool stuff like i'ma brian Tong
walked in a pair of heels that he had
printed out yeah 3d real practical
pragna not for you but for Brian oh they
weren't he told he said it just wasn't
his style yeah yeah they but at the end
of the day like they're it's all plastic
and it's this and it doesn't just print
out like a USB key like this it prints
out this weird vinyl II sort of thing
yeah and they're like layers of last you
could still see the sinews inside of
them yeah like it's some time yet
refined it's not refined I mean you know
there there's something still very
archaic about it I know we are inventing
something like nothing Airy first a
particle replicators right you want like
a Star Trek I want to do right now wait
man I can wait um you know what I've
been waiting for it is it decent burrito
to be made in New York shut the hell up
there's at least two or three there are
not around he's back peddle good burrito
no no okay well guess what not enough
Mexicans my new breed place is gonna
kick the crap out of anybody's day
really you haven't had one dude nope
yeah I research arable have you how many
have you had since you've been here
probably like three all right well
that's just the same add another but
these are at spots where people say like
oh they're like what what is here I
don't know I don't forget the names I
don't know I don't know your mind just
goes blank into my burrito no no no the
thing is the criteria for a California
style burrito is very specific right
like you have to have the right avocado
to make the guacamole you have to wrap
it up in a proper foil right not just
any fall has to be easily terrible foil
so that you can do like the rotator you
know what I've noticed about LA and you
have to like grill the tortilla after
its packed yeah you know like I get it
all right well can you freeze dry one
from SF and send it
my way I want someone else to do that
for me put some dry ice in it I would
love that I did I haven't had it you're
right i will admit it's maybe not what
New York is known for its like how you
feel about california pizza right just
miserable yeah it's terrible yeah all
right fine you know what though I'll be
honest what's that I'd rather have a
good burrito than good pizza and that
sucks for me having wait you right you
would rather have a good burrito oh
really might be hope for us California
have no we are not going the left coast
has no room well you hate LA but you
might like Sanford I think you would
like 70 I've been to asset I like the
town it's a cool town because it's not
Los Angeles mm-hmm but no I is it worth
going across the country for a burrito
there's a lot of interesting laws in
California that I think you mad I'm sure
there are chicho sure sure there are
let's get back to the dresser before we
get in trouble at hand the burrito bot
is the thesis project of an NYU student
named Marco Manriquez right and he goes
to the nyu tisch school of technology
and communication cools his thesis
project and so in the past we know that
3d printers they sort of output objects
right this is kind of the first step on
the way to printing a full burrito at
once but right now it's basically just a
MakerBot 3d printer and I'll screw
through some the photos won't it
probably already makes a superior
burrito then was still finding new
things like people were expecting at
least I was when I read this story that
it was gonna like print out like like a
whole burrito you know like line by line
with the ingredients already in sauk how
they rebuilt the fifth element yeah
that's what I wanted and eventually I
think we're gonna be able to do that
because you can actually instead of the
plastic you normally yeah 3d pretty you
can put ingredients and right but this
is basically just a 3d printer at this
guy used to put the sauce inside and so
as a nozzle inside this MakerBot 3d
printer home that has different kinds of
condiments right so you've got like um
you know your sour cream right salsa
meat cheese yeah and you can so bad I
want a chicken burrito so bad right now
good you know so you can actually go on
uses iphone what's like iphone app yeah
and you can specify exactly how much of
each ingredient you want and then they
make or bot will print you out yeah yeah
burrito but you know this still has to
be manual labor and putting down the
tortilla you gotta wrap it up right
there's no I've seen I mean I grab a
burrito sure how do you how do you do
that right to pause it's impossible I um
you know look at the end of the day
burritos okay maybe you've won that
maybe you've won that but i'll put i'll
put a new york burger up against
anything from SF okay I'll do that I'll
do that okay i'll put up the pizza as
well peach is a big deal yeah i'll put
up a freakin big bagel I'll put up i'll
put up the crappiest bagel you ever had
in New York up against the best SF bagel
okay that bagel literally start crying
in the presence of in your bagel little
bagel his little bagel tears in San
Francisco what do we at what else do we
have in San Francisco that you can't get
out yeah a couple things yeah okay how
goes taco no matter of Mexican yeah any
Mexican yeah okay great tacos yeah we
went over the chalupa nachos not know
you know all that's I'm sorry nostrils
or nachos I would put the produce in
California up against anything you bring
me in here and that's again huge catoms
back to the jersey tomato you trying to
be thrown that is the best fruit
available at jersey tomato a fruit oh
that's right yeah up against New Year's
what do we got stockton asparagus we
have the gilroy garlic that's huge I
mean it doesn't matter cuz I'm just
frying it in tempura flakes anyway yeah
whatever you're gonna give me I just eat
that up Italian take all my vegetables
um all right let's see what else we got
going on today I was really upset to
find this out I don't know if you guys
use meebo you know meebo is yeah me I
use
you will messenger meebo messenger is a
web-based instant messenger client right
you can hook into your gchat your aim
your Yahoo's and whatever else there is
google bought them a few months ago did
you know that and as a result meebo is
discontinuing the meebo messenger
product starting july eleventh right
what the eff meebo how am I supposed to
contact like what am I gonna do now yeah
use Trillium or adium trillion trillion
I'm sorry trillion and addy I don't want
an app though I want a web-based thing
okay because it meebo basically lets you
sign on using any computer and have
access to those buddy exactly you know
g-chat does that as well you can sign in
to your aim accounts she and your
facebook accounts really gchat yeah it
does it but in it does a good job of it
too does it okay I i prefer are having
in the browser too because you can put
the windows and you want words with
gchat you have to have like you know
that corner browser what i don't like is
that me bows like yeah we're not
offering this anymore and then they have
no means of a substitution they're not
they're just like all right your your
crap out of luck right you know sorry
yeah well I know but gchats like the low
so Googlebot nebo Google boys on these i
guess but doesn't even say here on their
little we're sorry page you know I wish
it would be like it's just like hey
we're deleting your account to you a
whole it doesn't even say like thanks
for all the years of loyalty you know
who's really freaking out about this
librarians even know the librarian is
yeah someone who uh soon you're not
gonna Madsen in a library library it's
in a bunch of book no librarians have
apparently been using not me by
messenger but meebo also makes something
called the widget it's called me Bo me
right in it basically and no one really
uses widgets yeah except for when you're
on a public computer because then they
lock down all the browsers right so
librarians really really love me Bo me
because it allows them to answer virtual
questions through their reference
library on that toolbar yeah with me Bo
taking that out ever I looked into it a
lot of librarians are freaking out
trying to find another
client cuz yahoo does it but me both
special cuz it lets you log into
multiple account yeah as you know
librarians didn't have it bad enough I
know give the librarian some slack now
you're gonna take away their only saving
grace yeah what are they gonna take away
next I don't know the Dewey Decimal
System yeah horn-rimmed glasses poor
library poor library are they so hot tub
I hensel skirts they are they got that
like Tina Fey thing gonna love it uh do
you know what uh alright so you remember
y2k obviously one of the funniest times
in American history was it funny just
funny because everyone's freaking out
was funny Oh Newsweek put out an article
I know we talked about it recently
planes will fall out of the sky yeah
come viruses held under computer lock
will just be entered into the atmosphere
but you packed a go-bag come on be
honest I had some duct tape yeah um none
of that happened literally none of that
happened but there's a new problem
coming down the pike it's called the
year 2030 a problem and it involves
programs that are written in the C
programming language now there's a lot
of nerdy sort of stuff I don't want to
get too technical because to be quite
honest I don't even understand a lot of
it at the end of the day the C
programming language is such that the
maximum value of time before these
programs written in that code can roll
over to a negative and invalid value
yeah okay translates to the date january
nineteen twenty thirty eight on this
date NEC programs that use the standard
time library will start to have problems
with date calculations you really should
have written read this in like a nerd
voice yeah yeah yeah anyway what that
means it's just it there's going to be
problems because and there's going to be
and if it's funny because this article
says that it's going to be basically
easier to fix than the y2k problem that
they've experienced on mainframes but uh
there are possibilities that there will
be some sort of confusion in IT managers
don't know about this problem right and
they came so looking at my old watch
well they've got a little bit of time
yeah
you know a little bit of time something
like 26 years so I but starts letting
your social planning or now as if yeah
so who even knows that programs will
still be in C program so what programs
like are there like nuclear facilities
that runoff see programs like what are
we at risk of losing here if the IT
managers don't EZ Pass let's say Patrick
no I have no idea I have no idea what
built on it but it's an interesting sort
of issue yeah the next problem will be
the year 21 16 okay so we're all in a
lot of trouble finally before we hit the
brake an Australian company has
introduced the world's first tax on
Microsoft's Internet Explorer 7 yeah get
this when you go to the Australian
online retailer kogan not to be confused
with bogan yeah right up and you check
out using an IE 7 browser you get this
message this is awesome it appears you
or your system administrator has been in
a coma for over five years and you are
still using ie7 to help make the
internet a better place you will be
charged a six point eight percent tax
all your purchase from kogan dot-com
right this is necessary due to the
amount of time required to make web
pages appear correctly in ie7 yeah not
bad pretty funny thing is six point
eight percent taxes by computers like a
thousand dollars well you're obviously
not going to check out you're gonna go
and download something else right or go
to a different website it's just a it's
a funny statement yet they better offer
compassion crushing prices if they're
gonna expect people to pay this I guess
so it's a joke Justin I don't think I
mean uh no not read no it's not a joke I
know it's not a joke but what idiot is
gonna go through with the checkout
process I don't know some people I would
be shocked uh I eat n is actually about
to come out yeah has nothing that's like
you know four versions later and so uh
just an interesting story we thought
we'd share with you guys on this
Thursday what is this red Oh in the r is
that what are we looking at oh also they
have like a
that is opera Orioles correct as an
opera Belle browser logo do you force
the Internet yeah I never use dropper
before opera is ok i use chrome and
firefox ok anyway we will take a break
when we come back video voicemails calls
from the public a lot more fun stay
tuned the 44 returns right after this

jump from elkhart a i was listening to
show where you were talking about chips
and you pretty much talk about food all
episode so I have a question for you do
as an amateur brewer I'm always up to
taking on new challenges and new ideas
yeah what are your two guys favorite
fruits and if you have a favorite style
of beer I'll take that too because i
think i'm gonna make a little pearl for
beer all right let the show how sick
would that be
you don't like beer though yeah I'm not
a big drinker so whatever you guys want
i guess i'll defer i'm a i'm a big like
belgian beer dude or like a hefeweizen I
can do have fun wasn't it what about you
I'm actually not a big big beard you're
neither but I like red stripe Jamaican I
love red stripe right drives my go-to if
it's like you know some of my regulars
aren't there I never I'll never i hate
settling for like the standard like for
ya like I'll never just be like yeah let
me get whatever those are yes I feel
like we've occasionally sponsored by
yeah yeah do you drink beer Richard how
much no I'm not much room now so I'm bud
light lime have you had that before no
no you look at heavily I haven't had it
well it's very delicious yeah yeah it's
good you don't drink beer though so you
can't really appreciate exotic jayveer
ginger beer yeah ginger beers I don't
know you mean like like ginger ale no
it's different like root beer or ginger
yeah it's a group is it so deliver yet
Saudi hey um yeah I am a huge fan of
this local brewery in New Jersey called
River horse me make a ba would say
riverhorse whore ok yeah honestly by the
river yeah it's just like that's just a
bunch of girls on a boat yeah toast to
river hole all right uh so yeah I so do
what you will man I would love to see
the label for that yeah yeah just make
it like more than six percent alcohol no
that's that's a good beer um let's go to
the next one bad headphones hey far for
this is Boston from TK i was listening
to tuesday's episode when you were
talking about the announcement from
apple and the prices of the new laptops
and what part of pro and macbook pro
wasn't clear it's a professional-grade
machine for professional and they can
tax deduct the cost and do other things
that will make them make money off it so
the same way that you don't complain
when people buy
a six-burner viking range for their
kitchen or a truck if they're not a
contractor then don't complain when
people buy a macbook pro when they don't
need one you know guys first of all I
was about has no that's fine second of
all got yeah I complain all the time
when people buy over the top kitchen
sets yeah okay all the time you don't
shut up about I don't shut up about I go
into someone's new house and they have
that huge Viking yeah and still a I'm
like what is this yeah are you gonna
host a party in here you know when
people wear baseball hats and don't play
baseball my phony right can't do that oh
I got was scary definitely although he's
not wrong he is not wrong as mad though
is not wrong but he's not a hundred
right either the thing is is that you
just you can't say that because Apple is
not marketing it just to professionals
if they were we wouldn't hear about it
um so that's that's fine I mean it's too
much money so that's that's that's the
main point so much money de la pro and
macbook pro doesn't mean that because
I'm an amateur artist I mean I can't own
one and I mean yeah I can't you know
it's it's it's almost as much as my
mortgage it's i mean that's it's so much
money dude especially if you're gonna
have to upgrade it again in a couple
years because oh you're not gonna be
upgraded that's the whole thing a
professional should be allowed to
upgrade their own computer I agree
should they not yeah get one of the
older Mick box let's just skip to the
last voicemail here today more about
bacon because I want to finish on a
tasty note hey guys love your shadow
listening to your bacon talk this

that is and how the process that they

do that and how do they also get it like
multicolored to you know it's like it's

fat and big there's a lot yeah it's so
freaking good you know what though I
liked leaner bacon though you know I
mean Canadian bacon within that just ham
