for cnet.com and give you a quick video
tour of the Bose Soundlink mini the
company's new ultra compact wireless
bluetooth speaker that retails for one
hundred and ninety-nine ninety-nine the
first thing you'll notice about the
speaker is that it's got a slick design
and almost looks like it was built by
apple with a unibody aluminum enclosure
that surrounds two small drivers in
front and rear passive radiators a 1.5
pounds of mini isn't as diminutive as
some of the tiny Bluetooth speakers now
on the market but it's metal housing
gives it considerably more substance
than most of its plastic competitors and
if nothing else this thing feels like
something that's worth two hundred
dollars the mini is designed to be very
simple to use with clearly labeled
buttons on the top like all Bluetooth
speakers it will stream audio wirelessly
from virtually any smartphone or tablet
plus any Bluetooth enabled PC or audio
player the speaker remembers up to six
devices so you only need to sync once I
like that the unit comes with a desktop
charging cradle you can also plug the
included AC adapter directly into the
unit so you don't have to take the
cradle with you when you travel however
it does not charge via USB so you do
need the AC adapter as for battery life
bose claims seven hours of playtime and
a three hour recharge time while the
cradle is a nice extra everything else
will cost you bose is selling protective
bumper sleeves for a whopping twenty
five dollars each and a carrying case
will set you back forty five dollars in
terms of connectivity there's an
auxilary input on the side for non-blue
two devices as well as a micro USB port
on the back for potential firmware
upgrades I really like the whole look
and feel of the speaker but like boses
step-up sound like bluetooth mobile
speaker - there's no integrated
speakerphone which is too bad how does
it sound
well while it just can't deliver the
performance of a larger speaker for what
it is and its tiny size it sounds very
good the one thing I noticed about it
more than some other speakers is that
placement makes a big difference
putting it closer to a wall definitely
improves bass response and the speaker
sounds fuller it also plays pretty loud
louder than the job
jambox for instance but it's clear that
boses engineers had to keep the sound a
little restraint in order to avoid
distortion at higher volumes overall the
sound signatures somewhat laid-back and
forgiving so it's got a bit creamier
sound the bass goes pretty deep but it
doesn't sound incredibly tight or punchy
all in all however you come away with a
sense that bose eked out about as much
as it could from such a tiny speaker the
mini is the better choice over such
products as the beats pill which
currently retails for around the same
price but the $200 UE boom has a bit
bigger sound better battery life a
built-in speakerphone is water-resistant
and better suited for outdoor use the
Soundlink mini is really targeted
someone who's looking for a very sleek
wireless speaker that sounds very good
for its tiny size and can be easily
moved from room to room but will
probably end up docked at the end of the
day in a bedroom or Home Office
perhaps parked next to an iMac or
MacBook Air David Carr Noi
and that's the bose sound like many
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
