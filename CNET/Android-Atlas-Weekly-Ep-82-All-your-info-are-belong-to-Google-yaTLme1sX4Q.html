made three billion dollars last year and
what to expect at Mobile World Congress
all that more on this week's edition of
welcome I am Justin Eckhouse long side
Anton Goodwin hey how's it goin and
special guest hey Mark V V hi I'm jmar
how's it go meet you all thanks you've
been on here before second second pair
from the show right you probably spent
on other shows too right um tap that up
on that all right now show you may hear
know him from such shows as as tap that
up and i was on here once before and got
that app you you a bunch of other stuff
for also template at the office you
clean the bathroom i clean the bathrooms
I have my own broom don't touch it I'm a
cube awesome alright well we are going
to jump into the show and talk about
Google's new privacy policy which is
sort of hot off the presses so forgives
it forgive us if it seems like we don't
know what we're talking about more than
usual but you know Google there's gonna
be a lot of talk this week I think on
scene that live shows about Google's new
privacy policy we're going to focus on
the Android part of it the deal the
basic gist is that they have I don't
know what this said like 70 different
privacy policies for all their different
services right now and what they're
trying to do is combine them into one
simplified human readable privacy policy
which you know when you present it like
that I think is a good thing because
normally privacy policy policies I think
all of us just sort of breeze by because
it's you know long-winded and you know
you couldn't understand it even if he
tried so they want to get rid of the
legalese and make it short and simple
and what we want to cover here is a
couple things this there was sort of a
quick analysis done by IT world of how
this affects Android and there's sort of
four major areas the first is device
information
google says it's going to collect your
hardware model your operating system
unique Device Identifier mobile network
information including phone numbers and
associated identifiers with your google
account to me that that first part seems
not too scary do you guys have any
objections that part I'm surprised
they're not already keeping it yeah may
well I think they may be are this is
just accounted for now in the universal
policy instead of the Android specific
one all right so it's true than some of
this may not be new it just is maybe
getting more press than it has before
because it was so buried and maybe now
it's a little easier to read exactly how
we understand we live in a post carrier
IQ world where everyone's kind of
already got their ears perked it like
privacy my information is being tracked
by who exactly yes so the second part
here is actually what I think will perk
up my ears and probably will for you as
well Google may save in its server logs
your phone number the number you are
calling 40 numbers times and dates of
calls and SMS routing information it's
not entirely clear so this to me is a
little scary but it's not entirely clear
if this applies to any calls you make or
only cause you make through for example
google voice or gmail and google+ you
know the latter makes sense they're
already doing this obviously you know if
you go into google voice it shows
records of your law you log calls and I
know Antoine you use Google ways for
everything so maybe is this scary to you
at all um it I mean it's not to me
because I don't really care about
everything too high I don't really care
I make like eight phone calls a year
nothing to hide well we'll see about
that she doing I had to do some digging
can you post your call logs in a blog
post please today yeah sure but no it's
like it doesn't really scare me a
particular but I'm not particularly the
privacy of verse so it doesn't really
i'm not really usually scared about this
sort of thing but for some people it is
and i mean it definitely is something
that I think a lot of people should keep
an eye on or you know if they have an
opinion on they should you know make
known because I mean yeah like logging
your phone calls is is creepy but I mean
let's be honest that think your carriers
do it already right I think even going
back to a landline I mean if you're
still carry on a landline carrier means
somebody's keeping a record of phone
calls that you make i fighting already
offering every police pretty exactly
that's what I'm saying anything from our
cell phone records TV yeah they know the
phone calls me when you made them where
you were when you made them CSI seen it
what you were wearing yep most likely
GPS coordinates just watching me of the
state so my main concern would be if
they're tracking it for non google voice
type of calls like if I just make a
regular phone call on my cell phone and
then they track that I guess maybe you
can make the argument they're tracking
it because they want to preserve your
call logs that you have on your phone so
if you lose your phone and you want
those logs back that you could get them
but the questions are like what do they
do with that information how do they
protect protect it isn't made available
for advertisers I mean I want to know
more information is what I want to know
like if it's only for my own use that's
one thing but if it's made available to
others if any Google employee who just
feels like you can just get in there see
who I'm call it gets a little weird
maybe we have to lean on the fact that
Google's motto is don't be evil I think
Google has been a little kinky in the
hold not being double know especially of
late lately their search results stuff
but shabnam that's another show so
location information google user device
gps Wi-Fi signals nearby and self felt
tower triangulation figure out where you
are on serve up location focused search
results and ads I don't have a big
problem with that i like more relevant
ads because they're actually interesting
ads then if they're saving this and
using it for other purposes or doing the
carrier IQ kind of like long history of
where you have been then i get a little
scared I know you check into foursquare
everywhere you go so maybe
about this nope yeah turn that off all
right I stopped chicken foursquare
months ago it's just too much mostly
it's because it's just too much to do
play I get somewhere and I've gotta like
I just have it auto tweet where I go and
then check ins just I just picked social
networking stuck with it yeah for sport
was not the one but it's not because of
privacy issues I mean but you're just
lazy well I mean it's life had the
reason I stopped chicken into four
squares because I'm lazy but I mean I
wasn't like afraid of people knowing
where I was uh I don't think anybody
cares to be honest yeah I care know
people care the only person who cared
was like the girl I was competing for
from mayorship of my favorite chicken
wings by zagg ruins our or I wouldn't do
you know I don't know our complete
stranger we're like we both go to the
same buffalo wing place in a while like
getting the mayor hood back and forth
and then like I was frustrated cuz I
never saw her there and I'm just like
how are you getting the mayorship and
I'm here every day I never see you if
she manages the place that's out no she
just lives above like above the place
she just checks in from her morning
upstairs I don't think that she's gaming
the system but then like she foursquare
friended me and I thought she was going
to confront me about it and then nothing
ever came of I think she just want to
see my pic you never said like let's
meet up the chicken wings yeah that have
been weird I think I think a little
weird uh are we talking about we're
talking about privacy and now we're
moving on to google wallet privacy so
the one piece that is not cover it in
there one page which is actually not one
page if you look at it privacy policy is
google wallet it has its own privacy
writer which is far too complex for me
to dive into right now but we'll get our
crack team on that and analyze it but
google wallet and d in general when
you're dealing with your money seems a
little like involved and may require
more stuff yeah i mean it would have to
be i think it would we have to have to
be separate i think it would be a bigger
issue if we were wallet were lumped in
just because you know the overarching
one pager is basically like we're just
going to track everything you do and log
all your stuff when you start talking
about Google Wallet you know if you
start using overarching
which like that then somebody's going to
jump to the conclusion of just like your
log in my bank accounts right accounts
with any company that I do business with
and I think it's in their best interest
and to keep it separate and there's a
lot of laws regarding financial
information how you track that so I'm
sure that is another reason for it
alright so we're going to switch things
up a little bit here and remember
everything we just said about Google
privacy because jmar has a little tap
that app app of the week for us and
we're going to ask you guys a question
after we do a little intro to this video
and you see what this is all about to
you want I introduce this and we'll roll
roll it sure sure the app is called
thumb and it lets you pull the public or
at least the public that uses this app
about pretty much anything you want you
got to attach a picture to your your
question and then you can ask them a yes
or no question for instance do you like
my car and then you post a picture of
your car and then the the audience will
will then give you thumbs up or thumbs
down boats and yeah well let's take a
look at your video that explains it all
I'm sure oh yeah in depth
hey folks welcome to tap that app I'm
Jay marker BB and this is the show where
we tap the finest pieces of app on
planet earth today we're checking out
thumb which basically lets you pull the
public about anything you want use it
correctly and it can be a nice little
tool for some casual research here's how
it works there are two ways to use thumb
you can ask for opinions or you can give
your opinion if you want to ask for
opinions first type in your question the
yes or no variety works best then attach
a photo you can use a photo from your
gallery take a new photo or grab one
from the web all from within thumbs
interface after that select a category
you know to give your question some
context then hit get opinions it'll take
a minute for people to start chiming in
so you can go ahead and vote on other
people's questions while you wait you
can vote with a thumbs up a thumbs down
or you can keep it neutral if you like
you can also add comments which users
always appreciate and to make it easy
each time you vote the app will
automatically move you on to the next
question at this point my only issue
with thumb is that some of the users
tend to ask questions that aren't
exactly optimized for the platform if
you know what I'm saying take this one
doesn't exactly lend itself to the
thumbs up thumbs down format right so
just be sure to pose your questions
correctly and thumb will be a really
useful tool for everybody now to go back
and see what the public thinks of my
question looks like sixty-seven percent
of the thumb population does not think
the 49ers will go to the Super Bowl and
if you want you can also see the results
of your previous questions as you can
see here 71 percent of thumbs users were
totally wrong about the shirt I was
wearing yesterday and that's it folks
thumb is free and available on both the
android market and itunes app store i
highly suggest you download it and give
my red lumberjack shirt some love
otherwise if you've got another app that
you want me to tap all are at me on the
twitter thanks for watching
ah awesome that I like that Apple aah I
like that idea sound a good idea i gotta
say though I'm still a little sore about
the shirt about the dirt my favorite
shirt has it changed at all I understand
I haven't I haven't checked our we'll
get back to you on that one so we're
going to do a live thumb question here
right sure if you have this cute up so
we do we are going to ask what does the
question do you agree or disagree with
the Google privacy policy with Google's
new new yeah so how will people find
this well well anyone who's using the
app at this time the question will be
pushed out there and can i search for
your account just like that or no the
questions are all another atom okay all
right well get on thumb right now and
you know we'll post this and then by the
end of show we will hopefully have some
interesting results for you but while
that is happening we're going to move on
and talk more about Android yeah there's
a lot of news from google this week
actually this was story is about their
earnings call answered of how that was
how much money android made as a result
of that basically and it's interesting
me in comparison to apples so a couple
things first you know Larry Page did the
earnings call and described and red as a
young product lots of potential it's
funny the way he talks about it just
like that Young Buck sound like that or
is that just something you're doing I
have no idea what he's having fun ever
we are in the early stages of monetizing
monetization for a number of our new
products and Android is one of those and
mr. page but we see a lot of potential
for us to make money in android and
you'll see that increase over time one
of the problems was sort of monetizing
android so we look at the Bigfoot put of
android he said for example 250 million
Android devices exist
or have been activated however a lot of
those aren't sort of what we
traditionally think of android devices
phones and tablets that even have
android market right there like gps is
that or the parrot asteroid car stereo
that I just finished reviewing that's
powered by Android where they
android-powered Android yeah that well
the what was that Samsung a refrigerator
the samsung android powered refrigerator
that was at feeis how was it yeah well
that thing the other thing yeah that had
the whole interview with the general
that was running Android but yeah yeah
it did support the all-share platform
yeah anyway so a lot of those can't
serve ads and if they can't serve ads
and they're not making Google any money
because android is free to those people
so Google made three billion dollars an
avid revenue this year to this the end
of this financial year which is I don't
have the exact number that Apple made
from iPhones but is significantly less
than Apple made and not a huge source of
revenue for Google overall I think
Google another thing one of the analysts
came out with which I thought was
particularly interesting is that Google
may not want to make a lot of money
quite yet with Android because there's
so many lawsuits going on right now that
if they were making tons and tons of
money that people would be able to say
that there were more damages and you
know ask for a higher percentage of that
money or more of that money then they're
asking for now but if it's not making
tons of money then they can't really
claim that they want a share of profits
if there really isn't any profit so it's
an interesting story because Android is
so ubiquitous at this point and is such
a big part of the market but not a major
contributor get to the revenue side of
Google I love it three billion dollars
is small revenue now right just I have
zero sense of scale for how much money
through be three billion dollars is
really really just find that interesting
because I don't think three billions a
lot at all I just have no idea like like
the amount like what like you need to
put it in terms
of something for me like how many I
don't know lexus is is can you buy for 3
billion dollars like that then i'll have
like a sense of scale but it seems like
a ton of money yeah I guess you no
imagery paychecks it's like two page oh
really I couch over to download.com
fetish me wah wah yeah but no its you
know it it's weird for me but I mean it
you know we're joking around about like
how three billion dollars a ton of money
but I guess yeah the symptoms the scale
is a bit different when you're talking
about large corporations especially
corporation as large as Google and then
you know who they are relative to a
corporation as large as Apple Microsoft
and whatnot so yeah I mean Apple is
making the revenue on the iphone from
hardware sales right yeah well they
don't worry some apps but yeah
everything anything that has to do they
make money of hardware sales they make
money off of software sales they make
money off of when you buy a case that
has a works with ipod stamp on it they
make money off of everything so it's a
huge cash cow for then google doesn't
really have that complete control over
their ecosystem great speaking of
ecosystems speaking of because yes do
you know who has built a great ecosystem
that apparently is generating them a lot
of money are we talking about Amazon
we're talking about Amazon there's only
a couple people out there who have
really sort of complete ecosystems I
mean I think you have apple you have
Amazon you have google microsoft isn't
in there there i think they kind of have
a patchwork of ecosystems right now I'm
in hmm I mean they're Mary waiting there
I mean these are our lives the way
they're linking the windows phone to the
wid the Windows desktop to xbox 36 but
if we say widely used ecosystems and I
think you're giving your maybe your
maybe underplaying a Microsoft of a
contender of it maybe we shall see time
will tell but anyway what we're talking
about on Android Alice as opposed
Microsoft that list is the kindle fire
so analysts are
from RBC Capital estimating that beyond
the actual sale of the hardware which is
one hundred ninety nine dollars and has
been estimated that that is actually a
below cost for it so that you know
Amazon's not making any money on that
that they will bring in more than a
hundred dollars specifically one hundred
and thirty-six dollars in additional
revenue over the lifetime of each kindle
fire and this comes from digital book
and app revenue and i think potentially
this number is plausible to me but the
way they do the math is a little weird
you know they say that you know in their
survey sixty percent of people bought
more than three books in the first 60
days of ownership and it sounds like
that they are basically saying that
people are going to buy on average five
ebooks / corridor at an average of ten
dollars per book i think what you do
when you first get a device isn't
necessarily consistent with the way you
use a device throughout its lifetime you
know you may be outside and you're like
this is awesome i'm buying a bunch of
books ooh this at this but it takes you
then some time to read those books let
me do you think you'll ever like get
sick of listening to music and just stop
buying it or you're like oh I think I've
watched enough TV shows on this kindle
fire like I mean I don't think you will
but i think the rate at which you
purchase will change over time mm-hmm so
i may have a small issue with the ebooks
thing but we're talking about this
earlier the app calculation that they do
i have a big problem with they are
saying the people on average will buy
three apps per quarter which average it
out to nine dollars every three months
for apps how much money in the lifetime
of your android use have you spent on
apps way too much more well know that
way too much is probably not the right
term but let me let me the means
estimate how much i've spent this year
in the month of january i've spent five
or six bucks maybe seven alright i'll
buy a lot of apps TMR and i were talking
to and i was saying i think i spent
nine dollars ever ever ever that's been
nine dollars you know in a quarter are
absent yet but I mean you and then me
you know I review apps mmm we might not
be the best sample I guess bright
arrogance I mean I'm talking about that
game all the time so it's like I don't
review those games like okay but what it
does it does seem like it could be a lot
I think for for an average user right
and it seems like what they are thinking
here so based on this math they are sort
of considering that the lifetime of a
user is one year mm-hmm that was gonna
be my next question because like a
hundred bucks over the lifetime of my
things a bit low right so they're
basically saying one hundred and
thirty-six dollars per year I think
they're be conservative on the how long
you're going to keep that device hmm you
know so maybe you're going to upgrade
that device to the kindle fire to next
year kindle believe the little inferno i
wonder if they're also including like
the amazon prime membership because i
know they got eighty dollars out of me
like that so they might also be
including that to this number right yeah
i mean according to this math or not but
there is they don't talk about music
they don't talk about additional
purchases like you're saying in the
Amazon market which I think does take an
account I'm sure Amazon is doing fine
here I'm pretty sure it was nothing
prettier than making more than three
billion dollars right three billion
dollars off this device yeah we'll see
so it's estimated they've sold three to
four million tablets so you can do the
math there because i can't do the math
on what that means in terms of revenue I
feel like other group we should all be
better doing math I think we should have
we should get rid of tomorrow's our
guests and we should just have a math
monkey there and any time we have those
questions let goodness let's not talk
about getting me g'mar well here I
appreciate appreciate Justin you you're
gonna talk you need to be a jit math
monkey for the rest of the show if
you're just load up calculator and every
time boom if I get a suit on company
dime then I will be a menace and I need
to know I need a monkey suit okay we'll
eat bananas too I will I will do that if
throw the peels at Antoine I can't like
where this conversation is going alright
let's take a break
and when we come back we'll tell you
what to expect out of HTC at the Mobile
World Congress
so while you were gone we had some
volunteers from the chat room actually
be to the math monkeys so we'll just ask
questions and then you know on our 15
second delay will get the answers from
the chat room wonder if we give you like
wolfram alpha plus google voice search
something that'd be cool we'll try to
rig it on that I think I'm gonna let's
give me my petrol maybe Jay mark and you
and Jane work and build that for our
next thing and then we can rig it up
into our little an android guy way up
there you can kind of see them up there
in the corner or Android Lego make him
talk with the answers that'd be great
alright this is a crazy show what do we
talk about now HTC so there was not a
lot of news out of HTC at CES but there
is a lot of rumors about what they're
going to do at Mobile World Congress
which I'm bummed again that we're not
going to because it's impersonal and ya
wanted to go to Spain forever mostly
though because I just want to pretend
like i'm ernest hemingway to drink a lot
and go to a bullfight the bullfight are
you going to do the running of the bulls
know that the Running of the Bulls leads
up to Apple you want to fight a bowl no
I want to be at the blow you want to
well I understand it's inhumane don't
crazy drunk at the bull don't do it you
all right let's see all right let's get
back to phones the first rumored phone
is the HTC edge which is supposed to be
HTC's first quad-core phone and a pretty
big one 4.7 inch display a megapixel
camera and Android 4.0 as well as HTC
Sense four point oh so a pretty nice
phone spec wise anyway hmm what else do
we have HTC Phil va va la really if they
are those two elder one if it's too else
we can pronounce them i said VA just
because we're talking about spain yeah
vijay yeah do you have to do this with
your hand even though i think that's
more italian little bit it's like this
thing right here I think we're
borderline
fanciful let me I think we're past
borderline of infants alliances that's
what we do now the HTC a VA is a
dual-core 1.5 gigahertz Snapdragon phone
also running ice cream sandwich so kind
of a mid-grade version one step down
from the edge but hopefully cheaper I
guess and then we have the HTC primo
primo this is awesome because we're HTC
is from the knee today open here they
yeah I'm Maria I got nothing walking a
fine line guys it's they've got a mix of
stuff going on here alright so then the
Primo is a 3.7 inch Super AMOLED display
with Gorilla Glass and a win gigahertz
processor 5-megapixel camera so this is
again and mid to low range device and
then the fourth is a tablet the HTC
quattro which will also be a quad-core
tablet with a 10.1 inch display take
your 3 processor ice cream sandwich and
support for the scribe digital stylist
how do you guys feel about styluses on
tablets we looked you know the samsung
note that at CES but i don't know i
think they're fine I mean as long as you
can use them without the stylist I think
having the option to all right now it's
time to jump in and be more accurate but
I used a Wacom tablet as it way come I
don't know four years of art school and
I still don't how to pronounce that but
the tablet the digitizer tablet a lot
with it with it with photoshop and in
various digital manipulation software
and I mean I the having a stylist is
great and we mean you get things like
pressure sensitivity that you don't
necessarily get with your fingertips you
get like a higher degree of accuracy you
get sometimes you get like things like
function keys that are actually on the
stylus itself that kind of lend
themselves to things like zooming in
zooming out are switching between tools
so
I personally love the the option of
having a stylist but if you're talking
about a tablet form factor you also have
to have the ability to get in there and
get the finger the screen driving with
your fingertips yeah I mean I guess if
it's like an add-on then sort of why not
but I would want the product to work
fully without it yeah and maybe the
stylus is just for artist types like you
and it'd be nice if there's a little
pocket or something like that to to
store the stylus right because I would
lose that instantly all right purchase I
don't miss my like trio at all put the
stylus did you ever have a trio I had a
snow nuclea I've seen those I can read
about when you were in high seas device
when you were in junior high or just
like look at all those people there
trios good that CLE a a typically a that
was did that run the palm OS it ran
windows not I remember we don't have a
stylist head stylist yeah oh good camera
getting back to HTC's announcement one
other thing which is not harder
specifically but we mentioned that these
will run Ice Cream Sandwich also run the
sense the new four-point-oh sense UI
which hopefully HTC will outline new
features of that and I've long been a
fan of the sense UI like generally I
don't like the you know them messing
with DUI but the sense has been the best
of the ones that I've used so it'd be
interesting just to see what kind of
innovation they announced their quick
quick note about HTC they're actually
Taiwanese company high 18 in 1997 and HD
c stands for high-tech computer
corporation never knew that guess who
just earned the job math monkey and we
apologize to everyone we have affected
which is many donkeys we apologize take
all monkeys I don't apologize to monkeys
you gonna get me my keys um all right
let's offense more people uh 3d what you
guys think about 3d i am not a fan it's
no secret that upset that for right on
on on phones or everywhere what are we
talkin here
three dimensions in life I love living
in 3d do you want to go further and say
like anyone who makes 3d devices is
stupid just so weak the family people I
mean well I mean if we're for anyone who
thinks it's good is just wrong no let's
back up let's back up here and state
that I do I don't mind it in theaters if
it's a movie that's filmed in 3d or an
animated 3d feature because usually they
make the conversion better but I've
never had like a way i would call like a
great experience with a handheld device
and definitely not a great experience
with any sort of like television it just
hasn't won me over yet and just you know
the the glasses lift you know steph is
it's cool if you are holding it in the
right angle in the home step you have to
wear glasses and i mean i'd be willing
to wear glasses for like an hour and a
half long movie but I saw Hugo in 3d and
it wasn't over two hours long and after
a while I just wanted those glasses off
of my faith and so I just can't see
myself watching a football game in 3d
for example yeah i mean i agree it's uh
there's very few movies in theatres
where I thought I was worthwhile and out
of the theater I've never seen a
worthwhile implementation but why we're
talking about is because LG is rumored
to be announcing a new version of the
optimus 3d and this one is somewhat
similar but it will also have the
ability to do 2d to 3d conversion which
if you thought 3d was bad then this
conversion is even worse because it just
it can't convert something that 2d to 3d
Adam it just doesn't one or me just ends
up looking like like a pop-up book you
know how you have those 3d things and
those 2d things in 3d space is how 3d
conversions end up looking to me because
it's not really 3d no it's all I mean
that's gonna look terrible I'm just
gonna say yeah I mean I've seen it and
it's not impressive but you go LG let's
see how that works out this time we'll
push for it hopefully um one more piece
of hardware before we head off into the
land of email maybe look at
do your survey there the samsung galaxy
s3 so the s2 is big right everyone has
that phone it's all i'll call the
different carriers I've got two of them
you do I don't sorry I I needed to
interrupt the flow of that Mara the so
this is a really interesting story
because the rumors of the s3 are from a
Russian blogger and who has provided to
some accurate information and some
inaccurate information in the past but
he says that the galaxy s3 will run
android 4.0 which you know i'm sure is
makes sense if there is one it's going
to be powered by a 1.5 to 1.6 gig of her
Claud core processor seems likely have
an HD super amoled plus display 12
megapixel camera and the design will be
pretty similar to the s2 so all of that
seems pretty straightforward like not
going out on a limb on anything there
the heat the one thing that is
interesting in this is that he claims
that there's going to be two versions of
the phone a quad core in a dual core
model that's interesting so because I
mean normally you see phones
differentiated by storage size we've got
a 16 gigabyte nay and a 32 gigabyte you
choose between those this is this is
kind of more akin to a computer so did
you had a for where you're like oh you
get the fast one or the the really fast
one bread the fastener they're not so
fast one depends on what's happening
there yeah I think this would be really
interesting to do a side-by-side
comparison of these because we all
wonder with phones or at least I do does
cpu speed really matter at foremost
daily use to just put that to the test
and then compare that against the
battery life like this does the quad
core affect the battery life so much
that it's not worth getting for most
people well every do they effectively
turn off the course depending on what
who are they using for their their chips
it because we think we already discussed
this where the Tegra 3 for example only
really in it technically has five course
it's not using the four cores for for
most things using that one
sort of what I guess a backup core is
what I'm thinking about like a low-power
chipset that the low power chip is
basically just there to do things like
render the desktop you know show your
options menu that sort of thing and it
doesn't actually engage the other four
high-powered cores until you're doing
something like playing a game or
watching a movie yeah it's rumored to be
powered by the Samsung quad-core exynos
4412 to look into how that architecture
works but I mean I mean it could be a
similar case where you know it doesn't
necessarily affect battery life unless
you're doing battery in tenth of things
and I think in that case then it would
drain your battery faster than a
dual-core processor just because you're
doing more things more powerfully but I
think it's kind of the equivalent of
like you could probably get you know 20
miles per gallon out of a four cylinder
or a v8 but the v8 oh let you get into
more trouble hell of tossing car
metaphor isn't it I didn't notice that
well anyway I love to see the
side-by-side comparison just to know if
the specs are a reality yeah in terms of
that how reputable is this Russian
blogger that we're talking about does he
look like Mickey Rourke and iron man
tuze what I'm asking it's a good
question i have actually not seen a
picture of him okay but is probably the
most offensive show on twitter and his
picture is mickey rourke from Iron Man
it's actually a puppy it picture is a
little stuffed puppy puppy Rourke is the
editor-in-chief of mobile dash review
com I'd like to apologize to him I would
too especially yeah let's just stop how
about that I'm sure he's a very handsome
brush and gentlemen of course as our
most questions ah shall we how's our
poll doing let's check it out check it
out that Austin let's see um okay do you
agree with Google's new privacy policy
seventy-five percent say no oh yeah
seventy-five percent say no which
according to my math monkeys
kills leaves 25% saying yes you are on
it I'm on it today how many responses
new have 94 oh wow what a short time
that's pretty good a lot of a lot of
responses and um just in case you're
curious i'm still at 71 percent thumbs
down for my shirt yeah yes how many go
thumbs it up right now please that's a
terrible it appreciate it meaning how
many ppl added statistically
insignificant change all right let's uh
let's move on to email Oh before we do I
don't like a quick Google search so the
good thing about like being on Google is
that you can do a gmail search for
Google receipt and get the receipt for
everything that you've ever bought a new
android app marketplace since i since
I've been on the android platform in
2009 january of two thousand uh actually
january of 2010 as when i get my my
droid 1 i've spent 150 5 + on apps wow
wow so there there yeah i went all out
there alright we couple of those one at
one or two of those are really expensive
gps apps they tend to be twenty dollars
plus right but yeah that's how much i've
spent on apps nice work helping support
the android community i appreciate that
LM saying like I'm sure that I'm not
unique in that that there are the users
who like me who spend a lot on apps or
more or who just you know by get a free
app and then just go you know what I
really like this app I want to drop the
developer a couple bucks yeah will skew
I mean that that's what however just
work a lot of people don't spend a ton
of money a couple of people do and then
that's how your averages end up where
you were talking about an average of I'm
sure they're people who spend way more
money on app than I do so there you go
female fair let's do those emails first
is from Travis he said I would like to
know if there's any apps bluetooth
controls for Bluetooth controls on
Bluetooth headsets preferably the
motorola ones I've not found an app that
lets you adjust the bluetooth controls
and I think that's mostly because I
think most people are the most one's
youth headsets that support things like
audio
already have controls built into them
the avrcp protocol has built-in things
for skip boards get back play pause and
then also you're entering an Indian call
so there's not really a need for
bluetooth headset controls unless you're
trying to do something crazy yeah the
crazies have the right word but if
you're trying to be something more than
that but I'm not I've not seen that the
closest thing I've found to a motorola
specific bluetooth headset app is their
moto talk app which will if you have a
the right motorola headset of a read
your text messages to you all right but
it doesn't give you any extra will go
with not that we know now that we know
all right you want to read the next one
from Bob sure it says hi guys i'm new to
smartphones and to your show i heard
aunt wanna take a shot at the casio
commando i just purchased my first
android phone and it is the command know
can you tell me why you're so dismissive
of this device I know it's not the
bestest most powerful smartphone out
there but it's working fine for me and
it looks kickass this comes in from bob
s and i guess since you're new to the
show Bob you you've probably heard a
couple of suits in the time since this
email was sent now and you know that you
probably shouldn't take me seriously
when I pick on a phone I don't really
have any particular problem with the
mcafee of commando I just think I'm
funny and I'm not I just has a dumb name
or sorry yeah but you know like speaking
of casio phones and i didn't toss this
into the rundown cuz i want to save it
for this point but I've seen sort of
like floating around the internet this
week something that I missed at CES and
that's casio g-shock phone so basically
if you're familiar with the the huge
g-shock waterproof weatherproof go
anywhere watches they've built this very
Batman esque a g-shock phone which is
powered by Android shock resistant you
could throw it 10 feet and it wouldn't
break the screen you could you know
basically submerge it 30 feet underwater
and you'd still be able to use it when
it came out it's like this rugged sort
of go anywhere you know kind of phone
and at first I thought it was ugly but
them and I still think it's ugly but the
more I look at it the more I kind of
want it
kind of just like a Casio watch yeah
listed the g-shock watch if I think when
it's modeled after and I just want to
pull this out and sit it on the counter
at a bar you know been interesting he
has this motor pick up girls well no an
interesting thing happened to me at CES
where I found myself at a dinner where
everybody at the table had an iPhone 4
or 4s and I was the only person with an
android phone and I just think it would
be you know when everyone sits there
like nice and like iPhones on the table
for me just to pull this beast out oh
you're like my phone can consume your
phone is definitely different this is
the phone that they should have had in
Mission Impossible instead of an iphone
do we have this discussion we haven't
okay I had this discussion where I just
saw really pay attention to Mission
Impossible because of all the weird tech
an iphone everyone our iphones i'm
willing to believe Tom Cruise can get
hit by a car and get up and keep running
I'm not willing to believe that I phone
in his pocket would survive a two foot
drop just would not believe it and feel
like they had this phone this is the
phone 10 had 10 feet 10 foot yeah 10
feet and then there was also a weird
scene where and this is not a spoiler
but they're talking about something in
the background they had these large
pictures on these flat screen TVs and
you know they need to put some data in
the bottom so it looks spy like and
instead of putting like GPS data or time
the picture was shot there's exif data
shutter speed and exposure information
and just like why would a spy need that
I did see that the only reason that's
dirty be yeah is because the people in
the art department didn't know what put
there and so they put what was
interesting to them and it just took me
completely out of the scene was like why
is that even there I don't know Tom
Cruise runs a lot spoiler alert alright
we're going to fly through these emails
we've got an email from andy from
amsterdam says he loves the show he i
think we talked about the user interface
guidelines last week and basically he's
saying that he kind of agrees with where
i was going that google should give some
kind of preferential treatment in the
market to people who follow the
guidelines versus people who don't
Antoine had a different opinion let me
feel like they already kind of do that
they already high like I have a clear
them there they promote it there's an
editor
just twice tab in the the online android
market and then we also i mean you can
also come to seeing at that complex
download and look at our best apps
they're usually pretty well defined
Delta well yes luck there for junior in
India nice how you set that up all right
get an email from Max is it has an EVO
3d and he's never had any battery
problems unless it's roaming or a bad
app kicks in all day power even with
games playing I know you guys like to
rip in the phone because your 3d haters
yes we are but even with how 3d it's
sweet and fast phone this is in
reference to sort of our discussion
about this last week someone had rode in
I basically we're asking what's a good
phone on sprint or should they jump ship
to verizon and we didn't bring up the
evo 3d I guess we did because then he
followed up and wrote an email saying
the evo is 4G how come you guys need to
learn more about the evo 3d blah blah
blah you're done we are done so I don't
like yeah I don't think we necessarily
made that exact mistake but I'm not
going to argue that I'm not dumb either
it seems like out that's a losing
argument got an email from an der who
says basically he has an Xperia Play and
wants to root it and has heard about the
software called ginger break and wants
to know because he has heard the ginger
break will root it without voiding his
warranty is that true Antoine no well
the thing about rooting is that it is
inherently a wart avoiding process if
you get caught so I mean if you root
your phone and then you try to turn it
in for warranty issue that software
related if you break it for example
during the ruing process and I mean
anything can happen even if you are just
using automated software it can be used
as grounds to void your warranty so
there is there's always an air of of
danger around the rooting process I mean
it's relatively low that anything will
ever happen to you but I mean if you're
the kind of person that's scared that
your carrier is going to you know shut
you down for tethering then you mean
you're also probably kind of person who
is a little afraid of running into
issues around the routing but I mean if
you learn how to
root if you ever have any issue and you
can unroot before you turn your phone in
like if you you know drop it around
crack the screen and you just unroot it
before you turn it in you should be okay
and if it's not a software issue that
your did your warranty claim is around
they may not even bother with it yeah I
think a lot of people have had pretty
good luck even returning original just
there's this is caveat there if you
don't blame me if you void your warranty
using my advice to around voiding your
warranty lame jaber oh alright the last
email this guy basically rights in says
he wants to buy a new phone in the next
couple months and is you know with the
announcement of the droid maxx which
there's a story what today saying the
droid maxx or maybe was yesterday as an
official release date and pricing which
is january 26 which is tomorrow and will
go on sale for 299 with to your contract
which phone should he buy that or the
galaxy nexus or something else i mean
i'll say and less battery life is your
issue i like the Galaxy Nexus better I
mean I have one so maybe I'm biased but
you know that being said battery life on
the Galaxy Nexus is far from great is is
just horrible compared to the new Dre
razr maxx which lasts like what is it 20
something hours 24 is what they're
claiming right 24 hours of street talk
of talk time so standby is just you know
massive supposedly they claim i like to
use the take their battery life and cut
it by half and that's what you should
actually get out of it sort of rule of
thumb there's but still it's a pretty
pretty decent amount of claimed battery
life he didn't say anything about like
you know he says that he considers
himself a technophile but he doesn't say
anything about like modding the phone or
anything so and i think that because the
droid razr maxx is essentially the same
phone as the droid razr is essentially
the same phone as the droid 4 that's
going to come out it's probably going to
be pretty well supported since any
firmware
goes on any of those phones should
probably be pretty readily adaptable for
the others okay so and I think
Motorola's also expressed a you know
definitely that there were going to be
upgrading this phone ice cream sandwich
soon so I mean I think it's a pretty
safe bet either way yeah I really play
around with the interfaces and see which
one you like best I big again I'm not
really sure what Motorola's going to do
with their with their interface with ice
cream sandwich are they just going to
adopt the standard Ice Cream Sandwich
interface are they going to blur it up a
little bit it's a good question
especially now that they have a new
owner I mean whatever i'm still
maintaining that there's going to be the
same level of autonomy that Motorola's
going to maintain so i don't really
think that Google owning them really
even matters and I'm maintaining there's
not well I mean if you look at like
Google products they don't they don't
maintain control over their own product
so it's like you got you know but now
they got a new home very different from
Android which I mean just just now just
started working together with the Google
TV team so it's just I mean if they
can't even do that with her software
like why would they be in there pushing
buttons and telling motorola what to do
like I just don't think that that fits
with their core I think that's one of
the thing that Paige wants to change as
CEO they have going to change anytime
within the droid razr maxx his lifetime
and it would answer your question
they're both good phones I say that
Nexus but I think Antoine is right go
you got to figure out which one I don't
even think with an extended battery that
razor Matt I mean that Nexus is going to
match to read their Max's know your life
it's not at all so if battery life is a
concern for you and it should be with
the poor glt phone on Athens network
because every single one that I've ever
used has had a you know a bit of a
battery issue I would say take a nice
long look at the razr maxx and if you
but if not Galaxy Nexus all right
anything else that's all I got all right
