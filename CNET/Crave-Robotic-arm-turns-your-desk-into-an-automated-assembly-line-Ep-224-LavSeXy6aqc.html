scraper 2015 is the year of the drone
and what better way to celebrate that
fact than with the world's first drilled
bass multiplayer game called drone and
bass welcome to the world's first
multiplayer rice drone and bass claims
to be an affordable indoor game
controlled via mobile device and created
for everyone
the interactive basis for the drones
have multiple functions you can be used
as racing checkpoints power-ups or as a
shooting target each drone has a
built-in infrared cannon which shoots
invisible light beams that can take out
other drones during the game the drones
are made with a durable plastic to
protect them from breaking during
violent crashes each drone comes with a
base for spare propellers two batteries
and a charger they use low powered
Bluetooth technology to communicate with
your mobile device and have a range of
up to 30 meters drone and base comes
ready to fly right out of the box and
will be available soon for the holiday
season not sure the price yet on
Wednesday morning around 9 a.m. Pacific
time NASA's Cassini spacecraft did a
close encounter flyby of Saturn's moon
Enceladus which is believed to have
elements of habitability within its
global ocean Cassini flew about 30 miles
above the surface of Enceladus traveling
at a speed of around 19,000 miles per
hour and passed through a large plume of
gas and water that is constantly
blasting out of the bottom of the shell
of the moon Cassini was used to analyze
particles and gases to determine what
makes up the surface of Enceladus
whether it be hydrogen h2o and methane
which are just a few of the building
blocks for life keep checking back to
crave for updates on what they found on
the moon of Enceladus
this may be the slowest Rube Goldberg
machine ever created inventor Bob
Partington built what he calls the roof
of slow birth machine and produced a
video for the YouTube channel field day
to show off just how slow the rube slow
burg machine really is
I mean machine uses grass growing to
push the ball that is painstakingly slow
in the end the roofs Loberg machine took
about six weeks to complete so I invite
you to go to the crave blog post to
watch how the machine ends and check out
links to other crafty Rube Goldberg
machines that Krave has covered in the
past the group of self-proclaimed robot
fans have built a robotic arm that can
see think and learn in an attempt to
make robots more accessible for everyone
in both education and research the seven
bot robotic arm has raised almost 400
percent of their goal on Kickstarter and
is showing no signs of letting up the 7
bot has six degrees of freedom
and is modeled after the classic larger
industrial robots you find in car
manufacturer
the body is made entirely of aluminum
and is highly rated for endurance and
durability
optimize control algorithm makes the
robots movements very smooth and
accurate allowing the robot to perform
very delicate tasks seven BOTS can see
its environment and through the use of
AI software can learn colors shapes and
be taught to make certain movements
without having to program the robot the
seven bots software is open-source and
with the help of the Kinect or leap
motion developers can easily build a
wide variety of applications for the
robot according to the product video the
seven BOTS will be funded on November
7th and will retail for $350 when it
comes to market all right guys that's
the show thank you very much for
watching as always you can find all
these new stores to see that's Krave
