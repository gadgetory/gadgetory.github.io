they don't build a car for every
practical purpose
they built a car for every impractical
purpose
the f12 is a GT Berlinetta let's break
that down now we use GT all wrong in
America GT is a Gran Turismo in proper
parlance that means a grand touring car
so take high-performance add spacious
room and comfort for 2 adults maybe room
for two kids in the back a car you don't
mind being in while you're going back
now the berlinetta part that's the
diminutive form of the italian barlini
which is a limousine or luxurious saloon
put these two together and you've got a
Grand Touring performance car with the
luxury of a little limo yeah
prepare to write a big check now a blind
man could spot this car from a thousand
yards on a foggy day because it's got
the most distinctive body styling of
anything on the road right here this is
called the Aero bridge big deep channel
on either side of the hood comes into
literally a bridge across this gap that
opens up on the side of the car and
along the door this channels air away
from a turbulent pressure zone here they
say it's good for up to 270 pounds of
downforce at Full Tilt inside this cabin
harkens to me back to the early mid 60s
250 GTS which had this kind of
protruding eyebrow design like this of
course those have now moved to LCD
panels replaced by some very handy
nozzles big central actual tach and
that's your only gauge 2 flanking LCDs
the one on the right handles
infotainment navigation is up radio is
left media right phone is down on this
side vehicle settings now those vehicle
dynamics settings under the VDA button
are tied to this this is Ferraris
manettino setup all the way down gets
you into wet so it's going to modulate
power very gradually for sloppy
conditions up one more they call sport
that's actually just normal mode up the
next one is race that's what most car
companies call sport mode it tightens
everything up in terms of power delivery
shift points and such then you've got C
T off this is going to push the car
right to the ragged edge before the
system's jump in
and save you finally rotated hold for
ESC off this has turned off stability
control and traction control time to
call your insurance company and tell
them there's a claim coming as you work
through the manettino settings you also
end up with a series of displays on the
left that show you what you're getting
into through six different vehicle
subsystems f1 track is the traction
control Formula One inspired heed if is
the electronically controlled rear
differential f1 DC that is our automated
manual dual clutch transmission ESC
stability control ABS obviously
anti-lock brakes SCM is the magneto
rheological adaptive suspension the
fluid in the actual dampers changes
viscosity as electrical current is
applied you don't drive this car like
any other yes you put a key in and turn
it but all that does is arm the thing
then you start it with an engine start
button to turn it off you rotate the key
back out again these guys appear under
your thumbs are your turn signals
similarly non stalk based or your high
beams you push this button on/off down
here is a shock setting press it once
for bumpy road press it again for smooth
Road and this little thing here controls
your wipers I still haven't figured out
how it works
no shifter of any kind aside from your
paddles you've got these three buttons
on this arc in the console are is
reverse auto is automatic mode kind of
like what you would have in Drive PS
don't know what that stands for is
actually launch mode quite a few cameras
you've got your reverse camera which
looks pretty good lots of good guidance
lines on it then as soon as you go in to
drive or go forward from there
it cuts away to a similar forward camera
and if you push this button up here you
can invoke a wall I view as well as you
can imagine this whole cabin is
low-slung gives me a lot of headroom I
don't believe but I'm not sure that a
sunroof is available in this car and I
absolutely love this titanium over brown
color scheme thank you for not being red
but if you think this is gorgeous and it
is you ain't seen nothing yet
now I'm about to open the hood
I don't normally give you warning about
this but I did it last night for someone
who's seen a lot of nice cars and he
almost fainted dead away just know your
warrant that's the sexiest thing under
sheet metal you'll ever see this is a
6.3 liter naturally aspirated v12
direct-injected of course but no turbos
no superchargers no cheats basically one
key thing high-compression point five to
one you don't run this thing on regular
730 horsepower 509 foot-pounds of torque
a big number sure but clearly a river
not a grunter the car weighs about 3,500
pounds driven out to the rear wheels
only through a 7-speed dual-clutch
automated manual only the result is 0 to
60 in three seconds really less than
that in anyone's hands it's capable and
the mpg 1216 may not sound interesting
to you but it's a full 30 percent better
than the Ferrari that this guy replaces
look where the front of the engine block
is it's right about here so your
engine's yay
that puts it right at the axle line
qualifying this is what's known as a
front mid-engine design that's key to
get this car some nice rotational
performance when you're cornering or
hanging the rear end out also check
these interesting structures that I've
never seen these on an engine these are
off the intake plenum and there's some
kind of an expansion chamber that helps
this car breathe and as we're going to
find out on the road
it really works let's go
this is one of the most civilized
driving dual-clutch high-performance
cars I've ever driven it's really really
nice all their this power comes on
almost freakishly that's the easy of an
engine like this that is so tuned for
great breathing
it's how they got that incredible power
without putting any Augmented intake on
it
the ride quality is really quite good
this is not a great highway I'm on right
here but it's it's tamping out all the
nasty stuff and the nice sort of
laid-back driving position this car
there's just you're in the slot when
you're sitting on this side because the
engine is so responsive because the
aluminum subframe and structure this car
is so stiff it's relatively light it
seems to lose a thousand pounds off its
thirty five hundred some-odd pound
printed weight the car doesn't feel that
heavy Oh
what's really going on here is the trend
in supercar manufacturer to make these
vehicles incredibly fast incredibly
capable in their dynamics but also
really easy to drive
okay let's price our 2014 f12 test for
kicks
it's about 330 grand there are a few
options to get it fully CNET style 8 the
cameras are an optional package and a
few other things but it doesn't matter
you're not gonna swing one of these
sooner than I can</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
