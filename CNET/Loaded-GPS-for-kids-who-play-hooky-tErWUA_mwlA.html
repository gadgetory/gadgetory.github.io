Morris and it's time to get loaded
comcast and that's the launch of a new
24-hour 3d channel called Xfinity 3d the
channel does not seem to have any theme
addict thread it just plays whatever is
in 3d that Comcast could find for
example it starts with the NHL Heritage
Classic followed by a Kings of Leon
concert don't most cable channels have
kind of a point like news or music this
is sort of just a channel of whatever is
in this format I find it very odd the
channel launches for the very few
Comcast customers that have 3d TVs on
Sunday the Commerce Department published
a result of a study that claims that
five to ten percent of the nation does
not have access to broadband speed
connections according to the study this
percentage of population does not have
data that's fast enough to either surf
the web or view photos and videos the
Department published a map showing where
access is the most lacking this study
wasn't really an experiment in the
traditional sense though the government
just compiled data based on advertising
rates from the major carriers like AT&amp;amp;T
and Verizon they did not test for speeds
or alternatives so we should take this
with a grain of salt but we also hope
for better nationwide service from
Obama's 18 billion-dollar Broadband Plan
in other political and tech news
President Obama dined with the heads of
major Silicon Valley firms on Thursday
including Apple CEO Steve Jobs Facebook
founder Mark Zuckerberg and Google Chief
Eric Schmidt the event was in Silicon
Valley and the purpose was to discuss
innovation research and job creation
also present was Paul Otellini head of
Intel who has since been appointed to
join the President's Council on Jobs and
Competitiveness I'm sorry to say no one
from C net was invited a pilot program
in California is going to put GPS chips
on students to make sure they go to
class this is a six week trial and it
began last week in the Anaheim Union
School District seventh and eighth
graders who have had four or more
unexcused absences will be assigned a
handheld GPS device about the size of a
cell phone
the device will notify students when
it's time to go to school and then track
their location until 8 o'clock at night
the device itself costs between three
and four hundred dollars and the service
costs $8
per student per day the motorola atrix
is coming out sooner than expected this
is the 4G Motorola Android phone with
the external laptop shell it was
expected to ship on March 6 but we got
word that it will instead ship February
21st and be in stores on the 22nd we got
an early review unit and reviewed it
both as a laptop and a phone here on
CNET make sure you watch that the Amazon
Kindle got an update this week that
gives users what they have long been
asking for real page numbers version 2.6
of the Kindle app allows you to see real
page numbers instead of some weird
number that gives you a relativity of
where you are in the book it also allows
you to look upwards through Google and
Wikipedia without leaving the app this
only applies to iPad iPhone and iPod
Touch apps no word on when it will
happen on other platforms like
blackberry or Android and finally
research is underway to figure out if
computers can be controlled with our
minds researchers at Johns Hopkins and
the University of Pittsburgh have
received more than 6 million dollars to
continue work on something called the
brain computer interface they have
already tested this on monkeys by
implanting electrodes on the monkey
brain and asking the computer to process
activity that is activated by neurons
the monkey has been able to extend a
robotic arm turn doorknobs and eat
marshmallows next up we'll see if humans
can do this who would like to volunteer
that's your news of the day and that
wraps up your week of getting loaded we
will see you next Tuesday because Monday
is the Presidents Day holiday
have fun behave we'll see you soon and
remember cnet-dot-com-slash-loaded for
