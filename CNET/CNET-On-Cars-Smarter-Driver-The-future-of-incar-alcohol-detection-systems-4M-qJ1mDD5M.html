center where they are one of the few
licensed installers and maintained errs
of the current state of the art of
alcohol detection ignition interlocks
okay here's today's technology here's
the smart start system installed in this
vehicle this is sort of a hand set of a
head unit with a display and a place
where you blow in it connects through
this big ol coil cord to a logger box a
brain box basically which is up under
the dash here's how it works I turn the
key to on because I want to go drive
somewhere of course the system has to
okay them and you just see it
initializes for a moment it says wait
now it says below here I go
it's analyzing me now and I got a pass
now I can start the car it gives you 2
minutes and counts down for you to do
that I had to blow and then when it gave
me a tone signal I had to make a humming
sound while still blowing now why is
that so that you haven't hooked up a
balloon or a tank of air to this thing
you got to do something that basically
only a human can do as I drive it's
gonna keep prompting me for random
retests there is a vision in the future
of having alcohol detection in every
vehicle from new it's part of something
called dad's the driver alcohol
detection system for safety
partly backed by the federal government
now for alcohol detection to be in every
car and be acceptable to the car buying
public it has to meet three criteria as
I see it first of all it's got to be
nearly imperceptible most of us would
never do this every time we drive no
matter what the safety benefits for
society second of all it's got to work
quickly this is a bit of a timely
process and third it has to be foolproof
but it also has to have a little leeway
for real-world living one envision
technology is a touch pad on the
steering wheel perhaps that shines
infrared light on the surface of your
skin reflecting from just deep enough to
show blood-alcohol concentration in your
body another technology is breath based
like we've seen today but not with the
device you blow into rather the car
would automatically sample the area
around the driver in the car
testing for exhaled indicators of
alcohol impairment
now those two technologies as amazing as
they seem are actually being
demonstrated right now in the labs they
are real the bigger hurdles come in
three other areas first preventing the
passenger or another person from sitting
in for a drunk driver to start the car
facial-recognition tech could help their
second calibrating whatever technology
is used to allow someone with let's say
a point oh seven to drive but not
someone with 0.08 that is giving tacit
consent to drive after some degree of
drinking quite different from the sort
of don't drink and drive mantra that we
operate under today and third another
issue will be the confluence of what
dad's technologies learns and the
automotive black boxes that are soon to
be required in every car under federal
regulation will the readings from the
alcohol testing system be stored in the
black box and if so for how long and who
can see that our partners at State Farm
are encouraged about what could be a
potential breakthrough in drunk driving
technology why something like that
whatever technology is used and they
point to a frustrating number that makes
it worth pursuing some ten thousand
people every year dying in drunk driving
accidents in the u.s. that numbers been
coming down but not much below that
level the Insurance Institute for
Highway Safety thinks 7,000 of those
deaths could be prevented by a
technology like dad's once it propagates
in the market</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
