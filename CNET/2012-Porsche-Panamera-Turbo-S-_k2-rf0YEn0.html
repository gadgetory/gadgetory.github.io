a Panamera it's likely because it's the
nearest thing to a four-door 911 and
among Panamera's this one is the nearest
of all let's drive the 2012 Porsche
Panamera Turbo S and check the tip
and one of you who watch these videos
know I've got an ongoing love-hate
relationship with the Panamera I love to
drive it I hate to look at it and what
hate to pay for it it's this big punchy
looking thing it looks like a beached
whale in any color then when you go and
paint it Beluga white are you kidding
this is one seriously unattractive ride
but that's not what we're here for
let's get inside now the inside of a
Panamera is admittedly a very nice place
to sit go driving take a nap just about
anything this is a nicely appointed car
but it's very familiar at this point
we've seen this new style Porsche
console which is kind of this high
rising thing it gets kind of button
crazy down here on this sort of spine of
buttons that are in sort of an order but
not really they just kind of got
everything spraying around here not much
has changed up here though since the
last Panamera we saw we have a good sort
of a 3d flyover view available on the
nav screen you've got hard buttons down
here for all your major functions but
this is also a touchscreen now a Turbo S
is only available with one gear box the
PDK which is some really long German
phrase for double clutch manual and
you've got this very simple gate and
you've got your shift paddles well
really what are these things kind of
like aluminized wedges to give you up
and down shift on either side it's an
ambidextrous wheel Oh check this out
because we have a high trim with a PDK
you've got this really cool indicator it
looks like it's just a nameplate that
tells you you got a PDK like you got to
be reminded of that but you've got these
illuminating indicators Sport Sport+
and launch control on the right because
you can put this thing into all those
modes partly because we have a Sport
Chrono Package that's what the
chronometer on the dash tells you if you
don't even see the spec sheet you let
these two Sport buttons the sport is
going to tighten up everything from
shifting to throttle response to
suspension behavior Sport Plus takes you
into a launch control mode and this
one's interesting this is your automatic
start/stop defeat button so when you
come to a stop it's going to shut down
lift off the brake it's going to refire
you can defeat that here our car has a
reverse camera and you can see when I've
got that up
you also have an overlay of the sonar
map front and rear that's a nice
blending of in
kayson's I like what it's all together
like that gauges are almost entirely
classic Porsche analog they do the five
ring thing but I love the one second
from the right
that's the roughly four point eight inch
round display that can show just about
any aspect of the main head unit which
they call a PCM you can dedicate that to
any part of it like audio there and nav
here navigation as I mentioned is a
good-looking screen here's how I changed
my map view you got a lot of choices
here not just the bird's eye there's
also weather displayed and a satellite
image Bluetooth hands-free of stock and
when you do have a phone paired up you
can also do a two DP bluetooth streaming
as part of this head unit base and
whenever you're listening to you've got
two output systems the standard rig is a
bose system 585 watts i think it is 13
speakers plus a powered sub that's going
to be a good sounding system but if you
look at the script on our speakers we've
got the big boy the $4,000 option the
Burmaster sound system that gets you to
a thousand watts of oomph through a 16
channel surround sound amp ribbon
tweeter technology and a microphone
somewhere in the cabin that lets the
system a depth to various sorts of noise
or interference inside the car in real
time oh by the way I find this very
telling with all these books on the -
this isn't staged this is my work today
I shoot about a hundred cars a year most
of them full of tech I seldom have to
break out this many manuals there's
something vaguely unintuitive about the
PCM head unit these guys operate
okay now the engine of a turbo ass is a
big part of the Panamera story when you
go to this level that's part of why it
costs so damn much
it's a 4.8 liter v8 with two discrete
turbos a true twin-turbo you can see
each one down the side of the motor
right there you've got direct injection
as well very open which is Porsches very
elaborate variable cam and timing system
for lifts and events and then on top of
all this you've got this beautiful
engineering of a Porsche motor so
everything's happening here at a high
level the results 550 horsepower 553
foot-pounds of torque gets this 43 98
pound beast up to 60 in 3.6 seconds
always going through all-wheel drive
that's a given on a turbo s and through
that PDK 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox Oh
check this out Porsche loves the
electric controllable rear wings this
one slick look how its segmented this
reminds me of those IBM ThinkPads from
the late 90s where they had the
butterfly keyboard it comes up at a
certain width and then it expands to
give you more bite in the air when it's
actually up kind of cool
the first thing you notice in this car
is you got some real 911 DNA in here
that's a pretty good trick now what
you're totally aware of is you do have a
longer wheelbase and a lot more car
longitudinally you're dealing with than
in a sports car this car does a lot to
get around it all wheel drives really
helping of course that's tuned toward
performance driving not toward off-road
the power comes on real nicely twin
turbos are great for that neither one of
them has to do everything they only have
one bank apiece and they can be very
responsive but the power comes on like a
bigger engine that is naturally
aspirated great exhaust note steering is
not electric in this car and say advance
but hydraulic accessory driven power
steering feels good whole DM car feels
good I got to say as much as I think
this car is ugly pretentious pompous
expensive it sure is a joy to drive
okay let's price our big turbo baleen
this 2012 Porsche Panamera Turbo S top
of the stack is 174 grand that includes
most of the tech I showed you as well as
the PDK dual-clutch gearbox and
all-wheel drive however there are a few
things you can add if you want to round
it up to 200 first of all voice command
for some reason not included 595 ala
cart go figure the rear seat charging
cradle for your smartphone 890 you could
buy every charger and Best Buy for that
much money I'd seriously blow off the
rear seat entertainment system for 3
grand it's just not that cool burn
master audio is 4000 on its own adaptive
cruise is 2500 we also have that blind
spot warning another 850 and that's not
even touching all the bespoke interior
stuff you can do on a Porsche you can
spend a week just configuring that stuff
