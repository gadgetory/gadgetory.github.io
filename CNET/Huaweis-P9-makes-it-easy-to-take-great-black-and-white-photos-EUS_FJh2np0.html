like a branding as well who always new
flagship p9 is all about the photography
so let's take a closer look only one of
the two lenses on the back shoot in
color the other is geared specifically
for black-and-white shots and is very
good at it as well
black and white images look great with a
really rich contrast well it looks much
better than just using a black and white
filter on a color shot if you enter your
arty photos of lattes then this will be
right up your street color shots are
handled very well too looking extremely
vibrant and very well exposed having two
lenses also lets the camera achieve a
simulated depth of field effect they're
similar to what you can see from a DSLR
I've had a lot of fun playing around
with this you'll also find features like
an HDR mode a panorama mode and a pro
mode that gives you manual control over
settings together with its slim
pocketable design the p9 is great of a
camera phone but that's where my
excitement ends always Android skin
changes far too much of a standard
Android interface making it clunky and
awkward to use and there's a large
amount of bloatware pre-installed too
the screen is at least bright and
there's a ton of power under the hood
the p9 might pack a great camera but
overall it's not a perfect phone it's
price puts it neck-and-neck with
Samsung's Galaxy s7 which offers a much
nicer interface a similarly good camera
and a stunning waterproof design between
the two my money would definitely go to
Samsung</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
