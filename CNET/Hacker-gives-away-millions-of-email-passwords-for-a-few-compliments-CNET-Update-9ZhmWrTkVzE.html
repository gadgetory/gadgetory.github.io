to get there also free I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update hundreds of
millions of hacked email usernames and
passwords have been leaked online and
it's just being given away for free a
Reuters report shed light on this
incredibly large stash of stolen
credentials discovered by hold security
researchers a young russian hacker was
bragging in online forums about how many
email passwords he collected turns out
there were about 57 million from
Russia's most popular email service
mail.ru and with that were also 40
million Yahoo credentials 33 million
from Microsoft hotmail and about 24
million from gmail accounts there are
also a number of corporate accounts from
banks and manufacturing and retail
companies what's so incredible here is
the sheer size of the data dump and how
this person was just give it away to
people who pay them compliments on
hacker forums the hacker originally was
selling it for less than a dollar but
researchers got it for free I say nice
things about him online so what do you
do now with all this well the email
providers are going through it to see
which of these accounts are still active
to warn their users hackers do collect
this information from tricking people
with tactics like phishing scams so it's
essential for you to protect yourself by
not using the same password for your
email as you do for other important
services and you also need and I mean
need to be using two-step authentication
that's when you login from a new
computer the system sends you a text
message to make sure it's really you
logging in and not someone who has a
stolen password in fact be good your mom
this Mother's Day and make sure she set
up with to step up education on her
accounts it's better than flowers but
let's move on to some more rosy news
shall we Twitter's periscope live video
streaming app is now letting you save
your broadcast to be viewed beyond 24
hours when Facebook rolled out its live
video broadcast tool it made it so
videos don't disappear and now periscope
wants to do the same to stay competitive
all you have to do is use the hashtag
save in your broadcast title you can
still delete it later if you want the
feature could be buggy because it's
still in beta test but it means that
periscope could be a more
important news reporting tool if you
could save a broadcast and that's likely
on the company's mind is a way to expand
because periscope just this week hired
its first editor-in-chief to help users
find the most interesting videos to
watch the new editor formerly worked at
Wired and CNN that's all for this tech
