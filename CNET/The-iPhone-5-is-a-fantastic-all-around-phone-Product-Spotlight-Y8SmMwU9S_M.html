iphone history there are a lot of
features that a lot of people wanted to
see in iphones over the years that
haven't been there faster 4G LTE may be
a lighter design a larger screen well a
lot of that has been incorporated into
the iphone 5 and it's what makes it a
really go to pick among all iphones and
among all smartphones right now because
of the fact that it's finally got
features that match up with competitors
and yet somehow been put into a device
that's really light and doesn't really
sacrifice battery life compared to other
iphones it doesn't have Android
obviously but if you want iOS it's the
one to go with and it is a overall very
slickly designed device with a fantastic
camera a really nice screen a really
nice design and there's really not much
to dislike about it other than perhaps
maps and the fact you're gonna have to
connect a different connector for a lot
of your accessories unlike a lot of big
screen smartphones the iPhone 5 is
discreet its compact and it still
manages to fit in a larger screen and a
lot of great features that we've been
waiting for it's a fantastic all-around
phone and it's one that a lot of Android
users are going to md 2 i'm scott stein
and that's a look at the new iphone 5
