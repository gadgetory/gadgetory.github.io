hi I'm Eric Mack for craved i'm here at
Colorado's San Juan River where I'm
going to be torture testing the Kyocera
torque which is a ruggedized
military-grade smartphone its 4g on the
sprint network and we're going to put it
to the test and see if it lives up to
its claim that it can be fully submerged
underwater they savor up to 30 minutes
in a couple of feet of water and it's
also shockproof so I'm going to combine
those two abilities today and going to
take the Kyocera torque for a quick
whitewater raft trip down the rapids of
the San Juan right here you can see one
behind me but just to make a little more
interesting going to do it without the
rest what is a little rough so we're
going to try this anyway and let's see
how this holds up if when we take our
first rabbit you're supposed to be doing
this with a tube
after inner tube but I kind of forgot
that so let's just see what happens
okay so quick wrap-up actually took two
runs down the San Juan with the torque
here and it survived pretty well a
couple of issues whenever went
underwater most times winner underwater
it did seem to actually stop the video
recording there is one there's a little
bit of footage work stayed running under
the water there and also after the first
run the sound on the recording one's a
little muffled we might have a wet
microphone issue might need to dry out a
little bit we'll see so I suppose if
you're an aspiring Jacques Cousteau this
might not be the phone for you use mic
still want to get some more advanced
underwater equipment but in terms of you
know surviving some pretty extreme
conditions that would knock any other
smartphone out of commission for quite a
while if not permanently it's definitely
living up to expectations
and if you're under 25 just google shock
do stuff for crave</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
