and I'm here with the inventors of the
Firefly LED guitar pick Brandon Williams
and Peter home right welcome guys six
for coming so this is a prototype of the
Firefly LED guitar pick and it actually
has a built in algorithm inside of it
that learns your playing style so can
you guys tell me a little bit about how
it works
yeah well it's got an accelerometer in
it which senses playing motion either
picking or strumming faster slow and
accelerometer drives the Bank of LEDs in
it so the accelerometer essentially that
creates a link between the lights and
the music that's being played which with
the nearly instantaneous response times
means that it can kind of dynamically
adjust as you slow down you're playing
or speed up you're playing the flashing
of the light follows the rhythm of the
music pretty smoothly so how did you
guys get the idea to make this LED smart
pick well we were talking about how to
make an LED guitar pick kind of how to
take an LED guitar pick idea and just
make it blow minds
we were just talking about it at lunch
one day and we thought evolution sensing
perfect you know and having a you know
things we can head to that LEDs you know
and then we're thinking like flashing
guitar pegs but then we wanted to take
it one step further you know and have
like the you know the L a dict our pic
that flashes when you strum and then we
added you know the rechargeable
lithium-ion batteries this it's just
like a huge thing now
it grew but I mean the core idea was
that there's not really a lot of
lighting effects out there that are so
intimately tied to the music I mean this
is impossible to separate from the
rhythm of the music so we just thought
that would be a really cool addition to
the sorts of options that are out there
for creative lighting effects
so this is a tiny pic how were you guys
able to fit all the electronics inside
this tiny piece of plastic so it's a
three millimeter pic about so all the
electronics inside of it and the board
have to be and the battery have to all
fit inside yeah not easy and not easy
not easy or sitting that's a really long
time to get all this stuff worked out
and so we have like a 2 millimeter
battery inside of it and like a really
thin circuit board we have a little
sample this is the new prototype of this
circuit board right yeah it's like gonna
be the production thickness I mean if
you ignore the components the board
itself is a quarter millimeter thick and
the prototype board is about 1.5 a lot
thicker but yeah and this is the
thinnest circuit board that any fab PCB
fab offers race day
what is the battery life on the pic how
long does the battery lasts how long
does it take to charge with the USB
connection yes it's the battery life is
really dependent on you know how bright
we have the Odie's because the LEDs use
about 95% of the power and the playing
in the plane yet so if you're doing like
a lot of fast Jeremy so if you're doing
all fast drumming currently as it is now
you should be able to get you know one
to two hours of play until the audience
a little bit about the Kickstarter and
how they can find you guys right well
you can find the Kickstarter @ks dot
Firefly pick com
that's probably the easiest way to get
to it our goal is $30,000 but it's going
well we're at 80% funded and we got two
weeks left two weeks left everybody go
to Kickstarter check it out support the
Firefly pick and it's awesome thanks
thank you guys for coming in we
appreciate coming and shutting it off
it's a Firefly pick on Kickstarter
everybody check it out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
