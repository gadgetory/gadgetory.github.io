the Samsung Galaxy Tabs or no now this
is a rebranded Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 tablet
loaded with nook apps and features and
available for 179 from Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
stores and Barnes &amp;amp; Noble com if you're
already familiar with the Galaxy Tab 4
7.0 tablet you know that there's nothing
new with the hardware here the tab 4
note has the same measly 8 gigabyte
storage capacity with support for up to
32 gig microSD cards it has the same 1.2
gigahertz quad core processors that's
suitable for sliding through menus and
things like that but it kind of chokes
on high-end games like dead trigger 2
and the tablet has the same cameras 1.3
megapixels on the front 3 megapixels on
the rear neither one is very good
no the tab for nook is all about reading
specifically reading things you bought
in the next shop there's a lot of
content to be found there over three
million bucks and plenty of magazines
and newspapers to subscribe to the tab
for nooks 1280 by 800 pixel resolution
display normally wouldn't be much to
write home about but it suits the device
well and text looks nice and crisp video
looks fine to the real story here are
the Nook apps and features that boosts
up the experience the most obvious
feature inif profiles these let you
restrict the content on the tablet to
particular users that's perfect if
you're sharing with new kids the nuke
today app will keep track of what you're
reading in your library and offer
recommendations while the nooks
highlight app keeps any notes you make
in books in a single convenient place
one of my favorite features sits right
on the home screen it's a little icon
that looks like a book press it and
they'll put you right back to whatever
you were reading last really convenient
so the Galaxy Tab for Nook is a nice
little package especially at 170 $9.99
after 20 dollars to move it and there
are plenty of neat things being offered
including a bunch of free magazine
trials some TV episodes and movies and a
bit of store credit just for buying the
tablet if you've owned previous nooks
and approaches lots of things from their
store and also a fine option if you want
to continue that collection especially
now that the Nook HD and the Nook HD
plus have been discontinued now it's
true that a lot of this could have been
taken care of with app downloads for
premium and much nicer Android devices
but getting it all in a complete package
budget price is a pretty good deal
provided you're already a fan of Barnes
and Nobles in the ecosystem the rest of
us we aren't really missing out on much
I'm Nate Ralph thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
