now we need a hack test rating I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update when we talk about car safety
soon we'll have to also think about a
car's cyber safety when vehicles add
wireless features to connect to the
internet it opens up the possibility for
a car to get attacked by hackers not
only are there concerns with privacy and
tracking but also it's quite scary to
think about a virus taking control of
the brakes and steering all it takes is
a flaw and security wear something
downloaded from the entertainment system
sends commands to the cars main controls
car hacking was a hot topic at security
conferences taking place recently in Las
Vegas and one group is proposing a
standard for the auto industry to guard
against these new security concerns the
group called I am the Calvary unveiled
the guide to create a five star
automotive cyber safety program and it
also posted a petition at change.org to
raise awareness and support from the
public if you think these worries are
overblown take this into consideration
last year two researchers demonstrated
how a laptop connected to a Ford Escape
could hack the car's computer and
disable the brakes while the car was in
motion if it can be done with a laptop
connected can it be done wirelessly this
year those same two researchers assess
the schematics of two dozen cars to find
security flaws and they ranked what cars
could be the most hackable remotely
these guys didn't actually try hacking
all the cars but rather they judged how
the car was wired topping their list as
most vulnerable was 2014 Jeep Cherokee
the 2014 Infiniti q50 and the 2015
cadillac escalade what makes a car
susceptible to hacking is when something
like the navigation system the radio and
bluetooth run on a network that's
connected to the engine and brakes
chrysler and nissan said they are
reviewing this research and when it
comes to high-tech on the road not
everything is in the car the Scully ar1
is a motorcycle helmet that has a
display similar to Google glass and that
display shows footage from a rear view
camera with
180 degree view the point is that it
eliminates blind spots and it can be
faster to look at the display in front
rather than glancing down at the
rearview mirror which the company says
makes for a safer ride it also comes
with GPS navigation and it can be paired
with a smartphone and controlled with
your voice it's designed so you don't
have to interact with it while you're
writing the company is taking pre-orders
now at a cost of fourteen hundred
dollars and it's expected to ship by
mid-2015 that's your tech news update
