of cnet.com and everyday I work with a
really large staff to decide what we are
going to publish on SEANET the reviews
that we're going to write the videos
we're going to shoot I do a lot of
thinking a lot of talking and a lot of
emailing my name is Mark Mandel and I
had product design for CBS Interactive I
oversee the design teams that create the
the product experiences for our websites
or mobile websites and native
applications
hey I'm Arielle Nunez I'm a video
producer here at scene it I shoot and
edit videos daily and I got to play with
the iPad pro as a video editing suite
the form factor it feels like a
full-size tool whereas before I
preferred the the mini for its compact
form its portability it's something that
was just really easy to put in my back
pocket and take with me but that came
with a lot of sacrifices in terms of the
fidelity of the work that I could create
I the metaphor I'd say is it was going
from a toy to a tool as a person who
consumes a lot of media it was really
nice to have lots of room on the screen
to really sit back and relax with the
content but I have to evaluate every day
particularly good for video watching
video which I do a lot of is that's
really nice to have the keyboard having
the keyboard was really nice it made the
iPad pro seem like more of a video
editing tool you could do things like
hit the spacebar for pause and play you
can also hit the arrows so you could
scrub frame-by-frame which could be a
little bit hard if you're just scrubbing
with your finger and although it wasn't
necessary it was nice having the pencil
to do edits like trimming which might be
hard to get pretty precise with your
fingers and also pulling up small menu
items it's got a great way I like it it
feels good in my hand it's got what I'd
call a shock absorber in that when you
you use it it does react there still is
an artificial feeling of kind of a glass
on glass effect and that doesn't always
emulate a brush pen or pencil type of
experience some styluses they have a
rubber tip that
comes over the top of the hardbound and
that way when you draw on the tablet it
emulates the drag that you get from a
brush or a pencil and as you use the
side there's a resistance that you get
and you don't get it with this one and
that's something that I miss so it was
really easy to pick up and figure out
how to edit right away I think anyone
who has no experience could easily grab
this and figure it out I would recommend
anyone new to video production to go
ahead and look into this you have all
the tools you need to create a nice
piece and you can edit 4k I would
recommend if you want to do more
intricate editing if you want to do some
compositing some key framing you should
still stick to a laptop or a desktop for
that I don't know that I would run out
and get it as a productivity tool I
think it's still something that I really
love as a consumption device but I think
it takes it to a deeper level that is
further than I thought
yet maybe not as far as it could go to
replace my laptop I think right now I
would say that this is a really
compelling device for anybody who needs
to use the pencil and anybody who needs
to see a lot on a screen if this
executives are creative professional I
would say I think you're really going to
love it and I think you should get your
hands on it so that you know what's
coming in the future
I think if I were talking to somebody
who works mostly with spreadsheets
somebody who really is doing a lot of
number crunching I'd say stick with your
laptop for now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
