and now the company is going after your
living room with the new fire TV
streaming box with voice search
superfast load times in gaming this
clearly isn't just another me to
streaming box and it's already a
best-seller on amazon.com the day after
its release
hey I'm Matthew Muscovy ak from C net
and Amazon's first livingroom device
isn't quite what everyone was expecting
it's not a chromecast I'll stick and
it's also not aggressively priced coming
in at $99 which puts it in competition
with premium streaming boxes like the
Roku 3 and the Apple TV the hardware
feels first-class it looks like a
thinner more square Apple TV and it
blends nicely into a typical TV cabinet
around back is a solid connection of
ports you've got HDMI optical audio
Ethernet and USB
although the USB port isn't used for
anything yet the included remote is
excellent with the shape that's easy to
hold in a simple button layout that's
not too cluttered
at the top there's a small microphone
built into the remote and that's for one
of the fire TVs signature features voice
search hold down the button say a TV
show movie or actor you're looking for
and the fire TV will find the content it
actually works pretty well in our tests
except that the search mostly only works
with Amazon Instant content occasionally
I saw results for Hulu Plus but it won't
show you what's available on Netflix or
other services which really limits its
usefulness
now that emphasis on Amazon Instant
Content carries over strongly to the
user interface
nearly all the menus on the left-hand
side lead you only to Amazon content and
even on the home screen there's no
ability to customize it so you can't put
say the Netflix app right at the top the
interface itself looks really good and
it's very responsive as you scroll up
and down through the menus but it's
really best if you primarily stream
Amazon content otherwise you have to
hunt a bit to find the other apps as for
third-party apps the fire TVs initial
selection is good but it's not great
there's some solid ones like Netflix
YouTube
Hulu Plus and Pandora but it's also
missing HBO Go Spotify Vudu and PBS what
the fire TV is missing and entertainment
apps it makes up in gaming the fire TV
software is based on Android and Amazon
has poured it over some popular games
like Riptide gp2 bad land Minecraft
Pocket Edition and The Walking Dead the
fire TV also worked with Amazon's new
fire game controller which is sold
separately for $40 the game controller
itself is a solid piece of hardware and
it makes the gaming experience pretty
good the graphics are impressive for
$100 bucks and the controls feel
responsive the only slight issue is that
the fire TV only has about five point
three gigabytes available for installing
apps so with some games coming in at
over a gigabyte you might run out of
space quickly on the performance set the
fire TV has a new feature called ASAP
that's designed to load streaming videos
faster the amazing thing is that it
actually works Amazon Instant content
loaded in a split second it's faster
than any other streaming box I've tested
however again the ASAP feature only
works with Amazon Instant content so
don't expect Netflix or Hulu Plus videos
to load any faster so altogether the
fire TV is an impressive living room
debut for Amazon integrating some neat
gaming functionality into a streaming
box plus there's some standout features
like the voice search and ASAP super
fast loading times on the other hand the
best features really only work with
Amazon Instant and at $99 plus 40 for
the game controller there's not quite
enough there to push it past competitors
like the Roku 3 or Apple TV so overall
it's a solid first effort from Amazon
but it will need some key updates before
it could compete with the best streamers
out there I'm Matthew Muscovy ak and
this is the Amazon fire TV</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
