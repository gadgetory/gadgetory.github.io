yesterday
the thrill of higher learning the taste
of jerky the smell of bong water and the
sound of my 56k modem desperately
clawing its way onto the Internet and
this top five were counting down the
best back-to-school tech gifts any one
of which would have seemed like a
miracle when I went to school starting
off at number five an all-in-one printer
there's nothing cool about it but you
just got to do it seen it's top pick is
this $80.00 Epson that can copy print
and yes it still sends faxes your kid
will groan when they get this but it'll
save their hide when they're printing
their turn paper at 4 o'clock in the
morning number 4 get them a real camera
if you don't all their college memories
will be nothing more than a series of
Instagram pics scattered across Facebook
our top pick here is the Canon EOS Rebel
t3i it's so good they'll be earning art
credits in their sleep at number three
give them some mindless entertainment I
know it sounds counterproductive but if
you want your kid to skip that kegger
give them a good reason to stay in at
minimum send them off with a $60 Roku HD
but if you want maximum vegetation try
this 50-inch editor's choice panasonic
TV and then seal the deal with a sony
ps3 slim of course all the real work
they'll be doing is going to be on a
computer which slides in here at number
2 they already have when they're
comfortable with you could throw in an
iPad for a little extra ammunition but
if they need a serious upgrade the Dell
Inspiron 14z is our top choice for
students now before we get to our number
one back-to-school tech gift here's an
item worth holding off on an iPhone all
the rumours are pointing to a new model
coming out in the fall which is sure to
make the current iPhone feel pretty
uncool that being said having a
smartphone on campus these days is so
essential that it tops our list at
number one even if they're dead set on
getting that new iPhone 5 when it comes
out you need to send them off with
something our top pick here for students
is the Droid RAZR MAXX has the battery
life to keep up with all day use and a
kevlar design that's very forgiving for
scene that's full list of gift ideas
check out back-to-school at CENTCOM
where you'll find a gift idea for any
budget and for more top fives like this
