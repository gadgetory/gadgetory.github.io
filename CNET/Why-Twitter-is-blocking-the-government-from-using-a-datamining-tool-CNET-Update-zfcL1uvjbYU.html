government espionage I'm Bridget Carey
this is your cnet update twitter has cut
off US intelligence agencies from
accessing a data service that sorts
through every tweet providing trend
analysis the service is called Data
Miner and many companies including news
organizations subscribe to it to get
alerts of when events may be unfolding
based on tweets popping up on the
network that means it could be used to
detect a terror attack in real time but
here's the twist twitter says it has
never authorized the company behind Data
Miner to sell its data to government
agencies for surveillance yet some
government agencies were paid to use it
The Wall Street Journal broke the story
and spoke to sources that said Twitter
is putting pressure on Data Miner to cut
off government agencies so why does
Twitter care who uses the data well now
that we're living in a post Edward
Snowden world technology companies want
to make sure they distance themselves
from government agencies as to not
appear that they are helping spy on
their users Twitter and other tech
companies need you to trust them with
your data meanwhile on the other side of
the social networking pond you may have
noticed a new option pop up on Facebook
this Sunday Facebook added a thankful
reaction alongside the icons for like
love and the moji faces the thankful
reaction flower appeared on Mother's Day
I've reached out to Facebook to ask if
its permanent or temporary but as of
filming this report Facebook has yet to
reply and Facebook isn't just focused on
flowers the network is rolling out a new
section in groups called discover it
helps you find more groups that may
catch your interest it also shows groups
that your friends joined there are many
categories of groups including some for
buying and selling items but one thing
you won't be able to buy is Facebook
branded food a Chinese company
registered to trademark for the name
face book two words but the social
network fought and won the trademark
battle what would a Facebook drink even
taste like probably has a shallow taste
yet seems filling with a full-bodied
self-absorbed aroma every few sips and
unwanted flavor just pokes at your
tongue and it pairs well with a site of
judgment
from your family and coworkers that's
all for this tech news roundup you can

studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
