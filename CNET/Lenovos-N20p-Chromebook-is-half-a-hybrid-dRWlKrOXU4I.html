more with a touchscreen and some other
fun features i'm dan ackerman and this
is the lenovo n 20 p this oddly named
Chromebook is almost like Lenovo's yoga
line they have a yoga chromebook now in
that it has a it has a touch screen and
it also has a special hinge that's more
flexible than usual it goes down like
this and then it keeps going but unlike
the yoga line it stops right here at 300
degrees and that lets you set it up kind
of in like this kiosk mode or you could
do it like this in kind of a table tent
mode but it doesn't go all the way back
just sort of the stand mode and the
regular pc laptop world Lenovo calls
that the flex line as opposed to the
yoga line which does go all the way back
let's see my kind of a cost-cutting move
away to kind of differentiate one line
from another lenovo also has a chrome
book called the yoga that goes all the
way back 360 degrees that's intended for
the education market kind of thick and
heavy and chunky and expensive like four
hundred fifty dollars at least this guy
is much more modestly priced this
configures about 329 and it's thinner
and lighter I consider this a pretty
sharp-looking 11 inch laptop whether it
was chrome or windows or anything else
running chrome of course you have to be
aware of what a Chromebook is and what
it isn't it's basically an online only
tool to get two different web services
through the chrome web browser so if you
use gmail or another webmail you know
that's great netflix and hulu things
like that work great if you need to
install apps like let's say photoshop or
something like that that's not going to
work although there are usually online
alternatives pixar is a good example of
a web-based photo editing tool that's
kind of like photoshop and can work in a
pinch and of course you need to have
access to Wi-Fi all the time pretty much
to use this system otherwise it's just
going to sit there and not go online and
not do anything that said it's a little
bit more expensive than some other basic
Chromebooks so which can be you know two
hundred two hundred fifty dollars rather
than 329 for this but you do get a
fairly nice build quality from Lenovo
and you get there excellent keyboard and
a pretty large touchpad which are
definitely better than pretty much all
of the Chromebook keyboard and touch
pants I've tried so far
dan ackerman and that is the Lenovo n 20
