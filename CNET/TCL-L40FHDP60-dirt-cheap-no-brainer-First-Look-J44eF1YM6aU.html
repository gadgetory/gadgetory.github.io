this is a review of the TCL le40fhde3010
specializes in low-cost LCD TVs and as a
result its TVs are very popular on
online retailers I looked at my first
TCL TV about six months ago and it did
have some problems but you know what the
newest l4 TF HD p60 despite its apparent
random number generator name is both
cheaper and better than the first one
it's also a little slimmer as well and
this solid glass stand is a nice touch
for a cheap TV at its current price of
three hundred and nine dollars online
you can't expect any features though it
does have a USB port for playing back
media but what really matters is how
well it can playback pictures and in
this case it's surprisingly good
the original TCL was a matter of fun for
a while but its reputation was saved by
some truly terrible Panasonic and LG TVs
but the new model is better than some
TVs that sell for a grand black levels
are excellent at the price and shadow
detail is much improved on the old model
though images can still look crushed at
times but its color fidelity where the
TV comes a bit undone with bluish skin
tones and there are some backlight
clouding issues which leaves black
scenes looking splotchy if you have $300
right now though and can't budge on the
price then the TCL le40fhde3010 debrief
for cnet.com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
