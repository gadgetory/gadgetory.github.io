10th episode 225 of the 359 podcast I'm
BBG and in the house for what is an
alleged repeat of 4/20 we have been Cox
Ruben and Alfred and good morning quit
whining good morning what does it have
to do a 420 okay it's like we're talking
about weed today did we talk about weed
on 4/20 I I mean no I'm saying I have
the date 420 Oh
what does 4/20 have to do if we'd come
on I'm already feeling pretty tight
right now
shut it down everybody okay so Alfred
wrote quite a few pretty impressive
stories and so leaning on you will be
leaning on you for the podcast today
we're going to be talking about a
vending machine that you includes
biometric scanner so you could
potentially verify age and therefore buy
weed and booze like through a vending
machine like a normal person
like a normal person and also our second
part of our series on West Point this
one focused on the cyber defense
exercise that's an annual competition to
do like mock cyber defense wargames I
guess is what you could call it also a
little bit more on the echo show and a
plug to Microsoft build which is going
on right now as always send in your
questions and comments BVG we'll get to
as many as you can at the end of the
show without further ado let's podcast
in three two welcome to the 359 I'm Ben
Fox Ruben I'm Alfred aying a company
called American green machine is
developing a smart vending machine that
could develop oh sorry that could
dispense weed and beer thanks to
biometric scanner that could verify
someone's age it's not available to the
public yet but it could be a quicker way
to dispense way too expensive beer at
the ballpark
alfred you got a chance to check out
this thing what did you think I mean I
think it's pretty interesting that it
can like cut people off after they've
gotten too much so at a stadium if you
go and buy like five beers from like one
side of the stadium and then the
bartender there's like you know you're
not give we're not giving you any more
dream look pretty wasted yes that but
then you could go to the other side of
the stadium where there's another
barr√© there and then that person
doesn't recognize you just buy more
beers from that guy yeah but like that's
the whole point of these machines
whereas like it recognizes you based off
who you are and you're laced on your
account yeah and you're like biometrics
so it doesn't have a fingerprint reader
it has a vein reader where it doesn't
like stab in it's like a infrared laser
that scans your insides kind of like an
x-ray but not as intrusive mm-hmm and it
scans your veins which is oh you know
more unique than your fingerprints are
like identical twins like still have
like different veins on the inside my
mind is blown yeah so it bases it off of
that so it's able to like kind of like
limit you and it follows you on your on
your account so like if I go to one
vending machine on one side and I go to
the other vending machine it know like
hey dude like we cut you off after like
five drinks yeah but like how soon is
this going to get to the public well
they're aiming to get this in
dispensaries and you know stadiums and
casinos within the next like two months
or so they're in talk sweet they're in
talks in places in like San Francisco
Las Vegas and like the tri-state area
and like New York Connecticut New Jersey
as far as like dispensaries goes it's
it's like kind of an easier way for them
to like store it in there and then like
people who can come like after hours
like they don't really need like a guy
working there and like Manning security
for it and all that stuff the challenge
is that they can't do with a credit card
yet so it's like either cash or like
debit for now because dispensaries like
are a cash operation right that that's
gonna be kind of frustrating and they
don't they don't tell your age by like
your fingerprint or anything like that
though it's it's kind of like a bar
where there's there's a person you have
to get an account set up by a physical
person so you still have to go and like
show your ID first and then that person
sees your ID sizi is like okay let me
make an account for you and then after
that you don't have to show your ID
anymore you can just go and put your
finger in and get the marijuana sweet
what could possibly go wrong
Alfred you also wrote about the cyber
defense exercise at West Point
it's an annual competition that requires
cadets to build a server and protect it
from NSA hackers what was it like being
there I mean it's really cool what
they're doing for like military cadets
to kind of learn about cybersecurity and
cyber defense because it's such an
important aspect of you know warfare
your future yeah pretty much I mean you
look at all the hacks that happen just
like the last year alone
and you take a look at you know what
these cadets are doing as cool as it
sounds though it like was not like that
like crazy like whatever you you man I
was I was defense I was there with you
and it was it was kind of chill while we
were there but you know it tends to go
up and down also wanted to mention
there's a startup called nucleus which
claims that it basically its idea for a
touchscreen enabled intercom got ripped
off by Amazon with the echo show are you
buying that do you see some similarities
there I mean I think I was the same
shape but I don't buy that at all like
to say that like oh they stole our idea
to have a screen like no right right
like its Alexa enabled it's got a
touchscreen it's got an intercom plus
Amazon is its biggest investor okay but
my point my point is that like you know
how like Ford is like announcing their
whole like car like Alexa enabled car
okay yeah imagine like if like after
like a year or two years from now Amazon
comes out with like their own like Alexa
enabled car they're not before it's not
gonna be like oh they stole our idea for
a car it doesn't make any sense okay
like it's a screen okay it's a it's a
screen it's a car last we just wanted to
mention that we are covering Microsoft
build which is going on right now expect
to see more Cortana scales a bunch of AR
and VR stuff check that out if you want
to read more about these stories check
us out on CNET I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Alfred Aang thanks for listening so
we've got a question in the chat from
Matthew doctor he says how big is the
company that will be storing our
biometric data will it be nationwide and
how secure will they keep our
information so we have a legitimate
concern about this like ah I thought
we're just gonna crack jokes all day now
I know that that was a legitimate
considering quite when it was asking
about they didn't have their CTO on deck
for me to like kind of probe into a
little bit more but they basically said
it's as secure as we can make it which I
feel not right it's supposed to be
nationwide it runs it basically runs on
the cloud but the thing is that their
Wi-Fi data entry point is that's not
their own security so these are these
vending machines are connected to the
cloud and they have a thing in the back
that you can either plug in Ethernet
port into or a
like a moat like a Wi-Fi card kind of
thing like a Verizon or like t-mobile 18
whatever really just any kind of like
mobile hotspot kind of thing that makes
it connect to the cloud but the problem
with that is that that's basically the
onus is on the vendors in that it's like
if I bought one of these vending
machines and I personally put in a Wi-Fi
card where all this data all your
biometric data all your account
information all that is going online and
it's connected definitely to you because
you're like vein data and all that stuff
and I just don't set a password for it
like that it could be a problem
yeah that's on so it tell me if I'm
wrong about this but if some of my
information is going to get stolen I
feel like I'd rather my vein data get
stolen okay well it's not really not
about that though the issue is that it
like because it's tied to your account
it's kind of like your Amazon where like
it remembers all the things that you've
ordered mm-hmm so I mean it doesn't have
my credit card on file yes I mean it
should but it's got your veins on file
this is analogous how Blade Runner got
start with that relic ins that's not the
point though lighter you go you're right
that's what I was trying to get the
point isn't about like oh just because
it doesn't have your credit card
information you look at like a
dispensary in like Nevada that had their
like logs of people that like use their
dispensary like leaked online hmm and
then it's just like okay well this
person like smokes like this much weed
and then this person like bought like
that's the thing there's the risk of
like that data being leaked where it's
basically you know Oh like been bought
like 20 pounds of weed from this
dispensary
last have you bought weed I hope you're
not watching mom I don't like I
definitely I I know yeah
it's it's a lot away I wouldn't really
care that much if people had my vein
data number one and number two if they
knew how many beers I drunk drink what
does he do like it's like been bought 20
pounds of alcohol tabacco think we need
to rework your measurements look at the
imperial system right still the only way
I'm doing it so we have a few back and
forth in the chat about whether this is
a good idea or a bad idea just from the
distribution standpoint like whether or
not you agree or disagree with a drug
paraphernalia is beyond this
conversation this is about does this
make it more secure does it make it more
liable does it Italy makes it more would
you be interested in hear from you if
you are in fact a then this is by no
means some kind of like confession do
you think that you would use a system
like this if you were to allegedly uh
purchase these substance it makes it
more reliable and BP seemed like I'm
like a vendors like standpoint where
basically like you buy one of these
machines and it's like twenty thousand
dollars which is a lot of money but like
you compared to like the salary of like
a like a pharmacist or like a bartender
and it's only it's like five hundred
dollars a month for like okay wait a
minute is this an automation story I
mean you put in bartenders and
pharmacists out of work because I can't
get on board with that well yeah I also
go to any missions anything about a lot
of my subs yeah yeah I put my finger in
it just like a regular bartender wait
Matthew dad also asks how long until the
first weed then the machine is knocked
over and stolen with a pickup great
that's a very point great point I asked
them about that and then they basically
said like well wouldn't they rather
steal like any team that has cash in it
I'm like well it has marijuana but the
other thing is they have a camera up
front on it and it's always connect as a
cloud so that data is like always there
which is another creepy aspect of his
machine because it's like wired for like
facial recognition so like if it sees
like a man or a woman going up to it
it'll like serve up like a different ad
based on like what gender it is which or
age and I'm like oh that's cool that's
totally normal
I have very feminine features so I hope
that I don't get the wrong ads we have a
number of people in the chat who think
like let's just stick with the old way
of doing this sure and it's luck it's an
idea what is the point what is it's a
novelty right now what is the point of
CNET if not to just tell you all the
stuff that were that's minion
development and some of its going to
stick item if it isn't I can see this
being used in like some kind of like
pharmaceutical aspect not like the kind
of pharmacist where you need like you
know a proper amount of dosage or
anything like that but like robitussin
or like tylenol and things like that
because like a lot of like pharmacies
will cut off like if you try to buy like
X amount of coughs here because you're
trying to do like cough syrup things
like 20 pounds of cough syrup I love
dark seer things but you're not allowed
to buy a certain amount
or like some amount of like certain
kinds of medicine so that was just
called doing puffins when I was growing
yeah yeah the thing is the thing is is
that like I could go to like one CVS and
like walk over like across town it's
like take the train to a write to like
Queens and then go to another one kind
of thing and then lexing you know I have
20 pounds of cough syrup so things with
this is that like because it knows based
off like your veins like print that like
it would effectively be able to block
you from like all their machines yeah
it's like one of them I think the most
viable use case for this is in a stadium
because there are tons of lines
especially between innings or during
like half time or something those lines
get really really long it's really
frustrating and annoying if you can get
weed at a football game now know I'm
talking about the beer part so if you
could do faster dispensing with that
that would just help out the folks I
don't think that it's different yet
Ricky Oz got a movie theater right but I
don't think that it would get rid of the
people behind the counter it's not like
automation would all of a sudden replace
them they're already like completely
flooded with orders this would just
speed things up a bit more and actually
allowed to stadium to potentially get
more more beer sold and Danny Green does
point out that it'd be easy to abuse
this you can just you know call over
your buddy and shove your finger in here
we're good to go
yeah totally great I mean yes I did not
think about in advance of saying it here
then brought this up to me before but
like I mean you can do you can literally
do the same thing with like a human
being where like you can ask somebody to
go if you're not 21 you can ask somebody
to go to the store and buy beers for you
so I mean that nobody has ever done that
yeah history of mankind Danny Green
expands on this there's an issue to buy
marijuana like that because it's a it's
federally illegal to sell so again we're
still waiting for the states to kind of
roll out and get on board and
synchronize right that's why it's like
we touch base that's why it's cash-based
on and if the system is access to phone
lines or internet there could be a
federal problem so essentially we're
looking at our you know getting hunted
down very good point and then any green
and very always a steward very good last
name for this type of conversation yeah
I don't get it okay god Alfred uh Chris
Wesley old buddy Chris Wesley says yes I
feel like there's going to be a lot of
legal hoops I'll have to jump through
just to get this even going and that's
very true like I think
we're in Colorado that's why they're
starting slow with you know like their
like weed is obviously a part of it like
even with their name like American green
machine but like I think they're
focusing on the things that they can do
legally now with like right the Medicare
I mean like medical marijuana that at
its own or viable option create points
out um yeah for now it's a novelty they
also they also like told me like oh you
can also buy like maybe we're also
thinking about maybe putting like sex
toys in there or like viagra and I'm
like why would I want my why would I
need my own magic scanner yeah why would
I want my vein associated with that I
think the only reason to hand over your
biometric information for something like
this would be for like age age
restricted items
sure so like sex toys doesn't really
strike me as like why would like or
viagra or something like those two
examples don't really like make as much
sense to me all right
change in direction a little bit before
we get out of here today beefy tech is
asking for a shout out shout out the
beefy tech shout out to beefy - they're
just handing out shoutouts like yeah of
course I call the shots here okay okay
that's two beefy tech so we were talking
about what was the name of the Seco
competitor again nucleus the nucleus so
beefy tech wants to know what do we
think of this new echo design that the
nucleus is competing with specifically
the what we are reaction to this Amazon
I would say I will say that Amazon
totally could have gone with a different
shape but because it does look exactly
like the nucleus oh really now that
we're not doing the formal podcast no
I'm saying I'm saying that they copied
them say like they're arguing like oh
they copied us because they put a screen
on I'm like there's different arguments
to be had here we're like maybe come up
with a different form factor for your
screen we all ripped it off from the
Jetsons yeah yeah I guess but I I think
the the most problematic part about this
is that and I mentioned this in my story
Amazon has been a partner with nucleus
Amazon is an investor Amazon engineers
works with nucleus to develop the
nucleus and then they created what the
nucleus people would argue is
essentially a copycat how can they copy
something that they helped to develop I
mean that's and there one day I'm not
even going to answer that why are we
already having a conversation about copy
at this Amazon thing just became aware
yesterday we just became aware of it you
know it's like saying like well for copy
Chevy or vice versa however the hell
that word look I it's it's very hard to
say exactly going to be other edited
fake a turn phone magnified video phone
manufacturing that's called competition
yes that's the basis of capitalism like
that's gas I don't know I mean I think
this is a serious like step back it's
it's like a 30-person startup that has
to now go up against Amazon and Amazon
may have like just completely squashed
their business so you know to a certain
level I empathize with you know this is
the small business people that run
nucleus that thought that they had a
good partner with Amazon and now they're
they're pretty jaded and annoyed that
they feel like their ideas got stolen
going back to the initial question as
far as what do I think of the form
factor of the am is it the echo show I
don't think it looks nearly as like as
it should I mean like why is it such a
big chunky item I almost feel like maybe
they should have been able to like have
you put it on the wall so it doesn't
take up you when you bring up like the
Jetsons I think of it it's like a very
like retro futuristic thing it looks
like something like I traveled back into
like 1950 and then like I want to like
World's Fairs like this is what will be
in the future like videos looks really
stupid now like it you have a phone is
it does the same thing as your phone and
like it is basically a house smartphone
like imagine if you had your phone just
stuck it right dock at home at all times
that your new landline it's say me
yeah and it's such a step backwards I
have a land like we can make calls on it
now you know what else you can make
calls on your phone it makes no sense
like the phone feature which I will
admit is kind of cool on the on the echo
or like when I have that at home oh I'm
actually excited to do that when I get
home tonight yeah but like to buy a
whole new product just for that like if
you have an echo already like awesome
that's like a great like additional
feature but like to spend like to shell
out like 230 dollars to do that when
like you literally carry something like
this in your pocket at all times is
completely absurd to me I don't like the
exit I mean I'm not I'm pretty
indifferent to it but I like the idea of
having something that's designed to be
there to hold my recipes to show me
tutorials like I like the cook so that
is very appealing to me but again like I
said I already mounted the nuke on my
refrigerator so as I just grab my
I just look at that like follow that
along a little bit bigger screen yeah
help though when you're trying to you
know use both hands that hook and so on
and so forth by the way I do want to
caveat that none of us have actually
seen this product correct person so
we're looking at photos just like you
all are we're probably not going to get
one into the office for another couple
weeks because it doesn't ship until June
28th so my initial impressions are that
this doesn't really look very sleek but
at the same time I haven't had a chance
to like hold it you know put it on my
kitchen counter so after me I do want to
throw that disclaimer out after we
discussed it yesterday it made me think
like maybe they wanted to kind of fade
into the background they don't want it
to be a centerpiece
like that could very well have been a
design choice on their part because
everything else you know like the echo
dot it's very minimal they wanted to
kind of you know just see can you come
part of the furniture and you know they
want the large screen but they don't
want it to be gaudy maybe that was an
intention I mean I think voice
assistants in the home are like really
cool and like I have mine enjoy mine I
just I think the one with the screen and
like being one another like video chat
and all stuff I think it's gonna go the
way of like the tablet where like I
think people are going to buy it I think
people are gonna like it I think it's
really cool but like the upgrade cycle
is gonna be like super slow and then
like the people are just not gonna be
buying very good 93 years very good
point 2 3 yeah like the the replacement
cycle for something like yes especially
no age the form factor could be like 7
years yeah like once you have it like
what we really think about how people
replace to land their their landlines
back when they had landlines like you
buy one and that's it yeah yeah that's
that's what like that's the way this is
going for that for the names on low
maybe it has I'm sorry so close it up
for the day we kind of lightly touched
on this yesterday but do we think that
this is going to encourage even more
in-home development for Amazon smart
fridge smart vacuum I don't know
in a word yes yeah yeah I mean you have
to learn the clock is ticking until you
get like an Amazon IKEA bundle like a
full home build we talked about this
yeah Amazon house you just move in and
it's a house and like one of the I I
think one of the ships 22 days if you
have Prime one of the smartest ways to
think about this too is that you're
essentially paying Amazon 230 dollars to
have a screen that goes directly to
Amazon
right in front of your face in your
kitchen or your bedroom or wherever else
you want it and there is no other
retailer out there that can offer that
to you there's not a Walmart comm device
in your house right just there to sell
you Walmart stuff expanding on one more
comment from beefy tech asking about
what's up at the new fire TV I think
that the next logical step for them now
that they've put this video phone in the
kitchen is to finally just manufacture
and Amazon fire TV like an actual TV
television set yeah there's not a lot of
money maybe like a fire broke a minute
but you're talking about oh yeah Roku in
a collision set right like a Injun
regard where somebody else right and if
I could easily do that but I think
that's an another logical step where
just becomes part of the ether you know
you had the TVs with a built-in DVD
player now in the TV be the built-in
fire stick it could happen I think
that's a logical move for them but
that's just speculation
I like to see what what Google comes out
with now Apple may come out with its own
you know
voice assistant smart speaker I mean
like in a lot of ways Amazon you know
here's the footsteps behind them there's
a lot more competition coming down the
pike as far as these different smart
speakers are concerned
imagine Sagi brings it all home for us I
think the echo show is just a bigger way
to funnel customers to buy more on
Amazon there you go but Elio ain't wrong
shout out to imagine saggy let's wrap it
up
all right oh that's my job you doing
okay the 359 podcast is available on
iTunes tune in stitcher SoundCloud
Feedburner google play music and see net
baby of course on CNET alright we'll be
