September seven here at the bill graham
auditorium in San Francisco senior eight
oficina at Shara chipkin is here to give
us the inside scoop on what's going to
go down so shower it's all about the
hardware at this event in September
we're talking iphone 7 what else can we
see yeah so we're definitely going to
see the iphone 7 it's time for Apple to
refresh their smart phone line we also
are thinking we're going to hear about
the new Apple watch so this will be the
second generation of their device the
last one they announced almost two years
ago and it came out last spring so we're
really looking for an update with that I
want to talk a bit about the actual
invitation itself so the invite is a
little bit cryptic there's some bouquet
like the out-of-focus areas of a
photograph kind of hinting possibly at
that camera we've seen a lot of rumors
about to a dual lens camera for the
iphone 7 what's the likelihood of that
being a part of the new handset yeah so
a camera update is a definite whether we
get the dual lenses you know that's
we'll see on wednesday there's talk that
that will only be in the higher end plus
version which right now the plus version
of the iphone has a better camera than
the regular one so if you're going for
the bigger device you know it's more
expensive but you're definitely getting
better photos with that so apart from
the camera what are the other room is
pointing out in terms of features that
might appear on the next iPhone yeah so
some of the features were hearing about
our things that rivals like Samsung
already have one of those is
waterproofing so you'll be able to take
this into water for longer also a
pressure-sensitive home button is
something also Apple could bump up the
amount of storage so instead of 16 gigs
for the cheapest version you could get
32 so there's also been a lot of talk
about Apple ditching the headphone jack
in the iphone 7 now if this comes to
fruition and we actually see that there
is
do you think all the vendors are going
to follow suit is Apple kind of going to
lead the charge in this area we've
already seen some other people do that
and you know used to even seem like
Samsung and some of these other guys
release new headphones that are
specifically blue too I think that this
is probably the future as much as we all
may hate it at first so I think you know
I think we'll see that from apple and
we'll see from other people too sharra
thank you so much and make sure to stay
tuned to cnet com from nine a.m. Pacific
on sep tember 7 for our live show and 10
am-4 the keynote itself</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
