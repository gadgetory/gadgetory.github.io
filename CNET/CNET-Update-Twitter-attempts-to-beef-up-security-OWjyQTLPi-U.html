Carey and this is your cnet update
twitter is adding more security when you
sign in to make it harder for someone to
hack into your account and Twitter's
doing this because there have been some
high-profile accounts hacked recently
including the account for the Associated
Press this extra security is called
two-step authentication you could turn
it on by going into your settings at
twitter.com and every time you login
you'll have to enter a six digit code
that's sent to your phone as a text
message Jennifer Lopez has a new
wireless company called Viva movil which
is targeting the Hispanic market and
through a partnership with verizon viva
movil will sell the same devices and
plans sold by verizon Lopez's chief
creative officer of the brand which will
have 15 stores opening up this year and
these stores will cater more to the
growing Hispanic demographic in
different ways for example employees
will be bilingual and stores will have a
children's play area and Lopez says
that's because Hispanic families often
shop with their children and these
stores would offer more devices for
people to test out before they buy those
all sound like pretty good improvements
maybe other stores could take a lesson
from JLo android users can now create a
digital archive of receipts with the
updated google Drive app with the scan
feature you can use the phone's camera
to take a photo of your receipt and the
text on the receipt is searchable that's
all thanks to optical character
recognition the Google Drive app also
added new ways to edit a spreadsheet
cell and a new app worth checking out is
called next door it's a social network
for people in your neighborhood to post
news about what's happening it could be
anything from a garage sale add to a
notice about construction nearby or
babysitter recommendations it's existed
as a social network on the web for about
18 months now and it just launched an
iPhone app with Android coming soon I
spoke with next-door CEO nirav Tolia and
he said the app will be useful for when
you need to send a real-time alert to
your community about something urgent
like a disaster a crime or big accident
nearby and that wasn't the original
purpose for the site but totally
said there were hundreds of urgent
alerts sent to Boston community users
during the bombing and the same happened
with warnings about the tornado in
Oklahoma so to answer that need for
real-time alerts users can send them as
a notification or text message to others
in a private community right now there
are more than twelve thousand six
hundred neighborhoods using it and if
your neighborhood isn't on it well you
can start one and say you want to just
message people inside your apartment
building well you can make a private
mini network within a neighborhood
that's your tech news update you can
