how-to contributor and today we're going
to take a look at an upcoming feature in
Android 4.1 jelly bean that allows you
to disable notifications on an app by
app basis this will allow as Android 4.1
gets introduced to more devices as well
as the Nexus line in mid-july so the new
feature when you're viewing
notifications and your notification tray
you're actually able to long press on a
notification and you'll get the app info
dialog will pop up tap on that and
you'll see a new notification setting
here under a pimp app info where you
could tap on it you'll get a warning
make sure you know what you're turning
this off for and you'll no longer get
notifications for that specific app to
re-enable it you just check the box
again another way of going about and
getting to the app info screen is to go
into your settings tap on apps and then
you could go through and select which
app you'd like to receive notifications
for or possibly turn them off so now
notifications for the scope beta would
be off I'm gonna check it back because I
want those notifications and that's it
that's a quick look at a new feature in
Android 4.1 jelly bean that allows you
to turn off notifications on an app by
app basis this once again this was Jason
