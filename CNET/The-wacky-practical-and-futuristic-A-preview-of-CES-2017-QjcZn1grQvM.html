your car the technology at this year's
consumer electronics show aims to make
things around your home smarter and
instead of using just your hands to
control them you're using your voice
these are all about speakers connected
in your home like the Amazon Alexa the
Google home Siri integrations through
home kit so you can ask Siri to change
the temperature and do all kinds of cool
stuff like that brighter sharper
televisions are a big attraction and
this year there's a bit of a twist we're
gonna feel a lot of flexible screens a
lot of big curved displays on laptops
car makers have an even bigger presence
at the CES as they show off concept cars
self-driving technology and greater
connectivity with your home we're going
to see a lot about self-driving cars
we're seeing a lot about new ways of
manufacturing cars and new ways in which
cars actually talk to your house so
really exciting field here is what
happens when you're in your car and your
car can communicate with the rest of
your life wearables are moving beyond
smart watches and fitness trackers now
you can monitor contractions help grow
more hair or control your music so we
start to think about wearables not just
as something that you put on your wrist
or your lapel but as the sensors that
are integrated into your life all the
way across the board from your car to
your bedroom for the latest news on CES
