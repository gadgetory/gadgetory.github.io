look at the Toshiba radius 11 this is
another entry in the growing field of
laptop tablet hybrids that use what we
call the full-back hinge and of course
we originally saw this in the yoga a lot
of other guys have had it to achieve
actually as a 15 inch version of the
radius that does the same thing here's
their 11 inch version and if you haven't
seen these before hard to imagine it
starts off like a clamshell laptop then
you tilt the screen back and it keeps
going and you can stop in this mode
which we call kind of a kiosk mode they
say you can flip it around and use it
like a table tent I've never seen anyone
actually do that but you can do that
you keep folding it and then you've got
basically a big sort of thickish tablet
the keyboard is on the back here but
it's you know deactivated so you can
just use it either as a as a landscape
or a portrait tablet you can't lay it
down and just flat on the table if you
want like that and then just pop back to
the clamshell mode I think the reason
why people like these systems is that
unlike a lot of other hybrids they don't
mess around with that clamshell laptop
shape so you can just use it like a
regular productivity machine and you're
not really even going to notice that it
has any special hybrid abilities until
you want to use them what's different
about the radius 11 compared to some
other models is that it's a fan 'less
design so doesn't have any air vents on
it maybe will run even a little bit
quieter it'll come with Celeron or
Pentium CPUs other ones like this cost
between four and five hundred dollars I
expect it to be about the same for this
model and it should be out around the
end of October I'm Dan Akron and that is
the Toshiba rias 11</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
