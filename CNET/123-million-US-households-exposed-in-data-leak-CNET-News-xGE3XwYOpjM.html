security researchers up guard cyber risk
team found a massive database unsecured
online the data belonged to Alteryx a
data analytics firm which is a partner
of credit reporting agency experient
Alteryx apparently purchased the data
from experienced consumer view database
which combines public and personal data
up Guard says the exposed data reveals
billions of personally identifying
details and data points about virtually
every American household up guard
director of cyber risk research Chris
Vickery found the data on an Amazon Web
Services server on October 6th of this
year the data was easily accessible by
creating an Amazon Web Services account
so what was exposed home addresses
contact information financial histories
mortgage ownership and more names of
individuals were not in the database
Alteryx says the database is now secured
and the information in the file does not
pose a risk of identity theft to any
consumers up guard does not agree it
says that data could be misused for
spamming unwanted direct marketing fake
debt collections or identity theft
Experian was quick to distance itself
from the matter saying this is an alter
X issue and does not involve any
experienced systems do these leaks freak
