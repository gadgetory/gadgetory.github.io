Tania we have a battle for the title of
the best seven-inch screen tablet it's a
prizefight watch out between the Amazon
Kindle Fire and the Barnes and Noble
Nook Tablet our judges for this fight
are David Carr annoy
Eric shake-and-bake Franklin and the
ladies man
Bryan Tom will take all three judges
blind scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth of a point the final prize
fight score will be an average of all
rounds using the same decimal system
let's throw some bows round one is
design
neither of these seven-inch screen
tablets is going to wow you
especially with Amazon showing off
arguably the most generic tablet design
we've ever seen it's heavy for its size
but it's not ugly
just forgettable now the note tablet
definitely pays attention to style with
its silver border and unique design
details like a flap for its SD card slot
and a corner that you can accessorize
which I personally don't care about now
it's the slicker of the two and the note
tablet takes this round with the four
and the Kindle Fire it gets a three next
rounds controls and user interface the
Kindle Fire decided that having the
fewest buttons possible was a good idea
but having no physical volume buttons
and an awkwardly placed power button on
the bottom center it just stinks now
makes up for it with its own custom
Android interface that shines in its
simplicity and the software update makes
the carousel more customizable now the
Nook Tablet has a power and volume
buttons in the right place that we
appreciate there's a home button that
should make things simple but their UI
brings up pop-up menus tasks bars and
drop-down menus that they don't even
need to have it's not a super complex UI
and it won't be confusing but the less
is more rule should have been followed
here the Kindle Fire strikes back with a
3.7 and the note tablet gets a 3.3 so
after averaging two rounds the Nook
leads by three tenths of a point round
threes features
the kindle doesn't really come with many
hardware features it has eight gigs of
storage space with no expandability and
it's depending on its cloud service to
pick up the slack if you're connected to
the Internet
it also has 256 Meg's of RAM but its
biggest feature is for Amazon Prime
members will have access to free media
content now the Nook Tablet
is loaded with 16 gigs of storage space
but the trick is that most of it is safe
for purchases from the Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
store and apps while only one gig is for
the user to put whatever he or she wants
on it now the expandable memory card
slot supports up to 32 gigs of storage
and you'll probably end up using it plus
it doubles the RAM of the fire the note
gets a three point seven and the fire
gets a three point three next round is
web browsing to multimedia the Kindle
Fire touted its silk browser for its
predictive page rendering it's a solid
browser but I still really haven't been
able to feel two major benefits I like
how its controls are placed on the
bottom and it added full screen mode
with the latest update where the Kindle
Fire just kills it is with its Amazon
ecosystem for media content that's
integrated into the device for direct
purchases of music movies and TV shows
and the multimedia apps it supports like
Netflix Pandora and many more now the
note tablet holds its own when it comes
to its web browser
even though browsing on any 7-inch
device still feels pretty cramped but
aside from books and periodicals the
note tablet doesn't have an integrated
multimedia ecosystem for you to purchase
content you can use apps like hulu and
netflix to watch movies but you'll have
to manually load any music movies or TV
shows of your own onto the device the
Kindle Fire takes this round with a 4.3
and the note tablet gets a 3.7 so after
averaging four rounds the Nook still
leads by just a hair round five is
performance
you'll have a hard time noticing any
major differences in responsiveness or
load speed but the biggest difference
here is battery life now if we're just
talking video the Kindle Fire edged out
the note by 12 minutes with a total
running time of 6 hours and 42 minutes
of juice but when it comes to other
activities the note tablet bests the
fire by over three hours and that's a
pretty significant difference the note
gets a three point seven and the fire
gets a three this one's gonna come down
to who throws the last punch the final
round that decides it all is value if
someone asked you what's the best bang
for the buck in the tablet market you'd
probably say the Kindle Fire and we'd
have to agree it's $1.99 price point
makes it a compelling value with its
ease of use and especially for people
who are already part of the Amazon
ecosystem now the note tablet is a great
device with plenty of app support and at
2:49 it's really worth that price but
it's absence of a media ecosystem to
support a device that is really made for
media consumption is what hurts it the
most in the final round the Kindle Fire
gets a 4.7 and the nuke tablet gets a
3.7 so lets average out all six rounds
and in a battle where the note jumped
out early the Kindle Fire was able to
claw back into the fight and after six
hard-fought rounds we end up tied at
three point seven points a piece but you
know there can only be one winner so
let's take this to the hundreds of a
point and in another epic battle the
note tablet comes out on top three point
six eight to three point six seven and
is your prize bite winner i'm brian tom
thanks for watching we'll catch you guys
next time another prize five whoo what's
that
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
