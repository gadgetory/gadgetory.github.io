conference it just ended this is CES
2013 the first crest concert of the day
and one of the biggest pieces of news to
come out of that press conference was LG
is going to be shipping their 55-inch
oled TV the best of CES winner last year
and March for the price of 12 thousand
dollars so that's right twenty of twelve
thousand dollars you can be one of the
owners of the very first 55-inch oled TV
in the world now this set had is very
excited last year we're still pretty
excited about it one of the big benefits
of OLED you can see right here is
spectacular picture quality TV has
pretty much infinite black levels that's
one of the big picture quality benefits
that means that the blacks can get deep
as anything that you've seen on any TV
and deeper than any we've ever measured
the TV is also extremely thin LG's
telling us about a four millimeter depth
at the thinnest point so again you can
have this really cool sleek form factor
and only weighs about 22 pounds of
course this TV does not have the 4k
resolution seen on a lot of the other
TVs out there I guess that'll be the
next generation but right now you have
1080p resolution and of course LG is a
3d TV passive bunch of other smart
features but the real story here is the
display LG has changed the industrial
design a little bit I told this stand
may or may not be the final shipping
version the TV also may or may not have
the media box included which is a
breakout box we can plug in a whole
bunch of the necessary hdmi cables and
things like that those things are still
being determined for what version
actually hits us so shores as a company
is saying march for twelve thousand
dollars for the world's first OLED TV
and that's a quick look at LG's 55 a.m.
9700 the world's first shipping big
screen OLED TV I'm David Katz mark from
seen at CES 2013
