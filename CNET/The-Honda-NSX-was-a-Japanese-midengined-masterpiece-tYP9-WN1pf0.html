this
the NSX was the supercar of choice for
the aficionados people who valued
incredible engineering a certain
legendary test driver and handling
prowess over big flashy badges and over
abundances of power it's easily one of
the coolest supercars ever made and his
wife
Japan's first proper mid-engine supercar
was supposed to be a best of all worlds
affair fast enough to make a Ferrari
feel foolish and easy enough to drive
you'd have to be a proper spanner to
crush one the year is 1984 and Honda
wanted to make something a bit special
so it commissioned Pininfarina
to design a concept car the HP X Honda
Pininfarina experimental it came with a
2 liter v6 and it was designed to be
anything that came out of Italy or
Germany as the concept turned into a
prototype it got a new name the NSX and
its target cars with a Ferrari 308 and
later the 3 for 8 that's how it ended up
with a 3 litre v6 you know how the NSX
is cabin looks a little bit like the one
you're getting a fighter jet well that's
not entirely unintentional you see
Honda's designers use the f-16s bubble
as a bit of an inspiration because it
gives 360 degree visibility as such the
cockpits nice and far forward and
there's loads of glass in it so you can
see really well and that also means the
deck at the back is nice and long
which gives better high speed stability
the NSX made its public debut at the
1989 Chicago Motor Show then again at
the Tokyo show of the same year it went
on sale in 1990 in America as an acura
in Japan and Europe as a Honda it was a
flagship to be proud of Bill to
highlight f1 tech the NSX is loaded with
interesting things for example it's all
aluminium body saves 200 kilos open
equivalent steel one
things like aluminium suspension arm
save even more weight on top of that
then there's all the toys for example
4-channel abs brakes forged pistons
titanium con wrong the first electric
throttle control ever fitted to a Honda
VTEC basically loads and loads of cool
stuff to make sure this thing goes
proper quick I know all of that doesn't
sound too exciting today but well for
the 80s and 90s that was quite something
oh and it's development driver one of
them at least was a certain mr. a Senna
and when he drove it he told Honda's
engineers to make it stiffer and they
did because Senate told them to Honda
being hunter didn't just engineer the
crap out of it it also made sure it was
solid as anything each car was assembled
by a hand-picked team of 200 people each
with 10 years experience under their
belt even the paint had a twenty
three-step process one of which was
actually designed for aeronautics the
paint on this early model still looks
good today
the first NSX's came with a three liter
v6 with 270 horsepower 210 pound foot
and a nought to 60 226 seconds and its
top speed was nearly a hundred and
seventy miles an hour a porsche boxster
today would smash that realistically it
would walk all over it however for the
early 90s that was mental that was
proper proper quick so this is the baby
the first NSX the original one what's it
like to drive well this is an automatic
and the gearbox is horrible I really
really don't like it removes a lot of
engagement from the car because it
doesn't really like changing gear
however the steering almost saves it
because it's a little bit funny to start
with but once you pop it in you get lots
of feel the car grabs and away you go
throttle response thanks to the gearbox
is a bit lacking the interior for a 90s
car is actually held up remarkably well
this one being immaculate looked after
by Honda is beautiful it's so clean the
lines are so loving that they CAC
anywhere in all the original MSX
this one it's rather nice it doesn't
feel that quick because of its gearbox
but Honda prided itself on the fact that
the NSX was easy to drive that anyone
could get in it and still have a great
time
and it really is easy to drive the
steering's not too heavy but it still
gives you beautiful feedback you know
what's going on this isn't a hard car to
drive quickly at all even with this
horrible gearbox we've got a nice
straight foot now come on Carl
oh there we go
and break harder than that please cart
there we go
breaks it very much of an error but it
is very quick it's a lovely lovely thing
it's so easy to drive easy to see out of
easy to control but for the next trick
I've got something a little bit more
hardcore
in 1992 Honda decided to make a
harder-edged
NSX for customers who wanted something a
bit more focused something with more
bite engineers worked to lose 120 kilos
from a standard car so the type r weighs
in at 1230 kilos in car terms nothing
how it was done however is when the R
gets fum
it came with no sound deadening no
aircon no stereo carbon Kevlar seats
rather than something comfy tweaked
suspension to sold some early discovered
surprise oversteer issues and its engine
was blue printed as well so it was
properly put together like a race car
Honda made less than 500 of them and
they were supposed to be for Japan only
but a few escaped and this is one of
them
this is a 1992 car one of the proper NSX
type ours
and there are a few little things to it
as well as the no sound deadening it
will have you because it is quite noisy
in here especially compared to the early
one but you can hear the engine because
the glass in between the cabin and the
and the engine bay he's very very thin
everything that could be removed was to
make this a proper hardcore lightweight
thing the steering on this is absolutely
fun normal it's so precise you can bang
it into a corner you feel everything you
feel the front you feel what it's doing
it's dragging it you're pushing it but
you know where the tires are oh man the
ride is a lot harsher than the other car
it feels a lot stiffer but as a result
this feels more like a proper supercar
and less like a sofa well the other one
is very usable and you can use it every
day and you still get some lovely
thrills out of it this isn't a daily
driver it's true litre engine is
allegedly unchanged the one you get in
the normal NSX however because it was
looked at and put together and properly
blueprinted and all that feels are a lot
more sprightly that said this has a
proper gearbox a five-speed
and it makes an elegant oiss or what
we're doing 100 110 120 because there's
less weight in here because of the work
Honda's engineers did to ensure it was a
proper lightweight track special it
feels so sprightly it flies this thing
it just throws itself along the road
feels fantastic
why isn't Honda making a car like this
today this is proper this feels good man
the rides a bit hard the gearbox is
beautiful the steering is beautiful and
the noise it makes who needs sound
deadening when you can drive along with
this thing sauntering along behind your
head this is perfect
there are many varieties of NSX's that
appeared over the years there is a
japan-only type half which I'm in right
now then there was the aforementioned
target op the US only Alex Zanardi
edition which was built to celebrate
many many many championship wins and
then the frankly mental sounding
lightweight special NSX s and s0
editions which where they sound quite
scary to me
1997 saw some performance upgrades the
engine gained 200 CC upping it to 3.2
liters and it also got a dollop more
power they got a six-speed manual with
better ratios while the auto cars kept
the same old 3 liter set up a new
aluminium alloy was used allowing for
thinner panels that retained the
strength of the old car and it got
bigger brakes as such naught to 60 times
fell into the five-second zone even for
the Targa roof versions and in some
tests under 5 seconds were managed for
the coupe a
in 2002 the NSX changed shape it lost
its pop-up headlamps it got wider rear
tires and modified rear suspension in
the US you're only allowed to buy a
target op where is everywhere else well
they got the right to choose between the
t-top and a coupe a so how does this
feel compared to the original one
well the steering is markedly different
this is very much assisted and it
doesn't feel grey to start with but then
once you pitch it in it feels nice it
feels good the bigger engine 3.2 also
feels a lot freer it feels a lot nicer a
lot smoother a lot happy it's a rev that
might be important to the gearbox though
this has a lovely lovely manual it just
feels nice and light and easy to use the
shift isn't too laborious the clutch
isn't too heavy which often kills
supercars and because of the bigger
engine and the lovely gears you knew
this
and you feel the extra power as well it
does feel a lot fresher than the earlier
car it feels more like a car that made
its way into the naughties the other one
did feel very very 90s it was just that
little difference here that makes it
just that little bit better it's a lot
of response is beautiful the brakes
again wonderful and you can tell this is
quite light you can tell it moves around
a little bit but not too much it feels
stable where you want it to feel stable
and if you do something stupid
well it'll let you know about it it's
not too hard sprung either it is a bit
soft and squidgy it's still got a little
bit of giving it which might not be
ideal for people who love a bit of track
work but it is ideal for people who want
to feel engaged but also enjoy their
spines and don't like giving money to
chiropractors
usability of something that super car
manufacturers kick about all the time
nowadays they keep banging on about how
oh it's very usable there's lots of
space and there's lots of movement in
the car you can put everything in it and
you can use it and it's all wonderful
but actually a lot of the time that's up
to parts of top driving something like a
911 gt3 on a daily basis is hideous
you've come to hate it because it's not
practical it's too hard sprung it's too
uncomfortable it's too noisy whereas
this will give you the noise when you
want the noise it'll give you the hard
drive that you want but it doesn't
overwhelm you and I love the noise at v6
makes 3.2 litres of fun that is he's
fantastic it's not quite as hardcore as
they are which might be a little much
for idiots like me but this is the NSX
this is the easy to drive usable
supercar it's a wonderful thing I can
see why people absolutely adore these
things
in 2005 the NSX was killed it was a 15
year old car and wasn't selling all that
well and its innings had been pretty
stellar however before it went the way
of Betamax Honda had one last trick up
its sleeve the second generation NSX
Type R the second generation NSX R they
lost the tight bit because well they
like losing things in that a lot of
weight for example its curb weight was
twelve hundred and seventy kilos there
was carbon-fiber pretty much everywhere
no sound deadening no aircon no stereo
no nothing really
it was a balls-to-the-wall track car and
here's the thing even though it was 15
years old at the time it still managed
to do the ring in the same time as a
Ferrari 360 challenge to darling today a
Honda Civic type-r the new one would
humble it quite happily but man is a
serious bitter kid over its 15 year
lifespan the NSX gained a lot of fans
from kids playing with them in Gran
Turismo hi to grownups who wanted an
alternative to the regular German or
Italian fare it's quite telling just how
good the NSX was when Gordon Murray was
on the customer list and Jack Nicholson
he wrote the NSX is run was long enough
at 15 years that's fair to say and while
it was around it keep all kinds of ass
there's a new one on the way but it's
been delayed well Lots
I don't think though that's because of
any adverts developmental issues I just
think Honda wants to get it 100 percent
straight out of the box so it can have
another 15 years at the top</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
