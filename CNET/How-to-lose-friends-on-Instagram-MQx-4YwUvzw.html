best face forward on Instagram when
we're doing something cool but there's
that one friend that takes it a little
too far going to extreme lengths to
boast about their latest get away or
picture-perfect life and there's only so
much of your perfectly curated Instagram
life that people can stand to look at
while they're sitting on the toilet and
by the way what's the deal with bathroom
selfies
nothing wrong with the occasional selfie
when you're feeling extra fabulous but
if you've been caught making duck faces
at your phone in public you may have
crossed over to the selfie danger zone
and let's face it not everyone is as
into you as you are oh yeah another
thing most people aren't as into as you
are your food granted there are some
culinary experiences that truly warrant
a post but save it for those that
resemble art or truly make your mouth
water most meals are best savored in
private hashtag to hashtag mini hashtag
hashtags may seem desperate hashtags are
incredibly useful to cross horse
pictures from places and events and a
pretty well-known tactic to garner more
followers but use them wisely and in
moderation also never comment with more
hashtags seriously never
and then there's next level obsession
the only thing worse than too many
hashtags spoot shots and selfies
ridiculously retouched photos getting
rid of red I totally fine but smoothing
out your entire face to look like a wax
figure or someone else entirely well
everyone else in the shot looks like now
that's just false advertising and it
needs to stop</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
