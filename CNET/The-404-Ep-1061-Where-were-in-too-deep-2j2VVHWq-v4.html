implies such a thing because uh man oh

right now yeah yeah you're hungry I'm
hungry what do you want I thinks I'm
kind of in the mood for a cheeseburger
too yeah um perhaps a cheese but like a
cheese steak was watching that video
which video the video where you you did
an imitation of me oh right back up and
oh yeah we should we do our hands on
YouTube it's no I think you put on
facebook oh that's right remember that
it was in his office I did a good
impression of an dia it's like I would
like a cheesesteak turn on apple pie
this is it which is just silly no one we
need that maybe a cheesesteak rat like
with a pizza wrapped around it now I
would do that would be tasty and it's
actually a dish at a number of the
establishment the apple pie isn't that's
just gross it's just silly Jeff it is
silly it is silly we're off to a silly
start because today's the first day
before a long weekend yeah there's no
one here we're literally the only four
people in the office everyone else has
gone home early yeah I think they've
locked doors and we're in for the night
doc all right and there's no food except
for trail mix none of any machine do you
have plans I mean we're talking about
food here you go to any bbqs for
memorial day um a couple things hanging
out in the city yeah stay in town yeah
this is like the first weekend where you
can really stretch out your legs and
have that barbecue you know
unfortunately it's Memorial Day is
really for uh you know out-of-towners
well no I'm selling like what it would
it represents Oh what does it represent
you don't know how to represent I know
it represents tell us labor day it is
not labor day laborer day's labor day
yeah it's it represents the
memorialization of the soldier
moralizing right so you know we sort of
take that time to get fat and eat you
know hamburger and stuff like that right
it is like that sort of summer starting
point you know what I do every Memorial
Day show watched YouTube videos of
soldiers coming home to their pets
nice have you ever seen those videos
before I dog they are breaking yeah just
losing their minds so adorable I mean
that or like a lot of fathers will come
home and like surprise their kids in
class and stuff and be like a heartfelt
embrace yeah man if you want to get
cheesy I don't like and you know don't
get me wrong obviously any time a
soldier comes home and sees their
daughter or son and they're like oh my
god i don't like when they surprise them
i don't think that's feels like i would
freak out and i would just be like to
emotion that's the only they're like
they're like oh dad's not gonna come
back for another three weeks just
kidding here isn't like you put that's a
lot of trauma to put through like a look
at it yeah I agree you don't even the
kids like oh well you know what they
actually do go away to war or something
they're gonna be like come on he's gonna
be like no around the corner isn't it
yeah you're playing with their emotions
I think that they should make a montage
of the the soldier coming home to either
kids or dog videos oh there is yeah
there's plenty of women but the music
should be the the Rudy soundtrack
because that makes anything emotion you
know it's like for sure Dan tan-tan tan
tan-tan tan tan-tan tan tan-tan tan
tan-tan tan tan-tan tan tan-tan you that
for 10 more minutes I don't even I can't
even yeah I don't even know D&amp;amp;D hello
dad dad dad Dan tan tan tan tan tan tan
come on you know the song no I can't
draw from memory yeah you can't kid you
know the song yeah he got it it's not
that bad don't placate him Richard you
have no idea yeah seriously don't care
attendant attendant
Rui Rui Rui you didn't I could do that
oh that's all the dead Dante oh that's
done the other one no that's not right
I'm done species you don't know this are
just because Richard comes in out of
nowhere he knows it is exactly it's the
super emotional super soundtrack I'll
let everybody knew that song I mean I
know though I know I remember the film I
don't remember the score remember this
no but you remember that one that's like
like Dumb and Dumber that's the ultimate
whether you're the most of no exam no
but I'm serious like he comes in Meade
no yes he's like firm harmonizing
explain the trauma wore that one anyway
that was amazing alright that's one of
those moments right there ilysm it was a
special moment that needs to be
memorialized I think so ever well said
Mr Andy um let's switch into a different
gear shall we please my god please uh
couple stories want to get to in a
run-down today there's a lot of
interesting stuff happening sure uh I
wanna hear about this Deadspin article
arm that uh basically explains how you
can avoid being busted by the Facebook
cops of college sports yeah so
deadspin's had a couple really
interesting articles lately and uh you
know me I'm not a sports fan right I'm
surprised you were reading Deadspin cuz
Deadspin is basically like a tabloid
sports blog sort of thing yeah yeah no I
never go to this but it's been linked
out to a lot of other uh news blogs and
basically they've been talking about uh
schools monitoring their athletes for
illicit behavior so they broke this
article last week about this company
called varsity monitor right and that's
an external company that colleges pay to
um basically check up on athletes and
warn them on how they can affect may be
negatively affect colleges personal
brands come smart for their activity
outside of the field right so if they're
partying a lot or using expletives on
social networks and that can reflect
badly on the college and schools will
pay companies like this uh up to like
ten thousand dollars per app
a year to watch these guys it's almost
like PR it's almost like PR damage
control right for for college athletes
right what I understand is how come
these colleges don't I mean these
colleges make millions and millions and
millions of dollars off these athletes
in but then they have to outsource this
sort of like damage control thing well
why is that not internal it's because
these companies basically have one app
that these uh that the schools require
the athletes to install on their phones
that gives them access to all their
social networks whereas if the college
is it they would need passwords to each
of like Instagram etc still not a good
excuse which is still crazy though
because in their contract all these
athletes are acquired by the school's to
install the app so there's neckl know
their monitor isn't that crazy it's
crazy that n-c-a-a sleet's don't get
paid I'd I agree with you on that but
that's another that's an Edsel other
conversation entirely that's another
conversation for another day yes but uh
but yeah it's it's kind of nuts yeah
what's even more nuts is that here check
out the screen and you can view the
whole document here but um basically
there's certain key words that the app
uses to identify questionable behavior
yeah so trigger words are categorized
from a scale from 1 to 3 and words are
associated to this number so for example
the word bitch is a level one low risk
we gotta level one low risk red flag but
still raises questions the the most all
three are the worst so I'm gonna use
this quote Negro is a level three word
okay and all as was the n-word obviously
okay I think really yeah yeah yeah and
there's different categories or there's
racial uh so crackers one a gook is to
grows three okay and then there's also
alcoholic categories visually that that
can maybe identify like a crazy party
where someone's talking about it on
Facebook page well I was gonna say most
college athletes are under 21 right but
are they I don't know sometimes it
depends fifty percent fifty percent yeah
it's weird because those drinks are also
categorized what one two three scale so
like bombay sapphire is pretty harmless
at a level 1 z mzima 0 not even on this
team is a 10 because they're concerned
about any car
yeah that are actually gonna perform
well for that actually drink see exactly
am I Thailand road not on the list
you're off the team user mode goodbye
what do you think is that number two
it's a drinks it's a beard on Budweiser
exactly really bud light at number
walkies best walkies battery pop not on
the list but probably all these bestest
super popular beer monks college people
may because I had cheap it is that
that's one of the reasons that's what
about natty light natty natty as well
known at eli know what is its natural
light is when a dance for non that like
a 35 like a dollar seventy what about
that that bitter beer face beer i like
that beer you know like bitter beer face
that commercial with the guy and yeah I
don't know it's beer they're disgusting
Busch beer baby push push push possibly
okay I don't know what do you guys think
a level three alarming alcohol would be
so you're really nervous about Jack
Daniels not on the lucky Allah number
three tequilas ID number three yeah also
on there is Colt 45 so all the malt
liquors oh alright we were three cuz
apparently just do crazy shit you take
malt liquor also four lokos on there too
four loko should be a category 10 yeah
yeah for local you're just immediately
halt the common else should be on their
freakin redbull yeah and daggers on our
llega zygier's to go taste when the
Jayco three Jager Jaeger is probably the
most dangerous cordial it's not exist
yeah Jaeger is bad deer blood man it's
bet it's not deer blood yes its nickname
deer blood is but that's it's clearly
not deer with an old wives tale it's
clear they're clearly not bottling deer
blood no but it's I mean it's not dear
but human blood but it's like haha you
don't believe me it's not human blood
distill it let's see without you it's a
B+ a negative o- it appends on the
fermentation period the season it's
bottled all your crazy sexual categories
really weird to so again later keywords
here that lightly cause college behavior
is about their athletes behavior of so
for that at the number one category um
bj okay so bj is pretty harmless right
now
co j HJ those are both on the list at
one I was a DJ HJ should be one is a
flag on Twitter ok yeah he should be to
you think no I don't think so because
what if it's like there's lots of got a
nickname bj what's up BJ let's hang go
get grab a burger chicken cutlet
sandwich yeah let's go do something like
that it's a bj let's go get a cutlet
sandwich on facebook that happens yeah
and then you're crazy yeah else number
two the work this is what it tapped debt
so literally wit dat yes in the phrase
tap debt is number two never tastes
worse than talking actually about some
ways and at the name of the riot on sure
the tap that app tap that that would be
a level three it's not it's that easy
yeah yeah not if it was tap that app
that's too that's a mouth right number
three is the weirdest though tread
lightly no it's not bad the word gay is
a number real re alarm yeah really on
the four varsity monitor this is mind
blowing that they have all that they've
somehow categorized I want to know the
methodology yeah I want to know the the
you know the method behind the madness
yeah yeah yeah it's very bizarre yeah
that's interesting story that is an
interesting story is very mutual when we
get back we'll talk about something that
is really making headlines today and
we've talked about something about it in
our past basically about why society is
failing young men and we have a good
example of that right here hopefully he
can speak to such a thing right after
this stick around a lot more 404 on the
other side of this break this is the 404
mr f'ers the show where we all sing song
welcome back to the 404 hope you enjoyed
your break as did we we got a three-day
weekend coming up I'm super excited as
you should be ah no show on Monday
celebrating Memorial Day which is Justin
mentioned celebrating Labor Day right
that's right and uh-oh Memorial Day the
day we're all together and do labor and
then okay so so check it out so four
episodes next week and then I'm going to
e3 a week from Sunday vacation from
haven't really figured out what's going
to happen while I'm gone but we will
before then in but we will and we figure
it out a week from today sure and let
you know what we from today okay cool so
that's that uh interesting topic that's
made headlines today and yesterday i was
watching CNN before i left the house
this morning and they had an author on
who is basically claiming that society
the internet and what have you easily
accessible pornography and other
undesirables according to sermon
professionals quote on quote
professionals and this is actually the
woman right here Nikita Duncan doctor
Nikita Duncan enough she's a doctor huh
um she's a doctor oh no it says it says
dr. Philip Zimbardo and Nikita Duncan so
I think it's Nikita's not a doctor
Tetris anyway she was on CNN this
morning talking about how film TV
internet pornos basically removing the
natural sort of evolution of a child's a
male child's life right and you know
eliminating the experiences that maybe
possibly every young man should have
growing up and saying that the access to
these sorts of stimuli are curbing the
way children interact with other people
right so mr. Andy yeah you spend a lot
of time alone you
navigate through some of the worst
places on the internet on daily basis
the ghetto of the infinitive you will I
mean no but seriously what do you think
about this claim because I immediately
took offense to it because number one I
I feel like I don't know we we grew up
were all relatively the same age we grew
up in a time where the internet wasn't
as pervasive as it is now right maybe it
became like more on our mid teens is
when the internet for me was like really
really starting to kick up and get going
so I guess you know that this Nikita
woman on CNN said the average child is
exposed to porn at the age of 11 now
which I thought was awesome I don't I
think like to put it bluntly it's all
crap I agree I don't know where you can
position orders I think it's crap it's
sensational they pick like a handful of
movies like art imitates life life and
imitates art sure it's like a vicious
circle but I you know you're gonna say
three slackers from you know some movies
video games and porn and there's a huge
promise with men in society they had the
the playboys and behind this again in
the 50s they did you know it's arguably
easier to get your hands on a playboy
than it is to go right when when when I
was that age getting your hands on some
like that wasn't tough I mean yeah I
guess it will it's tougher than getting
online but what what is the what is the
statement access to pornography earlier
just I mean that's what is it's
basically saying that the way human
beings have have developed in society
for the last hundred years or whatever
but the articles talking about in
relationship to mend though yeah just
like yes saying that like men don't have
a positive role model in bridge but it's
it's a bunch of things that they're
saying that it's the lack of American
fathers raising their own kids uh
they're saying it's video games
distracting boys from learning how to be
a positive male figure and then also
it's uh the internet taking a
distractions away from school work the
average teenage guy plays about 13 hours
of games a week that's 676 hours a year
or if you want to just call it the
entire month of februari
right I don't uh I'd we pick februari
with leap year without leap year go
after yourself I just think that um no
it's with I just think that uh you know
thank you you're welcome i don't think
you know i don't think that could that
could be replaced with anything he
could've been pledged comic books
replace with listen it's a diversion
record we have more things to occupy us
and cause right procrastinate correct
sir yet say to me that that that's the
reason kids aren't growing up to be men
yeah you know i buy much more the the
the American father the American parents
I mean there's there's probably you know
bad dads and good dads but mm-hmm I
don't buy the fact that but popular
culture internet porn our movie I mean
it right I agree I don't think your
games are having a dramatic effect on it
I would the whole popular culture is not
but you kind of see it right do you not
with what's popular now and the way
people act I think what different
specific just the whole Jersey Shore
phenomenon like how that affects people
and what people think is good in bed
yeah and the way they treat each other
to an extent but I think the vast
majority of people see it as a parody
and they're not going to be like these
are my role modeling pleasant lately but
that it's always been like that people
were always their role models its blown
to a little bit of a greater extreme
because it's on television but I know
came in for the accessibility the
internet is kind of interesting because
no one ever talks about how easy it is
to do something positive with the
Internet exactly things like like Khan
Academy for example that basically has
video tutorials on how to do everything
there's like Codecademy if you want to
teach yourself programming if you have
that positive influence in your life you
could do anything on the Yankee you can
start a Kickstarter if you have a great
idea or put your thoughts down on a
tumblr there's no so much on the
internet good point MIT an open open
courseware an MIT on your tip of
education right literally has every
single you course lecture every
available if you're gonna let a kid go
in there and do whatever he wants he's
gonna look up porn of quarantine he's
gonna play video games all day long
that's what I'm saying though
in VA make sure but you know why these
on the internet we are progressive wait
so you you all of us can remember yeah
that time when it was basically like
okay here it is yeah the Internet's
yours all the glory days like that that
original moment in a specific moment but
when you had a decent connection feeling
and you were like here's the Internet
any music what are you gonna do right
was the first thing it was like hi
narrators erotic like how can I blow up
a building know it was like you know
well but this is I think there's another
point here too it's it's you know
America is much more conservative than
Europe in terms of sexuality right it's
that you know obviously increased
globalization with the ability to share
you know ideas content with your it's
just a different thing there and I don't
think that uh you know their opinion
sexuality negatively even in when
children exposed to it relatively is it
is a bad thing it's a natural thing so
why would that specifically you create
problems in terms of the development of
male-specific right now I think a lot I
think they're more worried about social
interactivity like that's become that
too that's the focus at least for the
interview i watch this morning was that
was the the negative influence I don't
like the movie but the subject to their
like why are we obsessing over people in
knocked up and hall passes what so 20
years ago when we were obsessing over
people in what stripes and you know
movies like that you know i mean like
it's the same sort of thing they put
like four movies and i don't think
anybody's like oh knocked up i want to
be that guy that wants to be unemployed
Seth Rogen yeah right who knocked
somebody up with no money no one wants
to be that it's a freaking comedy like
people are you know animals decades ago
to not everybody joined a frat and
Dragomir every single thank you Animal
House there's countless example although
they are sort of you would maybe want to
have that yeah as a young when I saw
that as like a 14 year old I was like
that
it's kind of cool you know the article
that we're talking about here makes kind
of good point about video games an hour
to play devil's advocate all you've done
that no I know but they're talking about
how video games may be tied to attention
deficit disorder and it also cites this
uh research at Iowa State University
they're saying that um let's see uh
eighty-five percent of all stimulant
medications are prescribed to American
boys not girls so my question to you is
do you think that this is that video
games are inhibiting the ability for
American boys concentrate on the
schoolwork because they're so distracted
all the time huh y absurd season it's
not video games like oh I don't know
video games are the most stimulating for
me you could do we've talked about that
before like you have to immerse yourself
in the game and that's the point is kind
of like remove your side everyday life I
feel like yeah I can't you know anyone
who never plays games it's tough for you
to specify I'm asking you I think I
think they're super engaging um I just
also think that if you watch a baby hmm
if you watch a three year old who's
watching TV you are not getting their
attention either right okay but don't
you think that kid's gonna be so bored
when he picks up a book at school
because he's like oh man I can't control
anything in here nothing is blasting at
me right now I don't know I don't make
it so bad i think that video game would
would you know potentially you know help
somebody's concentration I think they do
right hand I aging I think it helps your
concentration when they're playing video
games but I I that skill is it just
doesn't hold over have some type of foam
mat but but if there if if you're saying
that video games distract people yeah
right bull when they're playing video
games what else should they be doing you
know I'm saying not while they're
actually playing like when they stop
playing it comes time to do some that's
far less stimulating they're not able to
focus as much because that was those
video game by that really hyped it up
for and by that no nobody likes to do
math except for like three people like
it was the same now as it's been like 50
years ago yeah now we're just like oh
the reason they don't like to do math
right because video games you know
people love to do math back and day yeah
no I was
today the alternative to video games
weren't video game like you know I mean
like the alternative to books weren't
video games why do they were when when
you talking they're like going outside
like even when we were kids no yeah
there are video game there were arcade
yeah and we went to the arcade and you
can get it as easily you had to have
someone drive you to your right because
that money still wanted to do now that
it's alcohol money so much more exciting
if you make the argument that
potentially you know obesity kids are
fatter because they're staying in the
play video games instead of yet going
outside abide by that but I know I don't
buy the the concentration because I
think anytime you have something
interactive the benefits far outweigh
the negatives I also somebody in front
of a TV then you know which has been
around much longer sure I think that
that could potentially harm someone's
ability to focus chattering up a lot of
good points uh Nick Jay jack says
they're just trying to turn video games
into a scapegoat I think video games are
not and will not be the last scapegoat
it was rock and roll it was the
telephone it was everything I'm not
saying it's just video games are you
helping yeah well that's why you know
what the only thing I think video games
are doing and and and this sort of leads
into what you were saying is that it
doesn't make it makes everything else
pale in comparison that's what I'm
saying should schools need to compete
with the engagement that a video game
provides for a child no but at the same
time I would learn a lot better in high
school if they made all my math classes
deal with hockey stats yeah I mean so I
feel like yeah maybe you know you gotta
play a little you know give and take a
little bit and figure out a way to
engage people outside of of their home
because yeah when I was young when I was
in high school right I want to play
games because we really are boring books
were boring even when there was no
alternate or not though they're not
because if when you're in high school
and you read The Odyssey mm-hmm that
stuff is awesome that's really cool and
someone who's super into fantasy and
games like they'll dig that yeah so
there's ways to do that you know what I
mean it's all about engaging people and
school has gotten this BS gotten is such
a big reputation it's god that's got to
change I think it just doesn't evolve it
hasn't really evolved that's key because
I think that you know
like thatI today relate to things
differently because they're sort of born
in this world where you know they are
born with the internet have access to
multiple forms of technology so you know
relate to them in that level in terms of
what you're teaching them relate to the
way that's that they take in information
um whether it's in terms of interests
like you mentioned hockey or just you
know mediums you know more computers
more via games on those line my dog in
the chatham says hey reading can make
your eyes go bad too don't forget about
that good points to it also makes you
super tired so we're telling all the
parents listen to the show is use the
four hundred dollars you would spend to
buy an xbox for your kid and donate that
to the school's technology program right
because then that will that will make
them more engaged yeah they're not gonna
hurt and it will be at home they're
taking out all these extracurricular
activities using anyone would ever do
that I don't know it's not my problem
right now your parents your parents we
don't have kids that's a world burn
schools go down in flames is what we
have to say yeah the point is that
there's never just one thing to
scapegoat the TV it's not video games
