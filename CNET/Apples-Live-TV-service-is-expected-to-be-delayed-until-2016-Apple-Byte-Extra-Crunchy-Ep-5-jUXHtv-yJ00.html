home so when I go there I just eat all

completely disconnect and it's the best
my question is do you think apple is our
squint o brasil brasil also for the
record uh I know you guys all won't
swore me like this but if you guys are
in the Bay Area and i happen to have
time i do have been able to give people
some tours of our studio um for about
like 15-20 minutes because i think it's
like the least I could do for all of you
that watch and support all the things
that we're doing I think it's really
like badass and I appreciate it so if
you guys happen to be in the bay and you
want to take a tour of the cnet studios
I just got to email me at a do you
have a public email or sit down I'm not
gonna get I'm gonna do you like I mean
do you have one that's for the public no

don't want to get too flooded okay just
do apple byte just do the apple byte it
seen it it's uh yeah it's the apple byte
at cnet com and I'd be more than willing
if again it just depends on my schedule
if it works out I've had to turn down
people before but you know just want to
let you guys see kind of what we do here
you'd be able to check out this podcast
studio with me and Steven um you'll be
able to check out the main studio that
we shoot in and just kind of some of the
different things we do so it'd be all
good why do I periscope on an iphone
instead of an android phone it's because
it's my phone that's why that's why
alright obviously an Android lover ya
mean if a if it times out maybe we'll
get one of you guys as a guest on our
show for fun just don't be an idiot what

smell smell of bacon smell of fresh
donuts probably up there all those
hearts what camera do you guys use at
the main studio I don't even know which
programs are using the studio you'd have
to ask that's a good question sushi when
you go into a sushi restaurant though it
doesn't have a Chamorro it doesn't have
a smell which is good the best sushi
doesn't have a smell once you get right
up in there bacon with Nutella Antonio

okay everything's back as DJ makati says
it was acceptable in the 80s how do I

gonna do way more than the iphone 6s

building in San Francisco it is the
apple byte extra crunchy with your host
mr. Bryant ah ah ah all right everybody
welcome to apple byte extra crunchy it
is episode 5 we took a little break just
like for kind of like a half a week
because you know sometimes the schedules
don't work out and we got to make them
all work out so we are here we're back
full live loving it except if you
download this podcast but this is the
extra crunchy apple white podcast for
all those extra things we couldn't talk
about in the show more news more
articles more new fun stuff if your fan
about all this stuff this is where we
talk about it all also Steve
Beachum is the man into morning show
hello good afternoon whatever time it is
reward is good night hello during your
siesta during your fiesta whatever it is
siesta siesta so we're gonna jump into
it and this is the news of the day it is
Friday August the 14th it broke my heart
but my heart can be repaired pretty
quickly according to a Bloomberg report
Apple is said to be delaying their live
TV service to 2016 as negotiations with
the networks have stalled and this is
when I saw this they have reported that
the Apple TV will still be coming and
we'll talk about that in a second but
this is the big news of today the
biggest thing that I see here and really
more telling than anything is Apple has
been used to getting their way Apple is
always used to getting their way you
know when when the record industry was
floundering and they needed to find a
new way to make money Apple came in as
the Savior and they negotiated really
low margins or really low prices so they
could make large margins and make money
off of that it's not the same with TV
networks and movies they don't need
Apple especially in this climate where
every major TV network is already
building some sort of streaming product
right CBS just did it our parent company
by the way CBS pga tour which i watch
all the time just kicked me up i used to
watch it for free now they're like four
ninety-nine a month bro oh wait wait
wait no so they had an app that you said
I need to watch their club if you had a
cable yeah subscription correct correct
but now they're like no we're gonna
ditch that no change or you have to pay
for 9am I guess what you do you're going
to pay for ninety-nine a month is your
come on let me know all the networks are
getting on board with this so I could
see how Apple's having a big problem
negotiating this deal so here's some of
the details of what's happening Apple is
trying to negotiate their own kind of
package and the prices that are being
thrown around this is from Bloomberg is
around the most popular channels for
forty dollars a month okay that's about
half the
price of a current cable bill now for
consumers if somehow Apple was able to
swing that hell yeah we'd all be on that
but guess what the the content creators
the network they're not going to let
them do that I can totally see Apple
saying this is our iTunes user base
these are customers these are our
whatever 15 million credit card accounts
that we have here this is what we want
and the content creators are like you
think you have you think you think you
can tell us the price no look sling TV
it took them old for a while but they
kind of understand that they're gonna
make their service available i think
it's around like twenty dollars they
don't have all the channels but they
understand the pricing Apple is clearly
coming into this with like this is the
price we want and that analyte and the
content networks are just like it's just
too late to the game come basically yeah
you either come play ball with us or you
don't totally different ball game it
makes emit it's going to be difficult
now will Apple get this done yes are
they going to push for every you know
penny they can yes but it's not like
they can just come in here run the show
and it's a different world so just to be
clear this is like Network live
television on Apple TV right well
combination combo yeah so it could be
mine live in on by me okay I'd imagine
live is the hardest thing to yes for
sure yes this is like so many different
licensing things you have to do with
live versus internet blah blah so okay
we'll see what happens live is the
private right now here's another factor
that's being thrown around here is that
also according to the report people
won't reveal their actual names
obviously what's going on but according
to this report apple also doesn't
necessarily have the bandwidth and
content distribution network in place to
even support a full rollout even if they
were able to lock down all the deals
from all the content carriers really so
that makes it tough right Apple has
worked with akamai technologies they
have servers obviously around the
country they're they're based in
canberra juice 'it's apple also has
their own you know they've been working
on their own data centers as well they
have four data centers California Nevada
North Carolina and Oregon all right so
right now
that where's there's there's not much
East Coast action over there now and
that's where most of television is it
would so delivering that content you
don't want hiccups that's going to be
part of the experience too so the apple
TV will come out but all this live TV
service that that we're talking about
it's gonna still Beal is still gonna
take time just get an antenna guys it's
like don't 30 tracks well you could get
it you could get an even you're setting
your hand you're stuck in your
television at home yeah for over-the-air
yes total but it looks great it's HD I'm
yeah if you guys don't just watch local
stations and aren't big sport bucks even
if you're the problem with me is that I
am stuck on cable because of sports yeah
Sports is the biggest thing man i watch
NBA all day every day NFL as much as I
can I mean those are my two main sports
my face ball you know here and there I'm
not gonna propose and pretend to be like
my buddy lose my buddy works for mlb.com
so they do that they have a big network
that just screens and screens of
baseball games that they're streaming
and they're probably gonna do the same
thing the PGA Tour did yeah kick
everyone out and say all right alucard
499 here you go so you know we have
people watching on periscope I'm curious
if you guys think that the service will
actually come out in 2016 or could it
even be pushed out to 2017 hmm i've got
him at they've been talking about
they've been trying to work on this deal
for years already yeah I I remember when
we started hearing about this at least
three or four years ago yeah so it's
just not that easy people thrown out
2017 people thrown out 2016 it's she
wasn't 16s close guys well it's very
close it is and well there's also you
know we're talking about the story a lot
and we're going to talk about other
things there's also financial
implications because Apple stock has
been dropping recently and what is that
indicative of investors and banks don't
think that they have enough momentum
moving forward if they were able to pull
off this live TV service the estimated
revenues would be somewhere around two
to three billion dollars now that is
kind of small in Apple's overall picture
but that's two to three billion dollars
that they aren't going to be getting any
time soon yeah iphone sales are
flattening we know ipad sales are
declining significantly you know every
Apple needs a new revenue source and
it's some sort of a subscription model
we have apple music but we don't know
how many people are going to stick with
it after three months I my hunch is that
not many people not me I already signed
or turned off the auto renew thing so
write me yeah they don't got me like you
checked it out you're like okay it's
okay right now i'm curious well we'll
kind of pull the periscope errs watching
right now what they think of Apple music
like are you gonna keep your
subscription service or are you gonna
move on I I'm gonna move on yeah I mean
already have to so many other options
that already got part of so moving on
moving on moving on as we move on just
to kind of follow up an addition to some
of the stories that we came back from
laughs a lot of people are saying moving
on nope moving on move on move on no my
whole fam org people people with Apple
music like that can share it within a
family I think that they're all on board
again more than I think Apple music is
really great if you've never owned a
detailed physical collection that you've
collected over years before it yeah cuz
once once it fiddles with your
collection and messes it up it's you
hate it I know I got to admit though a
friend of mine had Spotify and the car
the other day and we were just like
listening to everything he's like oh
let's go listen to this new album from
this band I was like oh you can do that
okay great No so it was kind of cool I
will say though Apple music does have
the exclusives if you're a fan of Nine
Inch Nails Taylor Swift Pharrell mmm
they put out some exclusive tracks that
make it appealing but overall you know
yeah i'm just gonna bite you man it's me
a lot of people are saying moving on but
there are people there that do love it
and I I also understand why people do
it's just going to be a smaller
percentage of users really love it
versus the people that I can I can get
something somewhere else all right
moving on just to kind of follow up from
a story that we did last episode we were
talking about the prospect of Apple
being an mvno mobile virtual network
operator basically acting like a cell
carrier Apple outright denied that last
week Wow they just said no and it ain't
happening and you guys all know what
that means
they're gonna be a cell carrier not
really I think that they're squashing
those rumors directly Apple never
addresses rumors but they squashed it
right away uh have they probably flirted
with the idea in their head yes I still
love the idea of them actually becoming
too cell carrier we talked about that
right yeah I think I mean it would be
awesome I mean really cool and it would
be even more powerful but yeah they
would be more than I mean go could you
imagine though any right now a phone or
a phone service that wherever you went
it would switch to the best signal now
adays on the carrier not that I need a
delightfully come on I'm getting moist
right now not really gross I just fed up
didn't I make myself and you throw up in
your head at the same time I apologize
all right um it uses a kind of follow up
when we're talking about the Apple TV a
BuzzFeed report and yes we're talking
about BuzzFeed here I'll show the thing
is that I do want to throw that as throw
this out there the managing editor for
BuzzFeed's text section used to be a
reporter for all things d removed over
to BuzzFeed so like when you hear oh
this report from buzzfeed everyone's
like what the hell why are you quoting
BuzzFeed but John pics Kowski is a legit
story breaker that's cool so therefore I
think want to speed BuzzFeed is making
moves hiring some yeah super legit
people right now like I do a NPR thing
with NPR marketplace every day and
they're like they just swooped up their
producer yeah Matt she's like bye guys
let's feed everyone talks about buzz
because they know about their listicles
right thirteen ways you can apply peanut
butter to a hot sore but exhausted there
there are thirteen ways let me tell you
but um so but their new their overall
news coverage that are also trying to
build this legitimacy which they have
but it just kind of changed that
perception because we all know what we
think of buzz I think it's facebook
video jokes exactly so according to John
paczkowski over at BuzzFeed Apple is
planning an intent intending to hold a
special event on sep tember 9th this
month that will feature not only the
iphones but it will also feature the
ipad and the Apple TV without
live TV service is this the right
article right here this is no it's okay
I don't care that's it right people
right well better listening can't see
that that's it's not but it's okay which
I'm i click on it it goes to that really
I don't know what something's wrong with
your computer something is wrong anyways
oh those are the products that we're
gonna expect to see typically apples
broken up there iphone event from their
ipad event if this is true they're gonna
throw everything in there one that's a
lot of stuff yeah I breaking up i pad
from ipad wait they're gonna debris yeah
they're gonna bring them all get one
okay yeah that's gonna be a long we're
gonna be in this room for like five six
hours if you guys don't know we do live
coverage of all the Apple events and
that will be a long day yeah you know
what i want that ipad pro i can't stop
talking about the ipad pro that's the
one with the keyboard special keyboard
well it has a keyboard layout but now i
want big i want to read my comics in
like big time I want to see my movies I
travel so much i love the i don't care
that people aren't buying ipads i'm like
to do that's buying ipads people like
the ipads dead no it's alive its alive
at least on me i just i'm still a ipad
3rd generation baby for life it's your
kid that's your kids computer stuff yeah
I have fo life ipad pro that's that 12.9
inch screen that we're expected to see
also obviously the iphone successes so
let's just talk a little bit about this
um will kind of go down the line of some
of the products that we expect to see in
some of the latest news that's breaking
how about this my man we've talked about
force touch on the iphone 6s that
rumored feature yes according to a 9to5
mac in their exclusive because they have
crazy they I swear they have like a
direct line into the brain of someone
that's working over at Apple they're
talking about the force touch features
that will be available for the success
now when we talk about the Apple watch
when you press down with a lot of force
it because it's screen is smaller you
get a variety of kind of like options
maybe more buttons on like an app like
Twitter yelp it allows you to do
different things but for the iphone 6s
specifically and 6s plus they are saying
that forced touch will be used more for
shortcuts and quick kind of
their actions across iOS so for example
let's say you have you pull up maps and
you look at it you pull up a destination
it shows up instead of you having to
click on that and then choosing the
directions and then the type when you
want it to be public transit if you just
did a force touch I got hard press
physically on the screen it would
immediately take you to the turn-by-turn
directions that's cool wind up with one
press yeah or maybe something they use
an example of the phone app the icon on
your screen if you just do a force touch
on that phone app it would take you
directly to voicemails that's nice so
you would kind of bunch of little
shortcuts yeah be helpful just quick
shortcuts nothing like too crazy nothing
with like all these contextual menus
popping up in things like that on your
little fingers like trying to get the
little pup I don't know about you I have
haven't I have very large fish I don't
know about you Stephen oh yeah medium
sized finger let's let's see well here a
bring your hand out here i want to see
how out who is a bigger hands it's
pretty close it's prettier than I think
mine are tiny meter bigger yeah yeah my
I'm a centimeter vaguer than be too yes
I like it I play basketball too maybe
that does i was gonna say you're a
baller man so well comparatively people
say i have really big hands for my size
just saying it's a good thing i just
wanted to throw that out into the ethos
to let you all figure out what that
means I don't know also um iphone just
some of the developers right before an
iphone actually released their websites
or their apps get hit by phones and they
can actually identify them according to
fix ooh spelled fiks you their developer
they have their logs have shown that
they've been hit by two phones labeled
81 and 82 what does that mean well last
year the iphone 6 was labeled 71 and 72
the iphone 5c was labeled 73 up to this
point they have not received any hits
from a phone with a iphone 83 which
would lead just to believe there's a lot
of back-and-forth rumors that there will
be no iphone 6c hmm ok and those are
like the lower end iPhones right yeah
kind of like
pastel colors yeah and all the ones we
are acrylic or plastic eek no yeah yeah
yeah we yeah plastic come on AB we
talking plastic yeah oh my lamb was
about one of the Miami fan okay wait
almost bought one for my sister but
that's okay yeah cuz she's like she is a
flip phone man I needed I've I don't
wanna I don't want to rip on people that
like the iphone 5c because I think it
was more like a styling option and it
was a better price but Apple like
completely like talk about their the
finest doesn't you know yeah all the
engineered metals no it's plastic dog so
we don't know maybe wills we will see an
iphone 5c we'll find out I'm sorry an
iphone 6c but we'll find out also we
want to show you this everyone was
talking about Ben gate right not been
gay the ointment that you applied
yourself if you have sore pains but Bend
gate so unboxtherapy was the youtube
channel Lou does an amazing job of stuff
and he showed off that phone and he like
Benton and tore it apart well he got his
hands on the purported 6s casing I got
the back of the casing yeah and he found
a cool a few cool things if I don't know
if you have that video if not it's ok I
think you do have that video but for
people that are watching on YouTube but
with this case he measured it out with
calipers it measures out wider thicker
and taller but it's lighter than the
iphone 6 case now what does that mean
well there's been a lot of rumors that
apple will be using their alumina 7000
aluminum series metal on the new iphone
6s this is the same aluminum that's been
used or is used on the Apple watch sport
so it's a bigger footprint but lighter
in weight also the main banting point of
the iphone 6 was near the volume and
power buttons and they measured it out
and it's now a lot thicker in that area
measuring from the previous iphone was
like one point one four millimeters this
new design that they have if it's
believed to be true as one point nine
millimeters
so they believe that it's a sturdier
body that won't Bend we will find out
when we get that one will try to bend it
I'm kidding I'm kidding you can I mean
if you're getting the phone right you're
in the market for a new phone yeah I
definitely am in the more you want to do
a bend test on your phone no I don't
neither do i neither do i we can't seen
that throw down on that CBS oh you mean
because we have so many models readily
available for us yeah she leaves
mollywood used to throw them off
buildings yeah we don't we don't
actually get a ton of phones unless
they're the ones that are owned by us
quite honest yeah yeah you guys would be
surprised like a lot of the first look
videos we do our with personal people's
or arms or computers or like there's
literally one phone for the entire
company to be shared between San
Francisco that if we happen to get it
before the actual announcement or before
the actual obviously we get them to
review but there's only one guy that has
it for like one week and it's like and
no one else can touch it no one can
touch you want to look at you no one can
even lick it like you know how I like
that like phones I like to make out with
them get all the dirty yeah we can't do
that with these phones man I'm sorry
Beecham all good I will survive I Will
Survive all right now let's talk a
little bit about the ipad coming up in
what we could potentially do or what
Apple is potentially doing at that El
Capitan the operating system for mac OS
10 or Matt yes I was I saying why was I
think why was I brain farting oh it's
not Mac os10 it's OS 10 I knew I was
saying it wrong Oh Capitan in the
developer files right inside inside the
files that kind of talk about products
that are supported here and there it
appears and this is kind of crazy to me
I mean it'll work it appears though that
Hamza said developer has discovered
within the el capitan betas that ipad
mini 4 right ipad mini 4 will also
support this a split screen view for
apps ok so you can like do like a you
can split your screen and it locks in
place yeah they're they're just they're
basically it allows you to pull from
the right side and bring in a different
app and then you can then resize it to
take up like let's say web browsing
didn't want appt and then notes in
another app but how Windows 10 is that
how Windows 10 Oh Beecham you this is
the apple byte Apple created it first
always don't ever say things like that
oh so if it's in wide mode I see yeah
yeah so the current the current uh
developers beta for the forum iOS 9 you
can use this feature if you have a ipad
air to right now but what they're saying
is because there's gonna be a processor
upgrade you can also do this on the ipad
mini 4 that's cool that is cool very
cool right also uh Eveleigh switch is
just a super-popular on leaks I'm sorry
like sometimes I get them confused
released a video of the measurements the
CAD design drawings of the new ipad mini
ipad mini 4 is expected based on these
renderings and what they believe is the
correct measurements to be 6.1
millimeters thin which is on par with
the ipad air 2 so um if you scroll down
on that beach them there's a vid there's
a youtube video that you can go onto
there you go there's the on leaks video
and so what this is basically telling us
is that it's going to pull from the
design of the current ipad air 2 but be
be put on the ipad mini 4 with this kind
of more tapered smooth out edges and
thinner body design kind of cool cool
just again little just always like these
little nuggets here and there and then
obviously we talked about the apple TV
yeah so what I'm thinking of doing
before we get to some of the fun stuff
do you want to we always talk about how
you guys can call us i forgot to mention
that the beginning of the show the phone
number is 1 800 61 62 63 8 now what's
really cool about this is you guys can
leave your voicemails for us you're
asking your little apple males we want
to keep it around 20 seconds to 30 tops
get right into it we don't want no like
we don't know we got a butt dial I've
got up we dial all you heard it's like
this like a enhancer
pants it's kind of awkward it's kind of
sexy who's kidding Stephen Stephen want
the button down Stephen wants a butt
dial anyways call us you can leave us a
voicemail for questions and we'll get to
them so we have a couple I think I'm not
sure how many we have let's plan but
we'll plan will answer and then we'll
get some of the fun stuff at the end of
the show okay okay here we go let's see
call number one caller number one people
on periscope can hear this this is b.o.b
from Sacramento California first I for
most definitely make sure you guys keep
the show going I love apple byte so I
like the crunchiness of the Apple as
well my question for you guys is in
regards to the apple watch everybody's
talking about how well the Apple watch
sold which it did so well but in my
opinion doesn't always equal to a
product actually being worth the price
tag and what have you so far seeing that
you have the Apple watch Brian I see
it's dead right now I we have a watch as
well who is your take on it and how do
you feel that they can improve it to
where it is a great device because I
haven't been happy with our purchase as
of yet especially with the way this
thing watched all right guys love the
show all right so for those of you
watching he's as or Paris goobers he's
basically pob is asking what are my
thoughts on the Apple watch I've thrown
out my own kind of personal review of
the things I like and the things i don't
i would say what do they need to do to
make this watch good there's a few
things that really stand on my mind
number one is they need to put an actual
gps chip in this watch now it's going to
affect the battery life but why is it
important right now it depends on
everything from your phone you know data
from your phone launching apps can take
as long as 13 seconds sometimes I'm
people are going to be like I was going
to talk about this all over again yes I
am because that's the question GPS is
going to be important because then will
actually enable you to track things and
it can at least feel a little more
independent when I go on a run or Ana's
walking around disneyland you know it's
still syncing to like the motion
processor on my phone and so it doesn't
track any of the steps even oh really
yeah yeah I'm actually surprised there's
no GPS and the one yeah right most
people would think that it there is
there's great apps like running app
that track your path but you still need
the phone you pretty much you still need
the phone for everything to do anything
on this watch so something that's
realistic give me a GPS chip in the next
gen and then also native apps which is
coming you need to have native apps on
this watch so that they launch properly
I think if you do those two things
everyone's saying Oh make a watch that
pulls data I think at the same time it
would be nice but what about a camera
would you like a number i don't worry
about i know you're about camera I think
this also this watch also needs to at
least be able to pull from Wi-Fi
directly without oh yeah if it can do
that those three things native apps a
GPS chip and pull from the Wi-Fi data
directly without the need of your phone
that will help it greatly I know when
you're on the go it's going to still
need your phone and that's just the way
it is because no one wants to devices
with two data plans but i think that can
open things up and with those with the
GPS chip and um sorry the Wi-Fi
capability i think that is going to
enable developers to do more with it as
well totally so those are my three
things that they should do my current
review of this I give it a six out of
ten it's good it's not great I don't do
much other than use it for time I do
love how it looks personally otherwise
i'd be really against this watch this
look cool except when the battery's dead
my battery was dead that's why i'm
saying my battery's dead last year right
my battery was actually dead this
morning i plugged it in specifically for
the show just so i could have it charged
okay like so sometimes I wear and it's
not charged so clearly I at least like
how it looks yeah which is what you know
must be comfortable to them it's isn't
comfortable it's like any other watch
people people criticize that I like
where it too loose that's how i wear my
watch that's how i rock monton i do that
whip what we named it that watch i do
that watch watch so that's that's my
overall taken on the Apple watch I think
that most people after you get past the
novelty of it in the first month you're
probably gonna be like what I'm actually
doing with this thing but I do know
there's a lot of people that love it so
I'm just trying to I'm just trying to
you know be real be real all right do
you have another call thanks be away for
call
on again 1 800 61 62 63 eight is the
number you guys can call us to leave
your messages and we talk shop with
y'all and here's another client's gordon
richards from adelaide south australia
my question is do you think Apple is
going to address the issues with all
their blood way for a new software on
their devices or example stock if you
could apply everything that'd be good
thanks blowed where well what everything
it's on every device pretty much right
Steven what are some of your favorite
bloatware apps ok let me look in the
folder that I made that says never yet
the folder called like crap let me said
I'll never tell you I never use passbook
gamecenter stocks maps newsstand find
iphone i never use that but i should
write my books and health yeah tips and
Apple watch well whoa whoa whoa whoa
tips is on my main home screen is it
really hell no say what oh yeah there's
a lot a game center Jenner never you
come on let's be real who actually uses
game center no one some people know how
to work it was like oh this is our xbox
live for the phone no one's using Center
get out of here um I with the new iOS 9
I believe newsstand is gone actually
that's good so cuz that was like a
forest app right yeah so newsstand if
I'm correct because I've been playing
with it on my iPad is gone and then you
also have but then they launched an app
called news which is kind of a more nice
presentation of curated stuff based on
what you read um you know from website
was reading what you read and give yeah
kind of yeah and it presented in a kind
of more print style presentation that's
cool yeah that's cool yeah if you guys
are watching we'd love to hear from you
what is your least favorite app you're
like crappy is blow or a pie I'm curious
I think yeah what else is it worthless I
maps no one's using Apple maps no no one
everyone's using google maps let's be
real let's be real
what HAP's is awesome it is it's sick
okay uh was without those all our calls
for the dance all our call okay oscars
for calling thank you guys so much for
calling we appreciate that that was
great stuff let's get to some of the fun
stuff to finish up our show Stephen you
you do this podcast called crave that
talks about all this kind of weird crazy
goofy stuff but also really cool stuff
so kind of set the scene of what we have
coming up right now okay so yesterday
there was a very popular story on crave
about this showerhead unbelievably right
it's always something random guess
that's really popular but it's a
showerhead called the nebbia showerhead
and what these engineers did was they
designed the shower head so it chops up
the water in a way where it comes out
kind of like a mist and it winds up
saving seventy seventy percent wat more
water than a regular standard shower
here right so I actually have this
really cool video yeah and it the story
here is that it was put on Kickstarter
maybe like three or four days ago and in
like a couple days it passed a million
dollars because people are just
fascinated by the shower head right and
the goal was $100,000 $100,000 right now
I'm looking at it it says a million five
hundred sixty thousand dollars that's
awesome and they also have a very
well-known celebrity backer to this
Kickstarter program you might know his
name's Tim Cook his name is Tim Cook so
he's one of the biggest backers of this
of this thing and I think it has a lot
to do with California's drought right
also the governor jerry brown of
california endorsing this of the shower
head so um yeah you should check it out
check out the crave video too if you can
because i kind of just go through it
talk about a little bit so it's called
the nebbia it's called the NBA PIAA it
kind of shoots down like a cloud of MIT
a cloudy mist so you don't get this like
harsh water hitting you I I must admit
uh you know I can always cancel it but I
I have one I got one did you threw down
on it I threw down on one right I want
to see what it's I think it's cool I'm
fast-forwarding through this video a
little bit so here they do a comparison
where they have these two like fish
tanks right and their spring one regular
shower head into it and then the other
our head let me see and you could see
how much water it's saving as it's
happening here it is okay watch this so
the nebbia shower heads people people
that are listening can't watch and the
the regular shower heads on the left so
look at that 20 20 gallons compared to a
regular shower head yeah 20 gallon so
eight minutes 20 gallons on a regular
shower head on the nebbia it was like
how many was it like six or seven six or
four I was like four or something yeah
so a lot of crazy I put this video up
yesterday a lot of people in the
comments were like if you use if you're
using less water you're going to get
less clean so i don't know i am i am
curious to find out i think that's an
act i think that's an accurate you know
it's a bit about how much water surface
how much surface area the water hit ya
now if to you being hit by water you
know really hard it to you makes you
feel clean there's a difference like if
you cover your body surface air water
and scrub I mean comping the same thing
I need good water pressure pressure see
I don't think that delivers water yeah
and that's what I'm afraid that this
thing doesn't do a lot of people they
described it as walking through a warm
cloud so sounds it sounds like when I
crop dusted someone yesterday yeah so
I'm curious you know Tim Tim Cook's it
gets behind this who knows me will they
put bluetooth in it or something who
knows you can sync it to something you
know you get it will be like a smart
device it'll like you know you can
control all that stuff from your phone
and everything so just kind of a fun
story that you know we do on the extra
crunchy podcast oh we get any action
crunchy yeah the link to this is tim
cook of course yes um okay here I got
something for you all right okay check
this out this is from a company a
california-based watch company there
called Nico Gerard and we have a video
for people but I'm going to talk about
it this is we talked about on the apple
byte show this is a watch this is an
Apple watch watch okay so it's like a
watch and then where you know you expect
the connectors to be it's another watch
like so it's like a regular know it's
real it's a standardized regular like yo
hardware time ticking geared watch and
then the other side is an Apple watch
the nikko Gerard okay this is the
craziest I
d I've ever heard uh their slogan was
like be uncompromised I think it should
be like this is the most idiotic thing
I've seen they're selling the initial
like silver version 4 9300 dollars
that's ridiculous it's not it's it's
gotta be a joke no I thought it was a
joke I thought it was a joke it's it
basically it looks like a for those who
can't watch you can't see the video it
looks like a watch band well watch with
a watch basel that has connection for an
apple watch it has a watch band with two
watches on both sides it's so like if
you had you're watching the outside and
you rotate your wrist you would see the
Apple watch on your wrist and then you
see the regular watch who's who's doing
this to face from batman is the only
person I can think of it's pretty
ridiculous also just to let you guys all
know Apple has introduced a new $49
Apple watch link bracelet kit so to fit
people with larger wrists I've got
skinny risk so I pulled off my bracelets
but now i know i could sell all six of
my additional ones for fifty bucks oh
really well technically that's how much
the charger like links to make it longer
yeah so what is honest yes they don't
have any in that steel space gray you
know the kind of the jet black looking
links yet yeah so they only have it in
the silver links but just in case you
know y'all got really big risk this
product is for you it's weird okay and
finally this is my favorite story of
like probably the month george fox
university their IT division they have a
lot of imax that come in and out of
there you know offices they've got to
stock the university what they did these
guys are crazy they took 36 cardboard
imac boxes used packing tape and created
the freaking i weel they glued them all
together all right the I wheel is
approximately nine feet tall weighs
approximately 130 pounds it's like I
think we could do that here to these
boxes Brian we got to talk to the IT
guys I want one so bad if you guys
haven't seen the video just look up I
will if you haven't seen the article
look up I will if you haven't seen my
Twitter we posted it
it's freaking awesome that's funny that
they figured out it would make up her
yeah perfect circle God and they're just
rollin so weird like they probably
designed it like you know Johnny I
Johnny eyes is like designed the box of
your anger of the books needs to be
properly designed to make the I wheel
you have to make one dude can't we
should we let's talk to the guys we
don't have that many imax here at work
though we have some but not we could
pull off like 10 of them at least well
10 you that's like that you need 36 dude
36 yeah so if you may be our the fans of
the show can send us their empty I'm a
somewhat someone said that they were
selling imac boxes online for like fifty
dollars a pop just for the box oh my god
so this thing would be like 1,800 bucks
if you had to acquire all those boxes
that's funny oh my god i want it i will
too man that's what i'm saying i love
people in college they just do fun stuff
well when you have all that time in the
world you can do crazy you just can yeah
okay boys and girls I think that's gonna
do for this we show thank you so much
