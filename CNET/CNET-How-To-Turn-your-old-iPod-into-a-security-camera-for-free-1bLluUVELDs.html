security cameras on the market today but
did you know that you can turn your old
iPod into a security camera in just a
few steps
so the first thing you'll need to do is
download the many thing app that's only
available for iOS products it works on
iPod touch iPads and iPhones alright so
when you launch them anything app you'll
need to set it up with a username and a
password that's the first step then
you'll have two options you can either
click on view my cameras or record using
this device so if you have two Apple
products you can use one as your camera
and you can use the other to monitor
your camera the other option is to use
the web app to view everything if you
only have one Apple product to leave at
home to monitor your space so behind me
is an iPod touch that I have set up
basically to work like an IP camera if I
walk by it monitors motion and it will
send me an alert any saved clips will go
straight to the cloud and storage is
free many thing is planning to add a
subscription-based service but it will
always reserve one option for limited
free storage so aside from being totally
free many thing also has an IFFT channel
it's really the first video monitoring
service that's available on it and that
makes it a really interesting option for
home security so I have it paired with
the Belkin Wemo switch right now so
every time the many thing on this ipod
touch back here detects motion it turns
on the lamp right next to it and that's
really it you have just created a DIY
home security system for free assuming
that you have a spare Apple product and
you can do even more with it if you have
Belkin Wemo products or a Philips hue
bulbs thanks for watching i'm megan
