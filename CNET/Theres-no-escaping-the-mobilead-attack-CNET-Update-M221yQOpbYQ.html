new way to annoy your acquaintances I'm
Bridget Carey and this is just seen that
update I know how much you all love
being forced to watch as before playing
a video well now you will experience
that joy more often because YouTube is
putting ads on videos watched on
smartphones and tablets they will play
for five seconds before you can skip it
YouTube is hoping to make more money
from mobile of course and Android users
will start seeing this first that's
because the current iphone YouTube app
doesn't allow ads but that'll change in
the next version the google plus social
network has updated its sliders no no
not those sliders although that would be
cool rather this feature is a bar you
slide to measure how many posts from a
circle you want to see in your feed and
now you can set it to the max to be
alerted for every post or if there's one
person or just is too chatty you can go
to their profile to mute them also when
you're making a post you can now check
off a box to send an email blast to
everyone in that circle yeah be wise how
often you use that Microsoft has a new
logo for the first time since 1987 along
with the new font that has grey type is
the four panel square color symbol and
as for Windows and its other products
wave goodbye to the wavy windows flags
everything's more Square and straight
edged across the board and as you heard
on a previous update if you recently
bought a PC you can upgrade to Windows 8
for 15 bucks instead of paying the full
price well you can get that upgrade for
free for any HP or compaq pc Bob between
august seventeenth through February's
second of next year HP is offering $15
refunds maybe others will also do the
same another deal for gamers the price
of the xbox kinect sensor just dropped
forty dollars in time for the holidays
it's now 110 dollars and you know how
nasty a keyboard can be dust crumbs
germs it can be frightening well
Logitech just came out with the washable
keyboard for 40 bucks no more dirty
QWERTY if you feel like there's just
never enough time in the day why not try
living on Martian
a day on Mars is three percent longer
than a day on earth so you gained about
40 minutes more a day a NASA engineer
had his whole family switched a Martian
time when the Curiosity rover landed of
course they'll have to switch back when
school starts but you can keep Martian
time yourself with Mars clock smartphone
apps for Android and iPhone that your
tech news roundup for today you could
