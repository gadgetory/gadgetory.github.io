wireless bluetooth speaker that retails
for $49.99 and has built-in speakerphone
capabilities hi I'm David Carr noise and
the BT 2500 is one among many
inexpensive mini bluetooth speakers to
hit the market in the last couple of
years a lot of these types of speakers
have more of a canister design to them
but what helps set this one apart is a
relatively flat design which makes it
easy to slip into a bag without taking
up too much space you can stand the
speaker up vertically it's really meant
to be laid down flat and had the speaker
fire upward like a lot of these little
speakers it plays louder than its size
would indicate and I like the analog
volume knob which gives a speaker a
slight retro look and more importantly
makes it easy to raise and lower the
volume that same volume knob can be
found on the step-up BT 3500 which costs
around $30 more as about twice the size
the 3500 adds NFC tap to pair technology
for devices that support it but
otherwise the two speakers have
identical feature sets it's hard to say
which speaker I like better thought they
both sounded pretty good for their size
though as you'd expect the larger BT
3500 does sound slightly fuller and
plays louder however I like the form
factor of the smaller BT 2500 you see
here these small Bluetooth speakers do
have their sound limitations so you
shouldn't expect the world from them
particularly in the bass department but
I thought both these filled speakers
managed to avoid sounding harsh and
we're relatively distortion-free though
they clearly perform better at more
modest volume levels and are really
designed for casual not critical
listening they also perform fairly well
as a speakerphone so long as you don't
want or too far away from the speaker's
microphone while talking the speaker's
charged via micro USB in the battery
life for both the BT 2500 and BT 3500 is
rated at 5 hours you'd ideally like to
have a speaker rated at at least eight
hours but if you don't crank the volume
too much you may be able to do better
than that 5 hour rating summing up these
fellow speakers may not blow anybody
away with their performance but I do
think they sound pretty decent for what
they are and they're slim form factors
appealing from a portability standpoint
they're also reasonably
price and it helps you can find them for
a few bucks less online I'm David
Connolly and that's the Phyllis Petey
2500 portable Bluetooth speaker thanks
