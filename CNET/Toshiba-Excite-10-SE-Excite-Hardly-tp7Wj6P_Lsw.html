front of me it doesn't really have a
name that quite fits what it is toshiba
excite 10 se I'm sorry it's not a tablet
you're going to be really excited about
it's because we're at a time that's
little transitional with Android tablets
and you also have a tablet that is a
budget version of what toshiba has
released previously originally there was
the toshiba excite 10 le which was a
slim sleek tablet then there was a
toshiba excite 10 there was a little
thicker those are both made of metal
this one is made out of plastic does not
have gorilla glass so you can definitely
feel it is a budget type quality
throughout and a lower price but this
isn't as low as you'd like it to be it's
about 349 which is a good deal higher
than competing tablets with pretty
similar specs including the Asus memo
pad smart 10 that I reviewed recently
this is a Tegra 3 processor 1 gig of ram
and 16 gigs of on-board storage and you
do have a micro SD card slot for
expansion but you lose a few things that
were in the previous versions of toshiba
tablets including micro HDMI which is
kind of a nice feature and the cameras
have been dumbed down a bit to 1.2
megapixel on the front and three in the
back as opposed to two and five
previously that's a kind of a big leap
and you know other than that it's really
kind of a cosmetic shift also previously
there was a full SD card slot as opposed
to micro SD and felicity is a little
more convenient it's still a functioning
tablet and it feels solid yet not really
that impressive the 10.1 inch screen is
a 1280 by 800 display which used to be
good back in 2012 but now when you're
dealing with a lot of tablets that have
super high resolution displays the ipad
the kindle fire HD 8.9 and the nexus 10
you're really seeing a new standard
being said in large tablets and I think
this type of resolution you'd now expect
in a 7-inch and the price just isn't
sweet enough for what it's gotten side
between Google i/o around the corner and
the fact that there are new Tegra
processors coming out later this year
Tegra 4 in particular which looks
promising incidentally this runs android
4.1
1.1 and that's what we tested this on
whether it gets android 4.2 is not
exactly clear yet and that's been in
serve on a device by device basis when
it comes to which ones get upgrades that
take that into consideration and the
fact that it's not really running the
latest version of the OS and doesn't
have the most recent processor gives it
that feel the middle generation kind of
tweener product is this really the
toshiba excite 10 se I feel like it's
the show Sheba okay se is a product that
is a tweener it's really between the
more exciting processors coming down the
road and it's not quite budget enough
it's not going to do terribly but I'm
not all that thrilled about something
that's not running the most exciting
latest version of Android and it's not
running the fastest processors possible
and doesn't have the highest resolution
screen i'm scott steinem that's a look
at the toshiba excite 10 SE</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
