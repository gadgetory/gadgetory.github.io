with a set as Mobile World Congress in
Barcelona taking a look at two new
affordable Android phones here we have
the liquid Zed 220 and it's bigger
brother the liquid is dead 520 let's
take a look first at the liquid Zed 220
now this is the most affordable of the
two phones coming into round 89 euros
that's around $100 to go on sale in
March as you can see it's got a four
inch display meaning is very small and
comfortable to hold
now it's not the most premium looking of
devices but it's white back is quite
nice and it certainly is easy to put
into your pocket the display has an 800
by 480 pixel resolution which seems to
make everything nice and easy to read
and it seems bright although inside this
quite dim room anything looks bright
it's got a 1.2 gigahertz dual-core
processor which seems to make everything
go fairly swiftly and it's running the
latest Android 5.0 lollipop software and
back of the phone is a 5 megapixel
camera and there's a 2 megapixel camera
on the front and now let's move on to
the Zed 520 as you can see it's quite a
bit bigger than is little brother if I
just got a 5 inch screen and it also has
an 854 by 480 pixel resolution so things
that look quite as clear as on the
smaller screen but still perfectly
readable it's actually running Android
4.4 KitKat rather than 5.0 lollipop
little annoying that it's two phones
from the same series have different
versions when apparently and updates
will come at some point see we said 520
has an 8 rather than 5 megapixel rear
camera which has got features like voice
activation for taking selfies without
having to press the screen with the
promise price of 119 euros which equates
to 86 pounds or 133 dollars these Edge
520 is very affordable you know the
phone is going to appeal to those of you
looking for a top-end flagship phone but
if you are looking for just everyday
Android features on a budget they could
well be good phones to check out they do
to be on sale sometime from March and
we'll have more information on CNET in
the coming weeks on pricing and regional
availability so whilst you're seeing it
from Mobile World Congress and make sure
to keep your eye on CNET comm /mw C I'm
Andrew Hoyle and these are the Acer
Liquid as n to 20 and the
stet liquids at 5:20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
