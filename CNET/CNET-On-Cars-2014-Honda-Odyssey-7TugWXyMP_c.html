why is Cooley excited about a minivan
why's Cooley in a minivan I'll tell you
every time one of the major
manufacturers does a heavy refresh of
any of the current minivans
I get excited these tend to be a
platform for great tech let me show you
inside this 2014 Odyssey they've redone
the center stack but not just the look
of the thing also the guts of what's
happening interactively hondalink is
what they call a rollup of services that
include aha mobile that means SMS text
message support your kids will be
texting you from like the second row you
know how they are Facebook and Twitter
as well streaming radio local restaurant
lookups and directions things like that
all paired through your smart phone
but nothing nothing equals at the light
that I had when I heard about this
little feature in the back in the left
corner of the rear cargo area is
something I've never seen in a car
before
see that honda vac no kidding
you pull this thing out and literally
designed with the shop vac people who
make the vacuum every have in your
garage let's fire it up
sounds legit
let's get some Froot Loops
they works really well I got to tell you
it's much better than that crappy little
plug in 12-volt one you've probably got
hanging in your garage and it's not just
for cleaning back here which snowin
cares about check out the length of this
hose this guy they tell me goes all the
way around the length of the car sure
enough here we are front row you can
clean up the front row the second row
the third row and the back
that means you no longer have to get
that back out of the garage which you
never do which is why your car is so
filthy and once you get your Odyssey all
nice and clean it's time to go for a
nice safe ride all good family
attributes the 2014 Odyssey is gonna
help you there with active lane
departure and forward collision
prevention technology so mom or dad can
avoid running into the cars around or in
front of them while they're dealing with
the chaos behind them the new Odyssey
arrives with an unchanged powertrain
which is just fine by most people
Honda's three and a half liter v6 is one
of the best in the biz still front wheel
drive of course and the car arrives
sometime around summer of 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
