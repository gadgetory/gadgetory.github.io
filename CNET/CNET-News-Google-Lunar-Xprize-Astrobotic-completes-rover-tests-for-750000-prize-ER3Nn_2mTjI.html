Mellon University home of Astrobotic one
of the teams competing for the 20
million dollar Google Lunar XPrize and
the last time we saw Astrobotic we were
in the middle of the Mojave Desert where
they were testing out their landing
systems in preparation for landing on
the moon today we're gonna check out
what happens next see if they can
actually broadcast high-definition video
from the lunar surface all the way back
here to us on earth for the testing
we're going to leave the lab and go out
in the field to an active quarry that
means safety gear most definitely
required partner so we're at the Lafarge
test site we're testing the image system
on the rover we're looking at the
quality of the images that come off the
cameras and then we're transmitting
those over a link that's similar to what
we'll use on the moon
from the earth to the moon we have a
signal propagation delay of 2.5 seconds
so when we send a command from Earth it
takes 2.5 seconds to reach the moon and
from the moon the image feedback that
gives the result of that action would be
another 2.5 seconds so we press a button
to make the robot do something then we
see it 5 seconds later so we have to
plan for that in our driving strategy we
need to prove that the resolution of the
images are good enough to drive that the
compression that's required to get all
that data down doesn't destroy the
images and that we can take nice high
color HD images of the beautiful things
we're gonna see on them yeah so right
now we're looking at the user interface
for our prototype moon rover on it we
can see the images that are fed to it
those are used to control the rover and
the higher definition images are
screened back to earth for the viewing
of the public the two cameras give a
stereo video on the moon the Sun lights
very bright very grey it's very flat and
so it's hard to tell distances we use
the stare
cameras to be able to tell distance to
things like rocks and craters so we
don't get stuck one of the key
requirements of the Google Lunar XPrize
is to prove that we traveled 500 meters
on the moon and this screen actually
updates our distance estimate in real
time so we know how far we've traveled
and we're also able to see the exact
number of rotations for each wheel
because that's that along with computer
vision techniques are the two key data
points for our distance verification the
rover has a suspension that allows it to
drive at low speeds very capably it's a
single pivot suspension one pivot
upfront and then all of the rest of the
suspension is fixed at this point the
big thing they have to do is really just
test hey my name is Jay Kurtz one of the
judges and they're scheduled with the
next couple weeks that really start
going through the like I say the thermal
the vacuum the shotgun bike testing and
really the shock and vibe the critical
part is to survive the launch I don't
think they're gonna have a lot of risk
there I think we've got very strong
strong umbrellas so that this Lander
looks very different from the one that
we tested in Mojave but the engines are
the same the propulsion fuel system is
very similar the computing and landing
systems are identical so what we need to
do now is integrate all of those
components fly a system that's got the
got the similar architecture and then
we'll launch it them space and land on
the moon this is Tim Steve who's
