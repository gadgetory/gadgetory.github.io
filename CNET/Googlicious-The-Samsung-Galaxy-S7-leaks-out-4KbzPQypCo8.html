your Google Isha's it's everything
inside the world of google that we can
pack inside of a show and we'll have
plenty of new things to talk about
especially after google's upcoming
September 29th event in San Francisco
now we're expecting to see two new Nexus
devices including a smaller Nexus phone
by LG and a larger version of the device
built by Huawei and they have been
leaked out on the web over the past few
months now these are the first Nexus
devices that are expected to run android
6.0 marshmallow out of the box
androidpit has released a new image of
the LG based Nexus phone that will
feature its fingerprint scanner on the
rear side as well but that's not all LG
recently sent out invitations for
another event of their own set for
October first in New York now this could
be for their own rumored v10 phone that
will reportedly have a secondary ticker
display for additional information that
you can see here it will be on the top
of the normal display and next to the
front facing camera this wouldn't be the
first phone to have something like this
you can search for a little doozy called
the samsung continuum but we'll see how
it all comes together and since we're
talking samsung they've had the galaxy
s6 out on the market for a few months
but did the galaxy s7 already leaked out
a report by sammobile says a Samsung
device with the name lucky LTE appeared
on the Geekbench benchmark database
recently and has confirmed it's the new
galaxy s7 that has been codenamed
project lucky s7 lucky lucky number
seven get it all right the report says
Samsung is using a new Exynos 88-90
chipset with its mangu system on a chip
that has some of the fastest performance
tested to date it's a likely expandable
storage will return but there is a
chance and Samsung is also testing a new
20 megapixel camera for the Galaxy s7
and a project called all lens cover
which could point to support for
additional lenses for the camera but
it's still very early now people are
still talking on Apple's 3d touch
announcement and yes I cover apple stuff
and hearing people say it's just a long
press feature is really selling it short
other than the OS really this became the
biggest platform differentiator between
android and apple and just wait until we
see what the devs do with it now in the
android world the only phone that has
something like this is the huawei mate s
with its own force touch feature that
they actually call force touch
pre-orders are open now but
unfortunately force touch won't be a
standard feature on the main s and
huawei said it will only be available in
select markets and it's a great thing
they decided not to tell us which
markets that would have it thanks huawei
now bloomberg reports that google will
begin testing grocery and fresh food
deliveries in two US cities later this
year to compete with Amazon fresh Google
Express will be partnering with the
super fresh and not so wallet-friendly
Whole Foods AKA whole paycheck and
costco wholesale for the new service San
Francisco will be the first city to try
it out the other has yet to be named
Plus Google's next day delivery service
will also be expanding to the Midwest in
and around Indiana Wisconsin and Ohio
and if you guys and gals aren't paying
attention this is really an arms race
for delivery services between amazon and
the big G right now and finally the
Guardian reports that Google is
expanding production of their electric
self-driving cars and is now making at
least a few hundred they say they are
building them to learn what it takes to
build one from the ground up they'll
have some more help after the
announcement that X Hyundai CEO John
Krafcik will be the new CEO for their
self-driving car project they aren't
planning to market or sell these
Prototype cars to the public in the near
future but their goal is to have
widespread distribution by 2020 alright
that's going to do it for this week's
show you can always email us at google
issues at cnet com or tweet me at Bryant
on this watching we'll see you all next
time for some more of that Google issues
