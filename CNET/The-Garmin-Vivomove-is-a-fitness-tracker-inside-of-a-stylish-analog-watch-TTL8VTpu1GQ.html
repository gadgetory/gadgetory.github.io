analog watch with fitness tracking built
in and it's unlike anything we have ever
seen before from Garmin the watch will
track steps distance calories burned and
sleep that's it there's no heart rate
sensor no smartphone notifications or
any sort of vibration although it does
include two small secondary eing screens
the one on the left shows how close you
are to reaching your daily step goal
while the one on the right is an
inactivity bar which will slowly fill
with red for every 15 minutes you aren't
being active but aside from that this is
a normal watch it has a normal crown
used to set the time and it uses a
normal 20 millimeter watch strap and
because it doesn't have a digital
display or any battery hog and features
the vivo moves coin battery will last up
to a year and like all of Garmin's
devices the watch is waterproof down to
50 meters so you can swim and shower
with it just be sure to remove that
leather strap first so while I'm a big
fan of the vive move it's not perfect I
experienced occasional sticking problems
with the Garmin Connect app and while
the app has improved in the past year it
still is a ton of menus and chemic in
fusing to navigate compared to the
Fitbit app it can also be frustrating
for anyone who owns another garment
product while you can have multiple
Garmin devices synched with the connect
app you're only allowed to use one for
fitness tracking which is just plain
annoying but otherwise the watch looks
and feels great and it's one I would
recommend for anyone looking for basic
and stylish fitness tracker the vive
move is available now for $150 the one
right here is the vive move premium it
costs 250 dollars but it has a steel
case and comes with a leather strap for
