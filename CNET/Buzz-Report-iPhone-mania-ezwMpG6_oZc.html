whose home wiping pureed apricots spit
up off the screen of her iPhone welcome
to a very special iPhone edition of the
buzz reports first our gadget of the
week duh it's the iPhone it seemed like
Apple was nine months pregnant for the
last six months but they finally
delivered their baby
now there's not much I can say about it
that isn't already covered beautifully
in seen its exhaustive iPhone coverage
and reviews except this if you get one
try not to gloat those first few days
when you're getting more attention than
Paris Hilton going back to jail and pay
for at least some of your drinks we knew
there'd be a slew of iPhone accessories
rivaling the array available for the
iPod but one of the first is actually
scary it's this Belkin iPhone adapter
it's basically a horsey extension
schnozz you plug into the iPhones
incomprehensibly recessed audio jack
that way it ensures any pair of earbuds
can be used with your iPhone well if I
just spent all that money on an iPhone
60% of which for its cool looks and
found out I had to use this thing with
it to use my earbuds I'd be right back
at the store returning my iPhone over
hand and as soon as I heard the
preferred method for activating a new
iPhone is to take it home and initiate
service via iTunes I felt real bad for
AT&amp;amp;T I mean that's just Apple saying to
AT&amp;amp;T we care deeply about our customers
experience so you're out it's the mother
of all put down the chalupas they're
saying back away from our iPod and Mac
customers
there used to a sparkling white store
where you're going to hear strains of
Brad Mehldau and there's even a thing
called a genius bar that nobody laughs
at and finally a prayer a prayer for the
poor senseless sob who works in the AT&amp;amp;T
store that Steve Jobs decides to drop in
on to see how they're handling iPhone
customers look at this picture from
world of Apple calm that's jobs
apparently inspecting the caulk joints
of the glass panels of the Apple Store
in New York the caulk joints so can you
imagine how he'll scrutinize your
presentation of the most important
product in his company's history you
might not make it home for dinner next
Tuesday
I'm Brian Cooley and this has been the
buzz report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
