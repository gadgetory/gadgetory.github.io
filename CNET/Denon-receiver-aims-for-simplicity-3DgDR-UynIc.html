and we are going to take a look at the
Denon AV re-400
this is a new 7.1 AV receiver that's
selling for six hundred dollars and the
big chains this year is Denon focused on
making AV receivers easier to set up now
that's a mission I can get behind as AV
receivers are notoriously frustrating to
set up and down on does make some
worthwhile progress the biggest change
is the setup assistant an on-screen
guide that walks you through the setup
process the first time you fire up the
AV receiver telling you how to hook up
your speakers and get all your devices
properly configured another change is
Denon's new push in speaker connectors
on the back now they're definitely
easier to use if you're sticking with
bare speaker wire although I found them
a little bit more cramped when using
banana plugs finally the included remote
is the same as last year's but it's
still the best AV receiver remote that's
currently available buttons are
logically laid out and they're nice and
big rather than the confusing jumble of
tiny buttons that most receiver remotes
have now while all those improvements
are nice the AVR 400 still misses the
mark somewhat when it comes to ease of
use for one it's still a giant metal box
which makes it a pain to physically
handle and it's not exactly the nicest
looking addition to your living room and
that size would be a little more
tolerable except Marantz offers the NR
1403 which is nearly half the size $200
cheaper and looks a lot nicer the AVR
400 is also missing both bluetooth and
Wi-Fi to wireless technologies that
offer a lot of convenience Bluetooth
works with the vast majority of
smartphones and tablets and it's the
easiest way to wirelessly stream music
so it's frustrating that it's not
included on a $600 receiver the lack of
Wi-Fi means you need to connect the
receiver using Ethernet to use any of
its networking features and that's not
always easy for every living room
scenario now both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
are included on the onkyo TX NR 62 six
and that currently costs $100 less the
rest of the AVR e400 features are solid
there are six HDMI inputs
should be enough for almost every home
theater the networking features are also
respectable including built-in airplay
DLNA Pandora Spotify and internet radio
we also had resident audiophile Steve
Guttenberg listen to the sound quality
and overall he was impressed the Denon
has a rich sound and plenty of power to
fill our medium sized listening room he
also compared it directly to Yamahas rxv
475 in pioneers vsx 8 to 3 and while he
did end up preferring both of those
receivers especially the Yamaha they all
performed pretty similarly so a lot of
it comes down to taste but to sum it up
the AVR 400 is ultimately asking you to
pay extra for its simplicity but I don't
think it goes far enough to justify that
cost especially without Bluetooth and
Wi-Fi which offer a lot of real-world
convenience the AVR 400 is a very solid
receiver when judged on its own but most
buyers will get a better value from the
alternatives I'm Matthew Muscovy AK and
this is the den on AV re 400</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
