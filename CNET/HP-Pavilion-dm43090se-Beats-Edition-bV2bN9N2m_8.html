HP Pavilion GM for special beats Edition
what they've done is taken a standard
Pavilion 14 inch laptop dressed it up in
this cool matte black exterior and of
course and that beats audio subsystem
that you're used to from the higher end
HP Envy laptops what you end up with is
something that's $8.99 but looks like a
much more expensive machine
it's kind of standard Core i5 and pretty
much everything else you'd expect for a
mid-priced mid-sized laptop but frankly
this is one of the coolest examples of
that kind of overused genre that we've
seen I especially like the backlit
keyboard I always love backlit keyboard
so this one because of the beats kind of
color branding is red and that does two
things for you a lot of the backlit
keyboards that I've seen are just too
bright if you're especially if you're
using them in a dark room it's just a
little bit overpowering so here in this
case the red light is almost like the
red light in a dark room it's muted so
even if it's a dark room while you're
watching TV or something you can turn on
the laptop and use the backlit keyboard
without really blinding yourself and out
of being too bright and plus it's
frankly just unique look I don't think
I've ever seen a colored backlight
keyboard like this except for some
Alienware laptops that have very
adjustable things where you can change
you know like four different quadrants
on the keyboard to be different colors
and of course the actual surface of
material is a matte black it's got the
big beats logo on the back this is a
metal overlay on the back panel the rest
of it is plastic and that brings up one
of my few problems with this particular
system its $8.99 it's definitely good
for which again but for like 150 or 200
dollars more you can trade up to the HP
Envy line which has everything this guy
has but also an all-metal body and
usually a discreet graphics card which
the DM for beats Edition lacks now
that's still a sizable additional
investment but if you're already up to
$900 I'd have to seriously consider you
know adding the 150 or 200 depending on
a few on the 14 or 15 inch HP Envy
because those are really Li go to
premium high and mid size Windows
laptops right now I've done Ackman and
that is the HP Pavilion DM for beats
Edition</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
