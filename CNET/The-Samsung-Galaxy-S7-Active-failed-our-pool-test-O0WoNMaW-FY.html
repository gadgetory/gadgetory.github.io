water-resistant to a depth of five feet
for up to 30 minutes when we tested the
phone for our review it emerged from a
20 minute dunk in a vase working fine
but when reports came in that other
units failed we decided to try again on
two bucket dunk tests to see what
happened next one of the actives was
totally fine but the other one was not
so now we're graduating to the pool test
I've got the phone it's charged up the
screen is on it will stay on for 10
minutes and then it's going to graduate
down to the always-on display it's going
in the pool at a depth of about five
feet and I'm going to set the timer for
28 minutes because I don't want to break
the phone and I don't have another one
okay are you ready here we go
there's not looking good no ok so we've
taken it out of the pool and I gotta say
things are not looking good for Samsung
first of all I don't see the always-on
display on and I see that the camera
lens here looks really clouded up it
looks like there's water inside ok so
I'm going to turn it over and just keep
inspecting it I don't like here any
water inside but I would be really
surprised if that happened anyway now
this phone's supposed to be totally
sealed up so the only entrances would be
the port at the bottom this jack at the
top and then any themes along the sides
where water can seep in and that's sort
of what the problem was now we did try
this on another phone to other phones oh
yeah you can see on the back that the
camera lens on the back also looks like
it's got water inside I'm rubbing it and
this is definitely not coming off okay
so this is internal not external so a
lot of water resistant phones use a
substance called nano coating and that
is inside the phone to help protect it
from water if water does get in right
now I'm going to see if I can actually
turn this thing on here's the power
button and pressing it nothing is
happening what I was going to do was
power on the phone and check the screen
to look for any damage there I was going
to take a picture I was going to reboot
the phone I was going to take it through
its normal paces play a video all that
just to make sure that there wasn't any
water damage but honestly I can't even
get to that power on stage so it's very
obvious that this phone did not pass the
test a full submersion now it's been
about thirty minutes since I've
retrieved the phone from the pool
thought I'd give it another chance I'm
still seeing this condensation inside on
both camera lenses front and back
there's still some water droplets on the
front but that's not a concern the major
concern is that the phone still doesn't
want to turn on so we have tested other
review units of this phone and some of
them have passed and some have failed
this one was the most spectacular
failure in the pool at about 5 feet for
about 30 minutes so I guess the moral of
the story is that Samsung still has a
little bit more
to do if you already own this phone you
know and you accidentally fall into the
pool but get out right away then it
might be okay but you don't want to
submerge it for long periods of time and
Samsung needs to make sure that their
phones are as watertight as they say</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
