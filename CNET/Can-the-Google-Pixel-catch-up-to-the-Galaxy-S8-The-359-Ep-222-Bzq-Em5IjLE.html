the 4th be with you all I'm here with
Alfred and Ben Fox Ruben good morning
guys what up I didn't think we were
gonna do Star Wars stuff I thought we
all agreed I wouldn't stop me I was
gonna beat boxing mime okay I was not
Star Wars related at all gonna go Star
Trek stuff anyway what we've got today
for you is we'll be talking about the
Google pixel what our wish list is for
the next one and how it can compete
against the Galaxy s8 I'm sure we'll get
some good questions and comments about
that also wanted to round out the show
talking about the Google Docs phishing
scam that got shut down pretty quickly
yesterday and also something about a red
bathing suit on Instagram which alfred
is going to fill us in on if you haven't
seen it it's hilarious like just the
whole the way the saga unfolded such an
internet dumpster fire you will
literally get 45 seconds to explain it
to people so good luck doing live so
without further ado we're gonna get this
thing rolling send you your questions
and comments we'll get to as many as we
can at the end of the show and let's
podcast alright here we go in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
alfred hang with the samsung s 8 &amp;amp; LGG 6
already out our own lynn la offered up a
smart wish list for what she'd like to
see in the next google pixel two of the
biggest weaknesses she identified are
the current pixels lack of waterproofing
and it's designed which includes a whole
lot of bezel alfred what do you think of
this phone i actually really appreciate
the pixel i kind of wish I had one but i
mean i've already got like two phones
there's no reason for me to have three
okay and i also don't want to buy it but
it's also it's hard to find in stock
right now so for me that would be the
number one demand to actually meet you
know the demand on it where like a lot
of people want pixels but they can't get
them and then by the time they can get
them they might as well just wait for
the next one one of the things that I
think is most noticeable for me about it
is is that the design looked perfectly
reasonable when this got introduced in
October last year and now with the si
coming out it already looks a little old
head I mean like you could disagree with
me on that because I know the iPhone has
looked basically the same for the last
three years but the s8 really like push
things forward with design with like the
no bezel look so I'm wondering if Google
is going to go that route I think most
phones are actually not gonna go that
route I just think that the you know
galaxy si was one of the first ones to
be able to do that I mean they'd been
toying around with it for a long time if
they're you know edge devices mm-hmm
what do you what are your thoughts on
the waterproofing I don't drop my phone
on the toilet that often yes but that's
not the reason why it's waterproof
they're not waterproofing it's like oh
go ahead and throw it in your sink it's
one of those things where it's like oh
if it's you know raining really heavily
on you don't have an umbrella or if you
do happen to drop it in the sink you
know that's not something that you
should have to worry about and I do I
think the waterproofing phone should be
a standard at this point
yeah those do definitely seem like table
stakes I would agree so we do want to
caveat I think Google i/o is coming up
pretty soon this month but we aren't
really expecting this phone to be
introduced until October so a wait a
little bit longer frozen yeah next
Google Docs was hit by a massive
phishing scam yesterday but don't worry
the goog shut down the problem fairly
quickly right
yes so what Google did because this
wasn't any kind of malware this was
actually more of a you know look-alike
kind of thing where they made an app
that made it look like it was Google Doc
but it wasn't mhm and then when you went
to it it would ask you for permission to
get access to your account so even if
you don't type in your password or type
in your username or anything like that
the way typical phishing attacks work
this one is more of an authorization
scheme where you say oh I'll give
permission to it because it's Google
Docs I've given permission to it all the
time but the thing is is that you know
they don't need your password if they
have the permission it's pretty much the
equivalent of that so if you agreed on
it then they have access to your account
and then it was basically they could
send that to all your friends and
contacts after that well that sounds
nice the good news is according to
Google at least you know they've gotten
rid of this rogue app and it only really
affected 0.1 percent of all you know
Gmail users which is still a lot because
how many people use it yeah I last up we
also wanted to talk about something
happened with a red dress on Instagram
fill us in on this so it's a red bathing
suit I know you've been seeing - dick if
you've been seeing on Instagram all over
it's because one company thought you
know as a social media promotion if you
repost this image we'll give you uh you
know this for your bathing suit yes but
the problem with that is that people on
the internet love free things so it
turns out that they can't meet the
demand surprise surprise and this whole
thing just completely backfired and blew
up in their faces because now this image
is all over people are really annoyed by
it and they can't even give it away
because there's so many like people like
demanding it well at least we know the
name of this company now maybe they got
some small benefit out of that which I'm
not going to plug I mean you can't even
pay like to get rid of that kind of
negative press on you I guess that's
true well if you want to read more about
these stories check us out on SEANET I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred Inge thanks for
listening
all right jumping into the chat yes yes
says regarding the the the phone the UH
pixel this battery life is a number one
issue yeah um that is a very good point
and one that Lynn mentioned in the story
I didn't actually get to it in the
podcast uh in the testing that scene it
did I think they said thirteen hours for
the pixel which is pretty good if they
stuck with thirteen hours that's great
however the s eight and the si plus gets
you closer to 16 and 18 hours so if
Google hopes to keep up that is
definitely a very good point that
they're going to want to amp up the
battery as well I mean I still think
availability is their biggest issue like
when when it came out they basically was
if you you can either buy it through the
Play Store like straight from us or you
can get it through Verizon which means
that you like if you wanted to do kind
of oh let me just pay like thirty
dollars a month for like the next two
years you can only do that if you had
Verizon which like is very frustrating
like as someone you know I mean there's
so many other phone companies out there
just make it available through I didn't
realize it was still having availability
issues I mean like this thing was
introduced months ago so like maybe
there really aren't making that many of
them I mean and the other thing too is
you know it obviously should be on the
next you know chip that comes out like
because you know the Galaxy s8 is on the
Snapdragon 835 now hmm which kind of
makes every other phone look like it's
old news at this point yeah it's not
even going to be able to reach like not
like near 5g capability which isn't out
now but like you can reach much faster
speeds if like the new right if this
thing is coming out in October my
assumption would be that they're going
to get the newest yes Qualcomm chip but
you know again this is all speculation
we're just kind of wish listing in
spitballing here so we don't we don't
actually have any super duper inside
knowledge on what this next pixel is
actually going to look like quite yet
Brian comments that yes availability is
the number one issue for him and for
many is this Brian like a commentary you
Brian Flores okay Brian doesn't speak in
the third person uh yeah see were friend
yeah sooo what's up yahoo
says as long as the s8 doesn't launch
pure Android edition phone the pixel
does have hope
he brings a breakpoint says even Star
Wars was built on hope oh my god bless
you for that bless you yeah ooh that's a
great point though a lot of people a lot
of Samsung customers get really
frustrated about the bloatware that's
been an issue for Samsung with their
phones for years that hasn't prevented
them from being the number one phone
maker but at the same time it really
gives a lot of big-time Android fans you
know like this is this is pure Android
unadulterated here you go I mean that
was always a big draw for like all the
Nexus phones where you were gonna be the
first to get you know all the updates
from Android and then you were also
gonna be not gonna have you know Samsung
milk on your phone or like four right
whatever later yeah there are all those
extra funds that they throw in there
yeah so that that was the main appeal of
it but you know those phones were also
like two hundred and fifty dollars now
like they're charging like a premium
price because they have a premium device
and it's not available and it should be
you know adding all these features in
this is gonna sound like totally
first-world problem whatever but that's
all it'll attack if you're I it's true
it's true let's admit it the the fact
that the fingerprint sensor is actually
in a better location on the pixel as
opposed to the s8 is also beneficial
like they put the fingerprint sensor too
close to the camera on the essayed the
pixel it's a little bit easier to get to
and it's right in the middle you're not
going to accidentally like touch this
the camera camera yeah I mean I think
when the Galaxy s8 like was announced
they were like showing it with like some
kind of like Viper like that you could
actually put on the the not put on but
like used like wipe down the camera
mm-hmm like because they were expecting
people to like smudge it that's just a
design flaw Larry I don't really like
that well the reason why they put it
there is because it was like last minute
they wanted to keep it originally where
it was but if they were gonna get rid of
the bezel it was like then they couldn't
figure out how to make a fingerprint
scanner and like a home button at the
same time without a bezel right and
we're expecting or really we're at least
hoping Apple might might get there when
they announced their phone we're
expecting sometime around September I
mean I do it'll be interest I like the
fingerprint scanner on the back though
it is so much better than like this
where you can like do this my only
problem with the s8 version
is that that phone is huge and it's I
feel like you have to like stretch like
super hard right we've talked about this
before the two of us with our tiny hands
not very well well-trained for the SAT
plus so one in the chat has a wish list
he says for the pixel how about both
daydream and tango that would be great
that's a great idea I mean like look
project tango is still very early days
and it's only in like one LG phone that
we constantly forget the name of is it
an lg phone that was Lenovo it might be
the yeah you're right it's little novo
something or they've seen it it's huge
yeah that's the thing like if it me if
it needs to have it needs to have like
all this like insane processing power to
be able to use tango right not only so
if you want it like the phone is gonna
be like and it needs extra cameras so it
needs more space like actually get like
the like the three dimensionality of yes
project tango this is this is an AR
thing by the way if you guys haven't
heard of project tango but tango is a
Google concept so the idea of adding it
into the pixel makes a lot of sense like
if you're gonna have a phone that's big
enough for tango like you're not gonna
be able to do daydream because it'll
like just weigh your head down it's a
funny idea we have some criticisms
coming through
Brian Barry says the Verizon exclusive
was stupid and made a lot of lists from
made a lot of less Pete a lot of people
less familiar with Google think they
couldn't get the phone and I would
sympathize with that I'm kind of
grandfathered into an 18 t deal I don't
love it but it is what it is I think I
was very interested in pixel and well
the thing is you can dye it directly
yeah but mine I bite off-the-shelf I
want to deal yeah that's that's right
way Mike right with it is because it was
like exclusively through Verizon that it
was basically either you're gonna pay in
full for this from Google and then just
put your SIM card in it which is what
they've done for like the Nexus and only
mike michael brown rob and several
others point out that there is financing
available yeah but yeah that's different
like t-mobile AT&amp;amp;T Sprint they all like
did their own specific offers for but
it's like the all of these like kind of
workarounds or it's like you have to buy
it first and then go to t-mobile with it
and they'll give you like credit for it
and things like that it's not very
customer friendly you're totally right
about that especially like when you're
adding on top of that the like the
availability
issues it's definitely Google putting a
lot of stones in its path to actually
become much more competitive most market
my theory on the reason why they did it
as a Verizon exclusive in the first
place is because this was their first
run as like a you know we're making our
own phone and they wanted to make sure
that it you know the experience was like
as smooth as possible
mmm where I think they sided with
Verizon on that one I mean when when the
first you know Android phone came out it
was a t-mobile exclusive at first yeah
um the as many will recall the Amazon
fire phone was also an exclusive with
AT&amp;amp;T and that did not work
I think the pixel has obviously done
better than the fire phone but I totally
agree with people that these types of
exclusive deals aren't customer Friday I
honestly thought that we did away with
you know company like carrier exclusive
phones like a long time ago we did who
is sure next will came out and decided
prove me wrong and you know that's let's
see how well and that that's paid off
for them since Natasha says the pixel
was too expensive and not enough
features I had the note 7 and minus the
exploding part it was hands-down the
best phone pixel was no comparison yeah
I mean Natasha
definitely brings up the point that like
the folks that did get the note 7
absolutely loved it and you know a lot
of the reviews before all those problems
started coming out with them were really
glowing and and they did Samsung packed
a lot of really impressive features into
that phone so I can definitely
appreciate the fact that you might felt
might have felt letdown after going to
the pixel which was was like a little
bit more of a run in the boom I think
the pixel is a great device I but for me
the you know biggest selling point was
the unlimited storage on like Google
Photos hmm that was incredible I
honestly wish like every Android phone
just had that feature yeah I'm that sure
definitely nice selling point I'm sure
Google has some preferential treatment
for their own phone but you know it
makes so much more sense hmm I love
having our regulars and friends coming
on back Michael Brown says do you think
the design of the pixel 2 would be
completely different from the first as
he confers with imagine soggy who says
the first version of any phone use
the best the pixel 2 will probably be
better in every single way Riki expands
on this saying I really hope the pixel 2
looks totally different and then Michael
Brown brings it full circle says compare
the first iPhone with the first pixel
iPhone had the same problems
availability and exclusivity yeah
indefinitely absolutely 110 percent
right so I have heard the point that
like especially with the first pixel
what is that they got a HTC to build it
and it's basically like off-the-shelf
parts yeah so they wanted to see the
viability of it they were a little bit
more careful with it with you know
bringing it to Verizon so they would at
least have a major carrier back it up
and an advertise it the expectation I
would think from from folks in the like
techs fear from customers whatever is
that this is going to be a much better
much more different design because
they're going to have a whole other year
to actually design this thing with like
its own customized look as opposed to
whatever HTC was able to pull off the
shelf
Matthew dacher says would having we're
moving into another topic here sorry I
guy I got distracted for a second let's
move on to the to the Google Docs issue
that's all you man Matthew dad sure says
would having two-factor authentication
have protected people from the Google
scam no because two-factor
authentication is usually when you log
in like you type your password in and
then it'll out it you know sends your
phone a text or it sends another email
address like oh here's the code you can
put it in this one was you specifically
gave permission for them to do it
already so you're not using a password
here so two-factor authentication when
I've done anything because even if they
have your paths have access to it they
can't log in from a different device
right and that's where two factor
authentication comes in in phishing you
know when you have when somebody has
your password then they just log into
your account and if you don't have two
factor authentication that's different
but in this case they already have
access but they only have access to the
device from the device where you like
gave it permission already so so in this
case the Google Docs like rogue app so
this was an actually Google Docs it was
like an app like kind of like any other
app that you see like Google sheets or
you know
like any like I'm trying to think like
what other asset is I use like beverage
if things like that like you give them
permission to get access to your
accounts and your Gmail accounts and
things like that like TweetDeck like you
tweet that has permission your Twitter
so in that case this basically looked
like Google Docs but it wasn't and then
you give it access you give a permission
to like read and read your emails and
write emails on your behalf kind of
thing and then most companies like won't
do anything with that you only give it
permission so that you know you can use
it to do those functions but in this
case you know because they had
permission they pretty much had your
password without ever needing to login
so too backed off authentication didn't
come in at all here well luckily they
attacked everybody all at one so it was
like much more bald-faced and obvious
than i guess it could have been if they
were a little bit more targeted about it
to be fair was fairly smart mmm like
they I mean like it was a different scam
yeah it was a different kind of attack I
just think it got way more attention
because they literally blast at
everybody well no I think it got way
more attention because they literally
blasted like newsrooms and journalists
no I'm seriously they were the majority
of the targets like like average people
like that I were talking to like didn't
even really know what was talking about
Wow until like they checked the news
could have been the Russians no big this
was like specifically targeted in
newsrooms that's always like blowing up
on Twitter like way before like any of
the news like Brooklyn mmm like all
these reporters that I was following
like talking about this don't click on
this you might have gone an email from
me like don't don't fall for it guy saw
lighting up on my facebook yesterday and
then I spoke first and my girlfriend she
knew someone who was affected by because
they were actually awaiting a Google Doc
delivery yeah and sure as hell that's
what fell through and yep I was I was
offended that I didn't get one until
like two hours after that all having is
like what am I not not real enough of a
journalist but I got one I got mine I
got I got two I was on one right after
the other
do we know anyone here who was affected
cuz I mean Derek is asking in the chat
if we have any idea how many Google Doc
accounts fell victim um while according
to Google 0.1% of all of Gmail users
were affected by this but they shut down
the Excel so they closed down the rogue
app so that that rogue app
is like gone now yeah and if you were
affected by this and you're you still
don't feel like 100% safe about it even
though Google has already shut down the
rogue app you can go to like your
security settings and then there should
be an area where you can check on like
the permissions on your on your Gmail
account like what a few do allow
permissions on and you can just revoke
access like one by one I mean you can do
the same thing on your Android phone
also when you like give permission
Stanny apps thank you for that I was
going to ask you next what were
suggestions were for those who were
affected yeah um before we wrap it up
could do it what what I still don't
understand this red ok bathing suit
thing ok sorry
so this company they make bathing suits
and they're fairly small they decide to
do a giveaway on their Instagram account
and the giveaway was basically please
post this photo and tag us in the photo
so they're looking to spam Instagram
feeds everywhere pretty much by free
advertising yeah it was basically like
oh post photos of our product and tagged
us so it's free advertising for us and
we'll give you like this free give you
the whole bathing suit yeah we'll get
this free night just like a percentage
ah basically cost like 64 dollars an
average sponsored post on Instagram cost
$300 you do the math all yeah people who
are desperate for free bathing suits are
you know basically saving them like 200
and like something like 30 something
dollars so I mean they were gonna make a
ton off of this but then it turned out
way too many people requests like posted
the photo and tag them in it and then
they couldn't meet the demand right
because they didn't cap it either
and we're like a lot of rookie mistakes
and then it's also a really dumb
strategy to like oh post this and you'll
get the free promo code for it because I
mean it's not like they're out anything
you didn't sign a contract yeah but they
like idiots now yeah they can't they
couldn't find every individual user who
posted it you know because it's like way
too many of them an Instagram search
isn't really that good no um so instead
of like individually going through
because there were more than like 5,000
that I had seen and that's that's like
when I decided to give up counting you
individually looked at all of these so
there were rows of them so instagrams
like grid does like if you've been
tagged in something it's like 3 by 3 or
whatever and you just keep scrolling
down
I counted up to a thousand like rows how
they are that's like about three
thousand I just kept scrolling down like
I stopped counting and I was like this
is like probably like five thousand - or
so in like the last 24 hours and then
there were even more after that I'm like
geez I'm not counting all of this I'm
just gonna more than five thousand
whatever I said rookie mistake
yeah I I think it's it's not as like
much of a blow up as like fire festival
because there's no ja Rule involved but
at the same time it's like 2017 Oh baby
ja Rule is been posted this bikini
photos I was like I want one but yeah
like 2017 is proving to be the year
where like there have been like a bunch
of marketing watches and let this is
another one but the best part the best
part is that because I couldn't count
all of it they posted another image and
say here's a free promo code so even if
you didn't post the picture you just get
the freebie you could get it anyway I'm
getting myself a red base all that spam
was completely useless
hey cheese and then the dress all all
their bathing suits are like sold out on
their website now which you can't even
like verify that's true maybe they just
put sold out so they wouldn't have to
like shell out all this stuff because
they updated like their terms of the
contest where it's like due to over well
overwhelming demand and we didn't expect
this to go viral we might not like we're
gonna have to cap this which basically
means we're not going to fulfill our
promises um so if anything we've learned
from this is that things on the internet
tend to go viral but if you tweet at me
I'll send you a locket of my hair then
we'll be bald by Monday alright anybody
doing anything for Star Wars day before
we call it a day there's a bunch of Star
Wars stuff on our website for the 40th
anniversary check it out
tons and tons of stuff there's like a
ton of stuff so you know joy you know
live long and prosper alright and get
out okay back it out let's let's call it
let's call it a week thanks everybody
