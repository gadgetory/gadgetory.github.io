year that really excited visitor was our
small oled TV well Your Enthusiasm has
not gone unnoticed and this year we've
got a much larger version for you this
is our 55 inch already revealed at just
4 millimeter thin and weighing only 7.5
program it's the worst finished largest
and lightest OLED TV the beauty of this
TV isn't just his appearance either the
picture quality quality is superb and of
course this is 3d capable and one
hundred percent comparable with other LG
3d glasses as you expect it from LG
Electronics our 40 it's for 84 inch size
cinema 3d TV uses an ultra definition
panel with a resolution and screen area
four times their of 40 24 HD panel we
have also made huge improvement to
design with llano full LED technology by
embedding the LED units directly into
the custom developed film we've been
able to create tin opener for a visually
stunning display unlike some of our
competitors we use a direct LED / night
unit to recreate really rich and deep
black levels introducing our cinema
screen design we've gone to great
lengths to reduce the thickness of our
TVs without sacrificing picture quality
LG cinema screen TB
has just a 1.0 millimeter bezel and 28
millimeter thickness let's talk about
input devices last year we introduced an
innovative new way of interacting with
TBS the ROG magic remove this year Magic
Remote as a wheel for scrolling to
improve navigation of large list pattern
register for intuitive control of common
features and most exciting of all voice
recognition as a natural solution for
text input now searching through the
endless amount of content available on
our Smart TVs becomes easier than ever
before with voice recognition taking
things a step further we are developing
a more lowest natural interface and
translate physical gestures into user
input this year in addition to voice
recognition we are introducing another
another major natural interface feature
3d gesture interface using a 3d camera
not only can you use your hand to
emulate a function of the Magic Remote
you can also enjoy the gains that
recognized entire body gestures last
year we introduced masher which is our
feature for sharing media between all
the products this year we've updated it
by adding a lot of new features and we
called it Smosh plus we have added Wi-Fi
screen sharing to mirror the older
display on the mobile devices second
display for mobile devices which allows
the TV to be used as supplementary
display mobile high-definition link for
the best quality video
action from comparable mobile devices
and finally widi through a strategic
alliance between LG and Intel LG cinema
3d smart TB will be the first in the TV
industry to feature intel widi
