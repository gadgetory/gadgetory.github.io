just won't die Samsung announced it
plans to refurbish and resell the
recalled phone like a phoenix rising
from its ashes the note 7 is being
reborn again because Samsung needs to
find an environmentally responsible way
to get rid of more than four million
phones and he just Chuck millions of
phones into the trash it would be
horrible for the environment not to
mention the South Korean government
could punish Samsung and charge a hefty
fine for that kind of pollution now to
sell a refurbished note 7 samsung said
it still needs approval from local
authorities and carriers it is doubtful
that you'll see a note 7 on sale again
in a US or European market but reports
have suggested that the company may be
looking to unload the tainted phone in
emerging markets like Vietnam in India
and it would sell it with a smaller
safer battery inside Samsung blamed bad
batteries for the phone Catching Fire so
using a smaller battery would be a
simple way to salvage the phone
Samsung lost an estimated five billion
dollars in the global recall disaster
and reselling some of those notes sevens
could help ease some of that monetary
loss but the company will not be able to
resell every phone so the rest will be
stripped of components and metals will
be extracted to recycle and reuse the
parts in other ways believe it or not
there are still some original note 7s in
the wild not everyone has turned in this
dangerous phone maybe a few collectors
want to hang on to the model as a
historical keepsake but the few
surviving phones may be killed off soon
Samsung announced it is releasing an
update to the phone to its South Korean
users that will stop the phone from
being able to charge the company did
this already for us phones back in
December and all of this comes just days
before Samsung is set to reveal its next
big comeback phone the Galaxy s8 I'm
