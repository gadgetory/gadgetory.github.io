Facebook feed I'm Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update you can now broadcast
live video to your friends on Facebook
it's all in real time and it works just
like Twitter's periscope app this new
feature is first being rolled out to a
small percentage of people in the US
with iPhones and here's how it works
you'll start a broadcast from the mobile
app and friends can write comments as
they watch the broadcaster can also like
a comment during a broadcast and you're
going to see the number of people
watching as well as their names when
it's over the videos posted to the
person's timeline and it can be viewed
again there's also a subscribe button
for viewers to get notified the next
time that person goes live obviously
this is going to be a major challenger
to the periscope app which is popular
with Twitter users so if you're in a big
event are you going to choose to share
with your Facebook friends or the open
world of Twitter Facebook is trying to
become more like Twitter as a media hub
and a place to discover breaking news
this feature was something Facebook
first reserved only for celebrity
accounts back in August meanwhile
there's a familiar face attempting to
come back in the chat Kingdom yahoo
right now we have tons of chat apps
there's facebook Messenger snapchat
whatsapp and Google Hangouts to name a
few of the big ones but it wasn't that
long ago that AOL and Yahoo ruled the
chat world with budding lists and screen
names well Yahoo Messenger has returned
in app form and it hopes to stand apart
with a new feature the unsend yes you
can take back a message you regret
sending maybe it's good for drunk
textures but that also can cause fights
when proof of a conversation could just
vanish at any moment yahoo messenger
also lets you send a huge number of
photos in an instant and it's tying in
tumblr gifts search so you can quickly
reply with an animated gif which is
something you can also easily do on
facebook Messenger the new yahoo
messenger app is available for androids
and iPhones but the timing of the launch
is a bit awkward there have been
anonymous source reports that Yahoo is
considering to sell off some of its
business hmm but there's much bigger
news breaking in the texting
world those of you with nexus
smartphones and tablets are going to be
the first of the Android clan to get the
new emoji icons Apple folks have been
flaunting the unicorn the taco and
dozens of other new icons and faces for
a few months now since iOS 9.1 came out
in October but soon these emoji are also
going to show up on Android the vice
president of Android tweeted the news
that is rolling out next week and it
starts with Nexus devices that's it for
this tech news update and there's more
as cnet com from our studios in New York
