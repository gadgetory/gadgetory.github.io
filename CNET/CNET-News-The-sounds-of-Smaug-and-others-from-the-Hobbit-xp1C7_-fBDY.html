bring the audience more into an
immersive world with sound bikinis angry
tanya Peter is you know he just loves
technology and he loves to push the
envelope he's aware of what we can do
with this as well and he'll throw out
ideas and we'll throw out ideas about
how we may treat a sound or how we may
whether that would actually be a sound
that might be interesting to play around
with at most we walk into a real silence
but a silence that you can hear of this
room just echoing and one way you know
that is that Bilbo walks down and he
knocks on the wall and just you the
knock kind of goes on forever I will not
risk this quest that's an interesting
scene for at most because it gives us
the ability to sort of really open that
room up so that the audience feels this
massive stone hall at the same time you
know we would have smaug's voice and
growls do this interesting thing where
they would emanate from his from his
mouth but then they would flow through
the room and then bounce off the back
walls we sort of present to Peter and
Fran our first pass but you know we only
go so far in the sense that you know
we're thinking about sound and and
they're thinking about story and they
come in and say yeah that's cool what
you did here but this is what's
happening dramatically that
collaboration with the filmmaker for us
as mixers is crucial and and it makes us
do some things that are far more amazing
than we do on our own with Peter and
Fran's direction if I took a specific
wind and put it up in the ceiling you
felt like you were up on top of a
mountain looking at this huge Vista
around you both of us look at each other
and it's sort of light went off and we
realized oh we have to be really
discreet and we have to make very smart
decisions about what sounds we put where
and how we blend them and and so I
thought that was a big lesson for me and
at my school when the academy at large
acknowledges that with a nomination it's
sort of like oh boy that feels really
good
Michael semantics is mixing the music
Michael Hedges it's mixing the dialogue
and myself Christopher boys I'm mixing
the sound effects we know what we put
into it we know we're incredibly proud
of it but to know that other people hear
that as well and acknowledge it is just
enormous
and if we've done our job well nobody
should be thinking about sounds they
should be having a good
Villas very do not think I won't kill</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
