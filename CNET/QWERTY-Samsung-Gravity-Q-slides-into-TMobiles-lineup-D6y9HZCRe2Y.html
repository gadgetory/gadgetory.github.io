is okay you know you wondering why I'm
saying that I'm saying that because this
phone does look like it's a decade old
but I'm Kim Sherman and I'm here to give
you a first look at the samsung gravity
queue now I know and this isn't a
criticism trust me when I say that this
phone does look like from another time
because I recognize that there are a lot
of people that probably want a phone
like this well maybe not a lot but few
people that probably want this they want
something it doesn't require data plan
which is this kind of phone they want
something with a physical keyboard and
they want something it's just not a
literally complicated with a lot of
features they're not going to use this
phone definitely fits the bill for all
of that it is only 153 with of course
with t-mobile service that means you
don't need a contract you can just put a
few dollars down you can pay it off in
monthly installments or you can pay it
off at all at once but that's a pretty
reasonable price for a phone that
doesn't change to t-mobile for two years
it is pretty small so of course you want
to remember that it does have a small
screen it's not very bright it's not
very colorful it doesn't have a lot of
graphics does have five home screens so
you can cycle between them you can
actually place widgets on the home
screen so you can get to things like
your email Andy the features that you
use pretty often so that's something we
wouldn't have seen a long time ago but
it is nice the screen is pretty
responsive to your touch there seems to
be a little bit of a lag but not too bad
so I wouldn't worry about it there are
two dedicated touch controls down below
that are in the hardware their phone as
well as the dedicated back button that
is a physical control so nice mixture of
controls shakes it up pretty well here
on the side there's a volume rocker you
have a microSD slot over here
nice to see a micro SD or expandable
memory slot on the phone of this stature
especially something so small and not
very powerful over in this size you have
a dedicated camera control and a power
control as well on the back there's your
lens for the two megapixel camera so two
megapixel Beth's than something else
from another age doesn't have a flash
doesn't have any really complicated
camera technology but you know it is a
camera for those times that you need it
it's light up the phone turn it on side
slide it up you'll see that the screen
automatically rotates there's no
accelerometer so the screen isn't going
to rotate if you tip it like this it
will rotate though when you open the
phone down below there is a four row
keypad so it's pretty spacious actually
and what I like one thing I look for all
the time is that there's plenty of space
between the bottom of the phone or the
bottom of the slider and the first row
of keys you're not
constantly pumping your finger up
against that so definitely have that
numbers do share space with letters as
well as symbols so you're gonna have to
you know hit like a shift button or a
function button to get to some of the
other special characters it's not really
unusual that we see that on a lot of
phones especially the physical keyboards
a nice wide space bar in the middle
which is nice sometimes space bars they
put them on either side they put them
over the end so it's nice to see it in
the middle of something that you used to
the use of keyboards of course inside
pretty standard feature is to make
epistle camera as I said some email
texting but really this is a phone for
making calls sending text not really a
lot else having a lot of Samsung
gravities in this line this is just the
latest most of them have been pretty
basic like this I wouldn't recommend
this phone for anyone it wants a lot out
of it so this is really a basic phone
for making calls keeping in touch and
it's gonna be really easier well I'm Ken
Sherman here with the first look at the
samsung gravity you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
