google Isha's it's everything google
that we can pack inside of a show let's
jump in and the latest report from
phandroid says we can expect a whole lot
more from Android wear now their sources
claim the next update will include a new
direct watch to watch communication and
new interactive watch faces a new
feature currently called together will
allow users to send messages images and
stickers or emojis directly to other
Android wear watches yes now there's no
confirmation that sending your heartbeat
or making drawings like the Apple watch
is part of it yet the googs is also
working on interactive watch faces that
would allow you to tap on it to change
the face so that it delivers additional
information to you think of it like
cycling through a list of options with a
tap a tap could show you your current
fitness levels or something like more
details about the day's weather alright
we talked about the new google glass
enterprise edition last week we know the
explorers edition for consumers has been
squashed and according to a 925 google
report google is currently planning to
distribute the device exclusively
through their current glass for work
partners they aren't planning to bring
it to the consumer market anytime soon
and adding a 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi band
support is one of the improvements to
help with better quality video streaming
for the current workplace applications
now Google's partners will be loading
their own proprietary software on the
devices in addition to the new benefits
of a larger prism display and an intel
atom processor that brings better
performance and improve battery life
I'll write a report by the information
says Google's next manufacturing partner
for the new Nexus phone will be hallway
Google is known to switch around between
partners every year for each new phone
and Huawei would be the first Chinese
manufacturer to make a pure Google
smartphone reports also say they're
working with Google to bring the Google
Play sort of China which is very
restrictive developers have been able to
upload apps to sell internationally but
in many instances Chinese consumers
aren't able to download them so this
could help open up the app market
overseas
also google recently released the second
developer preview of Android M over the
weekend and you can get if you want to
check it out at developer.android.com
it's currently only compatible with the
Nexus 5 69 and the Nexus player but some
of the improvements that you can check
out include the best one enabling the
new landscape default launcher that was
available to tablet but wasn't even
available on some phablets it also
includes a new app drawer that brings
back a more traditional four column view
and you can scroll up and down in a
letter will pop up on the side to show
you where you are alphabetically and
there's a new layout for widgets as well
you'll have the ability to quickly
delete a screenshot if you don't like
how it looks before it saves to your
library and there's new storage and
memory settings that you can tweak along
with other subtle changes now the
official release for Android am is
expected sometime around September this
year and finally galaxy note 5 fans will
be getting good news sooner rather than
later after a Wall Street Journal report
says Samsung is planning to move the
launch of the note 5 forward from sep
tember to August to get the device on
sale ahead of apple's typical September
iphone launch recent earnings reports
continue to show samsung smartphone
profits falling as smartphone sales
overall are also slowing alright that's
going to do for this week's show you can
always email us at google issues at cnet
com or tweet me at brian Tong thanks for
watching we'll see you guys next time
