overnight for an iPhone but now people
are doing that for a car I'm Bridget
Carey this is your scene at update would
you stand in line to buy a car that
you've never seen before that's what's
happening around the world as people are
standing in line to be among the first
to plop down $1,000 to reserve a new
Tesla Model 3 and many even camped out
overnight
of course people go crazy for the Tesla
brand but here's the wild twist these
photos of lines are people who have not
yet even seen the car nor do they have
any information about it Tesla CEO Elon
Musk unveils details late Thursday night
which is after this report is recorded
and also past my bedtime
so why the mania for mystery vehicle
it's the price the aim was to have this
new all-electric car cost around $35,000
another Tesla's start at around 70 grand
for those that lined up early at Tesla
dealerships around the world they will
still have to do quite a bit of waiting
before driving one because it's not
expected to come out until late next
year now while you still have to leave
the house to buy a car Amazon is making
it so you don't even need to log on to a
computer or phone to buy more coffee
coconut water or even condoms Amazon is
expanding its - button program which
lists Prime members press an
internet-connected plastic button in
their home to get more of a certain
brands products delivered to their door
it launched a year ago with about 18
brands but now with this expansion there
are more than a hundred different
buttons including one for Doritos one
for Red Bull and one for Trojan condoms
oh boy that's an exciting night right
there it's only for Amazon Prime members
which is a hundred dollar yearly
subscription that includes free two-day
shipping and other perks but if you like
paying even more for Prime well then you
should buy it from Sprint the wireless
carrier is letting customers add Prime
to their monthly mobile plan bill for
about $11 a month which comes out to 33
dollars more a year than you would pay
otherwise so unless you're doing it for
just a short term thanks but no thanks
also in Amazon news the company's new
smart speakers the echo dot and Amazon
tap are now arriving to those that
pre-ordered and we're busy testing them
out so stay tuned for our reviews
meanwhile Nintendo's first mobile app is
now available to download it's called
miitomo
and it's like a social network that
gives you points for using it which you
can spend on outfits if you like to
waste precious hours of your life with
me it's available on Apple and Android
app stores that's all for this tech news
roundup from our studios in New York I'm
