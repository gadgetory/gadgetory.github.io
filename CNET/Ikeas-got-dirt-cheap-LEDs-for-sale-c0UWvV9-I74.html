been selling LED light bulbs for a while
but now they've got ones that cost less
than five dollars each let's take a look
if you've been to an Ikea you know that
they sell a lot of lamps and lighting
related products so it only makes sense
that they would sell light bulbs as well
and IKEA has been a big proponent of
LEDs these two bulbs represent the
current generation of ideas 60 watt
replacement offering they call it the
lid RA now you get two options here one
with a frosted globe and one with the
clear globe both bulbs will put out the
same amount of light using the same
amount of power 600 lumens from 10 watts
now that's not great right because a
60-watt incandescent will put out
something like eight hundred and 80
lumens so you really want at least 800
lumens from a 60 watt replacement these
call themselves a 60 watt replacement
but only put out 600 lumens I don't like
that at all the efficiency of these
bulbs is also a little disappointing
because it comes in at 60 lumens per
watt that's not as good as curry not as
good as Phillips not as good as almost
any other LED that you'll find now the
brightness and efficiency of these bulbs
comes off as a bit disappointing ikea
seems to be trying to make up for that
with a focus on color rendering these
bulbs have a score of 87 which means
that they do a much better job of making
colors like accurate and vivid than a
standard LED would take a look at these
comparison shots we got a nice
great-looking bowl of M&amp;amp;MS there and if
you adjust from a fillip 60 watt to the
ikea bulb there's a noticeable uptick in
the color quality that bowl looks a
little more white the colors pop a
little more it's not quite as good as
what you'll see with a high CRI bulb
like the Cree TW series or the GE reveal
here's a picture of that bulbs
performance but it's not far off it's
somewhere in the middle between the
standard bulb and that high CRI bulb and
that's a pretty good place to be for a
bulb it costs a lot less than those
standard competitors all in all I think
these bulbs offer very good value at a
price point of less than five dollars
each I don't love the down tick' and
brightness or efficiency but that focus
on color rendering helps them feel
inexpensive but not cheap for cnet I'm
right wrist
