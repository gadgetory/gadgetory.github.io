current thinnest and lightest tablet be
toshiba excite 10 LD toshiba is back
with a new 10-inch tablet d toshiba
excite 10 hi i'm eric franklin and today
i'll take a look at my little friend
here the toshiba excite 10 the exciting
feels about as thin and as light as most
other tablets released these days you
know less than a pound and a half and
more than 1.2 pounds in weight give or
take and it's about us then maybe a bit
thinner than the new ipad built quality
seems better than the excite le with a
groove metal back but it's really bendy
which not a big deal but something i'm
not overly fond of in tablets also and
yes this is kind of an epic but the edge
feels like it could come off if i pulled
hard enough if the tablet has one thing
that makes it stand out it will be the
full size SD card slot which supports up
to 128 gigabyte cards in addition to
that you also get micro USB micro hdmi a
headphone jack and a rotation lock the
bottom edge has dual speakers and a dock
connector which connects to Sheba's
proprietary cable that is a bit too long
and thick guys really really and
honestly kind of gets in a way the front
camera is 2 megapixels and the back is 5
megapixels with LED flash the back
camera records 1080p video but honestly
it looks kind of washed out and a little
bit grainy navigating fields snappy
enough for an android tablet however the
screen isn't as responsive to the touch
as the asus transformer tf300 with the
Tegra 3 is fast internal some games
scale to higher frame rates but same old
story still only a handful take specific
Vantage of the Tegra 3 architecture the
screen does exhibit some backlight
bleeding on the left and right edges
especially when viewing a black image
the excite 10 comes in 16 32 and 64
gigabyte versions starting at four
hundred fifty dollars that's the same
price as the acer iconia a 510 but
higher than the asus transformer tf300
which starts at three hundred eighty
bucks surely excite 10 has expandable
memory up to 128 gigabytes but that
really seems to be all it has to make
stand out check out my full review for
more info in my final verdict once again
i'm eric franklin and this has been a
first look at the toshiba excite 10</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
