here not what the world's lamest flight
saver but actually with a new light bulb
this is the GE Brite stick LED and you
can see it's not really a bulb at all
it's actually more of a lipstick tube
shaped cylinder that shines out light in
all directions and under lampshade looks
more or less the same as the old bulbs
now aside from the shape what's really
interesting about this light is the
price point ge is gonna be selling them
in three packs at Home Depot for $10
each and that's a very good deal if
you've been waiting to upgrade the
lights in your home that price puts this
light right on par with the new Phillips
60 watt replacement LED that's a $5 LED
you can get at Home Depot and right now
they're selling it at 2 for 1 pricing
but that will expire soon this ge
praised the 3 for 10 dollars isn't going
anywhere so within a month or so it's
gonna be the cheapest LED you can get
from a major manufacturer now it's
pretty happy with this bulb when I
tested it out a little bit dimmer than
you might like it's 786 lumens but
probably not quite enough to notice
close enough to 800 that you'll be happy
with it it's got a nice color
temperature at 2700 K and you can also
get daylight versions at the same price
so there's two options there one that's
orange and one that's kind of blue one
caveat though this bulb isn't dimmable
so if you try and dial the lights down
on a dimmer switch you'll get a lot of
flicker and Buzz you don't want that now
it's not quite as good as that Philips
bulb in brightness or efficiency the
Philips bulb has about an extra 50
lumens again a very tough distinction to
notice and also better efficiency the
Philips bulb uses 8.5 watts this is a 10
watt bulb so the Philips bulb in the
long run is gonna cost slightly less to
use about 20 cents less per year in
energy costs that said this ge bright
stick does have a couple of edges over
Phillips it has a longer warranty at
five years Philips gives you three and
also a longer lifespan 15 thousand hours
compared to the ten thousand hours or so
that you'll get out of that Philips bulb
I also like that despite the odd shape
it still cast plenty of downward reading
lines so if you wanted to read under
this thing you'll have no problem
all in all at about 3 bucks a bulb this
is a pretty terrific value and if you've
been waiting to upgrade the lights in
your home and looking for a good option
to do a lot at once this might be the
exact thing you're looking for thanks
