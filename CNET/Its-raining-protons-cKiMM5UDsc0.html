brigitte carry on sina com and it's time
to get loaded a radiation storm hit
earth tuesday morning the largest since
2005 the burst of charged particles from
the Sun is causing glitches with some
highly tuned GPS and communication
systems especially in the north it may
also cause fluctuations in the power
grid aircraft are avoiding areas like
the North Pole but for most of us there
will be no noticeable effect on our
everyday gadgets if you live in a
northern state take a gander at the sky
for the next two days some folks might
catch a beautiful bright Aurora a few of
these reports say Aurora's might even be
visible from New York it's a computer a
computer if it's printed on a sheet of
plastic a Norway company called thin
film electronics prints basic computing
components on a strip of plastic called
a smart tag the first use of this
technology is to monitor temperature on
perishable goods like foods or medicine
it would be a cheaper solution than the
alarm sensors used today vimeo the video
posting site for the artsy crab is
rolling out a redesign beginning tuesday
users can sign up to be among the first
to see the new look and features which
will go live to everyone midway through
the year some improvements to vimeo
include increased loading speeds search
and privacy options for those of you
cool enough to have a nickname or known
only by a pseudonym you can finally be
allowed to socialize freely on the
google plus network you see google plus
always wanted people to use the real
names but out of the 90 million users
signing up many argue they were better
known by another identity than the real
name so google will now allow these
pseudonyms like Madonna but google has
to see some proof that it is an
established identity online with a
meaningful following so for all my
followers today I will be changing my
account to the name all my loved ones
and homies use be skillet in other
Google News Google's hotel finder tool
which launched last summer has a new
feature that lets users spine hotels by
travel time to certain spots or which
hotels are near a landmark it's only
available in a handful of cities like
New York Las Vegas Honolulu Paris London
and Bangkok these areas partnered with
local transit agencies to integrate
their data into Google Maps
it's a move that makes the online hotel
booking industry more competitive for
websites like hotels com or priceline
but Priceline to is in the news the site
is focusing more on selling fixed price
hotel inventory and because of that
Priceline has killed off William
Shatner's character the priceline
negotiator a role he's played on
commercials for five years the latest
commercial shows the negotiator falling
off a cliff and a bus after saving the
passengers no he can't be dead Jim maybe
he just got beamed up the last second
yeah that's it those are your headlines
for today I'm Bridget Carey for cnet.com
