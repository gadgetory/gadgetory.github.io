out the ZTE nubia 5s mini it's an
unlocked phone that will run on AT&amp;amp;T
mobile networks here in the US and you
can get it on Amazon for 279 99 starting
august 27 but you can start pre ordering
it on August twentieth if you use the
Android phone the Nubian 5s mini might
be a little confusing as using a custom
Android skin from ZTE that changes quite
a bit about the experience there's no
app tray for example so any app you
install is going to sit right on your
home screens if you're coming from an
iphone that'll be familiar but I always
thought that not being able to hide the
apt you don't use really often feels
kind of cluttered you can of course just
stick thing as the folders the phone is
also running on Android 4.3 jelly bean
which is disappointing now that many new
phones are running on Android 4.4 KitKat
there's a single speaker on the back and
like many phones it's pretty terrible
audio is really scratchy and tinny you
can always pair it with a Bluetooth
speaker if you need to hear games movies
or music out loud but I always just plug
headphones in speaking of games
performance is pretty good the phone
runs on a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon
processor and you can really zip through
menus and fire up apps out any real lag
I tried some higher-end android games
like dead trigger 2 real racing 3
asphalt 8 and everything performed
fairly well even on the highest settings
for games that let you tweak that sort
of thing I ran into occasional slowdown
in stuttering but all that tends to
disappear if you turn quality settings
down attack the 4.7 inch touch screen
has a 720p resolution which isn't that
great when you compared to modern phones
that are running it super high retina
resolutions but for less than 300 bucks
unlock it's not bad there's also 16 gigs
of storage but you can expand that with
up to 32 gig micro SD cards the phone's
biggest drawbacks are what's supposed to
be it's selling point the cameras
they're both high resolution 13
megapixels on the rear camera 5
megapixels on the front but lots of
megapixels don't necessarily mean a
great camera the photos i took with this
phone tended to be really noisy and
missing a lot of finer details the
autofocus was also kind of sluggish so
if a cat is doing something really cute
you can have to snap the photo and hope
you get something usable the camera
shoots 1080p video and quality is better
and generally much sharper but
autofocus is problematic here too you
can lock the focus when you're taking
pictures and shooting video but
sometimes I just want to pull the phone
out and start recording and not
necessarily fumble about with advanced
settings now I keep coming back to the
price for a reason to 7999 for a phone
with decent specs is a pretty good deal
especially because it's unlocked now I
test it on 18 TS that work but you could
just pop in a tmobile sim card or if you
like to travel abroad pop in a local sim
card and you can save yourself a lot of
cash I'm Nate Ralph now be sure to read
