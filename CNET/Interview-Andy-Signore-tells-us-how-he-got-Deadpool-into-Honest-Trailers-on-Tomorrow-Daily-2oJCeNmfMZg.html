he created
yeah and movie fights and so much more
about screen junkies Andy signor thanks
for stopping by bud thanks for having me
guys to be here you have had a pretty
major week at honest trailers we have
we've had an epic week I think you could
say Deadpool showed up in your honest
trailer for Deadpool he did and argued
with the voice he sure did
does the voice have an official name I
mean a real the real person is named
John Bailey but does the voice have a
name that's a great question no one's
asked that voice he's no he has like a
family he is a bit broken marriage he
has a kid is yelled at him so he there
is it we do have a character I don't
think we've ever given him a name so
that's a good I'm gonna start thinking
about that but so okay so you were able
to get he were able to get Ryan Reynolds
not only uh to do with this but also
have him in the costume kind of a big
deal
he wasn't in the costume we tricked you
there oh really yeah it was just his
voice he was actually in England that's
the mask we took we took the promos
because we wanted we needed to separate
when he was talking when he wasn't you
could feel like always talk to the guys
talking to us but yeah we he just did
the audio and it was several recording
sessions that we did with Ryan Reynolds
which was insane to me that that
actually all transpired how did that
come together yeah a shot to him yeah so
we saw I saw the movie in theaters and I
was like and Spencer our writer and I
was just like how are we gonna do this
on his trailer because we just knew
immediately like they did like honest
credits and they did all the stuff on my
face like your stick well I didn't mean
to say that but it's like they're doing
our tone like this is it like if we were
to do a movie how do you decide yeah how
are we gonna build a top top you can't a
joke and a joke is always never as
successful so I immediately enough
remove I'm like I got to try and get
Ryan Reynolds like dude Deadpool in the
trailer and I think at that point we
were feeling a little cocky because
we're like we got the Russo brothers or
on record turns and we've had other
people were like if we're ever gonna be
able finally I had always had this dream
for ever gonna finally get a celebrity
to do their own
I was like this is the perfect one their
marketing has been great spot on fourth
wall it's like this is the perfect
example of how you would do this yeah so
correct and so I just made it my mission
and then we I started on Twitter is how
I did it and so I started campaign on
Twitter hashtag Deadpool for the
Deadpool honest trailer and it got some
traction so many of our fans across the
web
we have fan Janine who was making
posters and she would send them like
every two days
and so we've sent a Rhett Reese the
writer and Ryan they were the owns on
Twitter Rhett Reese eventually wrote
back and was like sorry I'm busy writing
Deadpool - and I was like fair excuse
okay and then after a little while I got
it like a little ping on my H login it's
like Ryan Reynolds is following you on
Twitter right and then I see in my inbox
a message from Ryan and I'm just like
and it was just a very polite long email
looks like hey dude what's up I got your
messages he's like I'm a big fan I love
the Green Lantern trailer which was like
crazy you guys are awesome and they just
went to proceed like I'm really busy you
know I'm down - what do you want what
are you thinking we then they revealed
they tried to do an Australian tea the
end credits was gonna be oh they're on
his trailer so they wrote one I'm still
haven't seen it I'm dying to see what
they did but it didn't work they didn't
feel like was funny or they couldn't
muster it see they're harder than call
you I was gonna say right then they
think but anyway long story short I that
I knew all right I got one email back
because I don't want to like I can't
hang on this guy he's polite enough he's
reached out sure less than all of you
are trying to get an a-lister in your
shows
don't don't have them too much right you
got to be polite you got to be cool
about it so I thought I'm trying to like
exactly but there is like a protocol so
I Mercado and I've had some prep I've
had some embarrassing encounters before
that I know I'm I regret like
experienced bleeding I know I'm a pro
now I'm like I got it I got it hey
what's up Ryan like you normal and I
just pitched him back I'm like here's
what we want to do if you're not up for
it we get it I wanted to give him an out
just so I knew he was really interested
and sure enough the dude was so
interested not only that but then he
emails me like no studio no PR no agent
just direct the cool guy cool dude who
just gets it and it was like how do we
make this good for you guys and anymore
he ended up doing it over the course of
four or five weeks and it was just
insane it was just so fun to work with
him he got it he there was no joke he
turned down he's
there was some he wanted to adjust or
make funnier but I just love that he was
up for everything yeah you see it sounds
like he was super game for it and and it
shows in the the honest trailer cuz it's
really funny it's perfect how do you
guys set about making one of those from
you what's the process so I mean I I
stood to did it with my partner Brent
way back who helped me sort of do the
show and now he left I think trailered
15 or something we're now 150 so I've
been leaving it the process since then
and the team really now is our head
writer Spencer Gilbert does most of the
writing now he'll watch the movie we all
have seen the movie he'll will officer
I've share some notes and then he'll go
for a deep dive and do the first draft
and then after some notes we've share
and then we'll go and and I'll punch it
through and be like what do we this is
this isn't working we need go broader
here stuff like that and then usually
it's two or three more drafts that we
then go through I think Deadpool had 10
drafts because we really were like let's
do this one make sure plus we had time
usually we don't have time we're always
like a week ahead get it out the door
but that's the process we watch the
movie Issac Spencer sometimes watches at
3 and maybe 1/4 by through skimming and
then we give it to editor and then it's
there it's usually takes about a week
and a half Wow like I would think it
would take longer than that because I
would feel like I would need to watch a
movie like eight times so I really get
all of those nuances but I'm sure now
it's sort of a formula we know okay from
blank comes that you know we know which
jokes were setting up and then obviously
we're always trying to challenge
ourselves which is one did of how do we
mix the format up we did well with
boyhood where we just didn't even have a
voiceover and I like when we challenge
ourselves like that where it's like how
do we screw with our format so it
doesn't feel like we're doing the same
you have like totally do you have set of
rules for yourselves as far as what you
want do oh yeah I push a lot I mean it's
always be honest it's so in it which
sounds stupid but it's like it's not
sarcastic trailers it's not it's not
about I mean we make jokes the show is a
comedy series but is this honest as a
question I'm always happy on the trailer
is actually the other role like is this
trailer enough like sometimes we go off
on too many tangents where I feel like
we're just doing a commentary sure where
it's like how do we make and then
usually it's funny or because of that
when we really stick to the guy being a
trailer voice trying to do it is
something you want to stick into so when
you guys started doing honest trailers
obviously it was like a lot smaller than
it is
now but like you mentioned earlier the
Russo brothers when they were making if
you guys didn't know this the Russo
brothers when they were making Winter
Soldier tried to make it specifically
honest trailers proof so what is that
like what is that feeling like to know
that there are filmmakers out there
going like we have to do this right so
that honest trailers doesn't just kill
us I mean it's insane I mean the story
that also was like we we didn't know
that when we were making our Winter
Soldier trailer and we were like we're
having a tough time pretty good yeah we
can nitpick which we say in the trailer
like get ready for nitpicking but then
we learn later that yes they were like
apparent and then now we've talked to
them a couple times and Joe and Anthony
and we're like yeah I can't tell you
many times who said I don't want to hear
this an effing honest trailer gotta bulk
up this logic and it's like amazing to
me cuz that's great it's the goal like
of course we don't hate movies make
movies better it's not that hard to just
sometimes do one last comb through like
does this make sense like I just say a
line to make sure this make sense
because it's a movie of course we're
gonna if we render the movie and
invested you let a lot of things slide
but sometimes movies just don't so how
do we get a flash drive every episode in
it I will say the Babbitt's who read
trailers one that I think everyone is
very there's a lot of pressure on my
favorite movie of the year is gonna be
the honest trailer for Batman Superman
pressure
thanks bro we are very we're up to task
and we're very excited for that I cannot
wait to see the response is there a part
of you that gets excited when a big
movie like that is you go it has a whole
history it's like I don't know I don't
want to take forever but it's like the
DDC fans are so mad about it it's like
you're allowed to like the movie like
it's okay I didn't like the movie I'm
allowed to not like the movie and I feel
like I have justified reasons why I
didn't like Italy I love those
characters and I get there are different
versions of the characters but when
you're spending 200 million dollars on a
Batman V Superman movie you do sort of
have to please the masses
John I think that's one of the things
though that I see
makes honest trailers so successful is
that you guys never come from a place of
mean-spiritedness there's never a like
you said no sarcasm it's not like a
we're gonna rip this movie to shreds
because it because we hate these things
it's because you love movies and you
want them to be better you want them to
have better logic and audiences deserve
to have that experience of a better
movie going you know just a total
experience that you guys are willing
sort of ribbit hard but still you know
have it it's all in good nature like
it's all very good-natured it's all very
like you you love movies like you can
really get that through honest trailers
like you never feel like these guys hate
movies like this is what's terrible no
we definitely love movies and thank you
I mean that's definitely our goal we're
never trying to just crap on a movie
like that we definitely are trying to
crap sometimes on the logic or the the
choices certainly always have made it
but we always try to justify it with the
reason of this is why this isn't working
like why would I believe in this and so
yes we never are trying to say it on the
movie even with movies we hate we do
sort of like transformers we just call
out how lazy it is and that's a way to
sort of explain why we hate it without
just saying screw this movie I think we
might have said screw that movie just
because like oh god we gotta watch this
movie after the fifth one or whatever it
was but um we try and share why it's
like he'd litter but Michael Bay
literally reuse his shots in the movie
like you don't even have the courtesy to
and he like left green-screen screens I
don't like how do you mess like come if
you're not even gonna be fully invested
neither away so we we will call him out
when that's fair yeah exactly you're
very fair about your honesty it's never
it's never in an effort to be extra mean
to a movie it's and again it's honest I
mean I think that that's really I think
the difference is the big difference for
me is not trying to convince someone
that something is bad you know it's just
like we're trying to just call out
what's there and not not say here's our
argument for why you should not like
that correct right exactly um so what is
your favorite honest trailer that is
published thus far uh I changes a lot
but I'm really proud of the lame is Rob
Lowe on labor medley miserable we just
it was our we just decided to do an all
musical one and I just did not have any
faith that it was gonna work even I was
like I don't know but I loved the
challenge I was like of course we're
doing this
but we got a Broadway songwriter who I'm
not allowed to say his name but a legit
by the way it rhymes with blanchard of
lloyd blabber like musicals you guys
know I worked on musicals you know and
so it's like that was crazy to me and he
really helped us we wrote the lyrics and
did it but then he totally shift made
the music and sung helped us sing it
because to sing in that style is really
tough yeah and I didn't think we'd like
how are we gonna do this and we wrote it
and then it just came out and I was like
oh this is so fun and so I love when we
can do those so that one stands out and
I really like Superman for it's just we
went back and like an 80s trailer and it
was back in the day where now every
movies been asked for but it was like we
found one comment it was like dude that
movie we're like okay one guy here is
loaded when he saw that it went up he
was like they were listening to me
and then Lion King is just a avbyte help
us with no one knows of what there were
you say circle of life bit which still
makes me laugh I always the one that
always makes me laugh is when you guys
say instead of Michael Caine it's my
cocaine it's so simple and dance of pure
you wrote it in the script and I didn't
get it and I'm like Michael hey and then
I said it I'm like oh what are the other
things you're you're doing we know about
movie fights by the way fans loved you
you had an aggressive fighter against
you I think you were a little like what
oh I didn't know yeah people take that
show seriously they do indeed I had a
