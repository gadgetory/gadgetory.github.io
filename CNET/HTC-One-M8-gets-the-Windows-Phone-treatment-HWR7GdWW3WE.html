m8 well there's a windows phone 8.1
version the HTC One m8 for Windows and
it's now available it's got the same
exact design as before so it's got that
same really nice aluminum shell it's got
the duo camera it's got an IR blaster on
the top that connects with HTC's own
sense TV app and that's built in an
optimized for Windows 8.1 it's actually
Windows 8.1 point 1 plus you've got
Cortana of course and you've got a HTC
camera app in here that is pretty much
the same as well you had in the android
version you've got things like four
grounder you focus and in a number of
other features plus the ability with you
focus to be able to do dual focus shots
to get that effect which is not
currently available in any other windows
phone it's available in a 32 gig
variation with a micro SD card slot that
holds up to 128 gigs and it is verizon
that is the debut phone provider for
this and one of the other interesting
features on this blinkfeed which is
again HTC's app that allows you to scan
news and information android phone users
will be familiar with that the rest of
it that's Windows fun but the idea of
having a phone with the hardware that's
consistent running two different types
of software is a nice idea right now a
lot of Windows Phone owners abuse to
nokia this is a very popular great phone
and now it's running Windows Phone 8.1
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
HTC One m8 for Windows available now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
