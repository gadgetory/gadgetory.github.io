and we know a lot of your amazon prime
members I love the service but you're
probably not too happy after hearing the
news they'll be raising the annual
membership price from $79 to ninety-nine
dollars so i'm here to show you a quick
way to save 20 bucks and still get
amazon prime for 79 bucks for the next
year thanks to this tip from slickdeals
net now we don't know how long this will
last so your best bet really is to do
this as soon as possible all right first
things first get on amazon.com and login

prime and then click on manage prime
membership on the left-hand column

underneath that says and membership it
will take you to another screen to
select and membership and then you'll
get a prompt to either end now or n
later click on the end date that will be
your last day of your current amazon

seventy nine dollars and proceed to
checkout here you'll want to enter in
your current amazon email address that
has the prime membership on it that's
okay and then select the delivery date
for the day after your membership
expires that's December the 24 2014 for
me and then I'll hit continue and go
through the payment process and you have
now secured yourself another year of
amazon prime for $79 instead of the
renewed $99 price so there you have it a
quick way to save 20 bucks on your
amazon prime membership that you can use
