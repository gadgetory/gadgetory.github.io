network that lets you take edit and
share photos with your friends but how
do you set yourself apart from all the
other iPhone photographers when everyone
is limited to the same boring filters
I'm Arielle Nunez and today I'm going to
show you a few tricks that can help set
yourself apart from the rest of the
instagramers first off you don't want to
use the camera that comes with Instagram
it's very limiting
using the iPhone camera app gives you
the freedom to Regus zoom and crop the
way you want after you take your
pictures and now it's time to customize
your pictures if you want to play with
some of the filters that come with
Instagram try doubling or tripling them
up now this could take some time to get
right but if you find the right
combination it can really set your
pictures apart from the rest now the
double up filters first load what you
want in Instagram take a couple
screenshots of different filters so you
have some choices then press the back
button to choose from your screenshots
then play with a couple more filters
until you get it right now if you want
to take it to the next level try using
other photography apps such as Auto
stitch to help create the effect of
using a wide-angle lens or diptych to do
split screens or mini photo collages
there's also plenty of other photo apps
you can play with so go ahead and play
around and get creative adding hashtags
to your photos makes them easier to find
on the Instagram universe for example if
you have tagged trees you can click on
the hashtag and view all the pictures
that have been tagged with trees now
those are just a few tips to help you
get started thinking out-of-the-box
the rest is only limited to your own
creativity now go out there explore and
happy
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
