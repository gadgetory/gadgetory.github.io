show you the final consumer version of
PlayStation VR including all of the
contents that will come in the package
as I'm sure you can tell the design is
consistent with the recent prototypes
we've shown the technical specs also
remain the same and I'd like to
summarize them briefly display
technology is fundamental to virtual
reality and PlayStation VR has a 5.7
inch OLED screen with 1920 by RGB by
1080 resolution this translates into a
brilliant Full HD picture because all
1920 by 1080 pixels have our G and B sub
pixels the display features a hundred
and twenty Hertz refresh rate which
means combined with PlayStation Force
processing power amazingly smooth images
rendered at 120 frames per second the
display is the most critical component
to build the illusion for users that
they're inside their game but it's not
the only part of the equation accurate
positional tracking and super low
latency also play significant roles in
virtual reality PlayStation VR supports
360 degree tracking and for VR to work
we also need to ensure minimal latency
between the physical movement of a
player's head and the image rendered on
the headset screen PlayStation VR
latency is less than 18 milliseconds
well within the sweet spot for
convincing the player that the virtual
world they're looking at is real the PS
camera also tracks the DualShock for
wireless controller and PS Move motion
controllers providing input options for
developers who can use the interactive
element that best matches the vision for
their games
your sense of presence in VR is
completed by what you hear and more
importantly from where you hear the
sound in a game PlayStation VR supports
3d audio enabling developers to deliver
sounds in 360 degrees space all of that
sound can change in real time depending
on the players head orientation of
course all that audio tracking and
display technology we've developed needs
to be packaged into a headset that's
designed for users to feel comfortable
while playing games for PlayStation VR
headset we designed a visor style that
reduces the pressure on the players face
wherever possible our designers have
reduced the weight of materials to make
the headset as lightweight as they could
a single band and a quick-release button
make it easy for players to put it on
and take it off overall the PlayStation
VR headset Vokes
the future while staying true to the
clean minimal design the PlayStation
hardware is known for today I'm pleased
to announce the PlayStation VR will
launch globally in October 2016 for $399
u.s. 399 euros 349 pounds and 44,000 980
yen all of which thank you
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
