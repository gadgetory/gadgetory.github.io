Jupiter's moon Europa we're gonna give
you all the details and Playstations got
some big news it's not actually it's not
actually big news okay if it's bigger
it's big I'll tell you
biggish and also Samsung has an 18-wheel
truck that you can see right through so
if you want to pass it on a highway
you're not gonna die tomorrow daily
greetings citizens on the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best new
talk show known universe I'm Ashley
skeleton he's always post III haze kill
anonymous get a good show I did but I
immediately went home and played video
games I was because you don't play a lot
of game really deadlines a weight of
more than you play video game I played
like four games and so the thirst is
real but you know if you have any
questions about our thoughts on any of
our e3 ideas what we played or whatever
feel free to hit us up on Twitter yeah
but you know for now we're just gonna
have to add lines alright so I have to
tell you about the see-through truck I
saw this video and I thought it was
really interesting and honestly like now
it has me wondering why we don't just do
this with every kind of car and truck
ever so samsung has what they're calling
Samsung safety truck it's an 18-wheel
truck a big rig what are other names for
big rigs we got your wheeler 18 wheeler
18 wheeler yeah we got 18 wheeler I
don't know anyway a rig a lot of people
there's like different names from all
over the country um so it's really cool
it's a concept idea might save some
lives
which I always like it is a giant truck
cargo truck with a screen on the back of
it and a front mounted camera so let's
say you're driving down a highway and
it's only two lanes and you can't pass a
truck unless you know if there's a car
coming in there directions it's super
dangerous right if you're reviewing that
scenario we have to pass somebody and
you're like I don't know if there's
someone coming because this is a kind of
a big vehicle yeah yeah
now you're gonna be able to pass past
this big truck without any issue so
there you go that's what it looks like
and even yeah bigger trucks can pass
because the thing is as you can see if
there's any oncoming traffic which is
really really handy especially in you
know on roads like this so because they
needed to test on roads like this a
really good place where that was
Argentina so they did a lot of a pretty
extensive testing in Argentina it's got
a night vision mode which is pretty
great you'll be able to see this screen
day or night it won't wash out too much
in the Sun you'll be able to take a look
at it I think this is a great idea and
they were saying that basically after
testing again pretty extensively in
Argentina that
truck is not currently operational but
they would like to continue to move
forward with more testing and they have
proven they feel they've proven the
technology can work and they want to
develop the system and get it out to get
it Out's companies that have shipping
trucks just pretty awesome
what did truckers think about this did
they get any truckers opinions I did not
see any I I tried to look around to see
if there was any any truck driver
opinions because I do feel like this is
a very interesting thing like truck
drivers I'm curious like would you want
this technology I would guess if I had
to guess I would say yes because it
keeps their their truck safe and and
them because so many people drive
dangerously around big trucks like that
I mean here in Southern California I see
it all the time people cut those trucks
off they like they're just I think they
have it in their minds that the trucks
can stop quicker than they actually can
or like they just don't really consider
what it takes to drive a truck like that
yeah and so um so I mean for me I was a
truck driver which I'm not I would say
that would be a really great thing I
think you're not in charge Ivor well I
mean only Monday through Friday when I
do the show but on weekends there I
remember there being in the comments at
least on YouTube a lot of people that
were truck drivers that watch the show
so yeah of all this and then second of
all we'd love to know your opinions nice
to find out that cuz I know they care
about weight and everything too so I'm
wondering if that like weighs down you
know the truck and the weigh-in and if
it makes it harder to open the bag of
the truck and actually do your job but
yeah Samsung working on this is perfect
I mean like it Stella they get to each
other to wacky things yeah I mean make
the screens and everything so yeah it is
it really great but I also like that
it's promoting safety and I mean it the
thing is if you can just make any road
safer I'm I guess I'm all for that true
that so tasks us a question okay so that
brings us to our hashtag the day which
is tDCS EE see like you're seeing
something and I'm just curious like what
kind of what thing if you could have
anything in the world be transparent to
see through doing something for work
what would that be like what's the thing
it doesn't have to use this type of
technology which is if you could make
something transparent load it be if I
could like anything transparent I like
the see-through refrigerators you know
they have the glass you can see what's
happening I like stead of opening it up
and finding out
but that's already done so I'm going to
see say people's heads I want to see
what you're thinking I know that's a
very abstract thought but I just saw it
inside out and I feel like I need to get
to the bottom of this I like it all
right that or tablets because I will I
usually am like watching Game of Thrones
or whatever am i transplant and I'm one
of those those one of you people who
hold that hold it up and I'm too busy
multitasking it's it's a bad thing
people but anyway I'd love to be able to
see through it and see the show at the
same time I would say my hands because I
like sometimes you're writing something
down you want to see through like to
what you're actually doing or like if
you're if you have if you're you can do
touch typing you look through and just
see the keyboard you wouldn't have to
worry about like moving your hands I
mean by like put your wedding ring on it
would it be hard to like it would be a
little bit weird project one on there
they'll be fine good but yeah I would
like if I'm writing down notes I tend to
write notes by hand still okay
if I'm breaking down like a story or
something sometimes they're just kind of
like fiddling with notes and little
scribbles and I wouldn't mind being able
to see through my hand so there you go
all right
so TDC so we want to know what do you
want to see through buddy friend oh so
basically our next story is a little one
that came after e3 for some reason and
it's from Sony Playstation they have a
big announcement like I said not
actually big they decided that post
conference they're going to announce a
brand new Playstation which has one
terabyte of storage drive their other
one has 500 megabytes of storage drive
their big announcement is one terabyte
they're calling it the ultimate player
edition
yeah 500 gigs now 500 gigs now whatever
I said five hundred one terabyte now of
course we know that X from Microsoft and
Xbox announced that they were gonna
upgrade to one terabyte they announced
this at e3 right and now PlayStation
says again they they conveniently skip
doing it this is not the first time that
like it seemed like PlayStation moves
were based on retaliation
yeah and response but I mean it's coming
out really really soon in Europe it's
gonna come out on July 15 oh yeah it's
pretty soon but maybe that's enough time
to turn around it is it is kind of like
remodeled it's got like
more matte finish up on top except the
glossy one Oh God you know I would
rather have that than the glossy for me
the glossy is kind of annoying man I
don't care it all about either of those
things it just sits on my shelf and I'm
not sitting there like hugging it but
there you go July 15th and like other
releases in us we have no idea I'm sure
it'll be some round until your thumbs
they're 500 megabytes is like I mean
this is great what we need that extra
space why didn't we do that lunch oh why
don't we do backwards-compatibility at
lunch no I do these things at launch
guys they're trying to sell more
consoles I get it yeah yeah I get people
who haven't upgraded a reason upgrade
which is you are you gonna upgrade would
you upgrade harvey's now oh you're
saying to go from my PlayStation 3 to my
to a ps4 or from your xbox 360 to an
Xbox one
like now that these are out would um
backwards-compatibility are you like
thinking like well maybe look I'm gonna
be straight up I'm not gonna use
backwards compatibility okay like that's
I mean that's great I don't think you
got any peer gonna you're gonna it's
gonna be a fun toy for like maybe a
weekend to use backwards-compatible okay
it wasn't that big of an announcement
but no because it's games that sell the
console not the console necessarily not
for me at least I'm a PC gamer i hook it
up to my TV I can play all my Steam
games I'm totally fine are you gonna
cheat you already have consoles I mean
it's a way backwards compatibility is
totally wasted on me because as soon as
I got my xbox one I gave my Xbox 360 to
our next-door neighbor he's like eight
so I just gave it to him for Christmas
he's a nice kid and then I gave him all
my games so I was just like here yeah
like take my xbox so you see so it's
like I first of all I'm not gonna go
back next door guy hey kid give us games
back not gonna do that and then to like
I mean yeah it's for new games like I
mean I don't I don't need
backwards-compatibility just like I
don't need you know I like I don't need
my consoles to play old games unless you
know I don't mind paying for them to
work like I look on Wii U like I'll buy
a virtual console game it's fine it's
like five bucks it's not a big deal yeah
I think and distance doesn't even have a
place necessarily on this article but I
still think there was some sort of it
was a strategic move it wasn't for us it
was for Microsoft
they either work something out with
gamestop or they work really good they
work something out with who is the other
places gonna start selling used games
now someone else just announced they're
gonna start forgetting but even like
game climbing game fly sells you use
games they do the rental system I mean
this is like a really big boon to those
types of companies so I would imagine
you're probably not wrong Amazon no
Amazon sells these games yeah I don't
know it's a strategic move but anyway so
there you go but that's a good points
good news for anybody doesn't have it
and realizes that they can now get an
upgraded version there's no bundle so
you're not getting a game with it or a
cool controller or anything it's just
like here you go because the Xbox one
there you go one terabyte oh there you
go all right so what to everybody
there's your article that brings us to
our question of the day are you gonna
use backwards compatibility yeah you
every single day knows you can answer
that question too if you alright so
anyway sorry I gotta tell you about NASA
this is really exciting we are as a
human race heading to Europa this is a
big deal
nASA has been working on a kind of a
pitch a concept if you will to head over
to Europa which if you aren't aware we
are pretty sure scientists are pretty
sure that there is a liquid ocean under
the the frozen surface of Europa it's
one of Jupiter's moons and so one of the
things that we have found here on earth
is that life exists in water pretty much
anywhere like even even in these super
frozen old water that you find in
Antarctica that is just like you know
millions of years old these they have
been untouched they find microbes there
so they think NASA thinks that the best
shot to find a simple alien life-form is
gonna be on Europa so now it's moving
forward it's in the development stage
it's not a concept anymore it's been
approved concept approved moving forward
it has funding now to start development
and through designing and building so
they can actually start working on this
spacecraft now here's what they're gonna
do they're gonna send this spacecraft
out to Jupiter they're not going to send
it directly to Europa because there's a
lot of radiation surrounding your open
Jupiter throws off a lot of radiation so
any
any object any spacecraft it head
straight to your oppa is basically gonna
get shredded by radiation not a good
idea and it won't last very long so
they'd be able to do a very short
mission and basically spend a lot of
money do a very short sort of
exploration slash informational trip but
what they want to do is they're gonna
send this spacecraft out they're gonna
put it in orbit on Jupiter and then when
you're OPA does clothes fly they're
gonna do flybys when you're OPA gets
close to Jupiter and they're gonna check
out they're gonna take images they're
gonna try to make a full a fully
understood image of the entire surface
of the of the Moon which is cool and
then they also think that do you
remember a while ago when they had we
have this story about Hubble telescope
taking a picture of him we saw these
what looked like water spouts like
really big water spouts coming from the
surface
well they said if that's the case this
would be miles and miles high and they
would fly the spacecraft through those
water spouts and be able to kind of test
to see if there are in fact markers for
potential life so they're not testing
for life specifically but they're
testing to see if Europa could in fact
Harbor life living organisms so this is
really exciting I am just I'm always I'm
always super thrilled when NASA gets a
new project going so and this is a
really really exciting one I think for a
lot of people not only at NASA but who
follow kind of the space program because
this really is this is a really good
shot of finding life yeah man that's all
we need is one little shred to say that
life could exist out there
Wow that shakes up the whole planet
we're gonna shake it up like a snow
globe but yeah that's crazy how long
does it take for the satellite to go
around Jupiter because Jupiter's a
probably a really long time and eight
but they were saying that they would be
able to use Europa's gravitational pull
to sort of figure out exactly when the
best times of be and how fast it would
be moving like oh I mean it's all kind
of is this gonna be one of the my kids
are gonna like no this baby I'm gonna be
dead it might be no no I don't think
you'll be dead I think this will be this
will happen maybe in the next like I
think they actually had a time frame on
NASA's website I'm sorry NASA because
I'm forgetting it off top of my head but
yam is totally my bad but but I want to
say like at 20 like was in like 20 years
so you'll still be alive like this is a
that's gonna happen but it take it's
gonna take a lot of time to get that
spacecraft out there one and then beyond
that like to get those images and data
back it's gonna take take some time so
for sure it's in the future it's it's a
ways in the future but but it hopefully
will happen at some point which is
really I just think it's exciting so fun
yeah that's pretty cool
well not note we're gonna take a quick
break we'll be right back with a back of
her Hackett that you don't want to miss
it's it's just there they want
revolutionize audio the way GoPro did
video so pretty cool radical but before
we go on break check out this old man in
his cat on a motorcycle
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's Monday we're finally back from e3 I
felt like we were there for so long
that's still there I think maybe this is
a virtual reality space we're still in
the Morpheus still in the Morpheus guys
but for now it's time for back
interactive all right what so we're
gonna revolutionise inks they're gonna
revolutionize audio recording the way
that GoPro did video are you ready for
this yes all right so this is called
instant mic and it's not like an instant
Michael like you just suddenly a person
named Mike shows up ready not not the
case uh this is a really tiny little
device look how small this is that
records high quality audio and they're
saying you can literally attach it to
like yeah the inside for drought-like
like places you would not be able to
normally record high quality audio one
of the ones that I thought was really
interesting was they literally attached
it to a guitar amp so you would imagine
that would be completely distorted blown
out not so like this actually records
really good audio so impressive and
they're attached to a drum kit that I
mean they'll yeah they're like this is a
great way to get all kinds of sound
effects sounds just everything is it
records in 48 kilohertz 24-bit audio
there are two different models there's a
go model and that go model is splash
proof so you can take it out in the rain
and stuff you don't have to worry about
it
there's the size right there it's like
an inch by an inch and a half it's very
very little
there are mount quick mounts so they
have velcro tape and magnet quick mount
so you can like pop it onto a car if you
want put it next to the exhaust film
Fast and the Furious eight they could do
that if they wanted to which is pretty
cool you control it through an app
that's on your phone it's bluetooth 4.0
and they have a pro model that is
actually waterproof you can take it up
to five feet underwater which is pretty
cool and it also does stereo recording
the pro version so that the the go
version just records I think it's like
mono and then dual channel dual channel
so it can record up to four hours of
audio and
wanted about $50,000 on IndieGoGo and
they already have over $100,000 so a lot
of people are really excited about this
they're terribly I want to back the crap
out of this I knew you would like this
because you could take it to caught you
want a lot of concerts and whistling
glad you saw exactly where I was going
in it now I can pretty much rip the
music from a concert just put it on and
I can listen to it if I go and basically
steal from the artist no no but you're
gonna be hearing all the people cheering
around you too that's the best part of
listening to a concert personal mix of
the show and then they have like a
wristband where you can like wear it and
like not have to worry about it in your
hand you off like hold it so yeah it's
like 99 bucks - it's the same price as
like a zoom h1 which is one of its I
would imagine it's direct competitors
and then I think the pro is 129 but I
think they said that price would go up
like once the IndieGoGo is over no not
bad for something waterproof that you
can literally throw into a pool I mean
so I would I still would need to hear
the quality of each of these things I
like I trust that it's better but I want
to know like how much better how much
worse I'm sure it's fine I'm sure they
figured that out but I'd love to like go
around and test it so send it to seen it
yeah so the zoom h1 I was looking at the
chart the zoom h1 records in 96
kilohertz and then this records in 48 so
it is a little higher quality on the
zoom h1 but then it also can't do a lot
of the things that you can do with this
so you can't like
attach it to a car it doesn't have these
little quick mounts it's not as it's not
nearly as invisible like the zoom h1 is
like this tall it's like this thin so
yeah
it's literally like a little microphone
that you would hold but this you would
be able to attach to like inside
somebody's collar or you know there's
all kinds of ways that you can do this I
see a lot of espionage applications
people tape it to their chest and they
didn't get information from people Logan
what do you think about using this at a
concert are you fair enough yes use a
film producer life is this fun he likes
to produce the produce somebody oh
that's yeah so it's yeah 900 bucks gets
you a go and then 129 gets you
so I thought that was really cool so
nice work insta Mike but yeah they're
really they're really into they want to
revolutionize audio the way that GoPro
doing video that's what they keep saying
very cool
yeah look at my work okay guys it's time
now for your user feedback
okay so user feedback we didn't give you
guys any hashtags last week yeah so
sorry about that take that but what we
did do was I wandered over to our e3 and
virtual reality our 360 experience that
seanut put up on YouTube okay and we
pulled some of the comments from there
to make us just feel really good about
ourselves because everybody seemed to
like it a lot which is pretty cool so
here's here's the experience if you
haven't seen it yet it's really fun if
you have it if you pull it up on your
phone you actually can move your phone
around as if you're looking around into
space which is pretty neat it's a little
bit more counterintuitive on a desktop
where you have to like click and drag to
like move the camera around but it's
really fun on a smart phone so I'd we
highly recommend that you check it out
okay so let's get into our user feedback
first one is from Casey Casey says I
really hope this catches on and he got
five thumbs up take those to the bank
Casey take those thumbs ups right to the
bank
Danny CD 17 said why is Kalon seanut
yeah good question it's a really good
question I mean I know your heck it's
you're so new I have no idea he's never
ever been myself that every single
morning thank you Oh ultimate ruffles
wrote in and said I was watching this on
iPad and thought it didn't work until I
picked up my iPad and I could look
around
stop ruffles hey ultimate ruffles not
not regular rumbles ultimate good to see
you
well live stream later um by the way
that guy said khalil not kale he said
Kaleo yeah a lot of people ask about
khalil and I'm not sure that is fair
enough
that's more a name than my name is so
you're you you win this round like to
say friend
and then lastly every second wrote in
and said okay this is awesome not true
every second
I gotta cool if you didn't get a chance
to check it out you really should
there's been a lot of positivity around
it because it should have been done a
long time ago but now that now that
YouTube is allowing 360 and 3d
stereoscopic you can now create videos
like that
yeah and thankfully CNET was was hopped
on board with that almost immediately
and ultimately like one of the first to
do it yeah not even trying to brag for
them I've just been looking for this
type of content I remember I pitched it
to them a while back so yeah that's like
easily accessible I think is the big
thing where you're saying like Google is
finally offering us on YouTube like you
don't need you you can download the IM
360 app to view the content but now you
can just literally go to the YouTube
video and it will automatically load as
a 360 video for if your phone has a
gyroscope in it oh yeah show it to
people at bars like I did yeah they're
like they're like whoa this is amazing
because they're holding the phone and
they're drunk
yeah so yeah thank you everybody for all
of your very nice comments this will
mark the first and likely last show
where we do 100% YouTube comments for
the for the user feedback which is a
bummer
which is a bummer and also the best so
that being said let's hit our very last
piece of user feedback which is our
phone timer for the day
okay so Rollo wrote in our good friend
Rollo who's I think we've had a phone
he's been on photographer the day before
he said tomorrow daily I visited my
sister and went road-tripping to see the
sunrise at Halle kala Haleakala summit
in Maui Hawaii I did not expect to have
below freezing temperature in Maui are
you kidding me the sunrise there was
spectacularly gorgeous and a capture the
moment I've set my note 3 in HDR mode
and have my sister be my human tripod i
composed and framed it for her what I
wanted to capture I told her not to move
the phone then I immediately ran on top
of lava rock imposed go shoot it the
picture turned out an epic shot once
again I love her show you're avid fan
Rollo the role of a sister took this
picture but he was the mastermind behind
the framing of it and it's amazing that
is a really good picture that might be
one of our best pictures that we've had
and I might be I mean it's not because
of composure and color I know you did
HDR which I mean could be like hax but
still it I'll take it as long as you're
using it correctly it's a lot of the
best so amazing and I like that he gave
us credit to his sister for being a
human tripod well done well done Rollo
sister high-fives
but yeah so so good I saw this in our
inbox I was just like oh man like you
get to you get a fast pass to the front
of the lines and we have a huge like bay
of phone tag refers that I have like
lined up and I was just like oh we got
to get this one on like right away
which is pretty cool so um so yeah
