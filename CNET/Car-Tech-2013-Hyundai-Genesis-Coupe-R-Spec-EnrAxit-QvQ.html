drives a good thing you probably noticed
Hyundai's been stretching their brand
all kinds of directions the last few
years and this is the one that goes the
direction of Camaro and Mustang
it's the Hyundai Genesis Coupe r-spec
with the 3.8 v6 let's drive this 2013
with a new face and the new motor and
check the tech
now the Genesis Coupe isn't some pocket
rocket it's a pretty good piece of
machinery classic proportions short rear
deck big long sloping arc of a roofline
down over the back light and a
relatively long hood but the front of
that hood is where I have an issue this
new face which is kind of like the
Veloster is a little bit of a
combination of Mazda goofy grin meets
Renault Megane and I don't use either of
those terms as a compliment
and the first thing I'm struck by and
happily so is that the cabin quality of
the Genesis Coupe has gone way up and
overall it's got a more grown-up look
and feel which is nice
I'm also spotting these as being new 3
analog gauges kind of a weird hodgepodge
this one here is a fuel consumption
thing that's very green next to it is
torque that's very nut green and then
there's the irrelevant oil temperature
that's very irrelevant but they look
good at a performance coupe like this
remember this is the Korean Camaro the
Korean Mustang so bear that in mind they
go much more after those American Pony
cars than they do after other Asian
performance rides now once we get into
cabin tech it's a big story of can't
can't get this can't get that you do
have bluetooth streaming for example you
do have your basic aux iPod and USB down
here not too elegantly done because you
have to use one of these proprietary
double headed connectors you put that in
and there's a nice little bin right here
to put your iPod touch your iPhone
except it doesn't fit and because you
cannot get navigation or a big color
display in this car not in this trip
we're in the r-spec bear that in mind
you're going to use this pretty minimal
display right here I'm streaming off my
phone right now and as you can see I'm
not getting any meta tags off this guy
that may vary by phone but at least on
this what RAZR MAXX running Android not
getting anything like that here's my
iPod I get some good meta information on
that however even though I don't get
that on a2dp bluetooth we've got am/fm
radio there's no HD radio on this guy XM
satellite radio on this vehicle as well
that is standard on an r-spec there's an
upgraded audio system again not on the
r-spec
you're stuck with their basic rig six
speakers around the cabin 170 watts you
also cannot get Hyundai's bluelink
telematics system that does connected
services through your phone that also
comes on color LCD screen cars not this
one
and finally you only have one choice and
this is a good omission of this very
slick feeling 6-speed manual Hyundai's
new 8-speed automatic new to this car is
not available in the RS
nice guts easy okay a genesis coupe in
the r-spec can have two different motors
a 2-liter turbo 4 it's been upgraded a
lot since last year we'll talk about
that another day or this one the 3.8
liter v6 also updated a lot since the
last car mainly by getting direct
injection 348 horsepower 295 foot-pounds
of torque gets this guy up to 60 in not
much over 5 seconds about 5.2 while
delivering 18 27 mpg this guy stacks up
better on paper than either a 6-cylinder
Camaro or Mustang okay let's go for a
run on our Korean Camaro it's about the
same size
you got a gutsy v6 - rear-wheel drive
only there is no all-wheel-drive or
front wheel drive variant on this car
this car handles pretty nicely rear
wheel drives a good thing the ride will
get a little annoying if you live in
places with crappy pavement although I
can report the cabin doesn't drum very
much that helps and nothing yet
is squeaking or rattling I guess to take
away I would give you is that everything
feels kind of hard on this car so
everything on this car feels like a
handful they've dialed in the
personality of it I think well to match
what you expect from a car of this
pseudo track trim level okay the press
of 2013 Genesis Coupe r-spec now it's a
key thing to remember if you want the 2
litre inline-four turbo the one we
didn't review here that's going to be
about 27 4 and 2254 this 3.8 direct
injection v6 then in terms of options
there aren't any you need to care about
to go CNET style remember you can't get
premium audio in this car you can't get
navigation you can't get Blu link
information and telematics you can't get
the 8-speed automatic that's it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
