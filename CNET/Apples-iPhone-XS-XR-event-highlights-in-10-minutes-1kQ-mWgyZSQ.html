it has been redesigned and re-engineered
it all starts with a stunning new
display we pushed the screens right to
the edges and we curved the corners to
perfectly match the shape of the watch
and the screens are significantly larger
in fact they're over 30% larger we've
done this with minimal changes to the
case us Series four is thinner so
there's actually less total volume than
in series three and we've also designed
a brand new watch face with up to eight
complications that really brings them to
life now you can add loved ones to your
watch face and simply tap to connect
with them or if you're traveling you can
customize a watch face to track the
different time zone or maybe you want to
create the ultimate Health and Fitness
watch the digital crown has been
completely re-engineered and it now
includes haptic feedback giving you a
more responsive and mechanical feel one
of the leading causes of injuries
worldwide is Falls Apple watch series 4
can detect a fall for the new
accelerometer and gyroscope the watch
analyzes risk trajectory and impact
acceleration to determine when the fall
occurs and after detecting a fall series
4 delivers an alert and from that alert
you can initiate an emergency call
however if the watch senses you are
mobile for 1 minute it will start the
call automatically and it it also sends
a message with your locations to your
emergency contacts using the SOS feature
that is already built into Apple watch
we've added electrodes into the back
sapphire crystal and the digital crown
allowing you to take an
electrocardiogram
an ECG measures the electrical activity
of the heartbeat and it's used by
physicians to help diagnose certain
heart can diseases and in other
conditions the built-in electrodes in
the back crystal in the digital crown
they detect electrical impulses from the
heartbeat they route them to the s4 chip
which converts them to signal for our
algorithms the entire process takes just
30 seconds and at the completion of the
ECG recording you will receive a heart
rhythm classification if your heart is
beating in a normal rhythm the app will
classify the measurement as sinus rhythm
and the app will also classify atrial
fibrillation all ECG recordings their
classifications the noted symptoms
they're all stored right in the health
app in a PDF you can share with your
doctor so now your doctor has a detailed
picture of your heart rhythm similar to
a lead one ECG that is usually only
obtained in the clinic we've received
clearance from the FDA
this is iPhone 10s it is the most
advanced iPhone we've ever created it is
made of a surgical grade stainless steel
it has a gorgeous new gold finish on the
front and on the glass it is the most
beautiful iPhone we have ever made the
screen goes top to bottom edge to edge
rounded into the corners and it's
covered on the front and the black back
with a new formulation of glass that is
the most durable glass ever in a
smartphone iPhone 10s comes in three
finishes gold silver and Space Gray they
are beautiful and they're protected from
dust and liquids to an even higher level
now ip68 that means it's protected to
two meters for up to 30 minutes for the
screen on iphone 10 s is a super Retina
display the best we've made yet it's an
OLED display 5.8 inches on the diagonal
it's 2.7 million pixels 458 pixels
prints the highest quality display on an
iOS device well the iPhone 10 S is not
just one but two sizes of display the
5.8 inch and a new 6.5 inch Super Retina
display this is the biggest display ever
on an iPhone it is an OLED display as
well 3.3 million pixels 458 pixels per
inch again was as big as a plus size
display so what do you call a phone
that's bigger than plus size we call it
the iPhone 10s max
so there are two super Retina displays
now 5.8 inch 6.5 inch both OLED displays
both a million to 1 contrast ratio there
HDR displays a fast 120 Hertz touch
sensitive layer that's how it gets its
smooth growing really fast typing and
gaming responds they both have 3d touch
for pressure sensitivity they have
tapped awake they have incredible color
management their true tone display so
the paperwhite looks just right in all
the different lighting that you use it
and they have wide color these are
amazing displays we've matched them to
incredible sound systems as well
stereo sound better than in any iPhone
today now but the 10s should get a wider
stereo field the team has matched
powerful speakers with great software to
deliver an even richer sound experience
so watching movies sounds incredible and
the team has worked so hard to make
every generation of the a-series chip
better than any in ever ever - smart
phone and this year is no exception it's
called the a12 Bionic a12 ionic just
powers so many incredible new
experiences and that includes the camera
it is a remarkable new dual camera
system it has a 12 megapixel wide camera
a 12 megapixel telephoto camera and an
even more improved true tone flash the
12 megapixel Y camera has a new sensor a
larger sensor with bigger deeper pixels
it has optical image stabilization and
our fast 1.8 aperture lens it's Apple
six element lens the wide the telephoto
camera is also 12 megapixel camera also
optical image stabilization f 2.4 apple
design lens on the front side if the
true depth camera system and that's a
new sensor as well a 7 megapixel sensor
that's twice as fast and it works
together with the IR camera the dot
projector so it can create depth in your
portrait mode photos so for example in
the 812 ionic is the image signal
processor working together with the CPU
it automatically sets exposure white
balance sets the focus there's noise
reduction a low-light photography it
brings out highlights and details and it
confuse multiple images together like
when you do an HDR photo or create a
beautiful panorama we have a brand new
feature we call smart HDR so let's say
you're taking a picture the camera
recognizes you're shooting a subject in
the subjects moving you go to press down
on the shutter and you get a picture
instantly
it's called zero shutter lag what the
800 Bionic is actually doing is shooting
a four frame buffer so I can capture
that critical moment the 12 bio niggas
do even more than that it's also
capturing secondary inter frames at the
same time and those inter frame shot at
a different exposure level to bring out
highlight details and it's doing more
than that it's shooting a long exposure
so you can get better shadow detail as
well and when you're taking that picture
it's analyzing all of those finding out
how to match up the best parts of each
and merge them into one perfect photo we
want to reach as many customers as we
can with this incredible technology so
that's why we are very excited to show
you one more I phone the iPhone 10 are
and we hope it reaches even more
customers with this amazing incredible
technology
it's an LCD display that for the first
time goes edge to edge it took advanced
new engineering and technology to do
pixel masking and pixel anti-aliasing
and to have LEDs that fit to a smaller
space than ever before this is the most
advanced LCD ever in a smartphone it's
called the liquid Retina display the
liquid Retina display is six point one
inches on the diagonal now let's bring
well first it's 1.4 million pixels and
it's 326 pixels per inch so true Retina
image quality now let's bring that
iPhone 8 plus next to it because it's
really interesting it is a bigger
display than the iPhone 8 plus in a
smaller design the design actually fits
perfectly between the size of an eight
and na+ so we think it's going to make a
lot of customers really happy and like
every
iPhone 10 new experience it has face ID
and there's a true depth camera system
the same true depth camera system and
iPhone 10s and 10's max so it's infrared
camera flood illuminator proximity
sensor ambient light sensor dot
projector front camera speaker
microphone all the technology to have an
incredible face idea experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
