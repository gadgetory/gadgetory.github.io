del Conte and it's time to get loaded
Facebook has some kind of big
announcement on Monday the signs are
pointing to perhaps a new messaging or
mail announcement Facebook has been said
to be working on this for some time now
so your Facebook account would have its
own email address at facebook.com/ a
gmail killer perhaps I don't really
think they could possibly do a better
job at email than gmail but we'll see
we'll bring you the news when we have it
Viacom is going to sell off Harmonix the
maker of rock band Viacom owns MTV
Comedy Central and Nickelodeon as well
as the movie studio Paramount Pictures
Harmonix was an odd addition to the
company's media products and apparently
Viacom think so too they plan to sell
off the gaming division because it is
just not what they wanted and sales had
disappointed Apple has teamed up with
Twitter to promote ping its music social
network that lives inside of iTunes ping
hasn't really taken off like the iPad
and Apple is hoping to change that by
going social now you can tweet about
your music from inside of ping and when
you do your tweet will link to an info
box with information about that music
and listening samples use this as
cocktail banter sometime did you know
that 35 hours of video is uploaded to
YouTube every minute it's true youtube
announced this on Thursday that breaks
out to 2100 hours of video every hour or
fifty thousand four hundred hours of
video every day that's pretty staggering
especially when you consider how much of
it is utter crap as you gave up to shop
this holiday season keep in mind that
walmart is offering free shipping with
no minimum purchase requirement this is
starting now and Black Friday is still a
few weeks away the offer is good until
December twentieth at which time you
will pay the penalty of being a
procrastinator Microsoft has received a
patent for computing with your feet the
company applied for this patent a few
years ago now it is theirs it's called
foot based interface for interfacing
with a computer it would allow you to
mouse around a computer with your feet
it's not only an alternative for people
without all their limbs or limb function
but also
people who have other obligations like a
baby in their arms to compute while
multitasking Android users hustler has
you covered there is a new hustler app
for Google's mobile operating system and
I'm going to quote the press release
here it says it focuses on current
hustler honey's as well as classic
all-stars from the past 36 years and
includes photos and videos
behind-the-scenes interviews and all-new
hustler talent and whoever said Android
wasn't sexy those are all your headlines
for today and that wraps up your week of
getting loaded we'll see on monday I'm
Natali del Conte for cnet.com and you've
just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
