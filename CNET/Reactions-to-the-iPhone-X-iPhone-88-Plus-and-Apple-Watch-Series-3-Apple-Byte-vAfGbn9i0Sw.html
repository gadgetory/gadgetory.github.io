about for a long time but the reality of
this is I love this oh my gosh oh my
gosh now unlocking it is as easy as
looking at it and swiping up and you
know let's try that again
oh-ho-ho let's uh go to back up here
what's going on Brian Tong here and
welcome to the Apple bite for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
you know what it is
it's our reactions to Apple's iPhone X I
mean iPhone 10 event like you know
you've done the same thing I get why
they're calling it the 10 but X is so
much better in fact this guy Jayesh on
Twitter explained it for me X is 10 in
roman numbers that's why it's calls
iPhone X X for 10 Wow I had no idea now
there's so much to talk about so hold on
to your butt's we'll start small and
then build up to the iPhone
10 see I said it right now first up the
Apple watch three three and all its LTE
glory it's one of the winners of the
show just because they finally brought
LTE to the table to make calls without
your phone it will cost an extra $10 a
month to add it to your current data
plan AT&amp;amp;T Verizon and t-mobile have
confirmed that pricing here in the u.s.
Apple said the series 3 has an all-day
battery life of 18 hours on this series
3 LTE model that 18 hour number includes
4 hours of an LTE connection and 14
hours of a connection to an iPhone over
Bluetooth but if you think you're gonna
be making calls with it throughout the
day like over LTE think again you'll get
one hour of talktime 60 minute O's so
this won't be your primary calling
device and if you're taking it out for a
workout you'll get 10 hours without any
connectivity 5 hours with just GPS and 4
hours with GPS and LTE now pre-orders
are this Friday the 15th I'll be there
on my pajamas and the new series three
ships out on the
okay the Apple TV 4k was a solid upgrade
but it wasn't a standout for me 4k HDR
support and a new black background theme
they just did what they had to do but
did you notice how Eddy Cue came on
stage like did he just bless up after he
splashed a three from downtown
way up I feel blessed
right back at you Eddy now the new live
sports edition is cool but I got to give
props to Apple for striking a deal with
movie studios to price 4k movies at the
same $19.99 as new releases plus
upgrading my current purchases to 4k as
well that's a good Apple yeah like I
really didn't know if they could get it
done
now there's a new updated Siri remote
that removes a physical button for a
touch button with a white circle around
it to make it more prominent but it just
looks at a place like who decide that
why and the new Apple TV 4k with the new
remote is gonna be 179 pre-order on the
15th and available on the 22nd all right
let's talk phones like iPhone 10 is
going to be a beast for the record I
will be getting one if I get through
that pre-order but you might be
captivated by its OLED screen I thought
the most impressive thing about this
phone are all the chips and custom
silicon that are packed inside starting
with its heart the a11 Bionic like
really Apple you had to add Bionic to
that now that screen looks great but
Apple tends to get ahead of themselves
going with the named super Retina
display like here's what Phil had to say
about it
it's 458 pixels per inch now this is the
highest resolution in pixel density ever
in an iphone the super Retina display
uses OLED technology this is the first
OLED display great enough to be in an
iPhone se what Phil like really the
first OLED display great enough to be in
an iPhone because the last time I
checked the galaxy s 8 has an OLED
screen with 570 pixels per inch density
the si+ has a 529 and the note 8 is at
521 and guess who produces and supplies
your OLED screens for you Samsung ok but
how can any of you ignore the notch like
I know the kool-aid is good at an
Levent but that notch looks horrible
like I was hoping the leaks were preview
and Apple would just smooth it out and
take advantage of the deep blacks of the
OLED screen to make a consistent bar at
the top but nope you get the notch on
the home screen when you're looking at
photos then knotch and how about videos
the knotch
and some of you might say it's just a
notch who cares but Steve Jobs and Apple
showed us what great design and elegance
in a gadget was all about you know what
I'm sorry but that's not my iPhone and
you know we're all just asking for
rounded corners to watch our videos as
well just the way they were intended to
be viewed like this short clip from the
Brody Jonathan Morrison shows that you
can get black bars on both sides but
you'll have to double tap like who wants
to do that extra step just to watch
video without the notch come on it's a
no-brainer and that's a bad apple app
well all you have to do was put a bar
across the top and maybe you'll do that
eventually maybe developers will do that
for their own apps or we'll just have to
wait for it on the next iPhone you know
what I'm calling it right now it will be
the world's most interesting phone the
iPhone dos a keys all right face ID
still remains to be seen how good it's
going to be day to day the technology is
pretty amazing this ain't your mama's
iris Kenny and it's so much more when
you look at your phone it'll shoot
thousands of lasers straight into your
pores then it sucks out your soul how
much like a Dementor okay that's not how
it does it but you have to check out
that iPhone experiment
it's gold unlike the third iPhone 10
color we did not get now the tech will
get faster but there's no way it's
faster to hold it up around your face
and then swipe up compared to the
current touch ID speed right now is it
more accurate sure the chances of
someone else's face unlocking your phone
is one in a million compared to touch
IDs one in 50,000 but it's still going
to be 100% accurate when someone else
holds it up to your face so you better
clear up your DMS and messages on the
cloud before you get that iPhone X the
verge showed that face ID also won't
work when your eyes are closed in this
clip at the event but once you open them
it will unlock so you know what you
might be okay while you're sleeping so
how does it all do this
well that's courtesy of their a11 Bionic
neural engine seriously Apple who is
naming these things these days that's
terrible and don't get me started on the
wireless pad named airpower like it
doesn't even charge your devices over
the air it looks like a maxi pad you
know what that's a bad apple all right
now just to be clear that epicfail on
stage are in the keynote it wasn't
because face ID failed it actually
prompted Craig with a message your
passcode is required to enable face ID
that's the same prompt you get after
your phone is restarted or after hours
have passed without authenticating it
through the lock screen so face ID still
works just it's not as fast as touch ID
and also there's this the kitty cat is
so expressive and ferocious it's a happy
puppy
check out the physics in the ears take
me to your leader
wait a minute Craig I am your leader
plus his impression of the Ultimate
Warrior yeah he must be a fan of the
show now an emojis are fun I'm not gonna
lie about that but I also think it's
kind of idiotic that out of every
feature they spent the most time on an
emojis that are exclusive to the iPhone
10 like they didn't talk about Bluetooth
5.0 or USB see quick charging as much as
they did and emojis and we know there
will be people who get the $1,000 iPhone
10 just so they can use an emojis like
my buddy Mike Wang so really is it worth
it to get the iPhone 10 that starts at
$9.99 with its OLED screen face ID and
ant emojis or getting the 8 plus that
still has touch ID it still has almost
all the same amazing rear camera
features that the 10 does so here let's
get some perspective let's break the
pricing of an iPhone 10 in the u.s. down
and it'll be a lot more in other
countries so the starting iPhone 10 with
60 40 gigs of storage is $9.99 if you
want Apple care coverage and I always do
its bumped up for the 10 and is now
$1.99 if you want to take advantage of
its USB see fast charging the cheapest
Apple USBC powered after is $49 and the
shorter one meter USB see the lightning
cable is 25 bucks
so before tax if you want
all the bells and whistles for the
entry-level iPhone 10 you're looking at
one thousand two hundred and seventy two
dollars that's almost $1,400 after tax
and you know what it's time to make a
trip to Portland they don't got tax
there and this is just the pricing in
the US now I don't judge how anyone
spends their money if it's worth it to
you it's worth it to our phones were the
center of our digital life even more
than our computers but after all this
the iPhone eight will still most likely
be the top seller of this batch and
Apple will be just fine with that
because they're still going to be
selling a whole bunch of phones so start
saving up for the ten pre-orders are on
October the 27th and they start shipping
on November the third the eight and
eight plus critters are this Friday the
15th and available on the 22nd all right
that's gonna do it for this week's show
it was a beefy one email us at the Apple
bite at cnet.com or tweet me at Brian
Tong we'd love to hear what you thought
about the Apple event thanks so much for
watching we'll catch y'all next time for
another bite of the Apple this is the
