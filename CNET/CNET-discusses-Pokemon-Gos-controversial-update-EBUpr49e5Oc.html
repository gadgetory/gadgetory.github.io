two one sorry everybody Hey testing
testing lots of testing I can count some
numbers hilarious that was like
sorry
every challenge along with her age I
face I will battle every day
geez
come with me the time is right
is no better gee
arm in arm will we
hello and welcome to cnet's special
Pokemon go show my name is mike
sorrentino i am here with sean and
caitlin and we're to hash out this new
Pokemon go update and guys tell me a
little bit about your polka poop your
name's your Pokemon go experience and
then we'll go from there oh I'm going
first ladies first age before beauty
okay fine i'm sean sean hollister i read
a lot about poke about godo it's the new
beat here at see that and here are some
of my favorite Pokemon my favorite right
now is tentacruel it's always been one
of my favorites because you get to say
release the kraken every time you
unleash it and it's not powered up as
much as that like because I don't seem
to get any candy for it I started
playing pokemon with red and blue and
then I kind of stopped because after 151
I was like well I can't catch them all
because he keep introducing more what's
the point I'm Caitlin I never ever
played pokemon anything my best friend
at the time was obscure stole my best
friend mckaela Serio's hopefully oh
sorry not anymore again in school
Mikayla was near obsessed with pokemon
sorry I knew nothing about them I didn't
watch it I didn't play the cars I didn't
nothing but I am really enjoying Pokemon
go and not just for the tag culture
being involved aspect of it um I don't
know my favorite is I was kind of
thinking about it although to be fair i
really like renaming all of them so i
like this guy oh yeah love porygon I
don't have one apparently he's
ridiculous so jealous people children
seizures in Japan which obviously just
made him even more of my favorite also
the one that I can't show you i renamed
her poorly because it also gives you
serious right no no no the one that um
is like boob head fire which
incidentally is what I named him magmar
oh that's magma cool don't obviously one
of my most favorite parts of this game
is renaming them into weird stuff in my
favorite uh my to my favorites i duck in
general and i've renamed amount of
coming out zen fighter
because even though he's a duck he has a
psychic move and a fighting move which
is amazing considering he'll otherwise
in the cartoon have a massive headache
all the time yeah I don't know what any
of I remember that yeah Caitlin
apparently we just before we started
recording she admitted to us that she
did not know the pokemon theme song
apparently she'd never watched the show
or and and i should add never listened
to the song even once no because if you
listen to it even once you never get it
out of your head well now i think i know
all the words cover like five times the
last three minutes but no was a
contrarian thing because my best friend
loved it i was like no absolutely not
don't come near me with those things i
don't want to hear about it no to be
fair was my younger brothers thing more
than my thing and he liked to watch
things over and over and over again to
the point where I knew the entire plot
of toy story by heart and you recite
every line of dialogue so he's useful
but not anymore i lost the pokemon theme
song i could sing the song i'm not going
to sing the song so as we get a hash out
this pokemon go update and any other
pokemon news want to talk about oh we
are live so if you are with us in the
YouTube chat on live stream or on our
facebook post about it feel free to
chime in and we will get to a few
questions later on we have a hashtag we
have hash tag it hash tag cnet live so
we're going to start ma during that two
tweeted us cnet live and will monitor
all these things and bring in as much as
we can just to prove that we are alive
and in fact reading your comments
somebody named the awesomeness master 12
just talked about Mewtwo might be on a
slight delay but you'll see that comment
shortly okay so over the weekend
presumably Friday and Saturday pongo
changed up the game a little bit uh tell
me about what you think what what and
what you've seen we have some mixed
feelings about this katelyn we have any
mixed anything ok we have a vigorous
disagreement Kaitlyn and I I I wrote an
article that said Pokemon go just
changed battles for the better and I
thought it was amazing they did is the
thing I don't think we have a Mick as
mixed or I don't think we have as
separate disparate point of views on
this update as you think we do like okay
maybe they did but I'm a casual player
okay I don't
even though my local bar is a polka gym
I don't go and just battle and take over
it or even really train my pokemon just
because that's not what's fun to me it's
true I feel like a lot of people don't
battle it's so hard but this update is
about making that easy so what happened
for you folks just in case you didn't
know is they changed up the entire
battle system changing the moves of
every single Pokemon before the update
came out on Friday basically how you had
to win in a battle was yet have a really
really strong Pokemon one of a very few
in the game like a snorlax or a Lapras
or a Vaporeon and you had to tap tap tap
tap tap tap tap on the screen
incessantly spamming your quick attack
in order to take down an enemy gym and
retain it for any period of time what
they did is they changed it up so now
that the charge moves the more powerful
moves ones you'd expect to do lots of
damage like a giant water be more a
solar ray and things like that they
actually do realistic amounts of damage
now you can actually use them instead
just spamming your quick attack and I
thought that was great that they
balanced these Pokemon and made it so it
wasn't just a few on top of the gyms now
maybe Caitlyn could actually attack a
gym and win I don't know I mean I'm only
so I'm a level 14 never mind me too and
yeah i don't i don't think i have
anything that's really stir I think I
have a little pinchy pinchy thing looks
like a cockroach meets a crab sensor
nets had laid in sir it's got to be a
pincer sure i'm gonna go with mr. pinchy
thing and I think he's just under like
600 CP but okay here's the thing i'm a
casual player / hoarder I go out and I
enjoy catching these little free purple
things but i don't really battle and
then I just kind of hoard them like I
will transfer any silly stupid zoo bats
or purple rats or Little Pigeon things
that I see that are under a hundred CP
cuz I'm like no I know that's nothing
like I don't need that but I have come
on almost like 300 Zubat candies and I
haven't evolved any of them and I still
have two lucky eggs by two lucky eggs
that I've gotten from leveling up and
things and I haven't used any of my
lures I think I have what three of them
okay I mean it's fair that the pokemon
is about catching them all and gotta
catch them all right that is the tag
line so that's all you want to do I kind
of I'm kind of into it and so that's why
this update is really controversial
because it didn't just fix the battles
it also removed the ability to track
down wild Pokemon now this is where we
could differ a little bit so originally
in the game there was a system of
footsteps where you could see nearby
Pokemon there was a screen in the game
where you could see nearby pokemon that
i'm going to show you in a second and it
would have a number of footprints on
this screen to show you how close they
were to you one footprint is really
close three puts footprint is pretty far
away so you could walk around and play
warmer colder till you actually found
one of these wild Pokemon and they got
rid of it now there are no more
footprints as this update well I mean
theoretically it never worked anyway it
wasn't working any of it you told me
Caitlin you said it was working for you
in the very beginning before they made
like a quick bug release update I
actually saw one two and three
footprints depending on where I walked
or where I moved or like when I would
leave my apartment I'm in between like
two and a half polka stops so when I
would leave my apartment and go to the
bar go to restaurant or something in my
neighborhood I would actually see
changing footprints and changing Pokemon
it also theoretically let you target a
Pokemon by tapping on it and it appeared
in the corner of your screen with the
footprints and you can see how you're
progressing toward or away from it yeah
right right but you can't do that
anymore maybe you never could I know I
never caught a single wild Pokemon by
targeting it by chasing the footprints
it was always buggy for me never worked
and then on top of that there was
another way you could find these Pokemon
the developers of the of some folks on
in the Okavango community who are
software developers they said hey we can
build our own apps to track these
Pokemon using the same api's from the
game using the same data that trickles
into your phone to tell you where the
Pokemon are they win and they've created
their own apps like polka vision on the
web where you can just get a map of the
area and see where the Pokemon spawn
find them and then go there so you know
the other day in our
this a dragon night appeared right at
the corner of yes we're here for this no
that's right oh that's right his last
one Michaelson from New York ok so in
San Francisco the corner of our office
there was a rush on cnet headquarters we
saw people running down the street to
catch this drag it out of the quarter of
our offices because they found it on
these online maps they had no idea where
to go just by looking at their Pokemon
go app but by going to poke a vision by
going to poke a hound by going to these
pokeradar apps they knew if they walked
several blocks down to our headquarters
they could catch this elusive rare
Pokemon and so they did but now so
upsetting though to get Bonnie coming
into our meeting and being like guys
there's a there's a dragonite outside
the office go go this is breaking and
all positive villains chooser she's our
video producers just like we gotta go to
computers we left our papers we just
beelined out of here and missed it but
now nobody's gonna be able to do that
because niantic is cracking down on
these third-party Pokemon tracking apps
as well which is so upsetting it's like
niantic was like hey guess what we're
gonna cut off you know that really
useful thing that you use oh and by the
way we're also gonna turn off our own
tracking so good luck have fun catching
them you're my figuring out where they
are there might be a safety issue that
in a way though too because maybe people
who were like it when people getting
robbed by going after lures maybe there
were people taking advantage of the fact
that oh it's a dragonite there's gonna
be people going let's haunt that area
some a they're trying to turn off some
of the okay first of all if somebody is
gonna mug you they're not gonna mug you
when there are 30 people in a crowd
there there you will get pickpocketed
watch out for that instead second of all
if you are looking at a map and using
lures to determine who to go mug get a
better system okay that's illogical
first of all most Lords are from people
who are either in a building or near a
place of business like I said a lot of
mine in my neighborhood are either in
restaurants or bars
which is great if I go have dinner have
a drink or something but like guys be
smart seriously like you can still see
on your map anything near you that has a
lure that's sure those are the same to
know what they're really yeah I wasn't
really cracking down on here that's the
important they've been at that was one
of the other editions was a lot more
warning messages i think one the one the
ones i saw when i was writing in a lift
ride was a don't play while driving when
I was a passenger sir that's okay um and
then uh i think in other words they were
like a few times in it watch where
you're going I mean they always had the
gyarados in the front saying watch where
you're going but I think in the middle
of it now there's also a few extra pay
attention so I mean I think that I I
wanted to fit I want to step out here
and defend niantic for a sec and say
maybe they're just doing this because of
the immense server load like both people
trying to use the nearby feature to find
those footsteps and track down the
pokemon and also people using these poke
efficient apps every time somebody uses
one of those things one of these
automated tools that pings the server
over and over again to figure out where
the Pokemon are every time they do that
they're putting an additional strain on
the servers which are already trying to
deal with this massive massive load of
all these players that they did not
expect I mean this Gabe they say it's
making maybe ten million dollars a day
from it app purchases previous Gabe's
that dyad take his bait they move tiny
they didn't have any areas acting like a
Gris parent they're acting like a parent
who is like don't do this or I'm gonna
take away your toys and then they just
put you on like technological
restriction or something like what
you're just gonna ground me you think
that that's how you want people to play
your game you're going to take away
anything useful that we were using to
play your game like it's one thing to
take away the steps that would have been
fine because we all know it's been a bug
and it hasn't been working since
inception but then to also cut off
access for poke a vision and radar and
all the things that we're actually
making it fun to catch pokemon that's
ridiculous that is so backward
of niantic but how do we know they're
not just going to reinstate it in an
update as soon as they figure out the
server has there been anything to make
that even seem like a remote possibility
well to be fair they don't communicate
they don't say anything we had no idea
this was coming late on a Friday they
were gonna change the Gabe out from
under us so maybe that's why people are
so angry because we just don't know they
don't tell us anything at all neither do
a lot of I don't know okay I don't think
it's just the fact that they didn't tell
us anything quote unquote I think for me
it's the fact that they cut off any way
for a casual player to enjoy the game so
you were only enjoying the game by
searching for pokemon that you could
find through the tracking in polk
efficient and all that yeah i was like
oh that's cooler into my house like let
me go grab that let me go get this cool
blue fire me so now we're talking about
the difference between going out to play
the game and playing the game whenever
you're out my plan is a collective I
play it whenever I'm out I play whenever
I'm out about I play the game I don't
need to like something to ping me and
tell me no i'm on polk a vision or i'm
at home being like oh maybe I'll go get
a drink maybe I'll go get dinner where
should I go and I look on polk a vision
which admittedly I'm probably more angry
about this in most people because i only
started doing this on thursday night
friday morning then i'm gonna be like
cool go to monk's kettle for my beer
because there's a boob head fireman
nearby like oh it's I mean I just don't
I just go where the Polka stop so I mean
if I I'll say hey there's this
restaurant it's got to poke estas made
everybody maybe 3 i'll put a lure on one
of them I'll just sit there and sit my
coffee and you know cut up my steak or
whatever the heck I can afford to eat
this week and and I'll constantly get
pokeballs and catch the Pokemon while
i'm there it doesn't need to be a mag
mar or a booby fire head man is that
what you said i don't i'm not yeah boob
head fireman oh boo pet fireman there
wasn't doesn't need to be a transformer
porygon I don't need transformers
brother one makes great I caught that
one on accident so generally those
services were they outside of my antics
terms of service and you think niantic
would create a first-party version of it
to be like if you want to catch let's
say Articuno go to somewhere really
really cold if they don't want any
ill-will they'll create their own yeah
quickly I mean to be honest I think it's
kind of a cash grab for them to some
degree they really want to sell people
on this wander around and find things
you didn't expect they don't want to be
on the go to specific locations and
catch the rare Pokemon easily kind of
thing because they want to keep people
playing as long as possible why do you
use keep playing after you've caught
them all are you going to keep playing
after you cut them all probably because
they've already said they'll release
like new one okay but but soon in
September well originally supposed to be
coming in july but September they're
gonna have this wearable Nintendo scene
of this wearable they're going to sell
for thirty-five dollars it's a little
pin or wristband you put on your wrist
that lets you see Pokemon nearby you and
you can just press a button to catch
them and they want to sell those devices
I mean they don't want people to already
just know where Pokemon are go straight
there I want people to wander around and
magically stumble upon them hi I'm a
woman who lives in an urban area I'm
gonna be doing no wandering around by
myself I don't care what pokemons nearby
fair dressing what else we ate a lot
more so the style of the steps of a
style yep changed a little bit too i
noticed that when i was catching some
pokemon last night it seemed like there
was a couple actually graphical
improvements to the way the balls the
way the ball through and landed what up
and then I think we've talked about font
possible yes it's there some meme some
nasty means going I'm sorry angry about
there's a post ops all of theirs new
font changes like really niantic we gave
you a list of things we wanted from you
and you came to us and said look we
changed the font oh I'm sorry we also
now have the ability to customize our
human again to be fair you were you were
kind of interested in that right you
don't get me wrong I already did it like
re i totally already like change your
clothes I thank you dude come on hey you
could you can do a sex change in Pokemon
go now to super important I didn't go in
and I could just reach Ainge the entire
out
it and I'm kind of wondering i know
everybody hates much people hate Tim
instincts new leaders clothing options
but I kind of want his hoodie on my
character I'm just saying but although
the the jackets at the other two leaders
which colors T minster yeah yes yellow
yellow and I'm I don't think we can be
friends for some reason is a very
polarizing decision wait what are you
what you watchin mystic i don't know
what eva is that blue oh I'm on blue
yeah yeah everybody loves the blue blue
blue they also taken over every gym so
I'm already like I'm already outcast you
know people are complaining I've seen a
lot of complaining I don't know people
have been complaining oh hey hold on i
get this always a lot of complaining
what is i'm also getting a pokemon right
now what is it it's a piccie it's just
my favorite pokemon because every time
you catch four of them you get at least
900 experience points 100 for each
Pokemon you catch 500 for the evolve
unless you double it with a lucky egg
it's the best pokemon so to be clear
even though we're hashing out everything
a game obviously we enjoy the game cuz
we're still anywhere but right now would
you just catch Caitlyn I don't know okay
caterpillar thing no no oh you know with
that title okay all right we have any
good questions from the audience yeter
we have a lot of comments live and let
me jump down to our questions so Godfrey
asked how can you find Pokemon now that
the radio system is broken and polka we
saw buzzes it earlier but what would you
what would you best way to go about it
there are still a few trackers out there
that work if you go to reddit you go to
our / Pokemon go dev there's a bunch of
software developers working on the game
working on these apps and they're
talking about ways to get around the
blocks and they are talking about a few
of these tracking apps that do still
work is what pokemon it seems like what
niantic did is they shut down the IP
addresses of commonly used cloud
services like amazon web hosting which
we're powering these third-party apps to
begin with so it's like okay the most
popular ones will shut them all down
just by blocking Amazon because Amazon's
got the servers but then some of the
ones who were hosting them on their own
servers they haven't been blocked yet is
what my understanding anyhow Brandon and
our YouTube chad has a more general
questions i do want to post to you both
why do people like this game so much
pokemons been a game for over a decade
and that is really clear Pokemon has
been around for 16 years now a little
over that in Japan
and uh but now it's like 1999 all over
again Pokemon everywhere dominating the
news cycle you can get drinks so when
that came out I remember right away
older than I thought I was I think idea
98 in Japan if I'm or 97 even I think I
think 90s when the u.s. TV show started
airing 98 I'm gonna look at any case
what do you me the reason why I like it
is because the AR part of it is actually
really entertaining to me I think it's
kind of it was kind of fun in the
beginning for me to like be catching
things while I was in bed and be like
look who visited me that's so funny um
there was a little skull and crossbones
guy I caught him one day when I was like
vegging out on netflix nailed it there's
a lot of nostalgia for me but also this
I've been wanting a game that just
really gamma phi's exercise for me
something that'll get me out of the
house walking around losing some weight
and this one does it because the
feedback loop is just so quick and so
consistent I know every time i walk out
there I'll get some more pokeballs I'll
find a Pokemon soon I'll have gained
enough to evolve them and get some more
experience points get to the next level
I don't know how long it's gonna last
I'm already at level 22 and I feel like
the game's wearing a little bit thin but
ah it's just that quick jolt of
electricity that I didn't get from
exercise by itself our chat has after
we've been talking to that a bunch of
guesses at the year in age my search
said 1996 for the original release of
pokemon red and green in Japan that
sounds right that sounds right so it
seems closer when I thought it was so
it's um shifting away a bit from the app
updates let's go over a bit about just
some advanced Pokemon techniques so
let's say you want to go beyond
collecting and you want to take on Jim's
easily what are some of the best ways to
actually power up the team because the
game plays a lot different than it did
on Gameboy in Des where you caught a
Pokemon you raised it you got may be
trained it with some machines in this
case it's more like almost like trading
cards yeah it means a train it right you
have to train it at a
you don't you don't train the Pokemon
though I mean you're just training up
your own level and you're making the gym
levels higher to be honest this game is
that's my little monsters at all no oh
that seems weird no it's really weird
it's more like you're another reason why
I don't go to gym kind of like it's kind
of remember when the Americans in the
Wild West they hunted down all the
Buffalo and Jess are going small and
took their skin and their skulls and
split piled up the skulls into big piles
kind of like that because your objective
here is to catch as many as possible and
then you need to turn them into candy in
order to power up your Pokemon you have
to turn these Pokemon into candy so you
take them to the professor and you
transfer them transfer them and we
doesn't exactly describe what happens
when you transfer them but you put in a
Pokemon and out comes a piece of pokemon
candy I think he grinds them and then
and then you feed that candy to the the
other Pokemon of the same time so it's
it's definitely get this Auto
cannibalism thing going on here um and
then and then after you've powered them
up to a certain degree you can evolve
them or you can evolve them then power
them up and they could become a larger
you know monster ish in a much more
powerful version of the same Pokemon a
lot more candy they basically taken on
every single power that their relatives
add and ate them in the form of candy
but the weird thing is you can't that if
you find a big powerful Pokemon in the
wild you trade them in for the same
amount of candidate as the small little
weak ones so it's kind of like you're
you're you're thinning out the herd by
killing all the week buffalo off Darwin
is a man in a way if you have a little
fitness bro if you have a Pidgey in a
pidgeotto in the same polka stop you're
better off just getting the Pidgey and
you much better balls it's easier to
catch the Pidgey you get the same amount
of canting experience for it and when
you get that pitching into your
inventory it's easier to evolve the
Pidgey because it only takes one you
know 12 candies to evolve a Pidgey
whereas it takes 25 or 50 me 50 I think
to turn a pidgeotto into a pidgeot
so it's you're better off just thinning
out the weak parts of the herd the other
night my pilgrim I just had a head of a
bunch of Pokemon ready to evolve and I
dropped one of the lucky eggs and just
hit evolve and all of them cuz I guess
then yet double XP yeah I sort of weird
cuz I was like I'm growing all these
pokemon but I have no intention of
keeping eight of them and they're all
getting transferred after their being
evolved yeah I know that the fastest way
to level up in the game is to just get
rid sever your emotional connection to
any of these little monsters but I've
named them crackle lucky some of them
like little Kim evolve them and cut them
off and involve them and grind them and
carry the rear end them up and carry the
nickname to the new pokemon that you're
actually keeping for as long as you want
and the reason you do this the reason
you do this is because you're trying to
boost your own trainer level all every
time you evolve one of these Pokemon you
get 500 experience points you got a
thousand if you crack the lucky I
because lucky egg doubles all your
experience points so but the lucky had
only last 30 minutes so in that interval
you need to grunt you need to evolve and
grind down as many pokemon as possible
to boost your trainer leveling the
reason you do that is as your trainer
level goes up you automatically find
stronger and stronger Pokemon so that's
the best way to advance the game is just
to do that yes but so here's my question
at what point do I really need to level
up to like find some of the higher level
pokemon that I want like do you think
that I I won't even see some of them so
I'm like level 20 or something like that
that's a good question I mean you can
definitely go with you you can find you
can find any Pokemon I think just by
looking around for them somebody will be
really here at cnet a lot of the Pokemon
go people are levels 20 or above so even
though I'm just a 14 I just talk along
with you guys and you go out for like
walks and lunch and stuff snatch up
those 600 CP things because i am a
decent thrower i guess and it doesn't
take me like 10 it takes me like that is
a really good way to game the system
that you found yes if you go in group
sex but i've heard reports of the people
go in groups they just get better
pokemon in
and that's probably but yeah like that's
how i got my largest CP one was actually
I went on a poke a walk with Sean and
Justin and Rebecca and there was like a
69 or five something or 600 pincher man
and I was like ooh never seen one that
high justin justin is an insanely high
level I think he's like 26 now yeah
somewhere in there Sean I mean this
morning it was 25 so by now I might be
27 Sean and our chat has an interesting
a comment I want to throw in on this
topic he says that uh playing the game
from the perspective of a breeder is
much more interesting for me judging my
Mon based on individual value which can
be found using using poka poka advisor
what you're saying probably doesn't work
anymore but it does for looking at the
ivy the individual eyes are work yeah
okay we're not talking about maps
anymore we're talking about an
application you can put on your phone
which lets you see the secret values of
all your Pokemon because as a desktop to
I think as you my computer I think
there's a desktop version change the
login ah that looks like it yes oh
that's not the one I was using but
that's what happens there is um there
are a few there are a few that like
calculate based on what the CP the yeah
it's great it's weird cuz like CP is
like kind of a generalized we think your
Pokemon is this powerful and then that
combined with your move sent the and the
damage of those moves determine you know
how much damage you're going to do the
the enemy pokemon but they're actually
all based on some secret values
individual values that have been a
staple of the Pokemon series each
Pokemon has an attack number a defense
number and a rumor with the third number
is by any chance something like that
there's a I stamina or something that
determines help hit points and so the
folks online when they were analyzing
the games data they figured out how to
reverse engineer that formula so you
stick your HP value your CP value and
the current amount of Stardust it'll
take to evolve your Pokemon into a
spreadsheet or into a calculator and
it'll tell you what those secret values
are and that lets you know the maximum
potential of your Pokemon as determined
at Birth basically so if you find a good
Bulbasaur or a good you know squirtle in
the wild even if it's really low CP
might have just
15 20 CP something like that you could
evolve it to be a much stronger squirtle
than almost any other one in the game if
it has those high secret individual
values and poke advisors is one of these
app that will automatically show you the
values for all your pokemons you can say
okay I'm not going to trade the squirtle
in even though it seems to have low CP
because it's actually going to be a
better Pokemon in the end okay so what
you're telling me is that this egg dude
who I obviously may want to find that
Jan hey gone from Game of Thrones is
potentially better than I think he is
potential he looks like he's gonna do
nothing I mean we could sit on
calculated to me let me find the
spreadsheet well calculate all we
continue that way he's just gonna sit on
someone and all the pokemon believe they
grow as you grow up in level or at least
they can get good to a higher CP over
time hey real quick someone in our
chatterin livestream chat room pointed
out pokey advisor or pokey assistant
calm assist another yeah that's actually
where I am right now so what's the name
of that Pokemon that's uh chancy sure
and what's the CP 27 and then what's the
oh I'm looking the wrong calculator I
want the IV calculator okay so chancy
with 27 what's the HP 8520 7hp of 85 how
much dust will it cost to evolve tool
canta Bobby when power them up for 200
201 candy okay let's find the IV's so
that Pokemon could be 90 as much as 91%
perfect and is at least 61 percent
perfect so at least 62 percent means
you're definitely an average you would
not be wasting points by evolving this
book on and maybe maybe it's as much as
91% it could be a nearly perfect Pokemon
you evolve it and it's gonna it could be
fantastic in the end but you don't know
unless you do a little more calculation
so if you powered them now I think he's
much cuter than I originally did even
though he shaped like an egg with an egg
and his pouch that's just weird can you
power it up once mmm I'm a hoarder this
is very hard for me
haha do it do it do it okay so we're
gonna show you my son he went up to a CP
36 36 and at HP 9999 sounds dust is
still 200 yeah okay so that is pressing
the button now let's see we got ah
there's still lots of combinations but
it's at least sixty nine percent maybe
eighty-nine percent perfect okay so he's
got a little smaller okay yeah like that
I guess I'm the beach plus a minus like
I guess that's fine there's there's a
lot of math that could still be done
because they don't share these values
but that polka advisor if you plug your
values in there I mean if you if you
give it your account basically it will
automatically tell you how good your
Pokemon oh it's just you know the whole
giving it your account things I don't
think I want to know oh yeah I don't
think I need to know that much like I
want to know what my favorites are and
how they will do it's probably the next
thing niantic is gonna crack down on to
be honest I mean they're probably saying
is I should do that now or maybe they'll
trace it back and bania retro actively
no I wouldn't give them my things I
would like try it I was holding my
numbers fair yeah no I don't give anyone
making cow numbers were you what do you
think I'm it crazy the last topic I
think we're to wrap up on a couple
people put on our chats features they
didn't want to see in the future herson
said he hopes you can have trainer
battles shahbaz if I said his name right
uh his or her name right asked if we
will ever be able to change our teams is
there a feature a dream feature you want
going forward that we don't have
currently in this mobile game I mean
it's not a feat that's kind of a feature
so what I really really really want
ribeau c'mon go is I want a carpool mode
I want to mode you turn it on and you
say i'm in the passenger seat of the car
or I'm in the driver's seat of a car
playing this game I'm handling my friend
ain't talking mine the point is if you
hand your phone to a friend and you get
Stardust or something like that for
being a responsible person and not play
so this is something where you press the
button and it basically disables all the
features of Pokemon go just keeps your
phone on you hand
to a friend and you get some Stardust
for being the designated driver in the
car and not playing the damn game
because the game right now you can play
it while driving it is extremely
dangerous and there's nothing to stop it
I mean in a previous game niantic made
ingress there was like a speed limit
where if you went past a certain speed
you know you you would disable some of
the games features but right now I can
be going 80 down the highway and if I
see a Pikachu in the other Lane I can
tap on it and I can try to catch and
it's kind of crazy that it lets me do
that it just doesn't count your steps
right your it doesn't count your steps
States you do over certain speeds if you
do things that aren't that there's all
kinds of folks on reddit trying to
figure out exactly how I counting steps
works but we do know that over certain
speeds it doesn't work but also even
with ingress even with the speed limit
people would be okay well I can't drive
over 50 miles an hour I guess I'll Drive
at 15 miles an hour around this place
and and catch my in a pokemon or hack my
portals and ingress and it's just
dangerous and they don't need it doesn't
need to be dangerous just incentivize
playing responsibly incentivize not
playing what was the driver of a car
that's a good one don't drink and drive
don't text and drive do not Pokemon go
and drive that's correct do not Pokemon
go and drink kalyan what's your dream
feature I don't know I really thought
that much about it good question um I
don't know I guess I just miss the
tracking so anything that brings me some
semblance of that back would be
spectacular I guess for me the reason
why I enjoyed using those things was
because you know I'm not such I don't
know I'm a casual player so it wasn't
like I was being like oh look there's a
nest of XYZ over there but like guys I
really want Pikachu if I could like find
a thing the show Terry was I want him I
want certain ones i wish i knew the
creatures that i can only find in
different areas since like I was at san
diego comic-con recently and there was
all kinds of fire pokemon i could never
find in New York up here you guys are
the land of Zubat I have seen more Zubat
in San Francisco than I've seen in
anywhere else so far
even in New York which is plenty is
about there too um but there's probably
something maybe there's a seal they can
find more often here or if you're in LA
go to the La Brea Tar Pits they have
exactly the Pokemon you would expect to
find there we pull up this other one too
is it I couldn't see it I'll show to you
in just sec too so I just take a look at
this Grimer this is exactly what you
would expect to find exactly what you
expect to find that one that everyone's
like where is it how do i find it ditto
ditto oh god nobody knows nobody's
caught a did oh I don't think uh is he
part of the 151 or whatever as part of
the 14 and did the guy who said he
caught all them have a did oh no no when
he said all he met under 46 help there's
no artisan acceptable trace no ditto
gnome you or me or two yet those ones
haven't been found by anybody and
there's geographic specific ones right
North America has a tauros tauros for
North America there's assets retail
Bulls yeah I learned stuff ah dummbell a
look nice ah there's kangaskhan I think
Genghis Khan boys gone like kangaroo
pokemon i think that's Australia I don't
know that's awesome maybe being racist
by saying that elitist country estoy
have no idea nationale that's cool I
know that there are some so oh yes I
think that's really interesting hey if
you travel a lot have fun yeah they're
not always where you'd expect to find
them though I went to know Julia
California it's a beach town and I found
nothing but electric pokemon yeah we're
like volt orbs and electrodes up the
wazoo and Magnemite sand magnet ons I
think in that respect a little easier
for casual players like me because I
have no preconceived notions about where
they're gonna be living like I'm like oh
look something out in the wild let me
catch it and I'm lat like why is it here
along these power lines this it's like
you actually go into the wild and you
find no pokemon because there are people
live true well sort of i went to i
played so i play soccer after work and i
went to that park and that's where I
found boo pet fireman like he just
spawned in the park randomly but like a
public hardware P Q public
part yeah we're people there were no
stops it were like it was just Pokemon
there were no stops that's fair it was
weird people go I thought it was weird I
mean if you go to place where people
don't go even like I went to some back
streets you know where there weren't a
lot of people milling about was just
drivers and houses you know uh and there
was just nothing in that suburban area I
had to go more urban where there were
people see this park was in a suburban
area that's why I thought it was I me
parks there's an exception for parks for
parks that are known parks on google
maps they actually change the type of
terrain you can see that it's like this
dark green belt and they'll be Pokemon
there you sure just glad we don't have
to get into the tall grass like to be if
they reach you filled of the games if
you had to jump into like a large meadow
of grass up to your waist let me know
come on if I'm at the top of I don't
know some mountain around here i want to
find like mountain pokemon i don't want
to get up there and find no pokemon yeah
and i'm pretty sure that's what's gonna
happen right now I haven't tried it yet
but you know I was on a boat last week
and not one Pokemon appeared I was
thinking at the whole time to buy the
whole song okay um not one Pokemon found
me in though in the water yeah bae
outside San Diego I think you're
supposed to find them they don't mind
you but my eggs hatched all of my eggs
hatched because we were traveling under
20 miles per hour so i slept them
incubate and they all were done by the
time i was off the boat nice a Magikarp
did jump into my car while I was driving
this is yo water nearby nope there's
gonna flutter in I find that since the
update i get this GPS signal not found
way more often yeah yeah me too I don't
know what's going on which is
frustrating because then it freezes and
you can't tap your bboki stop or show
where you are it just kind of locks you
out which I guess is good cuz when it
used to say that it would let me tap on
the things that it I wasn't actually
near but I could tap on magic harp on
the highway yep it happened don't poke
him on go and drive I was in the
passenger seat you can't I know it's
just my disclaimer you know just making
sure everyone's like being safe all
