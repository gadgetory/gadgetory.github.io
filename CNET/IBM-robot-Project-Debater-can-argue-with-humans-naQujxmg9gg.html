it's one small step for machine one
giant leap for machine kind Ivy M's
newest artificial intelligence system
took on experienced human debaters and
one alive debates subsidizing space
exploration is like investing in really
good tires it may not be fun to spend
the extra money but ultimately you know
both you and everyone else on the road
will be better off cold project to beta
the system scans hundreds of millions of
articles and journals to develop its
position on a topic then it creates a
narrative to support its arguments it
has to be able to understand language in
a way that will enable it to figure out
what are arguments that support its tan
of the debate so we have developed a
machine learning algorithm it has neural
networks deep neural networks in it it
has other machine learning technologies
in it project debater took part in two
debates each consisting of an
introduction a four-minute rebuttal and
a concluding statement and in the second
debate the project debater actually
convinced 20% of people to change their
minds in favor of it the AI even
predicted and rebutted arguments before
the human opponent made them they were
learning what is the rationale behind
how at the beta structured how do you
build an argument to make it persuasive
IBM's human computer challenges began in
1997 when deep blue beat world chess
champion Garry Kasparov and in 2011 IBM
Watson of won jeopardy but it's
researchers say projector beta has
applications beyond just winning debates
like in the legal and financial fields
what we are trying to develop is a
demonstration of technology that has a
lot of power to aid human beings to
expand their mind to get better insights
Google is also developing an AI called
duplex that conducts natural
conversations on the phone I'd like to
reserve a table for Friday the 3rd in
San Francisco Lexus Avedis cnet.com for
CBS News allow me to respond to some of
my opponents most recent claims I think
that one of the claims made by MS Avaya
was that people should choose how to
spend their money I would like to offer
a different view people should spend
their
hard-earned money as they please but
society has a duty to provide help to
its people in need</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
