people say happy june i don't care i'm
saying happy june happy june everybody
if you like video games well June is
great because you've got III right
around the corner but if you're
concentrating on the games you can
actually play this month prepare to be
underwhelmed because there's not a whole
lot of games coming out in June let's
start with heroes of the storm which is
set to arrive jun 2nd the game is a 5 on
5 multiplayer online battle arena or
MOBA as it's called that features
characters from blizzards Warcraft
Diablo and starcraft franchises best of
all it's free to play which is better
than having to pay for it now it makes
sense why you'd want to make another
Lego game right there super successful
freaking adorable but why on earth would
you reopen an amusement park that killed
a lot of people the first time it open I
mean what were they thinking hey did
this park kill a bunch of people the
first time we tried it out oh it did
okay great here's a blank check do it
all over again anyway lego jurassic
world arrives the same day as the movie
and that's jun 12 thankfully june is
saving the best for last because the
23rd marks the release of batman arkham
knight
the only thing sources agree on is it's
the final entry in rocksteady studios
fantastic Batman trilogy of games now
the hype train on this one is in full
gear but the series stellar track record
has me feeling confident this one is
going to be a hit as well in Arkham
Knight players were once again assume
the role of the Dark Knight and face a
smattering of Gotham City's worst
including scarecrow and for the first
time in the series will finally get to
drive the Batmobile that's right Batman
fans the Batmobile is at your disposal
okay that's going to do it for me if I
did not mention your most anticipated
game for June make sure you hit me up on
Twitter and we can talk it over we'll
see you back here for july's games which
I hope are many more than June that's
going to do it for now thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
