Alpha Bang equifax is CEO Rick Smith is
retiring effective immediately three
weeks after his credit moderating
monitoring agency suffered a massive
cyber attack with up to 143 million
Americans affected so alfred did this
need to happen first of all that's out
of footnotes that retiring with witty
quotation with quotes retiring really
he's stepping down or forced out
whatever you want to cut i and i would
say that this definitely needed to
happen on four equal faxes sake just
because of the way that they've been
responding to this I think had you know
their CEO Rick Smith handled this you
know checking to see if you were
affected by it you know the millions of
people that wanted to know whether or
not they could sue the company after it
had happened the website that they made
for it that had a lot of security flaws
and things like that I would say you
know they're botched response to it was
the biggest reason for his you know
early retirement as they would like to
people to recognize it as I would agree
it was a severely botched response
especially the fact that it seemed that
they knew that this was coming and they
had quite a bit of time to actually they
had more than a month to prepare for
this and you know this is what you got
right exactly but at the same time this
was also one of the biggest tax out
there so do you actually think that he
may have been able to hold on and stay
on if for whatever reason they did a
better job on did properly he likely
would still be in this position right
now in his statement he said when he
left you know he said he was dedicated
to making it right and he said he felt
it would be best if the company had new
leadership he had been with the company
for about 12 years obviously he was in
charge when this breach happened and
when the company found out in July and
you know for them to have the kind of
response that they did you know it was a
whole month after it just it reflected
very poorly on him and equifax his
stocks I'm stocking shares were we're
basically tumbling down up until today
they had to halt it for a bit and then
you know let it resume after the
announcement came out
and it's just incredibly embarrassing on
their end and I think they're hoping
that this new interim CEO plus the CEO
that they appoint eventually is gonna
you know get rid of that like terrible
image that they have right now yeah so a
lot of people are also going to be
affected by this let's run through some
of the how-to stuff of what you should
do or just some some advice that people
should should follow if they are
affected they want to find out that they
well naturally after breach you're
supposed to go to a credit monitoring
agency do you know check on these things
like on these things but you know what
do you do when what happened is at a
credit monitoring agency so you know
they offered free identity protection
and things like that for up to a year
obviously I wouldn't do it Equifax just
that's just me you can because of their
driver or the best thing you can do
though I would say is a credit freeze
just because you know that's a standard
thing on its own that's not you know
giving trusting some other company to to
to monitor your ID and then you know
potentially they can also be breach if
you do a credit freeze that's like
across the board that's gonna you know
save you on a lot of things right next
up the newest version of Apple's Mac
operating system called high sierra is
out folks may have heard about a
potential security vulnerability with
the new OS alfred is that a concern well
Apple put out a statement yesterday
basically saying you know there's so
many hurdles that you have to jump
through to you know have this
vulnerability we'd be present but you
know that's Apple that's them trying to
cover their own their own tracks here on
but at the same time they also it's a
good specify yeah yeah they said that
like look hi Sierra has the same issue
as the other OS yes did you can update
comfortably without yeah worrying that
it's going to be more vulnerable yeah
than previous OS yeah so you know it's
not high sierra only that's affected by
this vulnerability but i think the point
that the vulnerability was trying to
make or the exposure which kind of make
was basically even though this is the
latest OS it can still be affected by
this right there are a couple of other
additional changes that you'll see in
high sierra but a lot of it is
back-end architectural stuff either way
check us out on SEANET for more
information on that and more about these
stories my name's Ben Fox Ruben my name
is Alfred Inge thanks for listening and
I cut to the wrong screen cuz I'm at
practice apparently one day we're just
glad we're back yeah
were you guys actually affected by the
Equifax hack I want her site and I said
I I allegedly was their website is so
bad that which is part of their botched
response that it's hard to tell you know
it like I put in my name as doe and my
social security number the last six
digits as one two three four five six
and you were affected so yeah it's one
of those things where I'm like I don't I
don't even know like if it's true or not
and granted that what I believe your
check was immediately after they put up
the site and they may have done some of
the appropriate fixes since then yeah
but I mean I I feel like it's at a point
right now we're like honestly you should
just get a credit freeze just in case
because if it's not with this breach
it'll be some other one yeah it's like
six months the important thing that
people should know about a credit freeze
is if at any point you need to open a
new line of credit you want to you know
have a mortgage new credit card whatever
you have to temporarily lift the credit
for you yeah so that is for some people
that might be a bit of an annoyance but
at the same time it is preventative
measure though but yeah yeah so if you
got a credit freeze you can still use
your credit card you can still you know
well yeah use your credit card I think
that's like the most important thing
here but like it doesn't affect like
your bills or a credit score in any way
it's really just if you're opening a new
credit card or if you're trying to buy
like a new house or something which
really how often are you doing I don't
know I buy a new house like at least
once every other week so you know and
that's why we have that GoFundMe for
Ben's dead so how bogus is the
information coming from the reference
website where you could go and type in
your name and Social Security not a loss
that's the thing they they they don't
have a lot of credibility right now so I
don't know how like legitimate it is
and the thing that's awful about is that
there's literally the only source so
there were some very obvious flaws in
the system right off the bat alfred
mentioned one of them i think some other
people were just putting in gibberish
and it was coming back as you may have
been hacked so i think there was like a
default script in it that just said
better safe than sorry you're screwed
there were it just it was pretty obvious
that they were unprepared yeah for this
for this announcement even though they
did have time to do it so i I would
agree with Alfred in many ways that they
don't have a lot of credibility and
unfortunately there aren't a lot of
places for people to go for this type of
information one of the other things that
I think we may not have mentioned during
the podcast is just continue monitoring
your own credit and information I mean
yeah you can get free credit report
there were also a lot of like
third-party free a credit and credit
report not because I think that right
they actually I think make you pay stuff
that's there is like I just like that
song is there is a government website
that does provide you your free credit
report I also know like through your you
know through your bank you can be able
to monitor your credit much more easily
than you used to only like two years ago
so there are a lot of things out there
and you know also third-party credit
monitoring sites if you don't want to go
through Equifax MP Cody says 143 million
Americans affected I think that's about
everyone who could possibly have a
credit score to be compromise right and
luckily this probably doesn't affect
children you know one of the new
elements of you know identity theft and
credit theft are you know getting Social
Security numbers of kids and then they
don't actually realize that their credit
has been ruined until they're up the age
to get a credit card yeah
the Equifax didn't have their
information because they weren't old
enough to have that's why oh that's why
I'm hoping I'm not in this bridge right
because you're snowbear I didn't get my
I didn't get my first credit card until
like yesterday actually yeah yeah yeah I
don't like Slate June the thing is it's
possible but at the same time I think
that they do keep that information very
up-to-date with Equifax I mean my the
the thing that I also wonder is is this
something that's actually going to take
down Equifax there are three
credit monitoring agencies there's also
TransUnion and Experian yeah if Equifax
goes down is somebody else going to
replace them this is just such a big
embarrassing fail on their part that you
know
yeah the CEO went down a couple of other
folks in the company went down but their
loss of credibility in the marketplace
it does make me wonder what are gonna be
the long-term impacts on that they're
still probably getting a nice lovely
departure package shorts if they all get
yo-yoed unquote retire storm king says
it seems like these hacks are done to
let companies know that they're
vulnerable less to be actually malicious
more just like hey remember how weak you
are
that's the nicest way to with this I
mean there are hackers that do that
there's our mind that like they really
only hack like social medias and they
like they take like HBO or Marvel or
Fox's like Twitter accounts like hey
your Twitter accounts not that safe
email us for more maybe you want to hire
us so that like they do that this one
and Yahoo no it definitely wasn't for
that if it were they wouldn't have
stolen all the social security and
credit card no I wouldn't have known who
and we would have no no like our mind
like very directly says like we're the
ones that hacked you they want the glory
right and they also want to get paid you
know yeah if it's just a friendly
reminder of how vulnerable you are I
don't think yeah that this isn't it I
think a friend I didn't say friendly no
it's it's I think a friend of mine also
like had their credit information stolen
from this hack and like already had to
do like a credit freeze so there were
already people that are getting impacted
by this I mean if you haven't been
impacted by this and you may have been
it's it's it's possible that your credit
just hasn't been impacted because there
are so many different social security
numbers that they stole afraid having
gotten to you yet a friend of mine had
to K go missing on them over the weekend
it's crazy yeah I've just got every
possible alert for any of my monetary
exchange bank credit card anything any
of my systems every alert email is like
you made a transaction yep yep I went
and I bought beer yes I know yeah it's
we were talking about wanna cry only a
couple months ago and I feel like that
ransom
attack a lot of people open their eyes
to the fact that like they were like oh
my god holy crap like this is really bad
ultimately that one had a kill switch
and it wasn't nearly as bad as people
expected but like this one could have
really lasting impact I mean Alfred do
you agree with that oh yeah I mean half
of the American population or you know
most likely everybody that has a credit
card they're really gonna have to figure
out what to do if social security
numbers now because you know it's not
like a password getting leaked when
Yahoo billion users got affected you
know it's just change your password
don't use the same password yeah let me
just go and change my social security
number which granted is possible but
extremely time cannot mer I've heard
that you can do it it's possible but
they make it very very hard to do so
they better get in line now or just
don't don't use social security numbers
as an identifying measure which you're
not supposed to anyway I mean when you
were in college do they do that also I
remember when I was at the University of
Pittsburgh you used your social security
number for like virtually everything
like that was your identify that was
yours no identify just used my like my
like fingerprints and my face mm-hmm no
that's not all right so good morning
everybody in the chat thanks for chiming
in thanks for joining us Matthew doctor
asks is a - do you think this is
possibly the worst hack that's happened
so far I don't think it's I I think it's
the worst as far as impact goes you know
as far as you know getting all that like
like critical information obviously like
Yahoo has set the record for the most
accounts hacked at 1 billion but that's
like usernames and passwords and you
know it's not exactly credit card
information as far as you know social
security cards your name your number
your birth date all your address all
this stuff yeah I think it's the worst
for the u.s. also and a global scheme
like it's not that much but like as far
as like if we were like relating to just
the America yeah it's it's probably the
worst as far as impact and like reach
that like the consequences will have so
let's expand on that a listener we have
James favor I think he's in the UK he's
asking is this a worldwide concern or is
it
the isolated to the US this has happened
so it's mostly in the US but there's
also victims in Canada and in the UK
that might have been on the same server
but it's mostly isolated to the US but I
mean you know these are these are people
who have family and like name and you
know relatives and things like that and
in other countries and things like that
so it could have lasting impact like
everywhere yeah while we're at it
a dog asks so what about people who
don't yet have a credit card and he'll
in the chat is already chiming in and
saying if you have loans or any sort of
credit you're at risk yeah it's
basically because you know it's a credit
monitoring service so even if you don't
sign up for Equifax directly you know if
you ever apply for anything
you have to hand over your social
security number and then they they're
the ones that check like what your
credit score is and they keep tabs on
that like consistently and that's why
you know this was such like a heavy hit
on a company like Equifax yeah back into
the chat Danny Green's asks wasn't there
something about not being able to file a
lawsuit if you accepted their offer for
free monitoring yes so there was there
was a major confusion over that and the
New York State Attorney General's Office
and several lawyers had to go and look
at it and actually Equifax and
themselves had to come out with a
statement after it basically saying that
applies to everything else you can still
use this and sue us guys because so many
people didn't want to use it which again
was part of their like boch respondent
yeah there was some crisis management
there was some form language in it's an
arbitration clause yeah there was an
arbitration clause that was was
basically like if you get tell me from
right here if you just wanted to check
Equifax
to see whether you were or weren't
affected that arbitration clause was
included in the language for yeah like
through and therefore you were wiped out
from the ability to sue that if you even
checked that's what that's what a lot of
people thought because it was in the
language it was in their terms of use on
their webpage but then you know a lot of
people like read through the fine print
and saw that the arbitration clause in
there and saw it and thought well I want
to check
I want to see you guys so what's going
on they had to come out and say no no no
that only applies for other Equifax to
it you can use this one and still sue us
which which may be coming and I think
there are there's a class-action lawsuit
out of Oregon there's been a
class-action lawsuit out of Georgia
where Equifax is based there in Atlanta
and then there's been a lawsuit from the
Massachusetts state attorney general's
office and those are just some ones that
were made public there's I'm sure
there's more lawsuits out there that you
know people aren't like tweeting or
telling the world about geez all right
it's a mess let's slam through a couple
more questions before we wrap it up for
the day we are running low on time Josh
Buddha asks if that much information was
stolen won't the chances be slim of your
information being sold no oh no no your
information will probably be sold by
well jump in yeah a lot of the times
what happens is that you know they sell
them in in batches on the dark web so
they'll be like oh you can buy like
fifty thousand Social Security numbers
for like 50 cents each unfortunately
that's how much your social security
number is worth online but you know
that's because there's so many of them
this applies so large that they can
afford to price them so low and still
make twenty five thousand dollars per
badger yeah so it's not all gonna be
sold at once but you know the eventually
it'll get to your name and they because
they sell them in such large batches and
there's bots for this kind of thing so
you know it's not like once they're sold
it's not like one man on a keyboard
earlier let me try this person social
security okay nope let me they're not
going through each one they develop
these like BOTS that like it's called
credential stuffing where they basically
just like cram them all into this bond
it does it all automatically and then
you know if they get something they get
something if not they didn't do any
where it goes a bot they did it and they
paid like 50 cents like a name right so
in many ways one of the only invest
things that you can do is monitor your
own credit to do the things that you
need to do on your end to create enough
for roadblocks yeah try to prevent this
kind of thing from affecting you because
they they verify it for you right and
they marry very well get to your Social
Security look like cyber criminals
because there's so many they take the
easiest route possible
like you so you know the bots not gonna
be able to like oh let me do this and
then also let me call this person's like
line pretending like social engineering
my way through it they're just oh the
Bob didn't get that one right next one
next one next one next one and then okay
the bot got that one because that person
didn't set like anything up do we think
there's gonna be anybody on the banks
side that's going to be more precautious
about these kind of enquiries they're
gonna have to be I think i bank with
Chase Bank and I know I've gotten like
messages from them saying like hey we're
taking like these precautions as like a
step to prevent that I can't say for any
other bank that I like imagine soggies
recent questions so if there's a
class-action lawsuit is an Equifax dunzo
good use good usage of the phrase oh
there's been class-action lawsuits
before for massive data breaches I think
I can't remember the company's name but
they settled for they usually settle the
the one that I'm thinking of a settled
for like 25 million dollars which is
like you know just a small penny in
these major corporations pockets so they
were not gonna be done but and here's
the other thing like because there's so
many people affected by this if you ever
see the money from this you're probably
only 5 bucks yeah yeah it's not it's not
even material the lawyers are the ones
that are gonna end up with the money
yeah for being cynical the other thing
too is that if Equifax really does get
harmed in a lawsuit more often than not
what ends up happening in these cases
and again this is gonna sound cynical by
the company ends up getting acquired by
a different company and changes its name
so Equifax decides going Knorr is
Equifax gonna be a verb yeah it's just
gonna be like fax echo or whatever like
you're just gonna like a lot of times
when like there's there's too much of a
blemish on a corporate name they they
can sell it and just change the name I
mean like Philip Morris did that there
there are a handful of other companies
that like you just kind of move on from
from that corporate name but the actual
infrastructure and the employee base and
you know the the corporate structure
continues to stay there just potentially
under you know a different company
lovely I like Michael Hoffs inclusion
here please steal my social security
number and clear all my expletive
removed up I don't think this is a V
vendetta situation one last question now
that's a nightclub oh you're right it
was Fight Club so yeah before we go one
more from M Hill who's been giving lots
of great advice in the chat about you
know changing your card reopen your pin
numbers so yeah the long story short is
going to be like start from scratch if
you want to be extra safe but we were
just talking about no Equifax isn't too
big to fail per se quoting Matthew
dacher in the chat but M he'll what kind
of golden parachute does the CEO get on
their way out actually in the SEC filing
yesterday for mr. Smith's retirement
retirement the Board of Directors
actually said they can-they
up for up to a year they'll be able to
at their discretion they can choose
whether or not he gets his parachute or
not so like during the course of it as
this investigation into you know the
incident given Baker chute give him a
couple of cinderblock boots they can
basically take away his retirement plan
if they choose to it which is rare and
which also could be very yeah often does
not he's also not getting his bonus this
year oh poor guy no but ya know Bo he's
not getting his bonus and his retirement
plan might be yeah so what's he gonna do
with only three boats then alright one
last thing before we go about Mac OS
High Sierra being that there's some
conditions at play here Derlin Santana
asks how long do you think we should
wait before you do the upgrade generally
I like to wake a loaded question yeah
generally when with any of these new OS
is whether it's you know for mobile or
your PC I always think it's a good idea
unless you absolutely have to switch or
you're you're like desperate to it's
good to wait just to like wait for the
unless you get all the kinks to run out
you got a burner desktop you want to
mess around with a beta on it sure and
it's the same thing with your phone with
like iOS 11 it just sometimes takes a
little bit of time for all the kinks to
work themselves out and unless you're
like really desperate to check this
stuff out there's really
no lost time and like waiting a couple
weeks nope I think you're right
all right that's a perfect place to land
for the day then you want to bring us
home sure
all right the 359 is available on iTunes
