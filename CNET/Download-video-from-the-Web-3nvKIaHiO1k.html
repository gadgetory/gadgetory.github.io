you're watching this video you probably
spend plenty of time on video sites like
YouTube too so much so in fact that you
might have some favorite videos you want
to download for repeated viewing in my
case and for anyone else who creates
videos I want to read download videos
that I previously uploaded and no longer
have on my drive the legality of doing
this is up in the air as some will argue
that as long as it's for personal use
downloading web videos is okay alright
with that out of the way let's get
started the fastest and most convenient
way to grab video from the net is with a
handy website called keepvid it lets you
download video from YouTube dailymotion
Google Video megavideo metacafe and
Vimeo to use it find the video you want
to download and copy its URL then had to
keep vidcom and paste the URL in the bar
up here now click download and once it's
done thinking decide what file format
you want to save it in flv or flash mp4
or web M are your options if you don't
know which one to pick go with mp4 which
will make it easy to use the file in a
variety of places like your smartphone
now click the link with the format and
video quality you want in my case I'll
take 720p in the mp4 format the video
will start downloading to your computer
when it's done you can watch it right
from your desktop with no advertisements
or transfer it to your phone or mp3
player so you can view it even when
you're offline another option for
Firefox users is the nifty browser
extension called net video hunter it
works with just about any popular video
website including Facebook once you
install the add-on from the Firefox
add-on site a button will be added to
your toolbar to use it just head to the
page with a video and you'll see the net
video button flash letting you know that
there's video that can be downloaded
click the button then download and the
video will be saved it to your downloads
folder for you Chrome users there isn't
really an extension that works as well
as net video hunter you'll have to turn
to keep vid which works great or you can
turn to a dedicated video download
program two options we tested our free
youtube downloader for windows which
only works with youtube or if you're on
a Mac give Mac tubes a try they're both
free and get positive reviews if you
have any questions or run into any other
solutions tweet me or say what's up on
my facebook page for C nut I'm Sharon
