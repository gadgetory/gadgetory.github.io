exactly given to following every
automotive fashion now there is the x6
but in this case they've caught the bug
for the four-door coupe crave that
oxymoronic state of the auto industry
with this the 640 I grand coupe grand
coupe means four doors on what is
otherwise a two-door 6 let's drive the
2013 BMW 640 I grand coupe and of course
check the tech the grand coupe joins
Audi's a7
Mercedes CLS Porsches Panamera and even
a Jag and a VW and answering baby
boomers who want a fastback roofline
without splitting their trousers getting
in the back hence the 4-door coupe
inside no surprises here
BMW standard and excellent tech
including HD radio bluetooth streaming
and a hard drive for media storage
there's Google connected nav with search
on our really wide screen front wall eye
cams go with the standard rear cam
optionally and Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen audio
brings you this pop up acoustic
dispersion lens about that package is
3700 bucks for a scant 250 almost
nothing in BMW terms you can get on
screen Facebook and Twitter support but
through your iPhone only
this first bottle the 640 has one
powertrain choice BMWs well-known 3
litre inline-six
with a twin scroll turbo delivering 315
horsepower and 330 foot-pounds of torque
that moves this 4200 pound car to 60 in
about 5.4 seconds while delivering quite
respectable 20 30 mpg your only choice
on the transmission is an 8-speed
automatic and your only place to put the
power is the rear wheels though BMW
promises a model that uses all four paws
soon
okay let's go for a ride in our grand
coupe remember it's a 640i powertrain
we've seen this before this is nothing
new
a great motor moving a little bit bigger
car a longer car a little more a little
more on the hoof now you can really feel
the fact you've got rear-wheel drive
steering with the accelerator is not
difficult at all the car feels it feels
its weight this is a car that feels like
it's gonna fool you that it's a big car
but a very capable big guy this BMW
eight-speed automatics gonna make some
people blanch but from 95% of buyers
even those who are gonna press this car
a bit like we're doing today it's a good
gearbox it really has good quick shifts
and that great tractability you want in
everyday driving it's a nice blend and
of course being a BMW it feels like a
bank vault dialed together but that's
what you'd expect at this price point
and from this company notice we've got
the for BMW drive modes here they're a
little different on this car if you go
all the way down you get to eco pro
really dials off the responsiveness and
maximizes your economy and then you get
into comfort plus comfort and then you
get your sports setting your soul sports
setting on this car which is Sport Plus
and that also turns off your traction
control and once we do that we really
get to have some fun here in these
corners
okay let's price our 640i grand coupe
not a cheap date at 77 delivered and
that doesn't even include everything I
want you to get to go see that style
that includes premium sound for nine
hundred and fifty bucks but I'm gonna
skip the Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen for 3700 I have
just never heard that much in it then I
want you to go for the driver assistance
package thirty-eight hundred bucks is
going to bring you a head-up display
line spot detection lane departure
warning active Park Assist and those
side and top cameras that doesn't add up
to the right grand coupe for you hang
tight cuz BMW promises a 650 I all wheel
drive version real sense</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
