welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
let's get to the show now the verizon
iphone 4 reviews are in and the overall
consensus is that the verizon iphone
beats out ATT when it comes to making
phone calls and having less dropped
calls you'll get the mobile hotspot and
unlimited data plan for a limited time
but it still has its own drawbacks data
speeds for downloads and uploads were
significantly faster on AT&amp;amp;T overall if
you want to use your phone globally ATT
is a better choice because of its gsm
network support now pre-orders for
verizon customers started thursday but
there's another thing that might make
you think twice according to a PDF memo
that boy genius report found on
verizon's website customers that use an
extraordinary amount of data and fall
within the top five percent may have
their data speeds reduced to ensure that
the majority of customers aren't
affected by the few are you serious I
got two words bad apple now this change
hasn't been turned on at the moment but
it exists and ultimately it's not good
for us also news car launched its daily
newspaper exclusive to the iPad called
the daily it's subscription-based the
first two weeks are free after that it
will cost 99 cents per week or 3999 for
the year but the biggest news from the
event came from Reuters who spotted a
working model of the ipad 2 with a
front-facing camera at the event there
were no pictures taken of it and Apple
decline a comment which clearly means it
exists photos acquired by nine to five
max show let's believe to be the LCD
part for the ipad 2 it's 10 grams
lighter and a millimeter thinner and
that could mean a smaller iPad I just
hope Apple brings back the socks because
the ipad nano ones were way too small
for me what can I say have a big feet
alright let's take a break with a how-to
for sexing up your iPhone signature yep
you heard me right taking away big sexy
hey guys Brian song here with sina com
and if you're bored with the same
generic email signature that's included
on your iOS device I'll show you how to
sex it up a little with the iphone
signature creator now big things to rick
broida for this tip first up go to the
URL that you see below and you can do
this on your iphone ipad the ipod touch
or your computer to create your snazzy
HTML signature you can enter in the
information you want like a friendly
closing or something important like your
name but here's some tips if you want
icons to show up next to your work
mobile and fax numbers leave the label
section blank you also have the ability
to check mark what other services will
appear in your signature that will allow
the recipient of your email to access
things like your Facebook Twitter or
LinkedIn pages so just make sure to
provide the address that directs them to
those profile pages plus you can also
set up your signature so they can call
you through FaceTime and Skype directly
when you're done create a pin number
that you can remember don't make the
same when you use on your ATM card and
then press create signature enter the
pin number on the website that pops up
you'll only have to do it once but this
is really important now before you press
go add this as a bookmark on your home
screen on your iOS device then whenever
you want to send someone an email with a
killer HTML iphone signature you'll be
able to do it with the press of your
home screen icon I'm Brian Tom for cnet
com and that's how you create your
custom signature for iOS devices and
trust me all the ladies will be asking
you about it use it wat hold on guys oh
no I know you like that signature I've
got to tell you my phone is ringing off
the hook after I changed my signature
just saying now we've told you all to
wait out for the next refresh of max
using intel Sandy Bridge processors but
you might have to wait a little longer
after a chipset flaw has caused Intel to
recall them and delay shipment so that
wait for a new macbook is probably going
to be a little longer all right onto the
quick bytes two more verizon tidbits
verizon is reminding their employees and
family members to put customers first
and refrain from buying the iphone for
themselves and that sounds totally fair
if you're the salesperson trying to
communicate the user benefit
of a phone you can't buy and in good
news people who own verizon's pantech 4G
LTE modem should be happy since a
software update now makes it compatible
with macs and we've shown you a preview
of iOS 4.3 in a previous episode that's
only available to developers apple
recently released the third version of
the beta which points to an official
release very soon as in a couple of
weeks very soon and finally to Apple
stores in the New Jersey area will now
be open on Sundays but for non sale
activities like classes and trainings
due to long-standing blue laws that's
set aside a day for religious observance
the only drawback is that its employees
now have one less day in the week for
their gym tan and laundry this poem huh
huh alright that's going to do it for
this week's show send us your emails to
the apple byte at cnet com I'm Brian Tom
thanks for watching and we'll see you
guys next week for another bite of the
Apple
