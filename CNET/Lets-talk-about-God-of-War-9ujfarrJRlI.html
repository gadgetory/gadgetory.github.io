question we've got Dan Reichert here -
hello
we just started just give us like 20
it's quick question but that's funny but
no it's not which just give us 20
minutes just yeah just get a coffee get
another coffee hey what's going on
everybody it's time for quick question
I'm here with Dan Reicher from Giant
Bomb that's me I'm Dan how are you Jeff
I'm great thank you for joining me of
course
okay great to work with you we only get
to work together like one so I know it's
everything out more everything in
moderation is what I say yes we're
talking all about God of War we're
taking your questions we've got a lot to
answer let's get right into it if I'm
big into combat in the vein of Devil May
Cry Bayonetta and or the old god of wars
is this combat gonna do it for me it
looks really toned down so I'm unsure
well question it is a good series about
that too because it is a different game
it is not that sort of like isometric
god of war of scrolling you know that so
you're not gonna be getting like some
like you know Devil May Cry
super-stylish you know action rating I
think you know Devil May Cry those games
are over-the-top sort of action II very
focused on combos and pulling off moves
and stuff like that God of War has that
it makes it easier to do those combos it
is a more accessible action game in my
opinion but the perspective in which you
play it is sort of third-person where
it's grounded and you're sort of not
watching it from the view point of view
of the first three games right so I
think it is a different sort of
aesthetic that will take you some time
to get used to but at the same time you
know I think it's a going to be a
satisfying evolution of that judging
from what I've played Nate wants to know
what's the weapon variety like is there
any and do you get to meet Loki well
here's how it works the part I played
you only have that axe and melee that's
not to say there's I would imagine more
weapons going to be in this game but I
just played
some AK stuff and some melee fist
fighting stuff and you get a shield and
you kind of like hit people with the
shields so no indication him like the
blades of chaos do they touch on that or
like did he lose I didn't see it in my
gameplay I would be surprised that they
don't show up in this game the iconic
there and pretty great I mean those
weapons are fantastic I would imagine
they show up Ken is asking more about
the Sun is he helpful annoying useful in
this game I can answer that real quick
from what I played he seems pretty
useful he's good at like distracting I
didn't get to do that much in terms of
controlling him but it seems like that
relationship that you have with him will
evolve in terms of how useful you during
combat so from what I played seems
pretty cool Brook takus wants to know on
a scale of 9 to 10 how angry is Kratos
well
Kratos if I'm dealing with 9 or 10 in
this one he feels like a 9 really yeah
like if he's toned him down they told
him that a little bit of a simmering
internal rage the whole opening is him
having moments with his kid so it's not
like he's 10 out of the gate I mean I'm
sure he gets the 10 two hours into the
thing I mean I played a part where he
was a solid 10 blitz rules 240 hey Jeff
and Dan if Kratos was a chef what do you
think his specialty would be and would
you eat at his restaurant
I absolutely would yeah my diet is
largely just meat and cheese but I
wouldn't trust creators to the cheese
part really he could figure it out you
just just throw it on the meat but it
would be a lot of meat from things he
slaughtered like centaur yes I think
this would undeniably be a carnivorous
restaurant yes but I feel like
everything would just be undercooked why
I just don't see quite a lady
yes flames yeah but I don't think
criticism the time to check the meat he
seems like he's in a rush I don't think
he's checking the temperature we're all
gonna get sick darkbeat asks do you
think the father-son dynamic is going to
work as well as the father/daughter
dynamic did in games like Walking Dead
and last of us well The Walking Dead was
a shitty game and I think that God of
War will be a good game so I hope that
it's different in that way
but I I am worried maybe not worried
because I trust this team but I just
don't want him to get in the way of
stuff likely well I just don't want to
have to I don't want this to be an
escort mission you know I don't want the
resume before I want this to be more
like Last of Us from what I've played of
the new one there will be some of that
where the kid he'll sort of be like Oh
didn't look like you got stomped by a
giant but then he's just sort of like
you know squirreling his way through you
don't have a life bar not what I played
okay you can love sort of tell him to
shoot arrows at stuff and bosses but
yeah from what I played and again that
was just small little slice I don't see
him getting in the way from Tim cross
since Dan is now a Dragonball Z expert
yeah which character in DBZ is Kratos
mostly I think he's a Vegeta in terms of
Vegeta is a man who's very very angry
he's extremely powerful the thing I
think it's a bit different is that
Vegeta gets a little overconfident
sometimes and he thinks he can do this
stuff and he's like god I'm an idiot
whereas the Kratos just kind of gets it
done yeah no I don't think Kratos is
overconfident I think Kratos is the
right level of confidence because he's
the best
portes asks if you were a Greek god
which would you be I had to google Greek
gods because I don't know which ones are
Greek and which ones are nordic or Norse
or whatever only transparent here that's
great I would say my first guess before
I did any research would be Zeus because
then anything where you can choose
between powers I always go with the
lightning God right but then I read
about Hades and he's a king he's very
wealthy and he's got a cool dog with
three heads and I think I'd be a good
Hades
okay you two come off like a good Haiti
I think I'd be really good if you had to
invent a type of God like what would you
be the god of oh boy fast food
you're like the god of trans-fats little
backstory here Dan likes to play pranks
on his dad on YouTube so Shawn Owens
chimes in and asks if Kratos was Dan's
father would Dan attempt to prank him I
don't think so because the reason I'm so
generous with my pranking of my father
is because he's not creative in the
prankster type of way and so
I don't have to worry about retaliation
from him and also he's a weak man and
would never be able to take me in a
fight we've had a couple post bar times
where we've tested this and really it's
wind it very quickly you guys have had
like actual fistfights not like just
like yeah but like I get winded headlock
media yeah I have one every time and
Kratos I think I don't think he would
find the humor yeah and the pranks and
also he could very much retaliate
against me Kratos is the kind of dad
that when you hear the garage door
opening you really get nervous and
scared like oh I'm in trouble
mine's the type of dad where if he hears
me open the garage door he complains
about the air conditioner Oh get it
different they're two two different
types of dads got it at grim reapers
what's better
NIC cages lord of war or Sony's God of
War
I like Lord of war a lot it's a good
movie but just by the sheer fact that
one has Jared Leto in it and one doesn't
I gotta go with one that doesn't have
Jared Leto got it worse better sounds
like Dan really likes Jared Leto he's a
stupid bad person boy all right that's
gonna do it for us Dan Reicher thank you
