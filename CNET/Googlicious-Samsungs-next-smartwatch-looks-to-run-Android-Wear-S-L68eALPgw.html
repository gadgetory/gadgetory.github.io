welcome to Google ishes for all the
Google goodness that we can pack inside
of a show each week let's get to it in
this week amazon takes center stage with
their big announcement on wednesday now
they first t is the event with an open
invitation to the public and journalists
with this video that's a pretty damn
intuitive that's really cool I would use
that a lot it's really cool that's
fantastic doctor give this back and we'd
agree after our video team analyzed
everything and realized everyone was
playing with the wobble app okay well
not really but all signs point to Amazon
revealing their first-ever android-based
smartphone with a 4.7 inch display and
glasses-free 3d display that uses for
front-facing cameras with one on each
corner that will facilitate a 3d effect
tracking the users face and eyes in
relationship to the phone's display now
the phone is expected to take advantage
of this as much as possible using the
effects in special lock screen
wallpapers icons the user interface and
even in their Maps application so to
tease the event even further they mailed
out Jeff bezos's favorite childhood book
mr. pines purple house and it's all
about the world being a better place by
being different you know people copy his
pine tree his bush so he finally paints
this house purple and uh you know what
I'd like to actually read an excerpt
from this book that really made an
impact on my co workers here at cnet
there are red houses greenhouses brown
houses there's yellow and pink houses
too but there's just one purple house on
Vine Street and that is mr. pines purple
us
so kids it's okay to be different even a
Lizardman different all right back to
the phone and the 3d effect might be
cool and you know it might not be but
what this is building to is Amazon
releasing another hardware product that
will give consumers access to the entire
ecosystem and really this is what this
battle is all about the ecosystem now
Amazon even recently touted that their
own amazon app store has tripled its
number of apps to over 240,000 in the
past year and almost two-thirds of their
developers are getting the same or
better total revenue compared to other
platforms now the phone is also expected
to have its own branded wireless plan
possibly called prime data that will
give users exclusive access to Amazon
Prime content as well so you know what
to do join myself in the crew for cnet
lives coverage on wednesday june the
18th at ten a.m. pacific time and we'll
have all the details from amazon as they
happen just for you alright shifting a
Samsung we told you about their tablet
event last week and Sami delivered two
sizes for their new Galaxy Tab s line up
so let's check out a first look with
david carr knowing hi i'm david carr no
way and i'm here at the launch of the
samsung galaxy tab s this is samsung's
new premium tablet comes in a couple of
different sizes i'm holding the 8.4 inch
model there's also a 10.5 inch model and
samsung is touting its AMOLED display is
a 2560 by 1600 pixel display the price
for these tablets is very similar to
what you see with the iPads this 8.4
inch model is 399 comes with 16
gigabytes of memory along with three
bytes of RAM that memory is expandable
however there's only one configuration
at this time 16 megabytes but you can
add cards up to 128 gigabytes the step
up model the 10.5 inch model is 499 with
that same 16 gigabytes of memory and
three advice of RAM as far as the
processor goes this is an octa-core
processor but it is split in two there
are four processors running at 1.9
gigahertz and for running at one point
three gigahertz for sort of a power
saving mode finally if you're wondering
how
the battery life is with this new
display Samsung is saying it's right
around 11 hours with video that goes for
both the larger and smaller tablets as
you can see this is obviously a slim
tablet if you're wondering how much of
ways the smaller 8.4 inch version comes
in at 10 ounces and the larger 10.5
version comes in at just around one
pound thanks DC now unfortunately the
rumoured 12.2 inch ultra HD tablet that
was in the wild didn't make an
appearance but Samsung has got to do
something about simplifying their tablet
line with our tab for their tab pro note
pro and note 2014 edition and now the
tab best lines with different sizes for
each of them is a little ridiculous all
right sticking with the Korean giant
according to The Wall Street Journal
nuance communications and Samsung have
held acquisition talks exploring the
possibility of a sale nuances believed
to be powering the back end for Apple's
Siri and they also partnered with
Samsung for voice recognition on its
galaxy gear smartwatch and note 3
product lines as Samsung continues to
move further away from Android with its
own Tizen OS getting their own voice
recognition platform would be smart and
it could also hurt their competitors so
just follow along with the trail here
but Apple's Siri was originally based on
vlingo that nuance has acquired since
then and if Samsung grabs nuance then it
could be a sign of trouble for Apple
Siri but right now all of this is still
speculation all right Samson continues
to push out every kind of SmartWatch
possible and Sami today has found FCC
tests as evidence that Samsung is
looking to bring its gear branded
SmartWatch running Android wear very
soon the FCC documents reveal a watch
that's 10 millimeters shorter than the
current gear 2 samsung also recently
filed for a trademark for galaxy we're
suggesting this device might be made for
google smartwatch OS and n a follow-up
to google's april fools prank where they
encourage people to collect all 151
Pokemon all over the world on Google
Maps well the googs has issued a letter
of congratulations certifying their
success with a set of business cards
labeling them a Pokemon master at
incorporated and it's just another dream
of mine never realized because I had a
life outside of spending hours on Google
Maps looking for Pokemon alright that's
going to do it for this we show email us
at Google licious at cnet com or tweet
me at brian Tong thanks so much for
watching and we'll see you guys next
week for some more of that Google Isha's
you delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
