a sir has a new gaming laptop called the
predator 21 X with a 21 inch curved
display and get this it's $9,000 what do
you get for your 9 brand do Nvidia 1080
graphics cards high end processor plenty
of RAM and storage and a dragon not sure
what you do if you don't want the dragon
but you do get this big curved screen
which has a deeper curve than even curve
big screen TVs now the screens not
especially high res just 2560 by 1080
but once you get up close and personal
it's a really immersive experience and
games play fantastically since ace are
treated this like a testing lab to try
out all kinds of crazy ideas there are a
lot of cool extras as well the touchpad
pops off and flips over to become a
number pad there's a magnetic wrist rest
if you need it it includes something
called toby eye tracking which
translates eyeball movement into select
games
it makes for a cool demo but I found it
kind of distracting
the Acer predator 21x is a beast to look
around it weighs eighteen and a half
pounds 26 if you include the two massive
power bricks you need to run it that's
why I'm glad it comes with its own giant
rolling suitcase you know for when you
really really want to make an impression
in a meeting or at the coffee shop
