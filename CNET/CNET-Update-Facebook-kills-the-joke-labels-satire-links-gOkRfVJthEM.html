us what satire is I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update Motorola wanted
us to wait a few more weeks to learn
about the details of its highly
anticipated moto 360 SmartWatch but
there's been a change of plans best
buy's website just spilled the beans
early by posting the price and details
oopsie we already knew this SmartWatch
runs Android but best buy site revealed
a little more about what makes it tick
according to best buy it will cost 250
dollars that's fifty dollars more than
samsung's new gear live model and twenty
dollars more than LG's new G watch the
screen is a backlit LCD touchscreen
that's about one and a half inches it
has Gorilla Glass 3 to protect it from
scratches and breaks it's
voice-activated with an optical heart
rate monitor pedometer and it has
bluetooth 4.0 it'll work with most
phones and tablets that run Android 4.3
but there are still some secrets
unanswered including when does it go on
sale Motorola will reveal the SmartWatch
at an event on September fourth now you
may have noticed a few changes recently
in your social media feeds for starters
facebook doesn't think we understand
humor articles so it has begun labeling
articles from the onion as satire the
satire tag was first reported by ARS
technica and it shows up on the related
stories that appear once you click on a
post gee thanks Facebook for spoiling
the fun of watching people fall for fake
news articles in a statement to the
press facebook says it's doing this
because it was getting complaints from
users who felt it was hard to tell apart
real news from the onion and over at
Twitter the network is changing some of
the fundamentals of how sharing works
when some people mark a tweet as a
favorite it's showing up in others feeds
the same way as a retweet so I would
Twitter make a favorite the same thing
as a retweet because Twitter is
desperate for you to discover new people
to follow if your Windows computer is
crashing and flashing that
so comforting blue screen of death it
could be microsoft's fault Microsoft's
latest Windows security patch is causing
some computers to crash and several days
after its release Microsoft has pulled
the August update and it's recommending
that users uninstall this update it was
supposed to protect users with security
updates and bug fixes but instead it
just created a bigger headache if you
want to attempt to fix it yourself
Microsoft did post a walkthrough but it
does require you to do some tinkering
with files that your tech news update
you can find more details on these
stories on my blog post at cnet com from
our studios in New York I'm Bridget
