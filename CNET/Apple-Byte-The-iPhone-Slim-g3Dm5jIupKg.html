the Apple buy for the good stuff the bad
stuff all of it inside the world of
Apple plus we will announce our winners
from our contest now if you guys are
hungry for more iPhone news and rumors
this week's show is for you even if the
phones expected announcement is over a
month away now the latest news is that
Apple's new iPhone is expected to be 18
percent thinner not officially confirmed
but expected that's after rumors cite
Apple Pro took measurements of the
leaked enclosures for the purported next
iPhone now the enclosure was measured at
seven point six millimeters thick
compared to the iPhone 4s is thickness
of nine point three millimeters and
trust me every millimeter counts now
they point out that Apple has been able
to reduce the thickness
thanks to modifications like an
elongated design with a bigger screen
the relocation of the headphone jack to
the bottom the use of the new nano SIM
card tray that takes up 40% less space
and the more compact MagSafe style dock
connector now website etrade also put
their calipers to work and found the
front glass piece was 0.1 millimeters
thinner as well the overall dimensions
of the phone measured were also found to
pretty much match the leaked schematics
that were discovered in June now Apple
also released the fourth beta of iOS 6
out to developers this week which has
helped to offer even more clues with
tweaks to the iOS simulator 9 to 5 Mac
found that iOS 6 is capable of
automatically scaling its home screen to
fit a taller 11 36 by 640 display more
interesting is that changing it to any
other resolution will not correctly
display five rows of icons so there's
definitely something specific about the
resolution that Apple has been working
with now iOS 6 will also no longer
include the YouTube app that's been a
staple of iowa's and they've removed it
from the fourth beta as well Apple says
their license agreement with YouTube had
ended YouTube is expected to be working
on their own app but it's a clear sign
that Google and Apple are moving further
and further away from each other now
everyone is still talking about the new
dock connection and inside of the iOS 6
code a new hardware feature is
referenced as
9 pin which could point to the smaller
dock connector but that's still up in
the air after reports of a 19 pin and
eight pin connector from other rumor
sites plus I more which first claimed a
smaller dock connector was coming now
says that the miniaturized dock
connector is coming to all of the iOS
devices and will implement it as early
as September 12th with the new iPhone
iPod Touch and nanos the rumored 7 inch
iPad Mini you can choose to believe this
guy's also there including an updated
version of the current nine point seven
inch iPad and that's why we call some of
these stories rumors alright let's get
to some actual news and some tidbits
that have come from the ongoing trial
between Apple and Samsung the big a
continues to plead its case that Samsung
went as far as even lifting their icons
from their iPhone and iPad now they
provided evidence comparing icons that
use the same colors or similar graphics
so here's a look at Samsung's music
player icon that yeah it kind of looks
like an iTunes logo the contacts at
totally different color totally now the
photo icon are you sure that's a
sunflower in both icons yeah I'm pretty
sure it is maybe notes let's look at
that well the page is turning there on
all of Samsung's so that's different and
settings yeah I always think of gears
whenever I think of settings and the
phone icon
okay Samsung really shouldn't have done
that
now the quote of the trial came from
Apple's first expert witness industrial
designer Peter Bressler when he was
pressed multiple times over the width of
the side margin between an apple and
Samsung device Bressler said you're
asking me to compare peanut butter to
Turkey
yep that's the kind of testimony we're
getting here so it's Apple the peanut
butter that sweet and sticky treat that
sticks to the roof your mouth I also
know dogs like peanut butter a lot like
a lot now why can't a Palance am song
just get along I've seen a peanut butter
turkey sandwich before so I know it's
possible and yes this trial continues
alright other nuggets from the trial
include Scott forestalls testimony where
he revealed content chief Eddy Cue was
pushing for a 7-inch iPad by January
2011 internal emails show that Steve
Jobs seemed receptive to the idea in
those recent times and
rumors about 7-inch iPads picked up
shortly after that also in Patten news
and a peek into the possible future the
gadget discovered a newly filed patent
application from Apple showing off a
significantly enhanced iPad Smart Cover
that could include features like a
secondary display on the inside with
embedded solar power cells a keyboard on
the inside like the Microsoft Surface or
even the ability to control your music
and change tracks on the backside of the
Smart Cover when it's being used as a
stand which seems like the most
realistic one to me there are some
really cool ideas here but again it
remains to be seen if any of these ideas
will be implemented I'll write to the
quick bytes Google is planning to roll
out its new version of Google search for
the iPhone in the near future and it
brings natural language voice search to
the app and asks for things like weather
mapping info information about people
and more it uses the same engine as or
Google now product does and it's worth
checking out for those of you who don't
have a 4s or really if you just don't
care for Siri and after harsh criticism
from the public and media Apple has
taken down those uninspiring non iconic
crapple genius ads from circulation on
TV they're really really bad Apple
worthy now the big a said the ads were
only intended for the first run during
the Olympics so just for the weekend
right
sure guys and the iPhone isn't coming in
September all right let's get to our
