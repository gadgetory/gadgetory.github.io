augmented reality whether it's Google
and their new glasses or HP and a little
company they bought recently named
Aurasma I took a tour around San
Francisco with aurasma to see how
they're inventing new ways for you and I
to see the world a little differently
essentially what we can do is take our
phones our tablet computers and point at
a photograph an image and object you be
out in the real world it can be a
sculpture and bring it to digital life
what use first see there's just so much
more than meets the eye that is super
cool can we do it again yep it's so
adorable you know that rocket looks kind
of lame let's just sitting there there
are a bunch of those around San
Francisco there are give me some
spoilers whatever other well we're gonna
go see some more you didn't even know
this guy was in here behind the scenes
the software on your phone or tablet is
using increasingly impressive image
recognition technology to identify real
world objects and then overlay that with
digital content it's like the new QR
code basically you don't need to put
that black and white square on your
thing you can actually just have the
image as it is recognized it and then
bring you to whatever digital content
you want to play like me here I don't
die don't die okay ready yeah
Oh
haha i survived the Thundercats now it's
still pretty early in the augmented
reality game but the possibilities seem
endless as long as we're all willing to
walk around like this
look he almost swiped our guy Qualcomm's
hbu Fauria is also experimenting with
augmented reality from games to
advertising to movie tie-ins and I have
to admit it was pretty fun walking
around and seeing iron man appear in the
most random of places so iron man is
tagged here but you could have him
anywhere yes so within the app we've got
a library of images and objects and
characters that you can create and put
anywhere you want in the world it's up
to you to put it wherever you want so
here you come there we go oh yes guys
right there man looking around see now
this too is a vision of the future the
part where people walk by us and we're
staring at the phone feet long I realize
what they're missing out us do big iron
man's words he's pretty ripped in that
suit I love this new world overall I
gotta say the tech is pretty cool but I
can't help thinking it would be even
more awesome with those google glasses
some contacts or dare I say it I
implants right now it's using the
smartphone to the tablets to get you
there we see ourselves with with some
sort of glasses or contacts that sort of
thing yeah where you're truly
interacting and play actually ya know
it's a little scary but hey I'm like I
always want to find the plan I'm ready
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
