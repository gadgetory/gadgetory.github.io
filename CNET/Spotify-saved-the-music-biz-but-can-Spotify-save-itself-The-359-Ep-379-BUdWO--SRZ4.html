I'm Joni sauceman Spotify is rolling out
its much-anticipated IPO today a big
milestone for the world's biggest music
streaming service okay but we're not a
business publication so why is this
important Joan well it's important
because I mean for any tech company
going public is like the milestone of
adulthood it shows that you've sort of
come into your own it's a great position
to look at Spotify his role in the world
which is that it's not single-handedly
but been most instrumental in making the
music business not be declining anymore
it's the last two years have been the
best growth that it's had basically
since built for the music industry for
the music industry for the recording
industry but the downside of that is
Spotify basically just shoveling money
to the music industry and not making any
profit right there currently
unprofitable very unprofitable they're
like Amazon level unprofitable Wow yeah
that that existed for a long time I
think I remember from your story you
said about 70 cents of every dollar more
than more than 70 cents of every dollar
they bring in they hand back to the
music and disgustin royalties Justin
royalty yes Justin licensing so what is
there a way for them to get to
profitability yeah so um there's two
possible ways one is that Spotify
already the biggest streaming music
service by subscribers and by just plain
listeners becomes even bigger so big
that it can essentially force the music
industry to lower how much they get paid
right so it's a scale play the scale
play or you know some people that I
talked to you said there's also the
opportunity for Spotify to broaden what
it does outside of just music that comes
with all those Royals he's a kid it's
and it's talking about going into it
already is in video and doing more of
that
getting into spoken word stuff like
podcasts um maybe like getting into like
StubHub business perfect and alive
events you could get in that's you know
one of the analyst I talked to you said
that we're gonna look back at Spotify as
a music listening service and laugh
because like Amazon used to be a
bookstore and now you don't you know you
go to it first that's true you know like
that Spotify could become
an entertainment platform beyond just
music we'll see if that happens yeah I
also wanted to ask you really quickly -
it's got a ton of competitors so how is
it doing against folks like Apple music
Apple obviously makes a ton of money
right well it's doing in terms of how
people on the ground are using products
it has more subscribers than any of its
competitors combined it's next closest
competitor is Apple music and they have
about half as many subscribers um so in
that sense there's not really much
competition just by those numbers but
the difference of course is that Spotify
is all it is like Spotify is just
Spotify Apple as the iPhone it has all
these other things that make the money
now apples been saying that it wants its
services like Apple music to be a bigger
part of its business but really like it
can just lose money on Apple music as
long as it wants sure um who knows spot
if I could continue to lose money as
much as it wants Amazon did it for many
many years let's say yeah next up our
own day and Ackerman said it's time to
break up with VR writing quote virtual
reality may yet become a massive
mainstream head but it's not going to
happen with this generation of tech he
was talking specifically about PC and
console VR not mobile by the way but you
have a different take on this I just
think that if you're saying like to say
the very first version of a pretty new
technology is that hasn't hit mass
appeal yet though the idea that the mass
and the masses need to break up with
this thing that they're not already
trying but it's still super news yeah
it's still super new and it's the first
iteration you know isn't what's going to
get people to fall in love with almost
anything
I would agree though with Dan that there
still are a lot of hurdles to we are
these days he specifies you know moving
around in VR while your tablet is pretty
difficult there's also a lack of games
lack of content last for our tech
enabled series Abrar Alec he D wrote
about new capabilities for prosthetic
limbs like sense of touch definitely
check out that story on CNET if you want
to read more about these stories
them all out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben
thanks for listening okay thanks for
joining us everybody I'm gonna go ahead
and jump back into the chat and see if I
can pull out any good questions and
comments to keep the conversation going
I think we kind of cheated that
prosthetic story I wanted to I want you
guys to expand some more on that because
that was really fascinating yeah there
are it's not enough enough there's never
enough time in four minutes so I just
want to hear more there are a lot of and
I wish we had a bra on to talk about
this but there's just she goes into a
lot of the new technologies that are
coming into prosthetic limbs one of them
that I think is really interesting
specifically is like thought control so
and and this is still fairly new but the
idea of actually being able to move
around your prosthetic limbs with your
with your brainwaves which is pretty
incredible to think about but it's still
pretty early technology yeah yeah the
other one is sense of touch of course
which definitely makes it easier to pick
up a pen or smaller objects and just
makes it more like you know an actual
limb as opposed to a prosthetic right
yeah let's talk about music shall we
from sure enjoy honestly solve this what
is Spotify don't tell me a streaming
service it's not that simple now this is
expanding on exactly what you talked
about just a few minutes ago how would
you brand something like Spotify now
because like you said Amazon was a
bookstore it's not a bookstore anymore
it's a store it is the end-all be-all
incumbent of e-commerce but is it a
bookstore no what what is Spotify now is
that a music hub is it a music networker
I don't know what the right word for it
is and I think part of the reason why
it's hard to come up like with the
lightning bolt light bulb over your head
perfect name for it is because the music
industry this is I mean for since the
dawn of music since like piano pianos
got those like the piano rolls like
that's at the very beginning of
mass-produced music it's all been about
buying and owning you
as long as music has been recorded or
produced it's all about buying and
owning it and you have it and this is a
dramatic change it's a total change and
the idea that you just kind of pay a fee
and you have access to essentially
almost all the music in the world yeah
there's not I don't know if there is a
good word to say like what that what
that is but it's that's and Spotify is
the one that not started it but it's
definitely the one that made it the norm
exemplifies it yeah you to know a lot
more about the music industry that I do
but I probably say correct me if I'm
around here that Napster was really the
big disrupter you know back in the 90s
and since then the music industry has
really been struggling to find its
footing and find like a functional
business model and it seems that Spotify
and streaming services have finally
provided something of that yeah so the
music industry's it's difficulties began
Napster's what exemplified the problems
in the late 90s early 2000s peer-to-peer
peer-to-peer slash piracy the
digitization of music and its ability to
be swapped over the internet the fact
that it started out because the music
industry when I send when I say that I
mean like the major labels they were so
intractable about because they had the
CD and the CD was just like a cash cow
well you had sometimes like one good
song yeah and then just crap yeah no
killer yeah and then you sold it for 16
to 20 dollars forever yeah but you know
like I remember paying that when CDs
first came out and I remember paying
that five years after CDs came out I
didn't know that digitization generally
was the the fact that the music industry
couldn't see that that's how people were
going to want to have their music they
wouldn't want to have to have this
really poor value in a CD anymore
the fact that they were so dead set on
that it said I mean that really kind of
set them on this path that's lasted them
20 years it set them on this path where
there was this you know to music
consumers hated the labels because of
them sued people over digital things and
then when you
buuuut I'm sorry when iTunes happened
that stopped piracy but it didn't help
the music industry from still declining
I mean he went from like sixteen to
twenty dollars for an album to not in a
sense for for the good song or the good
song or if you buy the whole album
that's still like if it's twelve tracks
it's only $12 you know like even if you
do buy the whole album and not just a
single so the last two years in 2015 was
the first time really that music sales
stabilized for the music industry and in
there was a 20 year almost twenty years
yeah
and at this and this this past year is
the first time that there's been
accelerating growth in the music
industry since like 1999 since Bill
Clinton was in office there's another oh
go ahead no no no please there was
another point that I wanted to mention
in the podcast which was I I've heard a
lot of complaints about from from
musicians about YouTube why is YouTube
getting you know crapped on
whereas Spotify is like the golden child
I don't actually understand so that's a
really good question um the reason is
cuz of this thing be called it's called
the value gap and the idea is that the
fundamental difference between how
people use YouTube and how people use
Spotify is that Spotify offers a very
popular subscription or people pay $99
99999 dollars $9.99 bucks a month ten
bucks a month were and that's Spotify
has been very good again about getting
people to pay that much money more
successful than any other company
YouTube is predominantly used because
people go to YouTube
type in what they want to hear and they
listen to it for free and so it's an ad
based versus subscription model between
the two and the ad base model the
YouTube model pays really really really
poorly and so the music industry feels
like that's where this idea of a value
gap comes in they're getting paid very
very little for a ton of listening
whereas on Spotify there's a ton of
listening but they're being paid much
much much right as far as they're
concerned a track is a track like you're
listening to my song right so yeah
that's interesting yeah
unfortunately like we don't like to
think about music it's an art form but
it's also because of digitisation has
become a commodity become an essential
part of a lot of people's day-to-day
yeah and naturally there's a lot of
people in the chat pointing out like
there's a lot of great options to
Spotify you know there are there are no
one's really presenting a fantastic
monetary solution for the industry and
at the very least Spotify still kind of
at the top of the list
yeah Spotify I mean just in terms of
subscribers it's not to say it's the
best streaming music subscription but
it's the one that most people are using
around the world yeah yeah it's
definitely marketed the best I would say
at this point yeah is it is it a
situation where the music industry at
least realizes that it doesn't want to
you know kill the Golden Goose like no
the music industry loves Spotify yeah
now now that they're actually making
money again it's been really bleak in
the music industry for a really long
time so they love Spotify at this point
but it said it's like when I say that
it's it's this like it's a frenemy
situation because they feel a gatekeeper
it's like yeah you know like Best Buy in
Walmart were the ones that were you know
sold the most music in this in in the CD
era and now it's basically Spotify and
so they have this sort of frenemy
situation where Spotify has pulled them
out of the gutter but as the bigger that
one person gets their goal is to have to
pay the music industry less because
otherwise they're never gonna make any
money and in addition to that you know
people talk about as Spotify ever going
to become a label itself like Netflix
like taking the Netflix model like have
original content and in the Spotify
sense it would be original music that
they own I guess they own the the
Masters for and all the rights for but
what's tricky about that is the labels
are actually investors and Spotify like
their own investors would be like you
can't take my business away from me you
know so it's a complicated everything
with music industry is very complicated
and this is no exception there isn't a
lot of brick walls though to stop
Spotify from founding their own label um
I don't think so I don't think there's
anybody on there I don't know actually
if they start sniping artists they would
be burning bridges they could never
rebuild yeah that's the thing they can't
they can't but if they start at their
own kind of up and coming right much
like SoundCloud did SoundCloud kind of
embraced that entire concept of nobody
knows you right let's lean into them and
Spotify looked at possibly buying
SoundCloud and decided against it
yeah I don't know um yeah they have to
they have to keep within the good graces
of the labels for the time being and
that would mean not completely
undermining the labels entire livelihood
one of the other elements that we should
touch on is that Spotify is IPO is
definitely different yeah yeah and
they're probably not gonna make a ton of
money on no money they're not making any
money on this IPO so this whole talk
about unprofitability and potentially
getting more runway so they could keep
the lights on the IPO doesn't solve that
yeah and it's not it their argument is
that it's not even an issue of having
runway and being able to keep the lights
on because they've gotten tons of
funding they're very well funded but you
know Daniel X says it's just weird it's
just very weird nobody definitely nobody
at this scale has ever done what's it's
called a direct listing instead of an
initial public offering and it's the
difference is basically like instead of
having this whole dog and pony show
where they line up particular
institutional investors and having a
bank that's there to make sure that
share the whole thing the shepherd the
whole thing through and also make sure
to make sure that on that today once
your start trading that they can't
plummet from like $20 to $2 that's what
an underwriter does they make sure that
it stays like generally in the not
horrible result zone above the red yeah
because they're not doing that they're
saving some money a little bit of money
not as much as they could potentially
make if they just had an IPO or like a
more traditional a more traditional IPO
yeah and they also we also have no idea
how many shares because what it
basically means is anyone who has shares
and Spotify workers founders investors
they can decide to start selling them or
not and so we have no idea how many
shares are gonna be available to treat
it feels like a potluck we don't know
what we do there is a bank that's
helping Shepherd this this procedure
through a little bit and so they're
going to land
an idea of how much the first trades are
supposed to be but we don't like there's
nobody that's gonna be like we say it's
20 there's somebody saying like we think
it should be $20 a share but there's
nobody being like now that it's 3 maybe
we should do something about that so
people don't think that our company is
dying yeah no no we have known they have
a lot of name recognition so that's
definitely gonna benefit them but you
never really know with an IPO
I remember Facebook had some really
miserable days starting off after the
IPO and a couple years ago and they had
a ton of banks supporting them so yeah
now I think your name have largely
answered this in the past 30 to 60
seconds but imagine Sagi was saying like
explain how they don't make money off
the IPO so yeah so to crystallize that
to make it maybe a little more clear
usually with an initial public offering
a company says all right we've already
given a bunch of shares to our founders
and our employees and our investors what
we're gonna do now is we're going to
tell all those people you can't trade
those shares for like six months but we
are going to invent a pool of new shares
gonna put that in the public market and
then six months later all those people
can start trading those shares - that's
another way that they keep in an IPO
they keep the market for it from like
going all over the place is that there's
a set pool of shares that can trade that
have nothing to do with the shares that
were already created for people before
it went public but in this instance
they're not creating those new shares so
it means that there's no new money being
invented by having shares period it's
all just instead of the people that
already have shares aren't subject to
that lockup period they can start
trading them today as soon as it goes
public but what that means is Spotify
doesn't make any money because it's not
creating new shares and it means that
the number of shares that are in the
market it's not they don't have that
pile that was designated and set and
it's gonna stay stable for six months
it's gonna be just however many shares
Daniel elect decides he wants to trade
how many shares like the programmer that
decides the algorithm for discover
weekly decides he wants to start trading
so yeah that's how it's a difference
between normal and not making money
they're not yeah they're not selling
their own shares
this time around but when they do create
a market for this it means that they
could potentially sell shares later down
the road could we'll see yeah
usually companies don't do that because
other than an IPO I mean they do do that
but they do it very strategically and
carefully because what that means is
you're basically diluting the value of a
share if you create investors generally
don't like it let's create a market for
it yeah music industry is messy
so that's Wall Street let's talk a
little bit of a history lesson here
because there's a really great comment
here from Nick pover Minh we'll get to
that in a second but let's look back so
we talked about how Napster kind of like
undid the threads which actually it's a
fun fun fact
Napster is now subscription-based
service that is a competitor Spotify
very true it's never died and eagle-eye
viewers will know that there were other
peer-to-peer options
prior to Napster but they became the
household names kind of broke the system
we moved on from there and as we talked
about earlier
Apple music iTunes broke the album the
art of the album right by making it more
song based single based and then we
bring up this headline that says spot if
I save the music industry which is
ambiguous at best let's expand on that
for a second because Nick says you know
I don't know everybody that uses Spotify
and as we mentioned a lot of
alternatives do exist out there
Ryan is pointing out like I really am
invested in the Google ecosystem how is
that differ from Spotify like I myself
like Google Play Music I can upload
things that I own that don't exist that
aren't represented and and streaming on
on a Spotify platform but I would argue
that the good thing that spot if I did
for the industry is that they reopen the
availability or the option or the art of
the playlist of the album itself and if
we take a look back I think I read an
article a week or two ago about how 2017
was the best year for physical sales of
music since 2011 and that's based
largely around people wanting to collect
again and people wanting to collect
specifically vinyl yeah one of the
interesting things that last month there
was the latest data about 2017 sales in
the in the recording industry and at
this point physical music CDs
and vinyl our bigger business than
iTunes like more money is spent on that
CDs - yeah still do buy CDs yeah it's a
charter you got you know it's for lack
of a nicer term its its shelf poor well
on the shelves correct me if I'm wrong
here - but that's probably the stuff
that's selling right is the collectible
stuff as opposed to like just one jewel
case stuff that looks really nice yeah I
mean that's why I do still like to buy
vinyl and I sound like such an agent
hipster with that one but it's like
there's something about seeing that
label in your line of sight every single
day records in particular are fun really
fun and pretty art there's art I mean it
feels much less commoditized than a
bunch of ones and zeros that you're
streaming into your headphones now full
disclosure with every record I still buy
these days it gets download code and if
I'm measuring on / / Act activation per
volume I'm listening to the stream a lot
more because that's coming with me in my
pocket I'm out more than I'm in and
until they figure out a way to make a
portable record player noted ooh
then that's the way it's it's gonna work
for a lot of us that are that are active
commuters yeah yeah um I haven't
listened to a record since 70s Ben
wasn't even alive in the seventies he
may seem old but he's not that old I
think my dad used to play records it's
cool that you guys are like big music
people for other people like me I'm like
that's great I don't go way more into
music oh I'm sure I'm sure it's it's to
me i I like hear what you guys say
because I think you also collect records
too right I don't collect them but I
have I have records yeah and you have a
record player the records I have the
device with which to make the music I do
have I know I actually have four records
I know people have records and no player
yes I'm one of the four records in my
house and they're in those urban
outfitter kids so yeah I mean like I
haven't put them up in my house yet but
anyway whatever he just made me yeah
yeah it's just music should always be
fun to an extent and I think Spotify
kind of made it fun well you yeah you
did brought up a great thing that we
haven't talked about which is playlists
which are the most powerful music
every tool right now it seems like
besides just straight searching for what
you want but that's not really discovery
that's knowing what you want to find and
finding it
yeah it I feel like playlists have
they're super super powerful for people
finding music and I think they have
added a little bit more of the art to
and the fun of music it doesn't feel as
an antiseptic you know when somebody's
making and they're like I want to share
it with you I will say this that Spotify
seems to like with its playlists it
seems to actually understand a little
bit more about what type of music I
actually want to listen to whereas when
I used to be more of a pandora listener
I feel like they kind of got the genre
right sort of but not really
so they seem to have like their
algorithm seems to be pretty good as far
as finding music that I'd be interested
in listening to even if it's new that
would be an interesting topic for us to
deep dive into one day and a slow news
day I would love to learn more about how
these algorithms work and we've seen
bits and pieces of them throughout and a
lot of them borrow from each other but
that all this talks ever since music has
existed and and personal recordings have
existed one of the best parts about
music is the art of the mixtape and
that's why I think that that's that's
largely why Spotify has excelled so much
and why you can do similar things in in
Amazon Prime google play music and other
places but Spotify really opened that
door and I think I guess my closing
statement is I think Spotify is less of
a streaming service and becoming largely
more of a social network or a hub yeah
there's definitely a social element to
it people music and social has had a
very it's the path that's littered with
the carcasses of people that have tried
it which is silly because music is such
a community-based thing but I do think
that playlists are kind of the genesis
of how music is becoming more social I
mean how many how many of us had their
AOL Instant Messenger away message as
song lyrics it was a pre-op cut in life
deep cuts in life but if you want I
could really quickly just go over
some of the things that differentiate
the algorithm of Pandora and Spotify I'd
love to I mean I would love to learn
more about all of them see how they all
behave because everyone's like ah this
one's got a better one this is got it
they all learn different things about
using different ways yeah and how they
play off each other and what they look
to because society is an ever-changing
thing and we're getting way too
soapboxing assumed but yeah I would
always be interested to learn more about
how they think like I'm gonna really
love this metal band when I've been
listening to jazz for a straight week
which works for me I mean that's that is
weird
I I couldn't even start to understand
that usually when I listen to something
on Spotify they give me something close
to it
so basically well the thing that that
Brian do that you just mentioned I can't
remember I think that Pandora and
Spotify both I assume they all do it but
one of the things that their algorithms
can do is learn how elastic you are for
surprise in algorithms and what your
suggested so somebody like Brian is
somebody I know Pandora does do this and
I assume Spotify does too they like they
not only do they learn what styles you
like they also learn how much diversity
you like within the music that you're
listening to so if you're somebody maybe
like Ben who's like I love my phone rock
I'd go more bluegrass okay I love
bluegrass and maybe and apparently he
doesn't want to go into folk rock even
though he likes bluegrass and so like
Pandora and Spotify not only they learn
that he likes bluegrass where they also
try to learn the fact that he you know
Ben likes to stay within a pretty small
band of bluegrass whereas Brian might be
like give me my death metal right after
my bluegrass please right they figure
out you're listening patterns yeah I
figure out that you're chaotic yeah
neutral I mean it makes a lot of sense
right but that is kind of cool when you
when you know you explain it that way
yeah yeah so basically pandora what they
do they have this thing called the Music
Genome Project and they have music
experts that listen to every single song
and tag it for like between a dozen and
thirty
different attributes and that's the
basis for which their algorithm
understands that song Spotify does it
more based on this mass this mass amount
of usage and finding patterns within
usage and then Apple music relies more
on it's more of a man-machine mix or
they have more curators and they have
more curated playlists to offer as
discovery tools that are maybe they
definitely have personalized elements
but they're less personalized than
Spotify is for sure cool
so just propose a question before I move
on and we are almost out of time but we
are having a couple requests to move on
to VR which we dance Arianna will take a
few minutes for that but and in closing
statements to end the topic of Spotify
and music who thinks that they might
actually invest in Spotify who's gonna
buy Spotify stock when the time becomes
available may be enlightened we're
obviously barred from doing it that's a
last thing I didn't get I mentioned
about this weird way that Spotify is
doing an IPO is it means that normal
human beings can invest like it doesn't
they didn't do like a roadshow where
they went to all these institutional
investors with the piles of money and
said we want you to consider investing
in us basically if you have like an e
trade account you can start buying it as
easily as somebody at Goldman Sachs
could do it
alright so finishing off who's gonna buy
stock where do we think Spotify is gonna
go next are they're going to work into
hardware are they gonna integrate
themselves in other places are they
gonna start to develop original content
by label start a label sign bands
interested to see where anybody thinks
any of this is worth going for them and
finally are they going to overtake the
mantle as the next great social network
as Facebook sputters and I personally
could only communicate in song lyrics
from you like somebody it'd be hard for
there to be election meddling if we
could only talk in song lyrics Oh we'll
see I don't know those Russian trolls
are pretty good have you listened to
Neil Young but new Young
I don't know Neil Young is that's that's
funny that you bring him up because he's
so anti streaming yeah so anyways let's
talk quickly about VR we only have very
general statements people wondering if
the playstation 5 could be a good place
to revive VR as a lot of their worries
about the playstation 5 already well
there will be a playstation fight or
will it be a playstation 5 for sure but
joan go i don't know about playstation 5
but generally speaking i feel like i
feel like you know we're in the like pre
flip-phone stage of VR right now you
know people talk about how VR has
actually been a technology since like
the 80s or even before it 70s but i mean
really this is the very beginning of
consumer VR and it's only been what two
and a half years has it been that long
since people normal human beings can try
it and see it well since this latest
incarnation of it where it's become more
household more readily as I mean almost
no point in history has there been the
opportunity for normal human beings to
buy and use VR like this and so and it's
not and it's also not going from like a
telephone that you turn or punch and
pick up and talk to you know like the
smartphone had the flip phone as a
runway and had traditional telephony as
runway I feel like we're just this is
like a new kind of interacting with
media and people that we are totally
unaccustomed to and the technology is
clunky and it doesn't work very well but
I also think that like I don't know
saying like it's so over when it hasn't
even started yet
yeah it's it seems premature that's my
take but dance take and I think that in
you're right I think he does make some
really great points that one of the
reasons why it hasn't hit consumer
adoption is because it is really clunky
it's really awkward it's really
expensive
and there aren't a lot of like
motivators there's not a Pokemon go of
yaar yeah there's not something that's
just a massive hit that makes everyone
want to try it
so we're computers in general in the
sixties though and look where we've gone
with that you know it's it's one thing
to say it sensationalized over it's
another to say well it is stale right
now and he's not wrong there we haven't
seen anything astonishingly new happen
about yeah I also think that his I mean
and this is totally valid but
his article came to it from a gamer and
hardware standpoint I don't see I don't
know and I'm and I get to go see
cinematic VR more than anybody like a
normal human being would but I'm always
good I'm always surprised with how
cinematic VR is improving and getting
better
so you're saying right now is maybe more
of an opportunity for VR to embrace not
the home entertainment but the
attraction entertainment the the the
theme park amusement park type
entertainments internet situation maybe
possibly say I think site-specific VR is
really fun if it's done well the only
times that I ever see it being done well
are at film festivals and those are
exclusive things hard to get into an
expensive - yeah you saying it feels
very exclusive still yeah oh yeah it's
definitely very exclusive yeah and I
think the dance totally right that
mobile based VR will likely be the thing
that is separate from his issues I agree
with that's gonna be how most people if
they do decide that they like er it'll
be through a system like that I think it
kind of goes without saying that mobile
based anything is the gateway for most
things days right right we are pretty
much out of time
I like this comment though to call it a
close things out from the eighth cow
which expands into other ideas if they
want VR to become more mainstream they
need to do something for those who wear
glasses wearing VR headsets hurts my
eyes and it's too blurry to read
anything what are some things y'all know
I was gonna say that and I thought it
was crazy I totally agree with that
comment oh yeah absolutely super
annoying to take I wear my glasses in VR
and it's super annoying to take it on
and off I always think they're gonna
pray it's also like and I get annoyed
with this because so many engineers are
men like it's really annoying when like
if I can't wear a headset of my hair if
my hair is up like this like I can't do
it cuz it like won't fit if I have my
hair back if I have it my hair in a
ponytail I have to take it out like
those are things that like predominantly
male engineering forces I don't think
think about and I'll give them some
slack like that's not the primary
problem they need to solve but I do
think these design issues like these are
very simple design issues wearing
glasses having hair that isn't dude hair
even like Brian's arrow like it would
ruin your hair to put on
had said you're very well coughed
nothing ruins his hair not a var said
not nothing no nothing yeah so yeah
that's it for us but I do want to hear
more from people about where they think
get really personal really specific what
do you need out of VR to make it more
worthwhile for you does it hurt your
eyes with glasses is it affect your hair
do you want that do not even know it
into your brain do you not you want it
to be more affordable yeah but yeah
let's sound off in the comments and that
was a great discussion today everybody
we have a lot to go on and then
hopefully we'll expand on these stories
in the near future
oh thanks everyone will say bye for now
who wants to say take us out on the
script I'll do it yeah the 3:59 podcast
