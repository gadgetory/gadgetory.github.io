the new fuel economy leaders but then
McLaren comes out with this the p1 this
is a Cara I first saw as a concept of
last year's Paris Auto Show and then I
expected it would probably just have
MacLaren's 3.8 litre turbocharged v8
that's a really powerful engine and it's
mp4-12c model this car has that but it
also has an electric drive system the
total drive system engine and motor
combined give it 903 horsepower and 664
pound-feet of torque now that's good for
zero to 62 miles per hour in under three
seconds and it has a top speed of 217
miles per hour although McLaren says
they actually electronically limited
that along with those really high speeds
and great acceleration it also can do
really good fuel economy this car will
go 12 miles under electric power at
about 30 miles per hour McLaren says
that's good for if you're in at zero
mission zone inside a city or just
general urban driving where you don't
want to be using all that power hybrid
drive system allows for McLaren cause
it's instant power assist system there's
a little button on the steering wheel
you push that and that gives you all the
power this they can give and that's
where you get your acceleration it also
has what the clarin calls the drag
reduction system
DRS that's a big wing on the back of the
car that's actually an automatic wing
where it'll lift up to provide maximum
downforce if you're racing or it'll
settle back and lessen the downforce if
you just want to get good fuel economy
in better electric range now you won't
see too many of these cars on the roads
because McLaren says they're only
building 375 of them and at a price of
1.3 million dollars each not many people
will be able to afford one
