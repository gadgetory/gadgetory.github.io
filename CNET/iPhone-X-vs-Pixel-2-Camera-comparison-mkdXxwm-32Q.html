Google pixel - and the iPhone tend to go
head-to-head to compare the cameras I
took them to the California Academy of
Sciences in San Francisco all photos
were taken with Auto HDR turned on and
video shot at 4k 30 frames a second both
phones produce really nice photos in
good lighting conditions but the pixels
images are consistently sharper with
more detailed colors on the iPhone can
look more saturated and the automatic
white balance is a bit warmer
Google's hdr+ enhanced mode also makes
photos look more vivid and appears to
boost the dynamic range Apple
popularized portrait mode with the
iPhone 7 plus where the subject looks
sharp compared to the background to get
this effect the iPhone makes a depth map
with the dual cameras and blurs out the
background while the pixel relies on its
single lens and machine learning to make
the blur in daylight both phones do a
good job of defining the subject and
blurring behind but details generally
look sharper on the pixel and the effect
really makes the subject pop and yes in
case you were wondering portrait mode
also works on fish in low-light the
iPhone had a hard time keeping portrait
mode active and kept asking me to turn
on the flash so I missed the effect on
this photo the pixel had no complaints
trying again the iPhone did manage to
take the shot and produced a more
flattering photo even if the exposure is
a little darker than the pixels portrait
mode is also on the front cameras
neither phone does a great job with my
hair but the iPhone has a smoother
transition between the subject in the
background and the warmer color
temperature is also more flattering the
pixel looks like a messy cutout
the second lens on the iPhone gives 2 X
optical zoom while the pixel relies on
digital zoom to get you closer at a
reduced magnification you can't see much
difference between the two but as soon
as you look at Sutra tower you can see
the loss of detail for the pixels
digital zoom at 2x compared to the
optical zoom on the iPhone as for flash
the pixels lights up this cage so much
it washes out the color while the
iPhones photo is much more true to what
it actually look like which brings us to
low-light photos in the aquarium at
reduced magnifications they look pretty
similar but on closer inspection the
pixel just takes the edge on detail it's
also slightly less noise but overall
they're very close both phones can shoot
4k at 30 frames a second for the iPhone
adds 60 frames a second at this
resolution the low-light video the
iPhone looks a lot cleaner and it has a
better exposure overall on the video
image highlights tend to blow out on the
pixel and the shot looks noisy the pixel
uses a combination of electronic and
optical stabilization whereas both of
the iPhones lenses are optically
stabilized while the pixel does show
some of the jello effect it's common
with electronic stabilization it looks
smooth especially if you're moving or
doing a tracking shot the iPhone can
look a bit jerky
at 240 frames a second the pixels only
recording in 720p while the iPhone is at
a full 1080p resolution colors look more
punchy on the iPhone while the pixel
over exposes and loses some detail and
sharpness on the leaves
so which phone comes out on top the
pixel excels at still images if you want
the most detail and sharpness without
extra processing but the iPhones got
optical zoom a better selfie camera and
overall video quality so which one did
you like better the Google pixel - or
the iPhone 10 make sure to leave a
comment below and vote in our poll and
hit me up on Twitter if you have any
questions about the cameras on these two
phones</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
