and it's sideways The Omen X desktop
from HP is one of the boldest PC designs
of the year taking what could be a cool
but not exactly groundbreaking cube
shape and standing it on one edge for a
sharp angular look even though it looks
precariously perched the sand is
actually rock solid now why is this
desktop balanced on one edge it's
actually a pretty brilliant idea that
makes it very easy to access the ports
the drive bays and even the interior of
the system with standard desktop so you
usually have to line them down on their
side or else crawl up next to them on
the floor in the almond texture you just
pop off the side cover and everything's
at a good angle and easy to reach
there's plenty of room for two graphics
cards and even liquid cooling in the
main compartment and that's because this
cube is cut into separate quadrants the
power supply is tucked away in its own
zone and all the hard drives are in a
separate zone and that makes cooling and
cable management much easier the front
lights can be customized with different
colors or to show CPU utilization and
this year is a pretty basic build with
one Nvidia 1080 card but you can get
higher-end configurations or just by the
empty case direct from HP and build it
yourself or if you want something really
high-end with specialty components and a
custom paint job
HP is gonna kick you over to a gaming PC
builder called main gear and they'll
take the basic Omen x case and build you
the very expensive gaming desktop of
your dream</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
