look at the main gear pulse 14 this is
another one of a reasonably long line of
midsize gaming laptops that we've seen
this year we've seen examples I'm
alienware an origin and razor main gear
is another boutique pc maker and it's
really cool ever seen people making
gaming laptops with 13 and 14 inch
screens rather than just two big 17 or
18 inch monsters that were used to of
course there are some trade-offs
involved if you get a system from a
boutique pc maker like main gear or
origin these guys can't make their own
custom bodies from scratch the way
alienware which is owned by del does
they basically is an off-the-shelf body
which is what you see here and they
customize it in this case they do
actually very nice color back of the lid
this has done an automotive paint and
getting different colors it's got some
really great kind of automotive sparkly
detail to it otherwise it looks like a
fairly standard chunky 14-inch laptop
and the keyboard and touchpad are really
not designed for gaming they're hoping
that you're going to hook up an external
mouse maybe plug the whole thing into a
monitor and use your own keyboard with
it as well now this guy configuration
wise it's just under two thousand
dollars where you can get it down to
about 1250 and for the 1250 you still
get the same core i7 CPU and Vidya 760
and graphics card that we have in our
more expensive version which is great
the big let down here however is the
screen it is a 1600 x 900 screen it's
not a full 1920 x 1080 screen which most
of the other mid-size gaming laptops and
all of the larger gaming laptops have
you really do want to be able to play in
full HD in order to do that here you'll
have to do what i did a lot of time
which is taking hdmi output to a larger
monitor and then you hook up a mouse and
a keyboard and you're basically just
using the hardware here if this system
had a better display it loses a lot of
detail and with off axis viewing
although I like that it's kind of a
matte display not overly glossy if you
can get past that display you can
certainly save a couple bucks over some
of these other systems and still got
those high-end components the dense if
you're going to plug it into a monitor
all the time as a standalone gaming
laptop I'd say the 1600 x 900 display
really turn
way off I'm Dan Akron and that is the
main view pulse 14</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
