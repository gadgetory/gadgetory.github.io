Brian Cooley for the longest time a home
security system was something you called
some company to come install paid them a
monthly fee to monitor and hoped you
never used it prudent but not very
satisfying
maybe that's why just about 17% of US
homes even have one and who knows how
many are actively monitored but our
appliance team at CNET's Louisville labs
are awash right now in really
interesting new DIY home security
systems that are connected and go beyond
just intrusion and fire detection making
them interesting see for the first time
get the components in the mail you'll
plug in the base tower here and then
you'll stick up the rest of the
components using the sticky tabs on the
back all the devices communicate
wirelessly to one another so it's a very
nice attractive system you won't have to
drill into your walls we'll have to wire
anything special into your house you can
add additional sensors out of cart if
you want to cover additional doors
windows or have an extra motion sensor
and they also have a carbon monoxide
detector leak detectors freeze detectors
it's got a motion detector it comes to
the panic siren and if you pay 350
instead of $1.99 you get two of these
these motion-detecting cameras that are
capable of switching into night vision
mode so this is a wireless hub designed
to be sort of the central nervous system
for your smart home devices right now
you get philips hue support support for
yale smart locks it's the on devices so
most music systems the app is available
for Android and iOS and it's very easy
to use all in all I think it's a
fantastic value a great entry-level DIY
option and perfect for a smaller home
this whole smart home security trend is
marked by three particular traits
low-cost choice and innovation low-cost
a recent price sheet from a major alarm
company shows they charge several times
as much for each home security module as
you pay for the new DIY gear if that
helps get people over a hurdle that's
keeping them from security tech all the
better choice these new systems are the
sort of thing you can buy now add to
easily later when you have the time and
inclination and tailor your system
readily as your needs change you can
also choose your own monitoring company
or choose to monitor yourself or switch
back and forth innovation the companies
behind this new security tech are
startups or at least operate with that
mentality they embrace online control
interoperability between gear in the
home frequent updates to improve the
product and services that are rich that
probably doesn't sound like your current
alarm company worldwide the home
security market will grow from about 20
billion dollars in 2011 to almost 35
billion in 2017 creating a lot of room
for these new technologies to tell their
story and capture share consumers expect
intelligent personal connected systems
everywhere now without lots of
gatekeepers between them and a better
experience all of this is disrupting the
traditional home monitoring services
industry as they're now competing
head-on with telco and broadband
companies that are new to the market and
all of them are competing with services
that ride over the top of broadband
companies so you've got at least three
layers here what's really needed here as
well is a redefinition of this term home
security to embrace really five areas
security climate control appliance
control lighting and of course
entertainment and if you push back and
look at all that from a higher level you
start to realize we're redefining home
security to mean more peace of mind and
then just crisis intervention and
prevention
