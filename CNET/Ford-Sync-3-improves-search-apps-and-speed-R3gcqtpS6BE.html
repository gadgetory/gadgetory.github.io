look at the car but to look at Ford's
new infotainment system they call sync 3
this is the third generation of their
infotainment system the home screen here
shows me a map on the left side and
information cards on the right audio at
the top phone on the bottom plus I get a
nice menu ribbon along the bottom here
giving me quick access to the major
functions of this system now for a
challenge was to make this system more
responsive than the previous one
so what they've got here is actually a
capacitive touchscreen plus there's a
Texas Instruments OMAP 5 dual core
processor behind the scenes here making
this all work pretty well when I hit the
map side of the screen it opens up the
full map and as you can see it's pretty
responsive it works really well in my
destination screen I get this new search
box here this is pretty cool I can enter
in an address or any sort of search term
and I'll actually search its own point
of interest database and find what I'm
looking for and the cool thing is even
though this is an online search it
actually includes information about a
lot of locations that has stored in here
plus a rating that's pretty cool now
back to my home screen here if I push
this apps button down here I get some
app link apps that are actually
integrated with the system I see glimpse
Pandora and Spotify those are all
actually running on my phone which is
connected to the USB port in the car and
they gives me some audio sources and
glimpse lets me send my like current
location to my friends Ford will be
adding new apps to the system as they
become compatible when I go to my phone
screen here you can see the Siri button
in the upper right-hand corner I can
activate Siri through that or a long
push on the voice command button on the
steering wheel and that will pass
through my voice commands to Siri on my
phone that's plugged into the cars USB
port right now but if I ask Siri for a
destination especially gonna use the
navigation system on the phone not the
one native in here if I just give the
voice command button a short press then
I get my local voice commands that
control this actual system here
you'll be able to get sync 3 in the new
Ford Escape on this 8-inch touchscreen
or in the new Ford Fiesta with a 6.5
inch touchscreen or we'll be ruling the
system out in other models as it updates
them Ford tells me that sometime in the
future that will be offering Android
auto and apple carplay as part of the
system although they haven't specified
when fortunately if you already have the
car
but update it wirelessly you can connect
the car to your home Wi-Fi network and
port will send updates to sync and
update this system so there isn't
anything really revolutionary in the air
nothing that catapults forward ahead of
the competition but it certainly keeps
them up with it it's a good system and I
like what I've seen so far</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
