selling vehicles niche to say the least
yet that's not stopping Mercedes from
going to a very similar look some would
say amazingly similar but this is called
the GL Eve it's part of their new naming
system which doesn't seem any easier to
me just different GL means you've got a
crossover and a means it's mid-size what
we're looking at here though is a coupe
line in fact they call this a coupe even
though it's a four-door SUV call it what
you will it is a completely new model
that takes over where the ml was but
doesn't look like the ML did inside
nothing too surprising in terms of
Mercedes tech it's the latest stuff but
notice how they've taken the screen now
and sort of not put it on top of the
dash nor in the dash but kind of split
the difference kind of on top of in the
middle of the dash and in front of it
the controller is the familiar now
command knob but also with the
handwriting and touch recognition pad
that sits in the arc above it now note
this is the GL e coupe it would be a
more conventional GL e crossover
virtually the same but different lines
coming out of the New York show you for
2015 now under the hood you're gonna
find three power plants one is in the GL
450 AMG that's not a true AMG there is
the GL 63 which is a real AMG with a
twin-turbo v8 to me 577 horse and then
behind me here you see the GLA 350 D
diesel comes out summer of 15 we'll get
pricing closer to them
