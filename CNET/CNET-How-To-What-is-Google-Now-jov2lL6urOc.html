on Android jellybean they're discovering
a new built-in feature called Google now
it's not a Siri competitor and it's also
not some revamped version of Google
Voice actions instead Google now is a
built-in assistant that gives you quick
answers to voiced questions it also
tries to predict what data you want
based on your search history remember
this is only available in jellybean
devices so if you have one just swipe up
from the bottom of any screen to access
Google now at the top is your standard
Google search bar except with Google now
you can search with your voice if you're
already familiar with Google search
shortcuts these voice commands will come
easy to you first I'll say Google to
activate the search then whatever I want
to search for Google define Sparkle I
get the definition and it's read out
loud to me sparkle shine brightly with
flashes of light to search again press
the microphone icon and say something
like 40 degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit
and that conversion will show up right
away if I ask for images of the Eiffel
Tower
Google now will take me straight to the
image results if you search for a sports
team you'll get the latest score and
upcoming schedules so I can say San
Francisco Giants the Giants beat the
Padres 7 to 1 they are playing the
Padres today at 7:15 p.m. and there's
all that info the more you search the
smarter Google now will get in fact
Google now will begin to predict the
info it thinks you want before you even
ask for it back in the main screen
you'll see cards show up below the
search bar they're filled with at a
glance information like schedules for
public transportation and the local
weather one of my favorite cards is the
one that shows traffic data for your
commute to and from work to make the
most of this feature be sure to set your
home and work locations by selecting
edit from the pop-up menu
that card and entering the appropriate
address you can also manually define
your home and work locations like this
open up the latitude app and find your
location then tap your name then tap
location history from here you'll be
asked to get permission for Google to
track your location when you do go to
change home location or change work
location
yeah it's creepy and you might not like
it so skip this if you'd rather not have
Google tracking your whereabouts you can
edit the settings for any given card by
tapping the three dots in the corner to
pull up the menu the settings options
vary from card to card so check out each
one and tweak them to your liking you
can also disable a card by turning it
off at the upper right of its settings
menu
if cards aren't showing up when you do
things like search for a flight or a
sports team there's a good chance it's
because you have Google web history
disabled in order for Google now to work
at full capacity you have to enable web
history this is a huge bummer for people
who don't want the goob tracking their
activity but if you're willing to
sacrifice that go to Google now and
scroll down to settings from there tap
privacy and accounts then check show
recent searches and then hit manage web
history from here your browser will
launch you'll have to sign in and
finally when you get to this web history
screen tap resume without enabled Google
now will use your search history to give
you custom cards Air Canada 4479 from
San Francisco to Boise is on time and
departs in 35 minutes so those are just
a few tips to help you get started with
Google now just remember that the more
you use it the smarter you'll get and
the more accurate those cards will be
also check out the full list of voice
search commands on my how-to blog and
tweet me with any other tips you
discover for CNET I'm Sharon Vaknin
