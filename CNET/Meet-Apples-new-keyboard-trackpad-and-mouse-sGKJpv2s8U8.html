accessories I'm Dan Ackerman and we're
here taking a very quick look at the new
magic keyboard Magic Trackpad 2 and
Magic Mouse 2 from Apple I've got apples
pneumatic accessories lined up with the
old versions you can see the difference
the biggest thing is course is that
they're getting ridley disposable
batteries you have to put in there and
that lets them be rechargeable connect
by a lightning to your backhand and
actually sync that way and also lose
these sort of big cylindrical battery
containers they used to have so the
keyboard used to have this big thing
right here we have to slip in your
batteries now the new keyboard is flat a
little bit of a wedge shape there the
key faces are actually slightly larger
Apple says that it's about 13% smaller
in terms of the desktop footprint the
mouse is pretty much the same it's a
tiny bit lighter and the little rubber
runners on the bottom have been cleaned
up just a tiny bit of doing that the
only real Mouse changes that again no
more batteries lightning connector right
there I think the real star of the show
however is the Magic Trackpad
2 now I've used a Magic Trackpad for
years and again it's got this
cylindrical battery compartment here
still work perfectly fine the new
version ditches that silver color now
it's kind of a white / off-white it gets
rid of the battery compartment so again
it lies flat a little bit of a wedge
shape lightning connector right there
just like everything else and a much
larger surface area Apple says that's 29
percent bigger and besides this having
more fingers to do all your multi-touch
gestures it supports force touch which
is the new touchpad technology found in
a bunch of the Mac books and even in the
iPhone and the Apple watch and that
means that on the computer version you
you click once and these kind of four
sensors here sense that you're clicking
give you a little bit of haptic feedback
as opposed to sort of a diving board
hinge and you press harder you get a
second perceived click that gives you
contextual information a definition for
a word a preview of a file or even Apple
map directions if you do that on an
address so if you're looking to give
your Mac a facelift you don't have to
get a new one you can just get these new
accessories and add it on there it's $99
for the new
keyboards 79 for the mouse and 129 a
little bit more expensive guess for the
Magic Trackpad - I'm Dan Ackerman taking
a quick look at Apple's new Mac
