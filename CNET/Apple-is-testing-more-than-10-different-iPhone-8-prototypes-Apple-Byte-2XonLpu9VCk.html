and welcome to the Apple buy for
everything good and bad inside the world
of Apple now if you guessed I was in
Hawaii last week you were correct but
other people swore it was Haiti or
Hitachi the company of Japan or even
Hungary with an AI now let's get to the
show and for all of you waiting for air
pods to come out we might actually see
them before the end of the year after an
email by a MacRumors reader asked Tim
Cook about them now cook responded with
sorry for the delay we are finalizing
them and I anticipate we will begin to
ship over the next few weeks now the
email has been confirmed to originate
from Apple's corporate servers these
emails can potentially be faked but
Apple did not respond to any of our
follow ups now will they make it in time
for the holiday season come on Apple air
pause 2016 let's make iPhones great
again
there's also lots of iPhone food stories
flying around this week a Wall Street
Journal report jumps on board with other
rumors that a curved OLED display iPhone
could come as soon as next year and
let's be honest it needs to be something
special for its 10th anniversary phone
to bring back excitement to a brand
that's honestly lost some of its mojo
now the report says the OLED model would
come with a higher price tag because
they're more expensive to produce but
Apple might not even decide to release
the model because it's one of more than
10 prototypes being considered so then I
saw all these clickbait headlines
claiming the iPhone 8 has 10 prototypes
see the casual audience aka Facebook
they just didn't know what to do with
themselves when they heard that but in
other related news Apple is working on
extras iPhone like they do every year
alright Apple is also asked suppliers to
increase their output of the OLED
displays in anticipation for next year's
model Samsung will most likely be the
primary OLED supplier in 2017 other
manufacturers just aren't able to
provide the amount of inventory needed
but the hope is sharp LG Display and
Japan display will be able to help out
in 2018 as it stands now rumor reports
still believe there will be three new
iPhones next year two LCD based iPhones
with the current 4.7 and 5.5 inch screen
sizes and a flagship OLED display model
with a screen size somewhere between 5.1
and 5.2 inches and a flagship OLED
display model with a screen size
somewhere between 5.1 and 5.2 inches
with all three models rumored to add
wireless charging and a rear glass
backing ok a recent Apple patent granted
to them reveals the company has been
actively looking at a iPhone with a full
screen foldable display the design would
require a flexible metal support
structure on the back of an OLED display
that could be folded in half to fit in
your pocket it's kind of a throwback to
clamshell cell phones from the 90s
shout out to the Motorola RAZR or what
NFL quarterback Andrew Luck would call
his current cell phone see that picture
was taken in August of 2016
come on Andrew that's a bad apple
or we could have called that bad luck
okay examples of the patent even show
the phone design folded to protect the
screen or flipped around and folded the
opposite way to expose the screen
completely the patent was first filed
for in July of 2014 I don't expect to
see this design yet but there really is
some old-school charm to it and if
you're thirsty for more iPad views a new
report from a co Takara says the new
rumored 10-point 9 inch iPad will have
the same footprint as the current nine
point seven inch iPad with smaller
bezels the report also suggests Apple
will replace the physical home button
and embed it directly onto the screen
and the new iPad might be the first
product we see this rumor tech even
before the iPhone 8 it also says the new
10-point 9 inch models thickness will
increase to 7.5 millimeters and the
larger 12 point 9 inch iPad pro will see
an increase of 3 millimeters then the
standard nine point seven inch iPad will
still remain to serve education and
enterprise markets oled displays are
still not expected for the ipad lineup
in 2017 and won't make it in there until
2018 but we're expecting this new lineup
in the first half of next year and
remember we told you last week that
Apple was discontinuing its line of
airport wireless routers that's not
expected to change but you know
sometimes timing can be cruel Apple beat
out all other vendors you can see the
breakdown here and it was the only
company to receive a five star power
circle consumer rating which places it
amongst the best timing sucks and you
know what that's just a sad Apple and in
arguably the best news this week Netflix
will now allow you to download shows and
movies from the service to view offline
for no additional cost so update the iOS
and Android app and you can click on the
download icon that allows you to watch
it without an internet connection this
doesn't apply to everything on that
flicks right now really its most Netflix
shows that are available but plans are
to continue to roll it out and it makes
the service even better
alright that's gonna do it for this
week's show you can email us at the
Apple bite at cnet.com or tweet me at
brian tong thanks so much for watching
we'll catch you all next time for
another bite of the</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
