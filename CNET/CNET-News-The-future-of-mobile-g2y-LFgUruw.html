future of series where we talk about the
big companies and trends to look out for
in 2013 and i'm here with executive
editor roger cheng who follows the
mobile industry very closely so let's
talk about what we can expect in cell
phones and mobile next year we have two
companies that are hoping for a success
story you have microsoft with the
windows phone 8 and research in motion
with blackberry 10 do you think any of
those two can really make traction next
year have some good news well both of
them are putting a lot of energy a lot
of resources behind try to create this
breakout hit but to be honest I think
for next year none of them are going to
really make a real impact I think
they're both going to do well enough to
keep going to survive but you're not
going to see any kind of breakout hit
either from blackberry 10 or Windows
Phone 8 hmm well one that could maybe
spice things up is t-mobile they're
going to get not only the iphone but
they're also going to be offering a new
way to think about paying for your phone
instead of a subsidy you might pay up
front all at once and have a lower data
plan or pay a little now and have these
monthly installments kind of like
layaway how do you think people are
going to respond to that whether it's a
higher price tag upfront fur phone than
they're used to seeing or this layaway
kind of monthly installment plan how are
we going to react a lot of it depends on
how well t-mobile actually communicates
this new plan to its customers this is
actually a better overall plan for
customers in the long term right now
under the current model you pay your two
hundred dollars for an iphone you give a
subsidy but in return you pay a much
higher monthly fee every month to the
life of your contract under this plan
it's sort of it's a bit more transparent
you either pay complete the full price
for the phone which admittedly is high
or you sort of paying monthly
installments but sort of the benefit of
this is you you pay a lower monthly fee
for data voice service text messages and
you do save money in the long run again
the whole point is the whole challenge
is whether our table will can get this
message across to customers right now
it's working a little bit but they
really need to get aggressive with their
messaging
alright here's another question for you
how about mobile payments that's a topic
that seems to go nowhere even Google is
backing it and I don't see any traction
of this picking up it's what I'm
referring to is the ability to just kind
of wave your phone over a cash register
instead of using your wallet to pay you
use your phone is this gonna take off is
it going to go anywhere next year right
like as you said Google other cell phone
carriers the banks there are a lot of
big players that have been pushing
mobile payments is this sort of new
solution for the future unfortunately
that hasn't only happened the problem
has been Apple the iphone 5 did not
include NFC technology which is sort of
the key technology you need to do that
magical waving of the phone to pay at
the register because the iphone 5
doesn't have that it's really sort of a
big hurdle for mobile payments to kind
of get adopted because customers aren't
really going to see this in a kind of
mass way other phones have adopted it
but just magic customers just don't see
the real use in it right now so the only
way for people to get used to the ideas
for Apple to do it I guess unfortunately
yeah i mean iphone has there's so many
iphone users that that's what that's
what it's going to take for mobile
payments to really take off well thanks
Roger for joining us and thank you for
watching our future of series for cnet
