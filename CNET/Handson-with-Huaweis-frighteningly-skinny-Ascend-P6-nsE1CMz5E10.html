is the huawei ascend p6 the first thing
to note about this phone is that it's
super slim it measures just six point 18
millimeters thick making it very slender
indeed it's quite light to weighing
roughly 120 grams so you're hardly
notice it once you slide this into your
jeans pocket the sides are made out of
aluminium as is the back which has this
brushed metal effect and while the p6
looks a lot like the iphone it does
manage to distinguish itself slightly
with this curved casing beneath the
screen build quality meanwhile seems
high this phone feels quite sturdy the
screen measures 4.7 inches and has a
720p resolution which is why all the
on-screen action looks nice and sharp
around the back meanwhile there's an 8
megapixel camera while unusually the
front facing camera is a 5 megapixel
affair that means skype calls all your
carefully pose selfshots should look
nice and crisp inside there's a 1.5
gigahertz quad-core processor powering
everything you also get 2 gigabytes of
RAM an 8 gigabytes of on-board storage
which you can beef up using a microSD
card the p6 is running Android jelly
bean version 4.2 point2 but over the top
you get wale's emotion user interface
the most noticeable difference from
normal android is that there's no app
list so all of your apps live on the
home screen that means fewer button
presses to get to your apps but things
could easily become a bit disorganized
unlike the ascend p2 the p6 doesn't have
4g that means you'll be relegated to 3g
speeds when it comes to downloads and
web browsing it's coming out in July let
me know what you think I'm legrest away
and this is the huawei ascend p6</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
