your host today are Roger tang and I as
act I thanks a lot yeah hey thanks

then he's sprung that on at the last
minute
we're just kind of amazing you don't
appreciate my ability to commit no I I
totally appreciate it
thankful because both of us got lame and
didn't have any concentrating
I didn't realize in retrospect I just
kind of look like the Black Knight from
yeah I was thinking that before I saw
Amazon logo I I thought you're going as
a Black Knight yeah probably should have
that's that's fine
my joke earlier was it there's like a
little scratch on it you could be a
refurb any scratch it would be fine I
was for a second I was worried Brian was
gonna do the whole show of that talking
battle X avoid with the show would laugh
three hours listen I'm just trying to
bring a little funny today sorry I
cannot sorry
constant our next question robotic I
can't help you with that right alright
so what are we talking about the heavy
stuff I know the iPhone 10 reviews are
out we don't have Scott I promise we
will have Scott on to actually talk
about it and bring the iPhone 10 way to
build me up there sorry I'm sorry I said
we've got no no no we're talking about
some heavier stuff some really important
topics Facebook Google and Twitter are
are going to the first of three
congressional hearings to talk about
Russia's influence on the u.s. elections
and we'll also be talking about Apple
Qualcomm and the latest in their legal
fight that's why I have eyes on our
legal expert retired attorney
that's correct retired attorney Aya's
Akhtar on to answer the questions answer
your questions about like whether or not
what's the endgame with the reason again
no he's gonna he's gonna answer all of
your questions you have about like about
yeah about law love will it does
none of that's gonna be usable come on
alright alright as always leave the
comment I'll give any questions look in
the comment section Brian will pick out
the best and we will get to them in 3
minutes and 59 seconds see you in a few
minutes back in the chat from 3 to
welcome to the 359 I'm dr. Chang and
with me is retired attorney I as act are
retired turning and current CNET
superstar I need to add that that is
Akhtar hi hello Roger
so Facebook Google and Twitter face
Congress today the first of three
congressional hearings looking into how
Russia used the social networks to
influence the US election and some of
these stats are startling facebook says
126 million americans or a third of our
population was exposed to russian-backed
accounts twitter says there are 2700
accounts that are believed to be
associated with the the internet
research agency which is russia's click
farm or troll farm and and google said
that IRA its spent forty seven hundred
dollars on ads and there are 18 youtube
channels associated with the group all
this begs the question do you think
these companies are too powerful I don't
know that too powerful so much is the
way people interact with them might be
the bigger issue because I know when it
comes to Facebook sharing a lot of
people don't click through they just
share there's no vetting at all right so
they meet the normal person is seeing
the headline there's moving on they're
not noticing what they're actually
reading same thing with tweets it's very
quick to spread information or
misinformation so I don't know if the
companies themselves are too powerful
but it does say that they need to do
something about it because of how people
are using their tools so to speak all
right I think the question that
hopefully we'll get an answer after the
next couple days is like do we need
regulation clearly Congress and Senator
the Congress is looking at regulations
these companies are saying we hear you
but we think we can totally regulate
ourselves and everything will be okay
yeah I mean this is arguably the Wild
West because this is this is uncharted
territory how this these places can
influence an election that's a very
serious event so there's a question did
it influence the event what's the actual
impact on it because just because you
saw something did it influence you or
not and that's a really bigger question
so will that lead to regulate
I could see these companies with their
lobbying efforts to make sure yeah will
regulate ourselves for now until
something needs to be done but this
might be the event that says something
needs to be done right I mean that it
definitely takes something dramatic and
obviously the u.s. elections it get it
doesn't get as dramatic is that right
kind of important so next up we want to
talk about Apple we're probably looking
to ditch Qualcomm as a supplier of
cellular radios this is the latest and
they're big legal spat which they have
disagreements over how much Apple should
be paying Qualcomm for both the
technology and for the radio in the
iPhone so is this just legal posturing
it's just making a bluff here yeah I
mean when we see a lot of these legal
battles in the past you know Apple and
Samsung famously go at it all the time
but Samsung screens are on the iPhone 10
yep and they have a working relationship
same thing with Qualcomm with Apple
trying to have all the stuff in the
public likely they're trying to get a
better deal maybe a better settlement
and by the end of this we'll probably
see that beautiful phrase cross license
cross patent license oh yeah they'll
figure their stuff out together it'll be
all private and we won't know any of the
details right it's just it's interesting
just entertained the idea of ditching
Qualcomm because it's the largest
supplier of mobile chips and radios the
only two other two that I'm aware that
could do this or Intel immediate AG yes
and Intel is in some of the the iPhones
the new iPhones
I believe it's t-mobile ATT the modems
themselves modems themselves yes it's a
very limited field also Apple has its
own manufacturing facilities with comes
of chips so I don't know if they can
pivot and make modems or not but this is
a very difficult field to be in right
you can't just decide one day I'm gonna
start making chips or I'm gonna make I'm
gonna start making radios because there
is a lot of set-up time and the process
to make these things is rather
complicated and it's unclear whether
Intel Media Tech could actually provide
the volumes that Apple really demands
yeah that's a really tough thing because
iPhones are I mean I couldn't agree I
think this is more legal posturing this
is definitely more Apple saying we don't
need you we can go on without you you
know just taylor swifting right now
exactly so you know trying to get try to
get everyone back to the bargaining
table to actually talk it out all right
it's all this time we have for these
stories and more check us out and seen
it I'm Roger Chang Amaya's actor thanks
for listening
alright so I'm gonna go ahead and jump
into the chat find and dig out some good
questions and comments for everybody
until then we did kind of miss a story
that we were trying to lineup today I'll
be what I thought ran out of time - OH
Roach oh yeah yeah we were trying to
sorry we were trying to tease the the
the ride that Tim shieff has had on a
lame-o self-driving cars it's a good one
of the Google self-driving cars just
kind of ran out of time but that'll
happen it's a really cool I mean we had
a lot of complicated storage discuss
those it was it was tough I wanted to
give some shout out some love to
Roadshow and the Whale Oh story which is
on the front page of Cena of course of
course
yep so I as educate us a little more in
the in the legal proceedings that we
might see over the next couple of days
or with I'm kind of curious as to what's
gonna go down with the social media
fallout I don't know how far we can dig
into this before we get into danger
territory but it is going to be really
there's anything legal there's just
gonna be a lot of back-and-forth there
gonna be a lot of questions a lot of
Wyatt tech people saying like okay we've
made that statement yeah we're not we
can't tell you more I would imagine a
lot of just getting stopped from getting
actual answers kinda like when we saw
what was that CEO experience with other
guy oh yeah the experience to you
Equifax and he's basically do you think
the monopoly guy shall appear I think
there's a chance it's also tala weaned
so yeah but yeah I would think that
we're gonna get not a lot of information
out of these experts and we're gonna
find basically the prepared statements
is all that they will say because that
is the safest thing to say over and over
again which is frustrating because it's
gonna be these were like two hour-long
sessions and they're they're just a row
of senators and representatives all
asking questions that we want answers -
yeah and there's just gonna be like
we'll have to defer to the statement oh
yeah people want to see something like a
court drama or like and it's every asset
ok yeah I did it you can't handle the
truth no that doesn't happen so jack
nicholson moment isn't one if it does
happen in the next few days we'll
all over amazing likes in fact that
person would lose their job be frequent
counsel loses their their stuff hearing
it'll be viral and that would be the new
distraction because we won't even pay
attention you're right we wouldn't be
talking to rush in which time with this
idiot that's I can't believe that dude
flip the table yep
alright let's go ahead and take a
question through them the chat and first
up we got James Vincent a comment
regarding our our headline is Google
Facebook Twitter too powerful no I don't
think they are too powerful there's just
no one else to knock them off they're
tough spots how do you respond to that I
mean does that mean they're by
definition too powerful like that it's
almost kind of a monopolistic right
there is no other facebook alternatives
okay wait a second so if you look at
Google's findings when they're talking
about the YouTube channel isn't it yeah
$4,700
they actually aligned about Google+ and
they're like we found no Google+ I'm 98%
sure that's what it said I just what you
can double check me on that I have a
link somewhere yeah there are
alternatives but they just I mean Google
tried to be an alternative Facebook and
that didn't really work I mean you could
argue that as a source of news there
they're competitors right Google like
Google is a good source I mean it's not
good I mean it's not saying it's good or
bad I'm just saying it's a very popular
source of news and just like Facebook
news feeds of become a popular source of
news and in that respect they do kind of
compete with each other but I think it's
still kind of same problem right yeah
but they're not meant to be news
organizations if you want to go there
right no there's no exercising judges
but my point is people go to those sites
right that's where the problem lies
there is no and I know Facebook is
throwing people at this problem but but
there is no sort of editorial control
right right right and here's there's no
way to say this it doesn't come off as
arrogant to some extent as we sit here
in our paid seats to be in a my paid I
think this is free you get what I'm
trying to say though and it's a we've
got things like Facebook YouTube Twitter
that gives everyone a platform to be
their own news agency sure everyone's
got a voice now and how do you vet that
to an extent because you don't want to
take away anyone's power of opinion but
how do you regret a credit
but they have tried to stop fake news
they've you know they've partnered with
like let us know to PolitiFact yeah
they've they've they partner with
companies or outside organizations to
the vets and the stories the problem is
there's just so much out there that
these organizations can't get to
everything it takes days sometimes well
are we are on that no are we too deep is
there any coming back I think this is a
pivot point because like if you think
about it I guess in the old days if you
had anybody could print out anything and
like okay this is the news if being
spread out or you can go to the town
square there's like a lunatic talk extry
extry you can have all of this stuff but
right now we're in this weird position
where Facebook you know we've seen a lot
of social networks come and going
facebook's managed to stick around yep
internet time a long time mmm-hmm and it
seems that they have a lot of users and
that's not going to go away anytime soon
and we're learning
we can't just trust everything we see
because it's just because it looks like
it's official it might not be and seeing
Facebook's like increased add
transparency a statement the other day
we are going to have clear labels and
what's an advertisement this is the kind
of stuff that has to happen because I
don't think and this might sound naive I
don't know if a lot of this was
foreseeable to go oh that's how this is
going to work somebody's gonna figure
out we're gonna throw a bunch of
propaganda well I mean to that point
Facebook was warned about this by early
on by security company so compared to
experts by even the government expressed
concerns about it X burying wires Stan
Facebook kind of looked into this before
the election is long before the
elections and this sort of said we'll
look into this and nothing really
happened it was foreseeable and some of
it was foreseeable I mean you know if
you're if you're looking at from the
Facebook perspective you're probably
thinking no that's crazy right is that
that was like a burst first reaction
when everyone kept saying you know this
was your fault that you know Trump won
the election and there was a fake news
they messed everything up his first
reaction was no that's crazy like that
idea and then he has that last naive on
his part yeah kind of human-like like
musk he's like okay you guys aren't
really with us write this but musk is
gonna be on a front line the fight
against the artificial intelligence war
with the t1000 Mark Zuckerberg is a
sleeper agent for them
I don't know all right that's a little
strong we don't met that is not the
opinion of CNN toward staff just bejust
Alexa just bake bake Alexa listen Zach
seems like a really nice cyborg that's
all I'm trying to say I'm okay with that
he still got some human left if he's a
cyborg yeah I mean this is essentially
we're on the cusp of iRobot the
questioning of who gets rights and the
first one to be questioned is Isaac
Oberg all right what questions do we get
I'm sorry I got distracted for a minute
well I mean Josh Boyata brings up a good
point and this is just kind of expanding
on what we were already talking about
earlier and what we just went into
detail
most recently but he says I feel that
Google and Facebook don't deserve all
the blame for spreading this fake news
because it should comes from the people
taking advantage of how the site's work
yes we know that from algorithm exposure
and just general I don't know the phrase
we come up with people don't take time
to verify anything they see online and
that's definitely the case that is part
of that he said before I'm guilty of it
that is part of the problem for sure I
think most people blame I mean
ultimately you blame Russia because
that's where a lot of this
misinformation is coming from but some
responsibility has to be put upon these
companies it can't just be this neutral
biased and you're like we're gonna put
out all the stuff it's up to you guys to
figure out what's real I mean that's
it's hard especially when you're getting
this when you're being flooded with this
information overload it is hard to vet
everything that comes through right
exactly and here is the elephant in the
room the devil's advocate question
coming from Dan McLean and I'm glad you
brought this up and we should we should
address this how well vetted is the
established media
ooh that's a question it is a good
question I would say I mean depends on
your agency yeah it depends on I guess
it depends on which media outlet but I
mean I can only speak for my time you
know writing both from CNET and at The
Wall Street Journal the folks there I
mean there's a lot of training that goes
into the job there's a lot of process to
make sure these stories are as objective
as possible you know nothing is 100%
objective but you know you you I mean I
worked at all
that at least had the intent to get
things right to get information out
there that is useful to readers and
that's not always the case with a lot of
the sources that are out there right
they're already the publication's or
their organizations like the our IRA
which they submit news and information
whose sole purpose is to mislead you and
so you know it's it's it's I don't I get
tongue-tied when talking about the the
question of it's tough because we draw
the line between media and objective
reporting in business because they both
play a major well it depend in it if
there's a line between editorial and
business that's really what the thing is
like I know ethics I don't learn a lot
about ethics in law school you'll figure
everyone thinks that's a joke it's not
immoral and and being actually ethically
sound in what you're doing and what
you're saying I know that transfers to
journalists as well absolutely if your
editorial head is saying look we have to
get this right and also your name is on
the violin so you want to be right you
know reading these things yeah and
that's why you stand by your piece so
maybe maybe The Times doesn't have
something as fast as some other site
does but odds are they're researching
the hell out of this to make sure that
they are going back to the original
source because one of the things I've
seen is the re reporting of other stuff
because if you go okay from this site to
the next site to the next site if you
never go back to the original source
right you have just hearsay you need
that original source information before
you move on to that so look we and see
that we we write and we report other
stories but we always check with the
source we always check with there's no
companies with the original people that
are the subjects of those stories
because we want to get it right right I
mean it may not be a like it may not be
up to us the companies may not want to
talk about certain things but we're
always trying to get things right yeah
and I think kind of in a weird ironic
sense there there's a level of the
business aspect to it that could seem
like that's the corruptible end of
objective objective reporting yeah but
the motivation at hand is you have to be
as correct as possible to not get called
out on your credibility so that your
platform can remain the whole point of
this is like we like doing this we
didn't do this to get rich this right
definitely job
I've been in the media and some aspect
since I was 14 years old I worked for a
newspaper worked for a local radio
station pursued radio and broadcast and
technical production as my my my career
continued to work for local radio
stations and other media outlets got
involved in media law as like a personal
interest throughout that and ultimately
when you get down to it at the end of
the day I'm not trying to oversimplify
this but this is one it's writing one
giant essay and the bibliography which
is always everybody's least favorite
part about doing it that's really what
has to come down into it is citing your
sources yeah and I think that's what
kind of holds our glue together there's
that motivation where you're working
with a team here I'm not solo out of my
basement like Alex Jones we're working
together to try to bring the most
relevant information to an audience that
would appreciate it of course first and
foremost but trying to stretch beyond
that at the same time and I'm not trying
to get on the soapbox I'm gonna wrap
this up soon it's just something I've
felt very passionate about and the whole
fake news thing bothers me to my core
and I don't know I like what I do I like
what we do I hope other people do at the
same time and I've completely gone off
the rails and lost my training out here
that's you're on the rails yeah idea
fake news I mean it upsets me as well as
someone who spent a career trying to get
it right you don't always get it right I
mean we're humans we make mistakes but
there's a higher there higher stakes
though when you work here and you know
it's our livelihood at the same time you
know if somebody can can preach all they
want on YouTube and it costs them
nothing right right right
we have overhead we have goals to to me
we have stretch goals we have an
audience to ultimately we have a
reputation that we have to uphold that's
a big thing is the reputation that's
yeah any other questions so you know I
didn't mean to get so deep into that
very so boxy therefore yes sorry I write
again it's something that I've been
really passionate about and you know
that's the biggest thing that bothers me
about the current climate keeping
politics out of it it's just like fake
news I've had my own family
members start preaching the fake news
thing it's like you know what I do for a
living right well you know known me for
31 years and how hard I've tried to be a
good person like right you know oh it's
not you it's all the other ones shut up
yeah that's about all I got so thanks
everybody for it for entertaining my
yeah my gripe on what's supposed to be
kind of a fun silly spooky day I know
this is the most frightening episode is
wow that's a frightening look actually I
can't do anything I don't know you can't
even you sound like an echo I can't do
anything
all right
I guess we could we should wrap it up
there we got a run we're gonna have more
on the congressional hearings tomorrow
as well as hopefully we'll have Scott on
to talk about the iPhone 10 he's a busy
man
