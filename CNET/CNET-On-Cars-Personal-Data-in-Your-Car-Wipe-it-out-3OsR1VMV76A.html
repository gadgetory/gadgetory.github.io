automotive theft over the decades in the
1970s some 70% of cars that were stolen
we're stolen for a joyride now more than
50% of cars that are stolen are stolen
to be stripped to have things stolen out
of them or parts from them but a part
that can be stolen from your car that
you don't think about is your personal
data that's stored in your systems so
think about these data protection tips
for your car when you sell loan it or
just leave it at the shop for a long
time did you set your home address in
the navigation system to allow that nice
one press take the home functionality
most recent places you've navigated to
are also typically stored and your GPS
head units menus as well did you click
yes when the Bluetooth hands-free system
asked you to transfer your phone
contacts into the car your recent call
history incoming and outgoing is
typically stored in there as well some
cars now have text message ability they
can send receive and yes store your
message history and what about that
garage door opener built into your visor
combine that with the home address you
stored in your nav system and you
basically made an easy garage break-in
car
luckily most of these are pretty easy to
deal with if you just poke around a few
menus in your car's head unit for
example when you unpair a Bluetooth
phone that will also typically remove
the contacts the call history everything
else with it navigation systems often
have a command to clear recent
destinations some cars have a clear
personal data command in their settings
menu that will blow everything out and D
memorizing the code for your garage door
is usually as simple as pushing two of
the buttons at once for a few seconds
check your manual to see exactly what
the sequence is so you know how car
makers are always trying to convince us
that their vehicles are now rolling
consumer electronics bingo and should
think about the data within them in that
vein</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
