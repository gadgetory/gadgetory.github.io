person but wouldn't it be nice if you
could launch all of your smart home
entertainment needs with a single voice
command now you can do exactly that with
the Logitech Harmony Alexa skill I was
dying to try this out so we brought the
Logitech Harmony hub here to the C net
smart apartment along with a Roku
streaming stick and plenty of smart home
gadget if you've got Philips hue bulbs
in the lamps a lifx bulb in the corner
lamp there my goal is to integrate all
of it into a single movie watching mode
that I can launch with a single voice
command here's what it looks like Alexa
turn on watch Hulu okay so you can see
the roku jumps right to the Hulu input
the TV's on the right place it needs to
be and even the lights here go green
kind of match the Hulu theme I did this
for every streaming service that we've
got here Hulu and Amazon Netflix HBO GO
all with a single voice command now as
you can see the end result is really
cool but there's still a lot of pain
points here the Logitech app is really
confusing it's very powerful it does a
lot of cool things for all your
entertainment gear but the different
settings and options you need to enable
to get things working or kind of
scattered about unintuitive lead you
have to search to find stuff it takes a
lot of getting used to there's a
learning curve here not the most well
laid out app I also encountered a lot of
pain points as I tried to import my
logitech activities and favorite
channels into Alexa what it's basically
doing is tricking Alexa into thinking
that those activities and channels are
just devices so you tell Alexa to turn
them on and off you can also add what
logitech calls friendly names these are
alternative wordings for your commands
the problem is that the logitech presets
that you can't get rid of kind of take
up all the good words there's already
turn on HBO turn on Netflix turn on your
TV those are already locked in so if you
want to make a really cool HBO preset
that has purple lights or whatever you
want you can't do that with the built-in
preset you have to make your own I don't
like that at all on top of that the
Logitech skill can't do everything yet
you can't adjust the volume of your
entertainment gear and you can't
fast-forward or rewind either so you're
just stuck turning things on and off and
switching inputs all in all I think this
is a pretty compelling use of Alexa I
just wish that it wasn't quite so clunky
to set up I'm also waiting to see if we
get additional Alexa skills for TV
avy gear in 2017 maybe an Alexa enable
TV set or deeper controls of Amazon fire
TV all of that has me personally waiting
before buying a harmony hub which is not
an inexpensive purchase that's said I'm
glad we've got it here in the scene that
smart apartment where we can keep
playing with it and testing it out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
