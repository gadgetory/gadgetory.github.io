Detroit Auto Show in front of the BMW
Concept 4 Series Coupe now the idea
behind this car is that BMW is gonna
separate their lines out of it they've
got the 3 Series right now with a coupe
a convertible and a sedan this should be
the new coupe version of that car so
there will be no more coupe version of
the 3 Series as such it's a performance
oriented car and the roofline is a
little shorter than the current 3 Series
Coupe it's also a little bit longer than
that car 2 we see some new styling on
this car which seems to point at a new
BMW design language a nice little cues
they have these inset elements like in
the front air intake and also in these
side vents on the front fenders as well
it's BMWs released now specs for this
car so we don't know what's gonna be
under the hood or what options are gonna
be available to help us a road-holding
but I would expect the BMW will have a
lot of the same engine throw some of the
same engines they have in their current
lineup most likely the engine in the
current 335 is Q which is the 3 liter
twin scroll turbo making 320 horsepower
and 3 than 32 pounds of torque
that'd be a likely fit for this car the
concept we see here also has a manual
transmission which goes along with that
sport car enthusiast segment car in the
cabin there's also a screen very similar
to the cabin electronics and the current
BMW 3-series so I would expect it to be
very different there either be nubbies
really good at standardizing their
electronics across all their models so
this will probably have no surprise as
far as cabin tech it will probably be
very similar to what's on the current
BMW 3-series so acid yeah we don't know
when a production version of this car
would come out but it looks like it's
very much intent on that we will
probably see one within the next year I
imagine
