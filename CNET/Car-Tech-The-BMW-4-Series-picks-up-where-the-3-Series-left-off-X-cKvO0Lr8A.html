detroit auto show in front of the BMW
Concept 4 series coupe now the idea
behind this car is that BMW is going to
separate their lines out of it they've
got the 3-series right now with a coupe
a convertible in a sedan this should be
the new version of that car so there
will be no more coupe version of the 3
series as such it's a
performance-oriented car and the roof
line is a little shorter than the
current 3-series coupe it's also a
little bit longer than that car too we
see some new styling on this car which
seems to point at a new BMW design
language a nice little cues they have
these inset elements like in the front
air intake and also in these side vents
on the front fenders as well BMW is
released now specs for this car so we
don't know what's going to be under the
hood or what options are going to be
available to help us a road holding but
I would expect the BMW will have a lot
of the same engines or some of the same
engines they have in their current
lineup most likely the engine in the
current 335 is Q which is the three
liter twin scroll turbo making 320
horsepower in free than 32 pounds eat of
torque that'd be a likely fit for this
car the concept we see here also has a
manual transmission which goes along
with that sport car enthusiast segment
car in the cabin there's also a screen
very similar to the cabin electronics in
the current BMW 3-series so I would
expect it to be very different there
either the adobe is really good at
standardizing their electronics across
all their models so this will probably
have no surprise as far as cabin
technical probably be very similar to
what's on the current BMW 3-series so
acid yet we don't know what a production
version of this car would come out but
it looks like it's very much intent on
that we will probably see one within the
next year I imagine
