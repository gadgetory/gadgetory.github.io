picture quality for the money and the
company's 2018 lineup looks to continue
the tradition let's check out the new
sets the best is the brand new P series
quantum available in just one size 65
inches shown here and shipping this fall
Vizio claims will have the company's
best picture quality yet with a peak
brightness of 2,000 nits higher than any
TV we've tested its videos only TV to
use a quantum dot film which helps
improve its color to better show off
high dynamic range TV shows and movies
and its local dimming is more precise
than any Vizio TV to date with 192 zones
here's videos demo of its local dimming
which shows the actual zones in action
the quantum is able to illuminate just
the areas that need light while the
other parts the screen remain dark the
result is improved contrast and image
quality yes other TVs from Vizio
competitors can do local dimming too but
very few have as many zones as the
quantum Vizio also introduced the newest
version with regular P series which cost
a lot less 1500 for the 65 inch size 75
and 55 inch sizes available
it loses quantum dots can't get his
bright in his fewer dimming zones up to
120 but we still expect to deliver
excellent picture for the money the M
series also gets a refresh with more
dimming zones and last year but fewer
than the P it costs a thousand for the
65 inch size and there's a 55 inch and a
70 inch version too like the standard P
series it's shipping now and if its
predecessor is any indication it could
be one of the best values on the market
and speaking of value
there's the entry-level e series it
ranges from 43 to 80 inches and cost
just 800 bucks for the 65 inch size just
like the more expensive sets it has 4k
resolution Dolby vision HDR and even
local dimming I'll be with fewer zones
one of videos weaknesses has always been
at Smart TV features which can't compete
with systems from Samsung or Roku the
company did recently add the ability to
work with Alexa as well as Google home
devices and also touts its search
feature coming soon is an app for
YouTube TV and another streaming service
as yet unnamed it will offer easy access
to free streams in a familiar grid guide
format and in more good news for cable
TV cord cutters all of videos new TVs
include a built-in over-the-air tuner
for antenna shows something that went
absent in past models that's a quick
look at videos new 2018 TVs we'll be
reviewing them at CNET as soon as
possible so stay tuned</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
