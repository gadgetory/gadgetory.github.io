water-resistant wireless bluetooth
speaker that's designed you guessed it
for outdoor use at $99.99 it's the
step-up model to the booms hockey-puck
sized boombox travel and produces good
sound for both its size and price point
hi I'm David Carr noise and welcome to
another CNET video tour of a portable
bluetooth speaker as I said this to voom
is a ruggedized model and comes in a few
different trim colors including the red
you see here as well as blue olive green
and all black weighing in at one point
six pounds or 726 grams the speaker
seems solidly built and has a set of
sealed rubberized buttons on the top of
the unit including a pause play button
and volume controls to prevent water
from entering the microUSB charging port
and audio input on the side there's a
rubber gasket that seals everything off
unlike some speakers that are completely
waterproof this one is only rated as
being splash proof as far as other
extras go there's a built-in
speakerphone and the speaker's equipped
with bluetooth 4.0 which makes pairing
with your Bluetooth enabled smartphone
or tablet that much easier
battery life is rated at 12 hours at
moderate volume levels that's above
average for this type of mini speaker I
thought it sounded good for what it is
it's got a pair of combo mid sub drivers
and a single tweeter along with two
passive bass radiators it's rare to see
that many drivers in a speaker this size
and it does play very loud for a mini
speaker you do get some distortion with
more complicated tracks and bass heavy
tracks at high volumes but so long as
you don't push it too hard
it offers reasonably detailed sound it
does have its limitations however after
all the speaker this size can only
produce so much bass so don't expect it
to mimic a larger fuller sounding
speaker still for the money you can find
it for closer to $80 online you'll be
hard-pressed to find much else that
sounds better I also like to voom
smaller voom box travel and think it's a
better choice for people who want to
carry a speak around in their laptop bag
or luggage in general but this boom box
outdoor while a little generic looking
is a better choice if you want to see
that can output more volume to a larger
space like the travel it's a very good
value and it's one of the better
wireless speakers you'll find for less
than $100 I'm David karna and that's the
boombox outdoor thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
