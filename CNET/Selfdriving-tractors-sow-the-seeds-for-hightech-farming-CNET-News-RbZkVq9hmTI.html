race cattle we have found so many
benefits for using the technology
anything from being able to run a lot
longer at night because we have Auto
track Auto track is is essentially the
ability for the machine to set a point
here and it'll snap a line directly in
front of you then it'll drive straight
on that track for you every time
AutoTrack vision gives that operator
ability to follow that crop role
allowing the sprayer drive down between
the roads without damaging that that
crop it uses a monocular camera that
focuses on and sees the difference
between your your row and the soil these
displays help the producer run the
machine actually do automated guidance
through our auto track product allows
section control to make sure you don't
over apply where you've already been
and so this iPad works together with
whichever integrated display that you
have and provides that visualization of
what's actually being done we have
application seed star mobile like we see
here and then harvest mobile that you
would use in a combine that would work
with those respective field operations
to visualize that information for the
customer and give them confidence that
the work that they're doing is going to
yield the outcomes that they've really
invested their money in
they're the tractors and the combines
are coming from the factory packed with
all these sensors and controllers that
help them not only do the job down to
within an inch of accuracy but also
record what's happening how much product
am i pulling off the field so what am i
harvesting how much of my harvesting
where am i harvesting it where my seed
placements are they are they within the
spec of the plan that I have out there
or am I missing the mark a little bit we
know which is our most productive ground
and our least productive ground so we
can essentially mitigate the risk of
going all the way across that farm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
