been phased out in favor of more
efficient fluorescent and LED options
but a lot of today's manufacturers are
taking advantage of the nostalgia for
those old bulbs and incorporating those
designs into the new ones this is a
great example of that this is the GE 40
watt replacement filament LED this is a
vintage style bulb ge calls it and you
can see it's got this vintage look with
the diodes inside a range to look like
an old filament it's also got the
elongated shape and a sepia tinge to the
glass looks very classic and very
vintage if you're going for an
old-school look with an exposed bulbs
setup I think it would do a nice job as
far as specs go this is a 40 watt
replacement bulb like I said so it's
gonna put out somewhere between 450 and
500 lumens ideally does a nice job there
puts out just under 450 give that a good
grade it's also very efficient only uses
five watts to puts those 450 or so
lumens out and that's a good number that
means it puts out about 90 lumens per
watt that's very good for the efficiency
standpoint you also get a nice low color
temperature with this bulb which I think
is a good design decision that
emphasizes the glow of that incandescent
like filament with a low yellowy color
temperature so I like the design I like
the efficiency and the brightness is
fine the color temperature looks good my
problem with this bulb comes down to the
dimming capabilities frankly it just
doesn't have them on every single dimmer
switch that we tested it flickers and
noticeably noticeably enough that I
could fill it with my camera that's not
always the case with these fast flickers
so it's a pretty noticeable problem here
using this on a dimmer switch I don't
think you're gonna like the result at
all you'll find GES take on the faux
filament LED selling it's sam's club in
a 2-pack for 20 bucks
that's not inexpensive for a 40 watt
replacement you can get them a lot
cheaper than that but if you want this
classic looking design from a major
manufacturer with a five-year warranty
it's one of the better picks out there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
