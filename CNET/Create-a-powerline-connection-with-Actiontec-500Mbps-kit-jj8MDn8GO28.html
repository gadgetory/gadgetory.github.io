at home with your wife well good luck on
that buddy but if you problem is your
Wi-Fi network I have something here that
might help and that's going powerline
networking such as this action take 500
megabits per second powerline adapter
kit right here now this kit always come
with two separate adapter and that's
because you need two adapter to create
the very first power light connection
here's how power light works you take
the first adapter and connect it to the
router of your net home network like
this okay and take a second to connect
to a network device such as a computer
or a printer after that just plug these
two adapter in to separate one socket
and that's it you have a chest connected
the network device into your home
network basically the powerline adapter
turn your home's electrical wiring into
a network cable
there's many power light kits and power
adapter on a market but the action tech
kid right here is very good because come
with two very small adapter actually
probably the smallest ever seen be aware
that you have to plug the power adapter
directly into a wall socket
for it to work well and it might not
work at all if you plug it into a power
strip or a shirt protector on this I
here next to the network port you can
see there's a security button pressing
on this button on each unit within two
minutes of one another will create a
security power light connection between
them that is necessary if you use them
in an apartment and try to keep auto
from tapping into your home network by
using another adapter in their own
apartment the best thing about this
action tech kit here is a price it costs
just $50 with two adapter included that
is less than many other single adapter
on the market for more information check
out the in depth review a sitcom I can
send me questions via Twitter or
Facebook once again my name is Domo and
this has been a quick how-to on
powerline networking with
the action takes 500 Meg's per second
powerline adapter kit</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
