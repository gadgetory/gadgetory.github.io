at CES 2013 where I've been eating a lot
of food free food I should complain that
has been served to me and I need to eat
it very quickly and I've learned too
late that I really needed this device
this is the copy fork this is entering
kickstarter funding on in February and
it's going to be available for
ninety-nine dollars in the 2nd quarter
of 2013 it is a Bluetooth connected fork
and is intended to help you slow down
when you eat and I really could use that
right now so it has a built in a little
buzzer like a cell phone buzzer and it
can monitor when you're eating too fast
and give you a little force feedback
here on the handle to remind you to slow
down it also counts the number of times
you heave food towards your face and it
counts how long you've been eating and
overall the entire idea is that it's
trying to slow you down because there's
been studies that have found that people
who eat slower ultimately consume less
calories because their bodies register
that they're full and thereby they eat
less food it's also going to come with a
companion the happy track that will
monitor how happy you are and those
moments where you're feeling especially
grateful or full of Glee or maybe you're
full of glum you hold down the little
button and register exactly how happy
you are in your happy meter and it seems
like a silly little thing but there's
really nothing out there right now that
tracks your happiness so you can
remember here at CES I was full of
despair on saturday but sunday i came
across the happy fork and i was very
excited so I changed my happy meter
there and you can track it throughout
the year maybe maybe yes seasonal
affective disorder and you would never
know until you track your happiness
using the happy track so hopefully that
will come to
another thing about the happy fork if
you're wondering how it gets its charge
for the Bluetooth connection is that it
has a built-in battery that you charge
over what I think is micro USB yeah well
micro USB here in the back so you can
recharge this if you 15 days of battery
life you can run this through the
dishwasher don't run your battery pack
with the dishwasher so along with the
happy fork you get a companion app that
will help you track how fast you've been
eating how many bytes you've been taking
how often probably if you've been eating
too quickly you also get a
family-focused game that will help other
people in your health fields compete to
how slowly they can eat at suppose you
win the race by how slow you go it was
also going to be I believe a video it's
like a video coach to help you lose
weight for cnet.com and Donald Bell here
at CES 2013 with be happy pork</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
