about a smartphone close to many
people's hearts we take a closer look at
the benefits of unlimited data and
whether or not they're actually
beneficial and check out the moto active
a workout watch that does more than just
play your music it's styled in cnet cell
phone podcast on this Monday March 19
2012 I'm Jessica doll cord here in San
Francisco with LAN la hello and
technical producer Steven Beecham hello
good morning Brian Bennett joins us from
New York hey guys so before we begin
let's do a little bit of housekeeping
first thing I want to do is announce
that we're having a special episode of
dialed in on Wednesday March 21st that's
going to be at 11am Pacific 2 p.m.

known as early termination fees and at
the end of it you know we were
responding to readers email and at the
end of it we thought well this you know
we clearly have a lot to say people
clearly have a lot to say out there

and that we can just all share around so
we're going to have a special etf rant
off and tip session so join us live will
be taking live calls will be reading
emails that you send us so send us your
email send tips and any experiences any
stories or save them up for a phone call
and you can share it with us live next I
wanted to just give a little shout out
to Lynn and her awesome chart making
skills if you haven't seen we had a lot
of iPad coverage last week and she
created this great and beautiful chart
about AT&amp;amp;T vs verizon and what their 4g
LTE networks are in terms of stats such
as the date that it launched the number
of markets it covers number of people
covered promised up load and download
speeds and a comparison of some of the
phones so not only is it informative but
it is glorious to look at so great job
Lynn and you should all check that out
as well as all of our iPad coverage if
you're interested in
so without further ado let's get into
the meat of the topic today and a story
that has actually had its seeds from a
very long time ago well before January
anyway bit of the works for a while this
is the story of this american life and
actor mike daisey who traveled to china
and basically went to Shenzhen went to
the foxconn factory where Apple
manufactures many iphones and created
this one-man show on Broadway and
elsewhere was actually here in Berkeley
very close to San Francisco and it's
been pouring around its going to DC next
week just finish up its New York run
actually this weekend and basically
created this one-man show called the
agony and ecstasy of Steve Jobs and
produces a lot of facts and stories
based on his travels in China and bow
about what the working conditions were
in shen zhen so fast forward very
popular podcast This American Life I
guess interviews him for four hours
makes him the star of one of the
podcasts and then some of the producers
decide that maybe some of the facts
really didn't check out so they went
into China and found his translating
exactly and she kind of had something
different to say so this has developed
into a giant brouhaha where Daisy is
defending himself in his blog post
citing artistic license today he's gone
after this american life saying that
they quoted him out of context are Greg
Sandoval from cnet news went to his last
matinee performance in New York where he
received a standing ovation Greg didn't
actually get to go inside because he
hadn't purchased tickets far enough in
advance but definitely interviewed some
of the people about you know whether
they knew about this or not and what
they thought of it so it was pretty
interesting a lot of people of course
had some negative things to say about
his so-called artistic license with the
fact
others did enjoy the show and thought
that it was brilliant and insightful and
it piqued their curiosity you know
stating that well you know maybe not
everything was factual and its pure form
but holistically the picture was so this
just opens up you know all sorts of it
breaks open all sorts of dams about
ethics and journalism and artistic
license and things like that so when it
comes to sending a damning message about
technology especially when it's a device
that's widely used today is there
something to be said for artistic
license was Daisy in the right is his
position defensible or should he
apologized and take a different stance
what do you guys think about this well I
mean I well I'll just gonna say you know
it's a shame because I do think that
topic that he's reported or not
reporting on with the topic that he's
discussing and basing his shows on is a
very real real issue and you know I
think that it's too bad that you know
his sort of lacks you know not really
following journalistic standards is a
shame because it's not it's going to do
damage to the whole topic as a whole and
the whole story as a whole I think and I
think people are going to discount any
you know future reports are going to
take it with a huge grain of salt now
and you know it basically does damage to
the whole a whole issue even though it's
something that I feel is really
important yeah I just think I don't like
how kind of unapologetic he was I mean
when you listen to the retraction and
Ira Glass and at first he was just
saying I'm really sorry but you know I
am this is theater not what I do is
journalism but he knows that this
american life and PRI and when Ira Glass
and every one of the producers do does
is journalism and in the beginning he
was just saying I'm really sorry that
you guys took it as truth but the bottom
line is I'm not a journalist and by
knowing that it was going to appear on
this american life then he should have
known that and they fact checked the
thing obviously not well enough but in
the first when they first around the
episode Ira Glass went through the
fact-checking
process in hell some were wrong but they
decided to run with it anyways until
they found out later that more things
were wrong and at first he's just hear
him say I really regret it i'm sorry and
then the more that he's being exposed
now he's saying with the latest news
saying that he four hours of grilling
edited down to 15 minutes and my my
quotes were taking out of context it's
like well you know if you didn't have
people operate under the assumption that
everything you said was true than this
one I have to happen and he was just I
just don't like how he's very not he's
just not very remorseful and he kind of
put the steak and the integrity of this
american life and what they do vaughan
herbal and he kind of risked their
integrity and he's just saying oh but
I'm not a journalist so it's okay but
they're what they're doing is sorry I
you know you know I gotta say too we had
Mike Daisey and Charles Duhigg from the
New York Times on reporters roundtable a
couple months ago and he never said that
he was taking artistic license or
anything he was standing by all of his
yeah he sing it now yeah he's singing
now that he's that he's in trouble so to
speak but he never he never came out and
told us any of that you know and I
understand he's an actor and he's not a
journalist but at the same time it just
seems kind of like was he trying to get
publicity for his show or what what was
he trying to do well let's pause for a
second and invite a couple of our live
listeners to call in if they have
anything to say on the matter Steve
what's the number I got it right here 1
888 900 cnet 2638 you can call us live
right now to talk about this and we will
put your call on the air so give us a
call so yeah I mean in the meantime so
then we look at things like that also
have to do with technology in the modern
time we're not looking at something in
the past what about movies like The
Social Network well that's just a
dramatization like based on a book and
and when you go into the movies theater
you expect to see a movie but it could
still be damning I mean how many people
went to see that movie and walked away
thinking about Mark Zuckerberg had to
actually live this life in its entirety
I guess I mean when with with that kind
of like the damning liable thing it's
just like okay that's just someone's
repeat
is someone's reputation and but i don't
i don't know about like damning evidence
it's just if you are operating an
assumption that what you're saying is if
the audience is operating on the
assumption that what you're saying is
true so if an audience goes into a movie
theater then and it says this is based
on truth this is a documentary then you
have to make sure everything that you
say is with integrity but like seeing
something like social networking what do
you see actors when you see actresses
and you see a director and things like
that you know that there that the
audience shouldn't be expecting a
hundred percent journalistic but to play
devil's advocate how is a stage
production any different than a
production exactly stage magician is
fine but the fact that PR I went up to
them approach them said we're going to
run your show we're going to
fact-checking and we're going to you
know we're going to run your show and
you know it's a journalistic radio show
and mike daisey who probably knows what
this american life is and knows what
kind of standard they operate on said
yeah sure everything yeah it's okay and
you can see that like during the
retraction he was also kind of like back
backpedaling anyway so he should have
just yeah so this american life
definitely has a responsibility of their
own to present their material however
they do so i mean it should they be held
responsible at all i mean they are
that's why they're saying like bottom
line this was our fault we should have
retracted it once the moment we didn't
get in touch with the translator and
that's why it does come down to them in
certain aspects but i just think they
got totally duped I mean like what
happens when your source lies to you and
just as yeah this is true and like and
then I mean of course they could have
found the translator and done everything
but but a quote basin there's uh there's
some other issues too i mean i think
that the translator i mean who knows
what role she had and not to say that
she was she was saying something that
was not true but you wonder what the
interest is of interest is and who she
represents or yeah if she has any
Chinese government have gotten to her
and said hey I got her this up yeah not
to be all conspiracy theory on you guys
but I mean you never know
and I mean I you know I do think that
it's like I said it's really sad that
that we're talking more about this guy's
actions which were crappy because you
know like a better word he went to he
basically gave the impression I mean he
went to China he went to shen jen or
wherever it was and he went in front of
the he did actually go to the factory to
Foxconn and he actually was um you know
there and interviewing people so he did
make the impression that he talked to
all these people even though he didn't
um you know so many it is it is a
responsible thing to do but on the flip
side I think that this issue is real and
and it's in affects a lot more products
than just Apple products to affects all
the phones and yes tough laptops
everything all the stuff is being
outsourced so in some senses does it
matter I mean he his dramatization has
sort of blown open the door on on you
know he's been able to make it personal
right by pointing out a very particular
device and basing his show off of his
experiences visiting the factory he's
been able to raise awareness about not
just Foxconn but also you know the
entire life cycle of the electronics
that we use every day so in January cnet
actually interviewed Mike Daisey and the
question was put to him that he visited
factories and talked to Foxconn
employees with the help of a translator
you interviewed workers some as young as
11 during shift changes over the course
of many days given the heavy security
there the suicides were you surprised by
how many workers were eager to talk to
you so he talks about that and basically
he says that he asked journalists before
told him that his plans and they thought
that nobody would ever speak to him but
he went ahead and he asked anyway he
says I don't want to be too speculative
but it has crossed my mind that is very
convenient for journalists if we
convince ourselves that no one will talk
to them then that saves us the
difficulty of having two out
do our jobs we convince ourselves that
no one's there and no one's going to
talk then you don't even have to go to
the factory he means so I feel like he
is putting himself in the role of a
journalist there when it's convenient
for him and then also during this
interview CNN asked you know we said the
story or the show is not just
storytelling it's also a call to action
because after the show the audience
members are given information on what
they can do to try to get apple and
other electronics makers to change
working conditions what made you decide
to take the extra step his response how
could it be otherwise frankly it's the
least I can do it doesn't even seem like
it'd be ethically responsible to perform
a show illuminating these things and
proposing that there is a chance for us
to turn things around to begin the
process of waking up and then not
provide some ideas toward what what that
might entail it would actually just be
an irresponsible it would actually just
be irresponsible as a citizen and people
have actually come forward in support of
him people have called Apple customer
service relations it has galvanized some
people what do you what do you think
about those statements well I mean I
mean I do think that he you know like
you said he put his he he definitely put
himself in the position of being a
journalist that was delivering facts and
getting and delivering information that
not everybody has access to or even
saying that you know sounds like you
know he's saying that people didn't even
have the the sort of the wherewithal to
go grab those facts or to talk to people
and that type of thing so so once he
puts himself in that position it's you
know he's definitely he should know and
you know he's definitely deserves all
the criticism but like I said the issue
is really important though because you
know people people have been dying there
in though in that plant um you know they
did put up those Nets you know it mean
to keep people from committing suicide
yes the key people from jumping yep so a
lot of the stuff um you know yeah okay
he should be completely grilled for
fabricating the truth and posing as a
journalist but that we have to realize
that the issue is a real issue and
people should really think about where
these products coming from and you know
how they're created you know personally
I mean I would love to see a day when we
have like really sustainable and you
know eco-friendly devices that are
actually cool as well you know not just
like made out of you know I don't know
like you know corn byproducts or
something but you know something that
actually looks good and that you can
actually keep keep with you you know and
not have to keep reusing just reuse the
internal components or something so that
that is something that I believe
industry should go in to take that
direction but you know it is a shame
it's a shame that you know this this
topic has been sidetracked by this guy's
actions so one more thing i'll put in
before we change topics is that the
original retracted now deleted episode
of this american life with mike daisey
is reportedly still on sale at amazon at
show number 45 for if you want to hear
the original it's already available at
pirate bay and one thing i will say also
is that mike daisey did redact some of
his one-man show in New York to
highlight the areas where he and his
translator were disputing so you guys
have been shy over the phone but if you
have any other comments you can
definitely email us and and share them
with us we'll give you those details at
the end of the show so switching gears
AT&amp;amp;T has right done away with all of its
unlimited plans but if you had the $30
unlimited plan you were grandfathered in
there is a new story or new report
actually from consumer reports that is
suggesting that your unlimited plan may
not actually be saving you any money
that's correct and basically don know at
cnet took a look at this situation and
he basically figured out you can see was
lucky enough to have one of those
grandfathered in unlimited plans I
believe he's paying thirty dollars a
month or was and
he actually tested his his his data
usage and found that he wasn't coming
anywhere near the 300 you know you
basically anywhere near the amount that
that they were charging for for
unlimited like he was he was coming
underneath 300 megabytes so we decided
to just you know go for that plan and
stay lofts which costs 20 bucks as
opposed to 30 bucks so he's saving ten
dollars a month you know he's basically
just saving that ten dollars a month as
opposed to just handing it over for no
reason and you know the thing is I think
that's a good that's a great observation
and I guess you know you really don't
use that much data on on a 3g device
like that like the iPhone on eighteen t
though I have to tell you that when I
personally have been using a 4g LTE
device on verizon i actually started to
burn through those those data allotments
pretty fast you know granted it's a
phone that i'm not paying for it was a
test device i was using the Samsung
Galaxy Nexus on verizon LTE and in Ice
Cream Sandwich there's a little feature
where you can see now just how much data
you're using built right into the OS I
don't you guys have seen this yes oh
yeah so at like I actually i only use
that phone for like maybe two and a half
weeks and i already got a warning for
two gigabytes of data so I'm like what
on earth and it turns out that i do all
these really really kind of questionable
things like uh i don't well okay oh I'm
sorry that I did not come across
probably i don't know how many videos
you're streaming no no no no no it's not
like that what it is is I'm listening to
podcasts you know just using google
listen it's just that a lot of times i'm
running out the door and i forgot you
know I forgot to download the latest you
know NPR shows or whatever it is dialed
in podcast I listen to myself what it's
kind of interesting so and you guys to
as well so I realized you know I like
run out the door hit refresh
and it starts sucking down all that
stuff while I'm walking down walking to
the subway because once again on the
subway there's no connection anywhere
and I know that's not a smooth thing to
do and it definitely does you know pull
down lots of data but I still do it and
I think that's the majority of my data
usage there but also I do a lot of I
know I know I shouldn't do this but I
used tune in Android app to listen to
live radio and that's streaming over 4g
to probably not a good idea but
sometimes you know I just need to listen
to the radio like right then you know
and i'm outside i'm walking around so i
think if you have access to that to that
faster connection you're probably going
to end up using it depending right then
depends on what you do but if you have
an iphone it looks like us you know on
AT&amp;amp;T the 3g is not really going to be
burning much data at least that's what
this consumer reports report had found
for now but then what happens when the
iPhone becomes a 4g LTE device oh yeah
in its next iteration so and there is
the reminder that once you leave you're
grandfathered plan there's no going back
in that's right yeah that I've actually
do that I personally think you should
invest in your future and keep it
however if you don't ever see yourself
actually using the phone for streaming
video or anything like that then you
might save money in the long run by
leaving it and that's the question
because what's the stop eighteen t from
saying oh well you know what the 4g
device that's that doesn't apply to you
even if with even if you have a
grandfathered in I don't think that will
happen I think that 4G LTE ipad users
are still grandfathered in mmm yeah
they'll be no tech talk I from our chat
room is saying that he was told his
grandfathered plan will stay when he was
upgraded to the next iPhone so yes he is
corroborating that so oh nice so it
really is a solid plan um let's take our
break and we will be back with headlines
of the day
you
welcome back to dial it in where we've
got some quick hits coming right at you
verizon has reconfirmed by telling Dow
Jones that all smartphones going forward
will be 4g LTE well guess what they told
me that very same thing first back in
January at CES so keep a lookout for all
verizon smartphones to be 4g LTE no
question also there is a simple hacks as
a user of a mac rumors forum that will
allow you to run your verizon LTE ipad
on 18 tease 3g network i have not been
able to try this out myself but if you
want to give it a go there are more
details at dialed in sony announcing
their new Xperia Sola and basically this
device is a dumbed down version of some
of their other Experian axis so
interesting is that it has a finger
tracking feature which lets you scroll
without having to actually touch the
screen and then also we have yeah it's
crazy I want to see this in action and
we also have HTC who has confirmed a
whole slew of phones I believe it's 16
in all that will get ice cream sandwich
updates so basically we've got a lot of
phones including the droid incredible 2
the HTC Thunderbolt a whole bunch of
different devices so definitely check
that out and speaking of ice cream
sandwich Samsung Nexus S will also get
the ice cream sandwich and the nexus s
4g wigan ice cream sandwich update in
April and it's finally confirmed before
they were kind of not very sure but now
we have word of it and the Nokia Lumia
610 we learn can be doubled as a Wi-Fi
hotspot up to five other devices can
connect wirelessly the note the Lumia
710 and 800 don't have it yet but
sources have confirmed that they it will
come to the
two devices good news so we checked out
a bunch of devices this last week
including the LG Connect 4g for metropcs
the samsung galaxy s2 for US cellular
the motorola moto active gps fitness
device that Brian took a look at and the
ZTE score for Cricket Wireless so Lynn
we want us through the LG Connect 4g
just a little bit yeah the LG Connect
four G's a phone on metropcs so it's for
anyone who doesn't want that for anyone
who likes a no paid no contract kind of
phone I personally liked it it was
really bright and very fast both the
processor and I and the network because
it is 4G and it also has a really bright
screen 700 nits of brightness and I just
kind of really like the phone it was its
Android I do brunch abrin yeah yeah yeah
it is and um yeah the backing I wasn't
such a fan of aesthetically because it
kind of feels a little plastic e but
everything else that has a 1.2 gigahertz
dual-core processor and um and yeah it
was a really adequate phone that i would
recommend for anyone especially for
people who like metro pcs and it's
always nice to see kind of higher end
phones for those kind of networks to
recall the price point for this guy mmm
oh that oh wait here it is 319 dollars
after a 30-dollar mail-in rebate yeah so
kind of it's a sweet it's pretty steep
that kind of makes it one of their
priciest no contract offering yeah and
then you get a data plan and voice plans
up really yeah I checked out the samsung
galaxy s2 for US cellular it is exactly
the same as every other galaxy s2 it is
of course on US cellular's 3g network
and the take-home message that i have is
basically it's a good phone it was a
good phone then it's a good phone now
and i think that it has the staying
power so even though we are hearing of
the samsung galaxy s3 coming up I think
for US cellular customers this would be
a good buy still this one is also a
little pricier it's 220 999 so 230
dollars after
$100 million rebate and that is with a
new two-year activation and Brian you
checked out okay so is this really the
full name motorola motor active moto
active gps fitness tracker and music
player is that really the full name on
the box well well actually i think it's
safe to say you can just call it the
motorola moto active the rest is you
know basically okay it's it's it's think
of it as a really beefy in apple nano I
you know ipod nano if that also has GPS
built in that has a Wi-Fi radio as well
as a bluetooth radio that comes with a
watch strap or at least you can get it
with that in the kit the whole thing
cost 249 for an 8 gigabyte version and
basically 299 for a 16 gigabyte version
and it's a music player see that costs
more than the phones I know I know right
I know I know well the thing is what it
does is it connects to only well only
fortunately connection Motorola phones
but what it's really for is for you to
track your fitness activity as as far as
workouts bike rides against sensors put
on your bike you can run with it its
water resistant and it tracks you via
GPS it also plays music that you can put
on to the device over USB and it will
actually monitor your performance so
that if you really kick in but to like I
have the tiger or I don't know what your
favorites that song it's definitely on
my workout mix right yeah it seems to be
a popular one but you know it basically
will listen to you and and figure out
what how well you perform to what songs
you're listening to on a device and it
will start to suggest a playlist for you
to keep you motivated it sounds a little
gimmicky but it's an interesting device
if you really want to track your workout
and also it ports over to the moto
active comm service web portal and you
can you know analyze your your workouts
there see how long you've been doing see
if you've got you know increase your
speed or your time or decrease your time
hopefully and they have a whole like 40
different activities
so basically you said it doesn't provide
casual activity tracking so what does it
not do well it doesn't uh kind of acting
oh my god I love it um yes so it doesn't
actually act like a like an all-day
activity tracker in that say if you have
a Fitbit device or some of the other
devices like the Nike FuelBand it won't
give you a sort of plan for just daily
activity and how much you need to move
to to really be in shape per day you
know as far as like a pedometer is
concerned so I can't say okay you need
to you need to work you need to move
around at least you know 10,000 steps a
day for you to lose 10 pounds you know
in 30 months there's 13 like a 30 days
or I don't know like three months or
something depending where the fitbit
will actually let you do that and other
devices i think do that too so that's
the one thing I mean it could easily do
that it's just a matter of software
because it tracks all your your steps
and everything already so it's a very
pricey device that's funky and
interesting but I think there's more
needs to be done on the back edge to
make it really really appealing to
everybody but if you really feel like
one of those triathlon super men or
women you you should probably check it
out because it definitely will give you
lots of information about your hardcore
workout and also mad respect to you if
you are so Lynn you checked out the ZTE
score could you give us the rundown of
that yeah this is a phone offered by
Cricket Wireless it comes packaged with
move music it's a music serie a music
subscription tie in the phone itself is
kind of slow and I don't really like the
display just the responsiveness is kind
of insensitive insensitive but not
really sensitive and also insensitive
but of and yeah I was kind of slow and
and the the I mean you reviewed the move
music before and we both aren't really
fans of the user interface it's kind of
clunky and I didn't really but I love
the concept of move music I think it's a
fantastic idea yeah I like that I mean
of course if you
huge fan of music and want to have
unlimited downloads of albums and
artists it's great for for that but as
for a phone with like smartphone
features with a touchscreen and a fast
processor this isn't really my favorite
yeah Linda actually gave it two stars I
think it's been a long time since we've
seen a phone renewed that low so the
bottom line is don't get this there are
other move music phones for cricket if
that's what you're interested yeah
there's actually like the ziti chorus
which is it has less features than the
score but the audio playback for the
music is so much better which was really
um odd oh well fascinating we got a
reader email that I want to share with
you guys um so this was from an
anonymous reader who's been nursing an
original verizon motorola droid oh yes
eid i knew it i knew their people out
there like that man there you go wants a
quad-core phone knows that there are
problems getting those two run on 4G
when do we imagine that a quad-core
phone will be released in the u.s.
because remember that the HTC One X is
quad-core outside of the US and will be
on a fast dual-core processor within the
US thanks that he or she can get the
phone to last through july so didn't you
see someone recently Jessica had a razor
like an old-school razor yeah I did
actually um so verizon motorola droid
wins yeah it was my my roommates friend
has this like seriously beat up original
RAZR and it's got chips taken out of the
paint I mean like you can barely read
basically like the thumb prints have
like worn away all of the writing on the
keypad and it is it looks like it's time
to change so I he was basically trying
to decide between iphone 4s and the
motorola droid razr and what did you did
you give him any advice i said sorry
Brian you were going to say something
well just gonna say it sounded like the
battle-scarred some sort of star
Wars technology you know like like Han
Solo's blaster or something yeah exactly
got all the scuff marks on it it's you
know it's like does he sleep with this
thing at night I feel like it's a prized
possession and I was trying to like you
know rip it away from his grasp um ah I
think that for him I think he would
enjoy the droid razr not max oh you're
recommending the droid razr yeah I
recommended the droid razr maxx but he
doesn't want to spend three hundred
dollars on it and he is not that
concerned with the battery life he
thinks he'll be able to plug it in and
have access to his charger frequently
and he actually doesn't I mean he's
using a motorola droid razr he doesn't
use Google Maps he's not using all of
the smartphone features so right now he
doesn't miss them but he's a fairly
young guy I think he is going to use it
I mean he's he's in his late 20s he's
going to use all of these features and
they're going to change his life he
doesn't have any other apple products so
I don't think it's imperative for him to
stay or even necessarily beneficial to
stay within that environment from an
environment standpoint and I don't think
he has especially strong feelings for
the iphone so i think if he's going to
go out and buy a new phone today for him
in his use case and his preferences and
his aesthetic i think that he would like
the motorola droid razr but onto our
anonymous reader a quad core do you guys
have any predictions when we're going to
get a quad core phone in the US I mean
I'm thinking my feeling is I don't know
obviously you don't know but I think by
June or at least by you know by ctia
that trade show that will happen may in
mid-may right um early May amazing yeah
that that is where care is going to drop
the news about what phone is going to
have quad-core that's where I'm thinking
well here you know what's gonna happen
with quad-core i agree with you
personally
so I clean wasn't there that I just
wrote up a quick post today this morning
about the HTC One X which there's a
rumor that it may show up on sprint but
that's dual-core that would be little
chorea yes Ali but I still but it could
be a very fast dual core and we may not
even notice it that's true I mean you
know I'm ER when dual core was the rage
right yeah that was a year ago core
black takes a while from the time they
announce things to the time that you get
it but if you can get your phone to last
through July then I think that that's
that's pretty safe I think you will
probably find what you want so that is
all for this show but a reminder if you
