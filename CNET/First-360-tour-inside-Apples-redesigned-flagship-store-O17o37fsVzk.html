first exclusive look at the Apple Store
Union Square preview here in San
Francisco doors will open on Saturday to
the public but this is your first look
inside this amazing piece of
architecture now look around me I'm in
the forum area this is upstairs in the
store behind me we have brown stools a
big the other screens is kind of
replacing their theater but if you kind
of turn your head around or move your
mouse around or whatever device you're
on look on the opposite side of me right
now and those are 42-foot glass sliding
doors that open 40 feet wide directly to
Union Square really connecting what is
outside to what is inside and this open
space Town Square field that Apple's
trying to accomplish is just something
that you have to feel to be in I know
I'm part of the Apple buy but this is
just an amazing store
now there's other sections here a back
area there's a plaza an outdoor space
that they've used they have a sculpture
there with mrs. Salwa so that's outside
that you can check out just to relax
there's other elements here there's a
Genius Bar they're now calling it the
genius Grove really again more open
space for you to hang out and get your
service done instead of you know
associated with a rowdy rambunctious bar
which it still can be but overall just
look around the floor level the upper
level this is an amazing store Apple
always tries to really draw people in
with flagship experiences like this and
they've absolutely accomplished this the
store again opens Saturday in San
Francisco in Union Square it's worth
checking out and I will be back</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
