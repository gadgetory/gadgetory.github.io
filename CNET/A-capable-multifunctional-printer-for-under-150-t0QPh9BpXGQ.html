printing technology in an all-in-one
inkjet this is definitely worth checking
out I'm Justin you with CNET and this is
a first look at the HP Envy 45 20
all-in-one printer you can get this for
less than 150 bucks which makes it a
good price for folks that don't want to
spend too much in a printer that they
may only use every once in a while but
that doesn't mean it can't do everything
that big printers can this is a printers
scanner and copy machine built into one
device the outside is a brand new design
for HP and this time they went with a
pretty low profile there's a usual
scanner lid up top a pullout drawer
underneath that can fit a hundred sheets
of paper and room on the back for a USB
cord and a direct connection to your
computer the face of the unit is really
bare with only one of the actual buttons
on the side to power it on all the other
controls happen through this 2.2 inch
monochrome LCD display I've looked at a
bunch of HP printers over the years and
this style just isn't my favorite for
usability there's a lot of deep menus to
scroll through and the small size screen
really makes it a little annoying to
navigate there's also some lag in the
responsiveness so the machine doesn't
always recognize it right when you push
down and with no way to make adjustments
to its sensitivity I wish they included
a few extra shortcut buttons on the
actual hardware thankfully the setup is
really easy you can either use the
software CD included to install the
drivers or you can download them off the
internet for the latest updates you can
print right away by hooking up a USB
connection but I recommend connecting
the computer to your Wi-Fi network so
you can print from the cloud you can do
that through either Apple air print or
Google Cloud Print from a Chrome browser
as well the 45:20 takes HP's upgraded
number 63 model ink cartridges that's a
new design for the company that
integrates the printhead alongside the
ink tank while also making technical
improvements to ink balancing as well as
end-of-life monitoring this printer is
also compatible with HP's instant ink
delivery system that's where HP will
track your usage levels and send you a
replacement inkjet cartridge in the mail
when you're running low there's a couple
different tiers based on how many pages
you think you'll print per month and you
can always adjust you're planning a time
choose you can check out more details in
my full review on CNET but that's going
to do it for me this is the HP Envy 45
20 all-in-one printer thanks for
