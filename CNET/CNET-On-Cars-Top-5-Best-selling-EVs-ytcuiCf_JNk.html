with the car buying public divided
between basically two forms of
incredulity one camp can't believe you
don't drive one the other camp can't
believe you fell for one
I'm Brian Cooley not here to settle that
argument but to give you a scorecard how
well the things are selling we're gonna
rank electric car sales by their 2014 us
full sales numbers for the year which by
the way amounted to about one and a half
percent of all new car sales leaving out
trucks and only about half a percent of
all new vehicle sales globally let's go
number five the Ford Fusion Energi
plug-in eleven thousand copies are so
were sold 19 miles on electric charge
and overall 88 MPGe now to most eyes
this is the best-looking car in the
affordable electric world but note it's
a plug-in not a pure battery car now the
Focus Electric which is pure battery
from Ford would come in a week eighth on
our list after the smart electric car
that has to hurt number four is Toyota's
Prius plug-in little over 13,000 sold
just six miles on a charge but
ninety-five MPGe now the standard Prius
that remains the undisputed king of
hybrids but this plug-in variant makes a
list of V's but just barely in terms of
sales kind of measly evey range that
battery does give it killer mpge
although it's gas mpg is about the same
as the regular Prius so there's a whole
lot of myth here no wonder it lags at
fourth and no wonder Toyota is in hot
pursuit of hydrogen right now as its
encore with the Prius
number three the Tesla Model S little
over 17,000 sold
265 miles of range is the big boy in the
list 89 MPGe from that the most lauded
car on our list
pure battery of course the highest range
as well if you have the money and want a
pure battery electric car this is your
benchmark it's also the only Eevee from
a company whose entire existence rides
on v's going big so all eyes are now on
the launch of the more affordable Falcon
wing door crossover Model X later this
year that will make the company more
than a one-note tune for the first time
in a number of years
number two the Chevy Volt little under
19,000 sold
gets 38 miles on a charge ninety-eight
MPGe
and it is of course not a pure battery
car but also a plug-in hybrid of the
range extender class with a gas engine
that is largely just used as a generator
yeah it's a bit of a complicated story
to tell even recent volt TV commercials
seem to admit that but these were
electric yes it's a Chevy Volt what are
you doing at a gas station the new model
we just saw unveiled in Detroit is going
to arrive soon with sleeker looks and
now a 50 mile electric range on a charge
before we hit number one the Eevee's
that sell so slowly you wonder why
they're sold at all include Porsches
Panamera S II at least if you buy a
Tesla 100,000 gets you an actual
electric car this just gets you a hybrid
and not the one you're wealthy greenie
friends are impressed by fewer than 900
last year Honda's Accord plug-in and fit
Eevee both around a measly 400 units
sold each year what can I say Honda has
never been great at selling anything ill
electrified and the Mitsubishi I need I
forgot they still sold this thing in the
US at 196 total units for the year
apparently you get is
well it looks like a prop from
Caddyshack not a real car and that
doesn't really fly in the US the number
one Eevee in 2014 by sales was the
Nissan Leaf over 30,000 moved out the
door it gets 84 miles on a charge and
has 114 MPGe the leaf was the sales
champ every month of the year except
December when Tesla had a spike this is
the Eevee to beat a sort of bookend in a
way to the Model S it's goofy-looking as
all get-out and rumor has it Nissan will
make the next version look more like a
car and perhaps offer a choice of longer
range battery packs but that's not for a
year or two so this is the one to look
at for a regular budget or top five
lists to wait the car lover go to scenic
