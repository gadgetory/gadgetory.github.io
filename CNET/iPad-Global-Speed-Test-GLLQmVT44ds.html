to our first ever ipad speed test
contest we're going to start right here
specifically San Francisco then we'll
travel to the UK Singapore and finally
Australia testing the iPads 4g speed or
whatever standard is available in sent
country will start first with download
speed through the speed test app what
we're looking at here is download speed
measure the megabits per second the
higher the number the better hey I'm
Luke here in London the 2012 Olympic
city and also in front of the beautiful
river Thames with the new iPad now we
don't get 4G yet here in the UK so the
vodafone sim card inside this is using a
3g connection all right let's take a
look at what kind of speeds we can get
high this Vincent in Singapore will be
testing the 2g download speed of the new
iPad
hello world Joe Hamlin here speed
testing the new apple ipad on a somewhat
sunny day here in Sydney Australia as
you may or may not have heard the new
ipad doesn't support our 4G networks
here in Australia so I'm going to be
testing on telstra as dual carriage
hspa+ network the theoretical maximum
speed of 42 megabits per second so let's
see how we go now that's what I'm
talking about the u.s. easily wins this
one and there's no second place because
as a great American hero once said if
you're not first you're last he was a
fictional character doesn't really
matter let's move on now synthetic
benchmarks are one thing but it's real
world benchmarks that really separate
the men from the boys so for our second
test we'll see who can queue up a
YouTube video the fastest
now keep an eye on a faint gray loading
bar the first country to load that bar
completely wins the YouTube loading text
it's just as we thought a good 3g
network our play is an average 4G
network any day of the week and you
should see our 4G network any
international viewers out there who want
the best cellular data speeds in the
world well you know where to come
speaking for my colleagues abroad i'm
eric franklin and thank you for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
