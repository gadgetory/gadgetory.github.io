likes and Twitter loses its mind I'm
Bridget Carey this is your scene that
update there are several wild tech
stories to talk about today but let's
start with one stirring up social media
controversy Twitter made a change to its
network that's making long time users
angry the star icon to indicate you
favorite a tweet is now a heart icon to
say that you liked it you may wonder why
anyone cares that an icon changed but
the problem some have is that not
everything deserves a love symbol the
star was a neutral way of acknowledging
you appreciated a post but with hearts
the meaning could change crossing over
into some possibly awkward territory but
today in social media we are throwing
hearts all over the place the icon is
losing all romantic meaning anyway
Instagram uses hearts as likes on
Twitter's periscope people pour streams
of hearts on top of videos twitter is
also changing vine so that it uses
hearts instead of smiley faces to make
everything hearts twitter is doing this
because it thinks new users will not
understand stars yeah that's what scares
me what is happening to society that
companies think we can no longer
understand stars it's as if executives
go into meetings believing that by
communicating with heart emoji more
people will use their network and Google
thinks we can no longer answer email for
ourselves yeah Google's artificial
intelligence is now able to offer
suggestions on how to reply to your
email based on what questions someone is
asking you so yeah it's reading your
email will you RSVP Google suggests
answers that say I'll be there or that I
won't make it is anyone looking into
this quickly reply with I'll check on it
or I'm on it the feature is rolling out
to google inbox app on Android and iOS
this week during early test google found
the Machine kept wanting to reply I love
you that's an option to everything but
it's working out those quirks so you
should still read through your email
before using a quick reply so you don't
accidentally tell your boss that you
love him meanwhile Microsoft is going
back on its promise to give office 365
subscribers unlimited online storage in
one dry
in a blog post microsoft says some
people were abusing the unlimited
storage so now subscribers only get one
terabyte for free but i have a hard time
buying this abuse excuse because
Microsoft is cutting back on plans
everywhere for two bucks a month you
could get a hundred gigs of storage but
next year two dollars will only buy you
half that 50 gigs also everyone got 15
gigs for free when they backed up their
photos but that's also being cut back
only five gigs free for everyone current
and new starting next year Microsoft
will be sending out notices if you are
using more space than is now permitted
warning you that you'll have a limited
amount of time to access your files
that's it for this tech news update was

York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
