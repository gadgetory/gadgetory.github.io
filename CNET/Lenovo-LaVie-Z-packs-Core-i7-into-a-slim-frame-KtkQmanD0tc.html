ackerman and this is the lenovo la vie z
this is a 13-inch laptop it's very thin
it's very light it weighs one point nine
pounds when you head to someone they
asked me go sista native plastic is it a
dummy mock-up it's a fully functioning
laptop even more than you might think
because unlike some other super slim
laptops that have Intel Atom processors
or Core M processors this one has an
intel core i7 from the current 5th
generation of those processes I've never
seen a chip so powerful in something
this small it's also getting better than
HD display non-touching this version and
256 gig SSD all that together it's 1499
at a premium price to be sure but you've
never felt anything with this
combination of power and portability you
know in the same package lenovo doesn't
actually designed to make these they
part of a partnership with NEC another
computer company so in japan these are
NEC models and outside of japan there
lenovo models and that's why you don't
get that great lenovo keyboard the
keyboard here is probably the one weak
point in the whole system i especially
hate this little tiny shift key on the
right side i'm always going up a line
instead of capitalizing a letter and
that really adds a lot to my typing time
other than that you do get very good
performance especially when compared to
something like that 12 inch macbook from
Apple which is even heavier than this in
fact I'm going to show you how all these
stack up and I'll prove it to you I've
got the scale and we'll put this guy on
the scale and he comes up at one point
nine pounds lenovo sells another version
of this called the levive z 360 and as
you might guess it is a hybrid version
with a hinge that goes all the way back
and has a touchscreen on it in a glossy
screen that weighs a little bit more
that's about 2.0 four pounds that's
actually exactly the same as the 12 inch
macbook weighs the same 2.0 four pounds
and of course you're more likely to
compare this to a regular macbook air
because they all have 13 inch screens
that thing feels like a pile of bricks
the macbook air which we used to think
of as super thin and light is 2.9 pounds
a full pound heavier than this guy right
here and unlike a lot of other really
slim light
laptops especially the macbook you get a
pretty good selection of ports here
you've got two USB 3 a full-size HDMI
and even an SD card slot of the two
versions of the live easy i think i like
the clamshell one better it is lighter
it's a couple hundred dollars less
expensive still super powerful for
something this thin in this light you
just have to put up with a really
annoying keyboard i'm dan ackerman and
that's the lenovo lavie z</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
