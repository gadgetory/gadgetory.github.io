networking and get ready for the launch
of a new type of mobile tool I am
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update here at cnet sometimes we come
across gadgets that just do one thing
really well and sometimes gadgets
combine two products and one but it's
not often you find a gadget that is four
things in one check out ZTE s live pro
projector hotspot now I got a demo of
this back in January at CES but sprint
just announced that it will sell the
mobile mashup it connects up to eight
devices to the internet as a hotspot it
can use sprint's faster 4G LTE spark
network where it's available it also has
a 4-inch screen like a small android
tablet with apps and as a projector it
can beam whatever you want to a nearby
wall and you can load it up with files
from an SD card or hook it up to an hdmi
cable so it's a hotspot projector
android tablet and what's the fourth
skill it's a portable battery you can
recharge your other gadgets off its
battery using a USB connection obviously
this is more of a work tool for
traveling presentations but it also
comes in handy if you want to stream
netflix for an impromptu movie night
when you're on vacation with the family
Sprint is selling it for 450 dollars or
it's three hundred dollars when you get
a two-year service agreement LinkedIn is
giving users a new way to stay in touch
with connections with a new app it's
called connected LinkedIn's old contacts
app has been updated and redesigned into
this connected app it puts a focus on
your existing relationships you can
check in to see what your connections
are up to so maybe you want to drop them
a line if there's something big going on
like a new job a work anniversary or
birthday and if you're going to meet
with someone the app will give you a
heads up of who else is in this meeting
so you can go in with more knowledge
it's like a new speed to make you better
at schmoozing this connected app is
right now just for the iphone in english
talking to your connections is one thing
but talking to your phone is another
sometimes
these voice assistant programs just
don't understand what we're trying to
say and google has added a new command
to help correct a misunderstanding on
google now you could follow up a voice
command with no I said so for example if
you say ok Google where is Santa Maria
but it didn't catch the Maria you would
follow up with ok Google no I said Santa
Maria you don't have to repeat the full
command but you'll still have to go
through the ok Google command each time
you speak that your tech news update and
get more details on these stories at
cnet com I can always keep up on Twitter
from our studios in New York I'm Bridget
