Bridget Carey on sina com and it's time
to get loaded google unveiled the new
Galaxy Nexus last night along with
Android 4.2 code name Ice Cream Sandwich
no word on price carrier or availability
of the Galaxy Nexus yet but the new
android operating system has several
notable changes such as instant talk to
type and some camera improvements the
front camera can track I movement and
rotate an image based on where the user
looks and if there are two people
hovering over the front-facing video
chat camera it'll focus on the person
who's talking also Android seems to have
borrowed from the best of the
competition much like a Windows Phone
the new andrew has people tiles and a
stream of social media updates in the
People app and much like HP's webOS if
you're done with the screen you could
just flick it away but one unique change
you can unlock a screen using the front
camera to detect your face let's just
hope you don't have an evil twin you may
find Apple stores closed for a few hours
today while employees watch a memorial
for the late Steve Jobs The Wall Street
Journal is reporting some apple stores
will close for at least an hour so
employees can watch a live video feed of
the Steve Jobs remembrance taking place
at the Cupertino headquarters today at
ten a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. eastern Apple
has not made any official statement
though about those store closures those
searches will now be more secure if
you're signed in to your Google account
by default all web searches will be
encrypted via a URL with HTTPS if you
don't have a Google account or if you're
signed out you could just mainly type in
the HTTPS in your URL to conduct a
secure search but of course once you get
to the destination it's not going to be
secure anymore Google already uses this
with gmail and facebook has the HTTPS
option as well so be sure to use it if
you're browsing through a public Wi-Fi
hotspot as Google results are getting
more personalized you don't want creeps
snooping in on your info the PlayStation
