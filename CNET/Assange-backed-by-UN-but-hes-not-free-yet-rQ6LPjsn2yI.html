a UN ruling which claims the WikiLeaks
founder has been arbitrarily detained
and should be allowed to walk free from
the ecuadorian embassy in london the
UN's working group on arbitrary
detention said that mr. Assange is
entitled to his freedom of movement and
to compensation however the ruling may
not change anything for a sand as the UK
government rejects the UN's claims
Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called
the UN's ruling frankly ridiculous in a
press conference today Assange disagreed
with that saying that following the
United Nations decision the question
over whether he's being unlawfully
detained is now a matter of settled law
Assange claimed asylum in the Ecuadorian
Embassy in 2012 and hasn't left since if
arrested Assange faces extradition to
Sweden over a rape claim the
controversial figure has said he is
concerned that being arrested would lead
to his being sent to the US where he
could be prosecuted for the 2010 leaking
of thousands of classified government
documents which is critics say has put
innocent lives at risk for now the
question over what should happen to
Assange as a kind of political stalemate
the UK says that a European Arrest
Warrant remains in force while the UN
says he should be allowed to leave for
now however it seems that Assange won't
be stepping out of the Ecuadorian
Embassy any time in the immediate future
