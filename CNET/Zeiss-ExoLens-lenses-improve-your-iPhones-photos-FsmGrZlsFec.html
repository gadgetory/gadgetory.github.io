natural pairing and now you can pop a
Zeiss lens on your iPhone for a little
variety in your angle of view I'm Laurie
grinning and these are the Zeiss EXO
lenses for iPhone the product of a
partnership between Zeiss and fellows
you know the office supply company Zeiss
is solution consists of the fellows
mounting bracket and its own lenses the
wide-angle lens which covers about 60%
more of a scene than the iPhone lens is
available now via Apple outlets and
it'll set you back $200 the macro lens
covers a varying angle of view between
one and four inches depending upon how
close you are and the telephoto has a
narrower angle of view by half than the
built-in version the latter two lenses
are slated to ship late this summer
overall it's a mixed bag the lenses
definitely allow you to get more
flexibility out of your camera and as
you'd expect the lenses are well
constructed of aluminum and glass in
fact with they're bundled lens hoods
attached they look like Zeiss high-end
ODIs line shrunk to lilliputian levels
and they're definitely sharp and clear
with no perceptible light loss color
artifacts or fringing but going with the
shrunken lens approach means tiny
untethered back caps that come off too
easily and lens caps that are easy to
lose the excellence screw on mount is a
pain for quick changes I prefer
competitor moments bayonet mount or
other snap or slide in approach and like
many of these the mounting bracket
blocks the iPhones flash so you have to
remove it if you just want to use the
base iPhone camera
