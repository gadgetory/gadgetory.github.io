brewing beer easier by offering you
prepackaged ingredients think of it like
a microwave for beer and now they're
letting you decide exactly what goes in
those packages of ingredients it's
called the Pico brew brew style and it's
a really cool web interface in which you
get to select your based style and then
add hops add mulch to your heart's
desire go going through the process you
start by picking your base beer we're
gonna pick this American IPA and then
you actually get to drag and drop the
different malts to build your grain
notice that as I drag and drop the malts
the ID use of the beer change the ABV of
the beer changes and the color of the
beer actually changes especially if I
take a chocolate malt and add it to the
beer notice speaker were actually trying
to a warned me against doing this but
I'm gonna go ahead and do it now notice
the beer is much darker and the stats
have all updated according to what I've
done once you select your grains then
you move on to picking your hops and
again you get to drag and drop the
different hops you want it'll give you a
warning if you're selecting too many of
a certain type and you do the same thing
with fermentation pick your yeast you'll
notice the price always updates as
you're adjusting things then once you're
done picking your hops for dry hopping
you actually get to name your beer will
of course call this Andrews awesome beer
then notice on the checkout page that
the Pico pack actually has the name of
my beer right on it so I'm really
excited about this system and how it
allows prospective Brewers to try their
hand at tinkering with recipes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
