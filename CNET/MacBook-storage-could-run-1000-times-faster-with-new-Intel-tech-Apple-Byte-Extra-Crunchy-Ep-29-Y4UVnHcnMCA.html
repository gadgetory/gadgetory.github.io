you guys we want to hear your thoughts
you're just as much of an expert as we
are so we're going to jump into this on
this 29th episode and we start with this
week the big kind of announcement from
apple they have officially revealed like
we've been talking about for like two or
three weeks that their apple event will
be held on March 21st that is a monday
in the past days yeah they've normally
don't like on a Tuesday but it's a
Monday it'll be held at their
headquarters in Cupertino California not
their new headquarters that crazy UFO
but the Cupertino headquarters March
21st of course I'm not going to be a
spoiler here but I am we're expecting to
see a 9.7 inch iPad pro and again a 9.7
inch iPad pro the iphone s ii they're
taking the five out from all reports
that that was actually from nine to five
mac a couple weeks ago it'll be a 4-inch
iphone and then Apple watch bands Apple
watch bands different colors different
styles
see this is one of those events that you
wish they kept a secret because I'm
going down the line just saying that out
loud and my soul is hurt doesn't sound
it's like this is sound too exciting
it's like I'm gonna be curious how many
of you all tuned in we are going to be
here live as usual seen it does a live
show coverage at live cnet com we also
do in our YouTube channel on livestream
during the keynote before and after but
man that you can just release that stuff
without even a keynote I was reading the
article Scott Stein wrote about the
invitation he's like the loop you in
what does that mean could it mean a
little loop added back to your phone
again a little like a little protective
loop thing yeah that's cool like that's
not exciting at all that's our
shattering a lot of you have been asking
me on the twitters and just over email
yeah people still use email these days
create believe it or not they've been
asking about what's going on with the
macbooks everyone's hoping to see
macbooks but we don't expect to see any
macbooks at this event just yet so it's
more likely gonna happen at WWDC so I'm
just trying to brace you all in case
you're really looking forward to
something and you're hurting inside yeah
just brace yourself this is not
innovation this is just vation it's just
it's there so this is for the
stockholders may be right man that's
talking going up with that I know also
just a quick thing just give you a peek
about what's going on with the ipad pro
9.7 inch a lot of rumors are pretty much
taken the fact that this is an iPad that
will be just a miniaturised version of
the pro the one that I love and like
with speaker for speakers and we have a
case here that's been leaked out by a
French website I Jen that is believed to
be the case of the ipad pro 9.7 inch
with holes specifically for the smart
connector that is the connector that
allows you to dock it into their
keyboard there have been no revelations
of a keyboard case that we've seen yet
but logically there will be one thats
sized for the 9.7 inch ipad pro so
that's going on there confirming
everything to believe also pencil
capability very important very and
rumblings of a improved I think it's a
12 megapixel camera that is better than
the camera on the iPad pro which hurts
my soul because i bought the ipad pro my
love the ipad pro for its very specific
uses which i've talked about for me just
reading comics basic quickly it's like a
big improvement in the camera like a
like a real big enough where you could
record 4k video oh yeah that's a big one
cinnamon scent cinematographer from my
ipad pro yo oh man i'm feeling sorry for
you right now what a jerk what a jerk so
we expect to see that and then obviously
iPhone se cases they're the kind of leak
in online similar shape to the iphone 5
rounded edges but no one's have no one
has really there's been ideas and
renders but no one's really shown off
enough to be like this is exactly what
the iphone 5 e is gonna look like
alright this is probably um maybe to me
the most exciting story of the week this
is Intel's a new obtained memory
technology just recently announced that
a branded as obtained expected to launch
in 2017 now why why should you even care
about this reportedly it could lead to
1,000 times faster macbook storage based
on this new technology now here's what's
going on with Apple right now they
recently released an update a software
update for their 12-inch MacBook that's
super slim one that would be able to
support what's called the protocol is
that nvm e so this is like non-volatile
memory express support it's a faster way
you know to access and get your memory
now the previous technology exists in
some of the older macbooks but why is
this important thousand times faster
memory on your macbook not only is it
supported right now in the macbook 12
but we know that new macbooks are coming
out in the summer most likely in june
and this technology will be compatible
with that and most likely in these new
macbooks so 1000 times i don't even know
what that feels like yeah what does that
feel like so you go to drop like a large
video file and just boom it's done what
have you done anything in your life that
was a thousand times faster than before
no I have actually yeah yes it's a piece
of / it's a personal thing let's not get
into that may be flying on a plane
before that you were like
there were like wagons back in the day
now just flying on a plane so thousand
internet moto moto like a 28 8 modem
yeps and compared to now that's like
that's like thousand times faster okay
so I have experienced that in two
instances in my life one that we will
not care to talk about them your beams I
know I've never experienced so this is
coming out again in 2017 the technology
should be available and already like I
said the new macbook 12 inch macbook is
enabled with this support for
non-volatile memory express with that
software update that happened last april
so what a time to be alive it's pretty
cool science stuff love it not going to
affect us now but will come into play in
the future let's talk more future let's
talk way down we haven't even seen the
iphone 7 but the big rumors coming to us
from our friends at digit times we like
to mix the pot up i don't know if you've
read this heard this a five point eight
inch iphone with an oled display is
rumored for launch in 2017 or 2018 now
we heard a maybe about a month ago
remling that apple was going to finally
use oled displays in their iphones
around 2018 so this story piggybacks on
that but why a five point eight inch
screen everyone that sounds just
enormous just the two but do you want a
five-point a niche phone nah man nah man
not man big my ice eps i need to work
out my ice eps this is a real thing man
I said I SEPs so here's here's one way
though how this could make sense and
it's not by that much of a stretch
either you have apples patents they have
a variety of patents from the past that
might indicate maybe what they were
thinking and one of their patents first
of all talks about how there would be a
iphone that was buttonless right it
would have no physical buttons and used
the edges of the display there would be
a ton set touch sensitive layer inside
that those edges that would allow you to
do things like change the volume use as
a music player on the edges of your
iPhone very cool what would that require
something like this a screen that is
large enough that would have to wrap
around the edges but then if you look at
another pad that they have that was kind
of for multiple different shapes
designs these are patents that have been
granted to Apple Apple is has already
put into their thinking caps of how they
could wrap o display entirely around a
phone or to the edges I haven't seen a
phone like that where the screen goes
all the way to the edge don't know what
someone would call a phone like that
with an edge yeah kind of baffles my
mind yes but check out the review on
cnet seen that Samsung s7 edge so these
are things that Apple's been thinking
about a five point eight inch there's no
way in my mind that you make a five
point eight inch phone that is flat like
that's just the current design it would
have to have some sort of edge
capability so that might be where
they're going the other thing that is
interesting to me is the whole oled
display conversation Apple has been
using lcds for quite some time we've
talked about how oled you know perform
versus lcds once more power efficient
when you have more you know of a white
when the screen is dominated with
lighter colors or white ones more
efficient with colors and battery and
energy efficiency but see the real
underlying thing behind this is that at
Samsung's keynote Mark Zuckerberg
remember do you remember when he kind of
ripped on the iphone yeah definitely
yeah so he he basically ripped on them
because he said the right now the gear
VR only supports Samsung phones because
they have the best screen technology the
best which is oled display yes that
support this with rear end that they
were going to eventually put OLED
screens into the oculus too right
exactamundo so so apples like you know
they've been putting the caps on Apple's
watching very carefully okay we need a
do vr is i think only it was literally I
mean of course they've been looking at
vr let's not be silly or AR augmented
reality or virtual reality depending on
what we played argue they've been doing
AR but with with app app developers have
been doing AR yes the iphones abso
absolutely yes so then then they're
really pushing an OLED display if Apple
wants to be part of this conversation
with VR they've got to have the tech but
to support it and so no wonder all of a
sudden and OLED in 2017 I mean my
goodness how long has have other phones
had 0 leads
for years don't tell about lee three
lads him I mean AB absolutely absolutely
we're gonna wear you know whenever we
say the word absolutely I it's a dim
it's a man date on this show you have to
say it absolutely absolutely if you call
in this show and you leave a message
what's our phone number I have to always
look it up 1 806 ick 16 to see 638 you
have to say app absolutely so there you
go Apple 55.8 inch OLED displayed iphone
rumored launch 2017 2018 we'll see how
that all comes together if it actually
does have seems so far away I don't know
I don't know what the people I'll ask
the people that are watching here live
what they think you know is it really
something that they really believe Apple
is going to do would they create a third
phone in their family i ho iphone 7
iphone 7s iphone 7 oled like special
edition oh that would be would they
actually do that I don't think so yeah I
don't know okay let's keep on going
iphone 7 this is actually a phone that
is expected to come out this year
amazing that we can actually talk about
this an early iphone case has been shown
on the interwebs this is a thanks to
steve hoffman i cant even my eyes are a
what does it say Steve hema Stoffer
hammer staff reversed offer again so a
lot of times people are we gonna say
look at all the holes on that thing man
but look there's actually less holes
than you would want there is no
headphone jack port in there only a
single Lightning port on that case
there's only there are two speakers on
the bottom of the grill so you're
actually getting speaker you get here we
get your getting stereo audio from your
phone at least if you hold it from the
coming from the bottom so you're getting
that but again only one single Lightning
port and a lot of times that it's a big
lightning port though it is a case yeah
so I don't know which lends us to the
guy always that I think I made a did I
make a prediction that there might be
two lightning port that's true you did
oh are you trying to tell me that there
might
big look at that look how big this thing
is I don't know it's not hard to tell
what the scale is on a image on the
computer but you're all dude this thing
looks huge on my 16gb yeah like I always
get the whole dude I I thought you're a
lot taller than you are I'm like yeah
it's cuz you're watching me on a TV
screen yeah I thought you're a lot
bigger than you were not really like
seven inches tall sorry brah iin six
feet I ain't six feet um so if you a lot
of times these leaked case rumors though
are pretty accurate so lending credence
to the fact that will probably get a no
headphone jack it's gonna happen I'm so
I'm still curious what the price of that
adapter is gonna be if you lose it 20
2013 19 that is brutal it's the classic
that is so brutal I know alright if you
guys like them the show MythBusters this
might be the show ended its wrapped up
yeah we actually had a Adam Savage here
in our headquarters at seen that
recently talking about that but why is
this a myth why are my saying myth
busted Apple software senior VP says
quitting multitasking apps is not
necessary and won't offer improve
battery life so we know I've done it I
know you've done it where you're like
hanging out and all of a sudden you're
like swipe your your double tapping your
home button and you're swiping away at
all those apps are in the background
because you think they're using more
power right yeah I do it cuz I think
they're just slowing my phone down
correct right that's you know they're
occupying ram you know they're they're
taking their taking up resources on the
phone someone from nine to five maca
reader basically emailed Tim Cook
directly saying do you quit your iOS
multitasking apps frequently and is this
necessary for battery life just writing
just wanting you to put this controversy
to rest because there's always been a
debate instead Craig federighi the man
with the world's way viest hair jumped
in and said no and no lie just that's
like Steve Jobs style answering emails
just like three basically get it done in
three words right three words occasional
smiley face occasionally and there have
been stories that i've talked about if
you actually swipe up and quit out some
of those apps remove some of those apps
what happens is it technically resets
the app so
some of the resources it needs to
download to start up again ends up in
the long run requiring you to use more
battery life to essentially like reboot
that app get it back up to speed
download the music glad you put the
story in the news yet does it gonna help
you is this actually happened to me
yesterday when my phone died when we
were coming back from a video shoot and
I went to start a nap and my phone just
died right there as the app is starting
I'm like maybe like it used power to
start that app you know so that's funny
so uh friend on the periscopes all but
the app is still open its using the
internet when it's there i'ma no it's
it's actually in a frozen state yeah
it's literally frozen enough that's so
interesting so don't do that just don't
do that that's why your video stops
playing when you do that right cuz it
would keep playing if it was running on
the background you are correct videos
that you can also watch on great
websites like cnet com yes they will
pause for you so they can continue them
later so that we get that what's that
metric we want completion rate pletion
rate the solution right to us this is
some insight serious inside baseball so
just for the record if you decide to
stop the podcast now don't just let it
play out and listen to it so that we get
a completion please let it finish it's
very important alright here's a fun
story very classic apple apple approved
this past week an app called flex bright
for iOS that adjusts your display
temperature why is this really cool well
in iOS 9.3 and their beta that they've
shown off they've shown at this feature
called night shift on the night shift
you know that's all oh that nice I
think it's a Lionel Richie song could be
yeah or is it a Commodore song I was it
wasn't a come-on yeah he was well you
guys are the commoners i think it's i
think it's the Commodore it's the
Commodores but anyways they approve this
app which allows you to change the color
temperature of your screen but then they
have this right really cool because we
know how they talk about how when you
stare at your screen that the blue light
messes with your biorhythms and you get
crappy Slee you can't sleep it keeps you
up I know this for a fact I do it all
the time still to this day I think I was
up to like 130 last night that's why
can't well that's why I came into work
late and you were like are you coming in
yeah I was like his Bryant on here today
maybe we're not going
do a show we always bring the crunch man
we always bring that crunch so Apple
then was like oh wow we well we actually
put this feature in iOS 9.3 let's take
down the app oh my why would they do
that's take it take it down so it's such
a but hang on a second hang on bro well
what what what could this possibly be
just tell me hang on just I'm hanging on
I'm waiting on hey man what is that
that's a bad apple Brian she'd be
screaming in the back it's a bad apple
so they took it down and then they made
a statement that says iOS apps that
adjust display temperature aren't
allowed well then why did they improve
in the first place mr. Brian Tom because
they had this cool guy working for them
that was like I'm gonna push this up to
I'm gonna push this after uh and he
pushed it through and then not cool guy
saw it and said no you're gonna do that
is that that's a whole wing damn it's so
crazy based on my sources what exactly
how went down Wow anyways flex bright if
you got it you were lucky also for the
record apples night shift feature is a
rip off from efflux which is you know
outside of the parameters of the app
store oh man hang on Brian hang on are
you getting second tired of this oh I
needed it I need another one of those
I'm sorry okay it's just it's just a bad
situation all right so I knew have for
developers I mean I know you know I got
it I got good news for you though okay
we've got a story for all you basketball
fans March Madness actually don't have
to be a basketball fan of like march
madness because a lot of times is just
all about picking who wins and who makes
money finally a use that makes the
appletv the new Apple TV compelling you
know you got to have these little
nuggets you have to have these apps that
kind of bring it bring it to the top
March Madness 2016 coming to the apple
TV with an exclusive split screen
feature that's a big deal this is
awesome that's a huge win I love this I
love this so basically if you have a
cable subscription you sign in with your
credentials you use the NCAA march
madness live app you'll be able to then
obviously log in and watch multiple
games at the same
time I'm ground so that's what the split
screen is its multiple games it's not
like stats and stuff on the other screen
also there is app support for the Apple
watch so users get alerts an update sent
straight to their wrist it supports I
the iOS app supports airplay as well but
at least the dedicated Apple TV app does
a split screen I know this is probably
the biggest piece of information that i
can't find right now but it I believe
it's going it doesn't say if it's just
for the new Apple TV it appears to speak
for the Apple TV in general hmm so if
I'm wrong you throw a bad apple out at
me but from what this article says it
looks like it just supports the apple TV
it's going to also be the split screen
is exclusive though to the apple TV hmm
that's cool pretty sick yeah if you like
march madness you know what's also sick
hmm phone calls phone calls are sick
phone call we love the calls you guys
continue to make this show pop come
alive I know one of you told one of your
friends to listen because based on who's
listening there's a lot of people
listening now yes we're digging it so um
let's just get the phone calls and see
what people have to say the number again
for you guys to be a part of this show
and gals we love it we got to represent
our ladies as well because I know
there's some apple by two ladies out
there yeah we got some we do 1 800 61 62
63 it's phone lines let's just go at it
all right here we go oh this is the this
is Lynn from denton texas talking about
how he uses his ipad and how he needs a
fancy ipod camera so here we go hello
Brian Steven this is Lynn from denton
texas i get a little bit of an insight
as to why you might want any actual
really good camera or maybe even up / on
my pad I know somebody taking using it
for taking pictures of the video this
seems absurd but I have a visual
difficulties and I use an iPad as a
magnifying device and the better quality
the camera the better magnification I
can get the clear the picture is so then
I can see for my school work in college
and even to see a presentation across
the room I can hold up an iPad and use
it in that respect now keep in mind i'm
not snapping pictures out in public with
it you know getting in everybody's way
it's for studying and usually held right
in front of me so it's not anything
crazy like that so un just thought I'd
pass it along guys great show that's
pretty awesome I you know using it for
that application is great but you don't
have to lie Lin I know you've taken
pictures of your iPad he's like I don't
I don't I pray to someone and some
people like dude why are you hating on
people that take pictures of with iPad
so much and it's just one of those
things that is just funny and silly to
me I don't have anything personal
against you I just think it looks
ridiculous to hold an iPad and block
basically the vision of everyone behind
you because you're taking this picture
with your iPad yeah you're only a giant
computer in your hand up in the air it's
funny I come I can rip on that you can
too no that's that's that's very
interesting Lin had no idea ipads are
being used in that way so that's cool
yeah okay let's check out the next call
from Jack Gaffney i buy I Stephen this
is Jack Daphne and I'm a longtime
listener of the Apple buy extra country
podcast and I was calling to give a bad
apple to Apple I recently went online
and complete the apple sales training
program and reached a level Apple
product professional but they don't give
out Apple product professional kits
anymore where you get a certification in
a label pin in the mail anymore and they
stop doing that after the end of last
year into this year and I just think
that deserves a bad apple okay Joe yeah
I'm gonna fulfill Jack's wish here as I
queued this up so there you go Jack wow
that was a forceful one so Jack in honor
of you we are going to celebrate
you're passing of the apple sales
training online program with a round of
applause congratulations congratulations
jack you are the man you are the man
people are just tuning in not tuning in
watching they're like wait you can
actually call in with bad apples yeah
you could call them whatever you want if
you want dating advice on the show will
help you out too yeah he was like yeah
I've been dated yea years but I even
like I'm the one that has to filter
through these calls thanks thanks Brian
really appreciate I love it i'm laughing
at my dad and giggling inside of my desk
when I hear this so yeah bat out we want
it again this is your part of this show
just as much as we are watch our next
show it's gonna be like it's got a bat
out before you were just talking about a
bad apple we like good apples to give us
some good apple yeah we like we like it
all oh you can help yeah I don't think
we'll be hearing any after this March
twenty first event though just for the
record oh yeah that's gonna be a fun one
all right okay last call is from I don't
think he left his name hey Brian what
will happen it's obeys the FBI hmm if we
learn we don't know either we don't know
Congress why they're throwing it out to
Congress to make a decision on this
whole Apple versus FBI case we don't
know if they'll rule in favor of Apple
or the FBI and also sounded like you
were eating an apple while did you hear
that crunch eating something sure
something yeah something was going on
while he was eating but uh do you think
is it possible that i mean if Apple
really is just like no we're not gonna
do this like can someone go to jail if
it if they rule in favor of it be I
don't know who would I how about this we
don't know the actual penalty right cuz
you can be held in contempt try would be
called being held in contempt i but they
can't necessarily say you're going to
jail it would be it would be something
else we actually need our league line or
something
maybe if I'm we need we need someone who
actually has some legal experience
that's please or a friend to chime in
actually I have a buddy that I might we
might be able to talk to uh maybe we can
line them up as a guest that'd be cool
no he's a legit lawyer oh I think I know
you're talking about g-money Gil yes see
we have another pressing oh my god so um
but anyways if you if you have any
knowledge on what really can happen
potentially there's probably multiple
permutations that are going on yeah just
give us a call give us a call people are
saying the scope crash periscopes been
crashing on me a lot recently really the
latest update might suck maybe that's
what it is could be I need maybe I'll
just use a different phone maybe yeah
houses all right everybody um I'm good
right now are you gonna think I think
we've handled all of our business we
have handled all the business today here
on the Applewhite extra crunchy again we
will be back every week sometimes
Thursday sometimes Friday it just
