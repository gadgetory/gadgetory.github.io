thanks so much for watching this is the
complementary piece to the apple byte
video podcast again this is a show that
is all about you it's all for you call
us out 1 800 61 62 63 8 that's where you
can leave us your name where you're from
your comments your suggestions your tips
maybe your experiences just whatever you
want to talk about here on the apple
byte extra crunchy we want you to be a
part of it um but let's just get right
into the show and I don't know if you
guys have been reading the news no can
you avoid this whole WikiLeaks can is
anyone safe if you haven't heard about
the WikiLeaks story that means you just
are you clearly are completely off the
grid and the only thing you listen to is
our show yeah you can't escape it right
well now I'm full circle it's on our
show now it is so now you can't you
can't escape it but here's basically
what happens if you're familiar with
WikiLeaks they're known for releasing a
lot of high-profile top-secret documents
whether it's from the government from
other entities you have things like the
Hillary Clinton Chairman's campaign
Chairman's emails that were leaked out
you have things as far back as 2007
where there were Baghdad airstrikes they
actually released a video evidence of
this but now WikiLeaks just of just a
few days ago made a claim and they
released thousands and thousands of
documents tying the CIA Central
Intelligence Agency and their Allied
intelligence groups and the different
method detailing specifically the
different methods that they are using or
have been using to either get access to
your smartphone's your computers even
your cars and your Smart TV
and everyone was like whoa what is going
on what are these vulnerabilities you
know who what are we susceptible to I'm
going to kind of talk about a couple
just to give you a scope of what they
were able to do and how they were
detailed so one of their programs was
basically called Wrecking Crew explains
how they crash targeted computers and
then another tells them how to steal
passwords using the autocomplete
function on Internet explorer they had a
method with your smart TV okay this is
pretty this is pretty wild with your
smart TV they're able to basically use
your smart TVs microphones and listen
use them as like a smart bug in your
home whether the TV was on or off like
this is documented that's gleam am
documented a different med and again
this is not just a few methods we're
talking about hundreds and hundreds of
methods and yes we know this stuff has
been going on for a while but for it to
actually be brought to light the
specific ways that they did some of
these things that's what makes it we've
always suspected but no one has said
this is officially exactly what they do
this is what they call it this is a
document that included seven what is it
7818 web pages 943 attachments all part
of this first installment of a larger
collection of secret CIA material of how
they went on to hack our devices and
gadgets now the CIA claims they're never
going to confirm that the documents were
actually accurate there's analysts that
have been looking at them and they have
said they believe that these are in fact
true and and real documents but let's
just talk about how this affects you and
maybe how vulnerable are you really all
to this Apple directly responded right
off the bat of how how you might be
vulnerable but Apple is says in a
statement to TechCrunch that most of the
vulnerabilities in the WikiLeaks docs
have already been patched and so of
course this isn't stuff that they might
have collected just yesterday and posted
this is stuff that takes over time it's
really like a treasure trove of
documents but this is um Apple's comment
there's this official statement to
TechCrunch they say Apple is
committed to safeguarding our customers
privacy and security the technology
built in today's iphone represents the
best data security available to
consumers and we're constantly working
to keep it that way they continue to
kind of go on while our initial analysts
indicates that many of the issues leaked
today we're already patched in the
latest iOS we will continue to work
rapidly to address any identified
vulnerabilities we always urge customers
download the latest iOS to make sure
they have the most recent security
updates so that's the statement directly
from TechCrunch that was going to be my
question did Apple patch this after
these docs were linked or leaked or did
they patch this before so that just
answered my question they Pat it
beforehand the last but did they also
see what came out yesterday and then go
and like fix things Oren well I think I
think it's probably a running situation
because just earlier today as of
Thursday Julian Assange who is you know
the face the man behind WikiLeaks did
announce that WikiLeaks is going to
provide tech firms so we're talking
about the apples the googles and the
samsung's they're going to provide them
access with more detailed information
from these documents that they have that
they have not released publicly to allow
these companies these large corporations
to fix some of these vulnerabilities
that maybe they have not addressed now
we know that always helping with it and
here's the thing though right you never
know how much he's actually helping I
mean Julie Julian Assange has many
different motives um he we know he's not
the squeaky clean character is doing
this you know to be a righteous person
uh but at the same time at least because
he said tech companies are reaching out
to them and saying how how do we fix
this how can we fix this he's going to
give them the access to the actual
documents so that they can at least
address the issue because see in his
he's he tends to obviously be
anti-government right he's trying to
show unearthed may be hidden agendas
consequat unquote conspiracies or
information that we don't know about to
the public and bring it to the public
light so you know you know you know
interesting way he it is in his best
interest to help
companies because he's so
anti-government yeah true definite so i
found that kinda be kind of to be i'm an
interesting twist but again wikileaks
will work with tech companies based on
these hacks but a lot of people are
wondering like I mean think about that
smart TV one though even when she's off
I mean you know I have an echo in my
house and well yeah you know I'm not
hiding anything I'm not saying anything
dangerous or anything in my house are
you sure that you know their willful you
that echo in your bedroom no no but um
but you know I mean it's still like Phil
you feel feels kind of icky knowing that
could be like some NSA nerd like
listening to me and my family or
something you know but well I think that
I think the premise that we all have to
go under is that everything is hackable
ya know for anyone to say that nothing
is hackable just not true right
everything is hackable and then on top
not only that on top of that we by using
these listening devices trust me I'd be
the first person to say i love my echo I
think the Google home is great too i use
my echo more because you know it it's um
it's just linked up better the google
home still has a ways to go for
compatibility but when we buy these
products and we put a listening device
in our home I mean come on you're no I
know you're you are asking for you're
basically saying I'm letting a company
potentially here they're probably
listening the apple byte right now well
you know there was that case recently
where there was a murder I figure what
state had happened there was a murder
and the prosecutors were trying to
subpoena the recording from the Amazon
echo that was in the room when this
supposed murder supposedly happened
whatever so there was the amazon was
ready to go to court like fight me like
no this is a private you know this is
private information to this person who
bought our device but then the person in
question was like fine yeah take my echo
and take the echo information i don't
care so then amazon like backed off and
was like okay we're not going to fight
this we're just going to let it play out
he gave permission to release this
information so we're going to back off
we're not going to let the the court set
a precedent for what's going to happen
in this sort of case you know so it's
just kind of interesting like I wonder
what would have happened if you fought
it I'm sure Amazon would have fought it
too
I you know and even if if um these
prosecutors do get this data it's not
like a voice recording of some you know
it's not like a voice recording it's
like we're gonna get a bunch of script
you know like with words and stuff you
know II mean it's not gonna be like a an
audio file or anything but I just think
people shouldn't be naive to the fact
that we are connected to tech that can
be hacked at any time have you have you
heard of a video game called watchdogs
that's what we're talking about okay but
but the body's not TV being turned off
and it's still recording you that is
like the creepiest that's like criminal
on the TV manufacturers part you know
what I mean that is that is pretty that
is without a doubt that is probably like
11 of the wilder things that I could
think of right I can't believe that yeah
yeah I can't believe it all right let's
uh when we talk about devices we
obviously can't go a show at least right
now without talking about the iphone 8
or the iphone x you know what actually I
need to pull this up while we're talking
I am I did a fun casual Twitter poll
related actually know what maybe I
should get to the story first before I
before I bring that up is that a good
idea yeah probably okay here's the
latest added line with the iphone 8
according to Macotakara japanese based
website that is continue to feed a lot
of rumors in the mackerel in most of
them have been pretty accurate
historically the iphone 8 could
reportedly be called the iphone edition
and ship well after ship well after the
4.7 inch and 5.5 inch versions that is
according to Macotakara the thinking is
that the iphone this new higher-end
premium 5.8 inch model would be similar
to how they named the apple watch
edition therefore the thinking is that
the Apple phone iphone could be called
the iphone edition I think that's the
worst name man hahaha is the worst name
is it really the worst name I think so I
don't know if this doesn't have like a
there's no like excitement to it the
iphone edition like what does that mean
that's bunk that's bunk okay so once
that article came out i threw out a poll
on
Twitter to the apple byte nation and I
asked them basically reports claim that
the next flagship iPhone could be called
the iphone edition what do you think
they should call it and I gave everyone
a few options we start off with the
iphone 8 iphone x iphone edition and
iphone future a total of 1500 people
responded so i want to know first of all
between those four Beecham 8x addition
in future which one you think one I i
accidentally already saw the results
sorry this room I just meant I just
loaded your tweet then the results
popped up but yeah the winner by fifty
three percent is the iphone X and
remember I'm sorry we started that long
ago it's awesome I mean it might have
been at least three or four months and
now some publications are using it I'm
not gonna say we started it but I'm
gonna say no did ya just say he we
started we started so fifty-three
percent came in with the iphone x thirty
percent came in with the iphone 8 the
iphone edition got thirteen percent of
love and then four percent was the
iphone feature i did get some funny some
funny comments because now people like
always like to kind of chime in and
write stuff in their own one of them let
me see if i can find it or not if I
can't oh well it's just this is too bad
someone just called it like the iphone
just works um someone called the iphone
s.h.i.t because hey because hate it
because haters gonna hate someone called
the iphone Deez Nuts edition Deez Nuts I
would have call it the iphone Oh Joe I
don't know that just popped in my head
while we're talking the iphone Oh Joe in
a cop-out would be hot I've oh no Joe
you know that's from a dodgeball right
that's how the Ocho I just pumped in my
head I phone Oh Joe that sounds cool to
me do you remember that though is like
the ESPN was covering the dodgeball
tournament and it was on because there's
so many ESPN put on ESPN the ocho that's
hilarious it's so good alright so my
phone acts literally is taking the cake
I don't know what you guys all think
about that someone call it
Trump phone come on the Trump phone died
yeah why is it why it's always gotta be
polite alright more stories around the
iphone 8 future iPhones could support
it's about time 4k graphics and much
faster gaming this is from a row actual
announcement and release from
imagination technologies that their
next-generation GPU architecture that is
currently in the current line of iPhones
their next-gen architecture is called
the power vr Furion if you are i am
theory yes burien the architecture will
offer up to seventy to ninety percent
improvement in real-world gaming
performance includes thirty five percent
better shader performance and eighty
percent better fill rate basically
you're getting a better looking product
currently the GPU architecture that is
used as part of the apple iphone is
their series 7 x t so the logical
thinking would be ok they have this new
power vr fury and architecture it'll be
in their series 8xt GPU that is again
they have a custom-designed version of
it for the iphone according to
imagination technologies though the
series 8xt will be announced in mid 2017
and they don't expect it to be available
until the end of 2018 at the earliest so
these advancements of uh in graphics
that we're talking about you will not
see them iphone 80 bomberman i just i
just wanted to mess with you you
basically will not see them at all
Furion sounds cool though I want the
Furion man now you down with fury yeah
also report 3d sensor production ramp-up
suggest that the iphone 8 will launch
later than September so this has been
kind of floated around a little bit
where we know that they have kind of the
standard 4.7 inch phone and the 5.5 inch
phone and now we're talking about this
premium OLED 5.8 inch phone and so from
that they're saying that the actual 3d
sensing camera chip will be from st
micro electronics and this is this whole
facial scanning with the rumblings that
they're going to completely get rid of
the touch ID button and no
home button there's gonna have to be
another biometric way to confirm you so
the rumors that they will be using some
sort of a front 3d depth sensing camera
system to unlock your phone potentially
and it's expected to be a new feature
but again because of the actual timing
of those components and the timing of
the iphone 8 we might we might see an
announcement but the iphone x we're
gonna call it the iphone x that that
could be coming a little later in
September not or maybe not even ready
for the month in September hmm I'm a
little afraid of the bio you know the
bio on the a lot like facial recognition
unlock no I don't you think that's
better than a fingerprint though if it's
fat like have you seen Samsung's is
really fast yes fast it depends on how
accurate it is because I could see like
people waking up early in the morning
and just look all a crappy and like this
your phone gonna recognize you or you
know Microsoft has hello also so someone
who's thrown it out there like Hello
Microsoft has that as well I'm like yes
they do they do on their laptops is that
the only way to unlock don't it's not
the only way I mean you can still always
you can always verify it right with uh
with your an actual passcode believe it
or not those still work okay good right
it's ice codes are still around sweet
pass codes are so 2015 so 2015 so we'll
see what happens over there let's take a
break to show some love to our sponsors
that make this show hop in and pop in
technology has changed the way we run
thanks to smartphones now even casual
runners can map the routes create pumpup
playlist and track their progress
however taking advantage of all these
technologies as mean stopping a look at
your phone which means you lose your
motion and your momentum like if you're
a runner this actually sucks okay but
now there's Mara a hands-free running
assistant that uses voice recognition
and the microphone in your ear buds to
help you optimize your runs take it away
beat them take it away from optimize
your runs additional info you can you
can tell her what kind of run you'd like
to do ask questions about your speed
pace or location or have her play albums
and playlists from your entire music
library Mario can also tell you how
you're doing in comparison
to your past runs or warn you about
changes in weather like it's about to
rain or something so you're gonna go out
to run oh it's going to rain better get
a job do that yeah she'll even track
your progress by noting all of your hot
spots and rough legs each time you run
and you can connect tomorrow to Amazon
Alexa enabled devices and ask her about
lifetime statistics and records you've
set while you get ready for your next
run so go ahead and take it away finish
it off friend visit Mara AI Mara dot AI
to download your free virtual running
assistant today that's Mara dot AI just
check it out just try it out it's free
it's pretty cool I actually got to play
with it a little bit um I mean I I'm
gonna be honest with the only ran like
five blocks because I do my running I do
my running on the basketball court nice
there you go only do I run I hop over
fools at a at a roughly five six frame
I'll dunk on you I will I will I will
dunk on you I saw you go up against one
of the Warriors man you're you were
you're on top of him it was that what's
this thing I mean I don't know if I was
on top of them I mean I think that's
very generous of you to say that but
anyways check it out Mara dot AI all
right back to the show new beta releases
Apple's released iOS 10.3 beta 5 for the
iphone in iPad bringing kind of a new
little bevy of features to the table
we've we've actually kind of seen a lot
of this stuff already but it's just kind
of the fifth beta so if that's kind of
your cup of tea and you're into um
please feel free to enjoy that I me
includes things like their new Apple
file system this is kind of the a
modernized system that is optimized for
flash storage include stronger
encryption kind of a big feature of the
new iOS 10.3 OS that will eventually
roll out is fine my ear pods oh yeah
fine I'm has baby no new amote no new
emojis yet in this batch but trust me
when I OS 11 comes out we're gonna get
all new we're gonna get another batch of
emojis nice like we hear you're all nice
that's what I want to find my ear pods
uh the thing about find my ear pods it
will show you where you last
had your ear pods and you will be able
to play a sound from the air pods only
if they're outside of their charging
case which is kind of it's helpful but
let's be honest most the time when
people are have put their pods away it's
in the charging case I see so that's
going to be one of the other new
features in iOS 10.3 there's also kind
of a feature that breaks down exactly
your iCloud storage in the settings and
you have an Apple ID profile that's kind
of a link to all your services and
billing so there's just a few little
tweaks in there so i would say um that's
that's good on you if you haven't
checked it out already you can later and
then an another watch OS beta release
this will be watch OS 3.2 beta 5 the
biggest feature here coming that will be
coming soon is theater mode to the apple
watch so it likes ice basically doesn't
bother you it's kind of dimmer it's made
for theaters there you go believe it or
not they they called it the other mode
for a reason you know so you said that
Apple's coming out with a new file
system I feel like every they come up
with a new file system every year is
that you come out they come out with a
new update every year that can drive
people crazy okay but this is like a
completely new modernized like file
system architecture I think the one that
they've been using which is I hfs+ has
been around honestly like since floppy
disk days Wow like pretty old okay not
floppy how about no like at least hard
drive at least hard dislike it's been
around for a long time so it's time to
modernize and they weren't they weren't
optimized for flash storage that's what
everything has now right so these will
be more efficient which is which can
only be a good thing alright Beecham I'm
gonna do a little this is kind of
different than what we've done before
but I'm working on this this kind of how
to but I wanted to talk about it to the
apple byte nation on the on the apple
byte extra crunchy but how are you with
cutting the cord why are you I'm like
I'm still on the fence like I still have
comcast and it's way too expensive but I
am like in my habits of how i watch TV
and you know I have on demand television
and yep it's on my phone and everything
so yeah I'm I'm kind of on the fence
right now so one of the things that I
this
might help you you'll probably have to
watch the video when i put it out but i
wanted to tell everyone really the best
and easiest way as an Apple user to be
able to cut the cord just using your
Apple TV nice are you just did that
piqued your interest at all yeah for
sure yeah if I could just have one
device and I have to worry about
everything well okay I'm gonna take this
bat you won't have just one device
you're gonna have to need a lot okay so
I want to break this down I basically
want to break this down and I have links
on that you can show people as well
beach as we kind of go along with it so
if you're listening you might want to
pause you might want to get a pen and
paper or if you're watching you can
pause and get a pen and paper but
there's really four things that you need
to make to really make this happen in
when I'm I'm not just saying by cutting
the cord Oh get netflix and hulu I'm
talking about actually getting a cable a
live TV streaming service as well as
over the air antenna TV so you get your
local stations and you also get cable
package stations all alright so that's
first thing fixed you need first thing
you need step 1 a fourth generation
Apple TV okay that that retails right
now I believe that are at 149 I believe
they start at 149 for the 32 gig one so
let's start off with step 1 4th
generation Apple TV step 2 I want you to
show this link this is a product called
the hdhomerun it's from a company called
silicon dust if you go to their website
silicon dust com it's this box now they
have three different boxes well what
these are this is basically a breakout
box that you connect from an antenna
like an actual over their antenna and
then you connect it into your network
just your wireless network so the key
thing is that you have a fourth
generation Apple TV on your home network
and you have this box called the
hdhomerun extent what makes it special
it's 179 dollars in price okay so you're
going to have to pay for this but I over
the long tail of this it's going to pick
it's going to pay for itself it's $179
for this box and you connect it to your
network why this is cool it is an it
enables you to take in a antenna signal
pump it in there and then be able to
watch it either on your Apple TV on your
iPhone or even on your computer and you
can actually watch like over the air
TV so what your major networks ABC NBC
CBS fox you need this home run HD extend
box and you need an antenna and antennas
are really cheap you can find an antenna
that's about 39 bucks if I wanted to
walk around my apartment right now i
would but i want people figure out where
i'm at yeah antennas really cheap and
they and the picture that they get is a
lot of a lot of the time it's better
than what you get from comcast or
something you know well comcast gives
compress of these cable networks are
compressing three or four channels yeah
yeah lee into one pipe or they should be
separate you can get over-the-air HD
channels and they're completely free so
all you really need is an antenna but
the reason why I want to bring this up
is because I want people to be able to
use it just seamlessly within their
apple TV so and antenna 39 bucks this HD
home and extent is 179 and then you have
a fourth generation Apple TV okay do you
got that does that make sense are you
following a lot oh I know yeah fourth
piece of this is a product called the
channels app it's available on the apple
TV it's called channels you can go check
out what it can do on get channels calm
all right it's a if I recall right i
think it's around a twenty-dollar $25
app but this is the most amazing app
that i have ever used if I want to get
over-the-air HD TV on to my apple TV
what it does is it not only do you get
the antenna signal that goes through the
channels app is basically the software
that makes all this hardware work you
get a complete TV Guide everything right
you get show descriptions but what I
thought was really special about the
channels app is you can while you're
watching a TV show it's actually using
the 32 gigs or depending on which
capacity you got the storage on your
Apple TV to basically create that buffer
so I can watch a show I can pause it
during commercials if I need to go do
something or pause the show I have to go
to the bathroom I can rewind I can
fast-forward this is all done directly
to your Apple TV and nothing else that's
pretty awesome man in time shift with it
um the channels and then it works kind
of like a DVR a little bit yeah yeah
it's like a it's not a true like you
can't you will be able to in the future
they're working on a
you will be able to actually create a
true like kind of DVR where he and
subscribe to shows but that's not going
to be integrated on the appletv it I
shouldn't try to confuse people let's
just say this right now whatever show
you're watching at the moment you'll be
able to pause it time shift and record
it the app is called channels app but
again it's four pieces to this puzzle a
fortune Apple TV a product called the
hdhomerun extend which is 179 you can
get any over the air antenna but the one
that I like the most and it's a pretty
affordable it's called the clear stream
eclipse it looks kind of like a circle
crescent moon but it's called the clear
stream eclipse and you can apply it you
can actually stick it to your wall
somewhere and it gets a beautiful signal
and then you have the channels app which
is I around 20 or 25 bucks so let's see
what are you to the clear stream eclipse
is key because it's an indoor antenna
yes and that is he it's app because it's
hard to get a signal with an outdoor
antenna if you have an inside I'm gonna
work on a video to show all these
components together but I think people
that are savvy enough and most people
that are listening to this podcast I
know you're all savvy you you'll be able
to put the pieces together and check it
out so just go look at those things it's
so what happens is you got your
over-the-air kind of your local stations
Fox CBS NBC ABC and then what do I pair
it with you have variety of different
services you could go with but i pair it
with the playstation view service
because it has actual DVR recording I
love the PlayStation be serviced and now
if you're someone who likes vh1 Comedy
Central MTV those are Viacom channels
PlayStation view recently lost that so
maybe that's not for you but it covers
everything else I need and then even
just something like a sling TV service
which is 25 bucks if those are all the
networks you need you can get that as
well so there's so many different
options that people can do there's AT&amp;amp;T
direct and now as a service but I
personally like the PlayStation view
service matched with this whole over the
air antenna setup and the main thing
that I can't stress enough is you can do
this all directly through your Apple TV
and you don't have to go anywhere else
right people don't like turning on
different boxes do different things
there's an actual PlayStation view app
on the Apple TV if your subscriber
that's cool yeah so I agree like
I have so many devices sitting on my
television nightstand you know it's like
here's my ps4 here's my Nintendo Wii U
here's my chrome cat you know it's like
it's hard to just navigate all that
stuff so think about this right people
these days I mean if you're a single
individual you might be paying at least
over 120 to 150 dollars on your cable
bill right yeah 2 125 oh so think about
this you can get it you can over the
course of this you're gonna save money I
know there's an initial investment but
think about this not over even over a
year over years you can basically find a
service and internet plan that is maybe
what like forty fifty dollars per month
that's all right so they all you need is
an internet connection that and that's
going to be a quality one for around
forty fifty dollars per month let's say
40 say fifty dollars you buy a
Playstation view subscription plan
that's around 45 more on top of that so
your time about 90 yeah your time out 90
95 let's let's just call it yeah 90 95
but then once you buy the rest of the
stuff you'll never have to pay for any
other additional services after that
yeah huge oh yeah it's huge so let's say
I'm fine maybe you're one it doesn't but
you're too you're three or four you're
going to save you're gonna save lots of
money that's great man so I'm just
letting y'all know if you all wanna know
a lot of you might already have an a
fortune Apple TV so you've already put
that costume so I'm basically telling
you it's about two hundred twenty
dollars to get set up with everything
else you need there you go listen listen
alright so we get some calls yeah yeah

those you listening if you guys have any
other suggestions or just tips about

year detection issue in australia i'm
not sure if the same in the US or not

here so i thought i'd bring that up and

damn big for me I'm but you know I'm

rumor it's just what I see samsung

ok is gear from Ohio again my question
is I'm about to buy the iphone 7 plus
and I'm not going to buy that iphone 8
i'm based on what people are saying so
my question is what we can you do to
make me convinced that the iphone 8 go
to the best iphone 8 ever or the best i
phone manners um they've shown anything
else seems like i can get you just as
much with the iphone 7 vs the iphone 8
so yeah whenever you get a chance please
answer my question okay bye have a nice
day it's very smart yeah he's just
asking us to convince her to buy the
iphone 8 though dude like you know I
leave that Tim Cook he's gonna come out
he's gonna say this is the best backbone
I've only ever ever ever made he's gonna
say that then you're gonna be like oh
wow it is you're gonna be like oh my
gosh but see here's the thing when Tim
Cook says that fine when Steve Jobs says
that everyone's already opened up their
wallets impressing refresh yes yeah bike
seriously pre our pre order right now
right now like they don't even care um I
don't you know quite honestly look it
comes down to what do you really need
saw hey guess what some people in this
tech privileged world need the latest
the baddest most awesomest iphone like
quite honestly if they put the bouquet
effect camera in the 4.7 inch iphone I'd
actually be that that would make it hard
for me oh yeah yeah that is awesome it
too but I'm gonna be real with you all
at the end of the day if this is the
10th anniversary iphone and if all this
stuff that is being thrown out there
does come true I'm probably gonna buy
the 10th anniversary iphone yeah you
know the funny thing is I've been that
guy who's like I need the latest phone I
need it right like I need to have the
best phone out right now but that
feeling only lasts like maybe six months
or so you know what I mean that's a real
time dude I don't a lot of time but
still like less than a year and then all
of a sudden your phone's not the best
phone
again I don't know it's it's a very
short-lived feeling well here's here's
how I'm going to put it for people Apple
has pre ordered enough screams for this
5.8 inch oled screen they basically
pre-purchase 160 million screens from
Samsung to be produced for this new
premium iphone you can tell where
Apple's brain is thinking because in
past years basically they're leading
phone whenever whatever it has sold
they've sold around 200 million or so in
that first quarter so the quantities
that Apple's wrapping off is there
assuming that people are going to buy
the bigger phone and I think that's
what's gonna happen yes if it has
definitely a big trend going towards big
if it's for it looks if it looks like a
new phone people gonna want that one
like I've had this is so pathetic right
we've had the 6s and the seven that have
looked pretty much exactly alike right
yeah totally so there's two years
there's a lot of users that have hold to
have their phone for more than two years
and they're now waiting for like the
tenth anniversary iphone like you know
whether even though yeah sure it does
duplicate a lot of stuff that other
phones have had we don't dispute that
but it's gonna be the it's it might be
it probably will be the best selling
iphone of all time attending and the
seven was just the best selling iphone
of all time right yeah yeah so so yeah
there's Adam there's a huge demand like
people could really passed on the 7th
day I don't think people are thinking
they're gonna pass on the 8th we
definitely poo-pooed the seven we were
like oh the 70 it's not that great but
then it came out we were kind of shocked
when we heard all the sales figures you
know in the last couple months because
you have a group of people who've
already been waiting for two years to
get a new phone so now you're gonna have
people that I've waited two years for
this new phone and people that it's more
comes down are those one year people
gonna jump ship just to get the new
phone and I think there's a lot more of
them for the eight yeah yeah that's
where you're gonna see it so so there
you go there you go I'm sorry if we
didn't convince you otherwise we just
end up talking about the iphone forever
because you could always you can always
talk about the iphone should we don't
recap the rumors wireless charging new
oled screen what else what else curved
curved glass curved
last with the wire with a wire not a
wire with a metal frame usic USBC for
charging you also have you know a 3d
facial scanning recognition potentially
no touch ID button at all and a new way
to biometric to unlock your phone and
use it for payments obviously you'll get
a faster processor a better camera
rumored ip68 improved waterproof and
dust protection I mean it's it's
basically every feature that every phone
has now finally on the iphone that's the
best way to put it yeah the NSA facial
scanning though still kind of scares me
a little bit yeah you're gonna buy it on
