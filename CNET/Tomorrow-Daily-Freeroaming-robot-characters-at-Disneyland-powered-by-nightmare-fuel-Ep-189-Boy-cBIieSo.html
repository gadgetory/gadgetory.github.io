transformed into a magical playground
for kids and adults also science grew a
rat arm in a lab which is amazing and
this new tech from Disney Studios is
either made of wonderful dreams or
horrific nightmares I guess we'll find
out on tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome welcome to tomorrow's daily the
best ski talk to the universe I am
Ashley Scott that Jimmy's always quelle
anonymous
at least until fallout 4 comes out in
which at that time call me yeah well
likely just hire somebody else because
you will literally be living in front of
your computer for at least a month I
have a theory that it is gonna look like
rapture outside she's gonna look like
last man on earth
have you seen that you could find like
will Forte's character in Boston oh that
would take me out of it
sorry no no good all right so we have
some insane stories today so I don't
want to waste any time let's have
headlines
okay so stuff of night stuff of dream
stuff of nightmares stuff of a dream
stuff of nightmare is kind of crazy so
didn't he has this great idea great idea
that they'd already they've already
started working on scared by too much
that they want to immerse you so much in
your Park that they want the characters
walking around the park no not costume
characters but basically like robotic
characters and they've already begun
doing this as you can see and they're
testing I don't I know they have three
stages that they've been working on with
this this whole testing okay three three
phases so the first phase they have the
digital the digital character and you
know here that's how they got it move in
whatever then they have the 3d printed
legs and they're showing they're showing
it okay this is how it's moving and then
they actually try it out so we have all
three stages here for you in this video
it was released by by Disney they turn
the comments off in the description well
I can imagine why this is really scary
but anyway they're 3d pertinent this is
the this is the other robot legs trying
to replicate that motion but looking
like a drunk winnie-the-pooh can you
imagine this looks like zombie
winnie-the-pooh like longer eat you
really cool rapper winnie-the-pooh cuz
you know like yes like swag when he's
walking really strange so but there you
go there was a precedent for this uh
they've actually done stuff like this
before okay they had a dinosaur named
Lucy that they had at I want to say
it was it was at Disney World and it was
at the Animal Kingdom and Lucy would
walk around and she was attached to this
cart oh right
she was a walking talking Dino but it
was all robotics there was nobody in the
suit so they have stuff like that they
also have Mickey now has a mouth that he
can move and like facial gestures and he
can like talk and voice through it so
they're trying to bring that immersion
even closer to people like I mean Disney
does a really good job of this in the in
the inside the rides like the
animatronics in Pirates of the Caribbean
for example they have Jack Sparrow and
they're really lifelike renditions of
giant ants yes pretty awesome yeah so to
have that untethered walking around the
park would first of all be so awesome
but also that would be maybe the
scariest thing I've ever seen
yeah it's it's pretty incredible that
they're doing it but again I haven't
played Friday nights five nights at
Freddy's but I know about it and I feel
like that's very close to how it started
so maybe not the five nights at Freddy's
way maybe we don't go that way I really
don't have never seen a costumed
character and be like yeah wish there
wasn't a person in there yeah wish that
was a robot no I wish that was a robot
no also I don't know if you saw The
Simpsons where they go to itchy and
scratchy land yeah that didn't end well
remember it zoned in on them and was
like and wanted to kill them
Simpsons always do it first and they did
that that is really buying what but yes
okay so I'm being told that that brings
us to our hashtag of the day it does yes
wait yes it brings us to our hashtag of
the day which is TV character what I
want to say this is special hashtag of
the day because it is a photo challenge
oh listen photo you step it up alright
and you need to pick an image that
wordlessly describes how kids will react
to this technology in a theme park okay
just just one image you know words you
don't get any towards let's let's not
even say what we would pick no no no
we're just that we're just gonna go to
the next story
what what face when kids make when
seeing the character when experiencing
this type of technology in the park if
it was pot if it was polished not that
terrifying like a big scaffolding so
come back on Monday and we'll come back
Monday you have all weekend to do your
homework grab an image off the internet
of a kid's face that you think is the
best representation of their response to
robot characters walking around speaking
of terrifying uh yeah speaking of
terrifying science grew a limb in a lab
this is well they do that all the time
though right not limbs so organs yes so
we'll talk about the difference this is
kind of this is actually no it's not
even kind of this isn't straight up
science fiction stuff that you might if
you're squeamish don't watch this video
your legs a little bit a little bit
scary um so it's really fascinating
though biomaterials published a proof of
concept from Massachusetts General
Hospital in which they grew a rat limb
with working veins and muscle tissue
whoa so science as I mention has been
growing muscle and vein tissue for a
while now with stem cells like you can
grow them separately no problem but
obviously growing an entire limb is much
more difficult because it's a lot more
complex and you have all these different
structures in there like the muscles and
veins like they're separate things so
they took this technique that they have
seen that we've seen used with lab-grown
organs and they did what's called oh
gosh I'm gonna forget the name of it but
they they basically strip the limb of a
deceased rat and they take off all of
its cellular material so when you see it
in this like when it's complete it's
like all white you can't see anything
that was there previously they literally
strip it down of all its cellular
material so you can see it's becoming
wider and wider wider because all that's
being stripped off all there's all that
cellular material is being stripped so
then while they're doing that they have
another rat that's living that they're
getting cells from in its arm okay and
then they place the stripped cell limb
into a container and they inject the
cells from the other rat that they
harvested into this into this limb
and then after a couple weeks they
pulled they pulled it out and they said
that well after injecting vein muscle
cells in two specific places on the limb
we took it out of the container and we
saw that the two types of cells were
populating correctly so veins and
muscles and they they hit it with
electrodes like electrical current and
they said it performed at 80 percent of
what a newborn rat would do so like
working like muscles 80 percent like
what a standard newborn rat would be
able to do which is pretty amazing so
the next up would be the white
transplanted onto a rat so the so the
point of this would be yeah the next
step would kind of be to see if they
could get they have to continue to grow
it because the thing is is it might not
be ready yet for transplant it's really
like growing like an ear in a lab like
it takes time you got to figure out
exactly like this is so so far away from
clinical trials like or any kind of
human testing but the idea is that
bioengineered limbs even for animals
would be a huge boon over robotic
prosthetics or or transplants because
you're using your own cellular material
to grow a new limb or an organ and that
that's actually one of the big tenants
of like lab-grown
organs is obviously you have a much
lower chance of your body rejecting it
because it's your own cells I don't have
to take like potentially you won't have
to take anti-rejection medication for
the rest of your life which a lot of
people do if they get transplanted yeah
so um yeah this is pretty amazing
I mean clinical trials obviously for
humans like not even in the horizon at
this point but how amazing is that it's
pretty crazy pretty good I know and I
think that rat would probably need like
shoes right for sure yeah definitely
maybe like a sleeve or something he
needs shoes right shoes for for what so
tell me about this shoe factory oh this
shoe I try to help I try to help her
move to the next story seamlessly and
she's just like yeah shoes are like a
glove you so we're generously trying to
be like failing on this joke
know what you wanted okay shoe factory
so tell us about this shoe factory
everybody we're all gonna take a trip to
st. Louis because when you see this
you're gonna you're literally gonna
leave right away and you're gonna want
to go take a trip there this is called
city museum this used to be a shoe
factory in st. Louis that has been
transformed into a really cool urban
playground you'll notice there are
salvaged planes in there there are all
kinds of crazy things inside here it is
600,000 square feet of fun it is hi
that's that's and those are my words and
it is constantly being improved and/or
added to and the guy who originally
thought of this project passed away a
few years ago and they're still like
working on this then constantly adding
things to it it's got all kinds of stuff
so I'm gonna give you a list of like all
this different things that you can find
and this is just a starter list like
there's way more than this 600,000
square feet it's huge you can find
repurpose airplanes for Jungle Jim's ten
story slides like ten story
not ten as a number but a 10-story high
slide my god a school bus on the roof a
cantilevered school bus on the roof
caves fall pits aquariums circus arts
equipment restaurants a bar and even a
ferris wheel on top that Kayla and I
will never ride because we are scared
hey you can see there's a salvage plane
right there tires salvaged construction
cranes there's like this I mean it is
it's insane like this is madness and
it's all basically a huge recycling
project they've taken all this stuff and
that is salvaged and reconditioned and
recycled and they have brought it in
here and I want to go to there now and
kill wants to go to there so bad that he
did in fact leave so I never knew that
this place existed but man I mean would
it be really cool for all those major
cities in the world to like make stuff
like this I want this in Los Angeles and
I think we should have an in every city
which have these big urban playgrounds
that we can recycle stuff with and
everybody can go enjoy it so nice work
st. Louis I'm gonna go take a quick
break I got to go find kill before he
hops on a plane to st. Louis so we'll be
right back with into it because it's
Thursday and of course our user feedback
and your phone tahg refer of the day so
don't click away it's tomorrow
Kayle
welcome back to the show I've captured
kale he's got a ball ball chain prison
thing on his ankle and he can't show you
cause it's just too heavy to lift
but it's Thursday which means now you're
gonna have to tell us before you go to
st. Louis to play at City Museum what
you're into this is into it I have a
feeling I know you're gonna say but
please what are you into this week this
week it's no surprise I'm into cheddar
cheese no of course I'm gonna fall out
for look at the announcement just
happened we're gonna hear a lot more
about what's what's what we're gonna see
at e3 there's a lot of rumors going
around that the game will be coming out
this year there's look there's so many
reactions to this there's been just
shocked surprised there's been
complaints already there's been yeah
there's people like well the graphics or
that great look first of all this is
only what they're saying is this all
in-game which most games when they show
a trailer annex it's always cinematics
this is in-game look at these look at
this lighting that's specular lighting
it's incredible it looks like a lot of
fun there's I want to go to that city
I'm really sure beautiful so this is
takes place in Boston right in Boston so
I'm gonna have a yeah oh my god
but yeah so there's a lot of places like
Fenway Park right Fenway Park's in the
end the actual thing so you can go on
like spine like the subreddit and you
can find breakdowns of of what every
location was but but but tread carefully
because you never know what you're gonna
do yeah don't find explores I do see a
bobble head right there yeah you got a
bobble head yeah there's there's a lot
of stuff in here vault 111 I need to do
my research but I don't think that's
actually a vault that's been mentioned
yet which is incredible because there's
a lot of vault 101 anyway so we're
really excited about that and I've been
playing Fallout 3 on pretty much
non-stop a lot of people when Kayla's
not filming this show he is just playing
fallout I'm just playing my life yeah
connected to Michigan we're very much
we're very much into games anyway so
what's yours so
game it's a game it's a video game no I
set you up soon
I said you don't appreciate it I really
do
it's splatoon I'm super into splatoon
right now I just got my amiibo I just
got my 3-pack my squid and my inkling
girl and boy and I love how they work
with the game it's so much fun I mean
way more fun than even the demo like
they had the the global test-fire and
that was really cool but this to me was
even better the full game is just so
much fun there's all kinds of like
upgrades you can buy clothes you can go
into the little shops and buy like these
like crazy outfits and hats and shoes
and stuff that all have special
abilities like more damage you take less
damage you know and you can upgrade your
clothes and then also they have a
single-player mode that has all these
like these stars like challenges where
they take you through serve an obstacle
course and then with the amiibo you have
to go through them again but in a
different way so like one of them is a
time speedrun another one is with a
certain and the other two are with
certain types of weapons so it's so much
fun I played a lot of non ranked play
last night because I didn't want to jump
into the ranked games
I know producer Logan gets really
frustrated at the fact that you only
have two maps at a time that rotate for
three hours in each mode so it's like
you can only play one of two maps for
three hours at a time but then like
right at 11 o'clock last night we got a
message from the thing it kicks you
everybody back out into the lobby and
they're like it's like a little news
program with these two really hip cool
squids oh really
yeah and they're like hey guys it's time
to talk about like what's up next like
an a like sit there and they say like oh
well it's this map and this map and
what's your strategy and everyone's like
I don't know like when like that's the
strategy I guess like so it's really fun
it's really cleverly done and honestly
one of the better shooters that I've
played on console and awhile question
okay with the Wii U there's not really a
means of communication No so I've found
that with shooters and our strategies
like that it helps to communicate so how
do you get over that barrier so one of
the things that really helps is with the
gamepad you can see all of your
teammates on a map
you can kind of see what's going on
because there's a live representation of
in the non ranked play it's all it's all
based on how much ink you can you can
spread so you can sort of see where the
hot spots are and what's happening and
then if they're getting killed
there's also abilities where you can see
other members of the enemy team all at
same time right a mini-map yeah well
there's like special abilities where on
your main screen you can see them like
where everybody is okay so I think that
they work really hard on making it
accessible I do think that I'd like for
last night I was talking with friend of
the show Mike Hobbs we were playing
together and in the same rooms but and
sometimes we would not get matched on
the same team sometimes we're on
opposite teams so we would just be
talking on the phone I'm like I was just
play like FaceTime audio and then we
would just talk about you found a way
around yeah I kind of find a way around
it so I moved in
you don't need teamspeak or chat or
group you know any kind of group chat
it's honestly like it's really fun it's
easy to pick up and play I like I'm
really enjoying it and kudos to Nintendo
for creating a new IP that I was really
skeptical about last year when they
announced it I was just like squid
children really a Nintendo and then now
I'm just I'm such a I'm a convert I'm a
believer I love splatoon it's so much
fun I can't wait to see what they do
with more of it later down the road with
DLC alright so yeah splatoon splitting
it up um you want to talk about user
feedback yes okay
alright guys so we asked you to use the
hashtag TV play time to tell us how you
would want to integrate play nation
which is Disney's new set of toys they
have this sort of interactive oh yeah
what games and what franchises would you
want to see utilize this type of stuff
Rick Rhoden instead of Batman or
Sherlock Holmes detective game with
basic AR goggles and haptic feedback
gloves to find clues oh no you like that
young Batman I like that he's like
Batman isn't like the detective Batman
not the not thee give me weapons so I
can go fight people all the time right
detective mark wrote in and said I'd
really want time crisis around my house
so that I wouldn't have to waste so much
money on the arcade machine version
reload also he says also my juice box of
choice is Apple and black currant so you
asked what did you Spock some choice
would oh yeah that's right I forgot
about that I'm out what do you say Apple
and blackcurrant yeah Wow hashtag fight
me it's kind of classy it is very close
all right
so hi hi probe ah uh Neil wrote and said
kids should not need technology like
this especially when their imagination
should be doing all the work so he's
like no kids gotta do their own heavy
lifting Neil you have a baby on the way
that you're gonna that kid is not gonna
get any fun toys you're gonna make it
use its imagination know that he has a
baby although he sent us that picture I
was a phone tiger for the day
oh I remember everything about everybody
I waste all of my mental energies and
storage space the hard drive in here is
just filled with trivia about all of you
it's literally the case and then Adam
wrote in and said I would like to like
counter-strike with VR oh my god I'd be
amazing oh my god this is for just
having the frustration of being bad at
counter-strike in VR it's not something
I want to think about Dustin wrote in on
the same on that same sort of page Call
of Duty would be awesome imagine being
able to use real-world locations as game
maps it would be fun and exercise also
know also I don't want to be bad Call of
Duty wait he wants to use the Omni no no
he just said use it outside in
real-world locations as a game map oh my
god diving everywhere you're gonna
really love this so Dave rodent
and he said I was listening you damn
kids whining about how today's toys are
far ahead of the toys that were around
back in your day well back when I was a
young whippersnapper here's what we had
for robots it's just part of the yeah
Rock'em Sock'em an interactive game we
played and we have to do all this while
walking uphill through several feet of
snow now get off of my lawn Dave apps
then hashtag grumpy old man hey Dave
Dave Dave Dave Dave thanks Dave bowing
to you all right that was amazing you're
the real MVP what are you real MVP do
you imagine that day yeah I drew a robot
for you they'll give to you
Hyup okay did you imagine that dave
doesn't have a smartphone he just has
like a can with a string on it yep
that's how he sent this he tapped a tap
the cam captain and I got the message
it came via Telegraph I love very
difficult I love it I wouldn't mind a
once a week Dave like listen Dave all
the things yeah a deal she was it like
our we're like that deal she didn't have
kind of graphics he's like look here's
my DLC pong I love it I love it thank
you Dave grumpy old man Dave thank you
Dave and then and then finally we have
our very last piece of user feedback
which is always our photogra for the day
our good friend Rollo wrote in to the
show Bravo
it's like Yolo I'm sure he's never heard
that probably not um he took this
picture with his Galaxy Note 3 and he
said hello tomorrow daily my friends
just hanging out at Galveston Texas not
much just another lazy Sunday afternoon
before going back to the corporate
jungle I took this with my note three
love her show Rolo a little ferris wheel
they all a roller coaster I love it
sweet lean lean that's all my exes live
in Texas yeah
Alison in Galveston but yeah that's
really sad that he's like yeah this I
took this on my lunch break I think it
took a picture well he said was a lazy
Sunday oh we're going back to the
corporate jungle so maybe he got to have
a really good and I want they see in the
water right here cuz look at the picture
the shore is way over to the left
Rollo's Aquaman Aquaman just sended live
in Texas okay Jason Momoa your jig is up
we know what you're up to but that's a
really cool picture like I like I like a
good picture
I don't really man use the note three
looks great it's very waterproof maybe
Samsung isn't a sponsor Aquaman we
haven't director in hours we are down
the rabbit hole this is a Thursday for
sure listen if you want to send in your
phone tog Rafi you can you can send us
all the kinds of other stuff too story
ideas family recipes I have one I got
tiramisu I'm gonna make it maybe after
III though cuz I got too much to do
before them tomorrow at cnet.com is our
email and you can find us on social
media rate reviews on iTunes say hi on
YouTube because kills always hanging
around there he's like an alley cat at
YouTube
I'm bored for tomorrow daily on a lot of
social media let's take that too far but
anyway yeah dude don't forget to follow
us on our personal account to be mostly
is Twitter I'm a Killa not on this oh
yeah and that's it for the show this
week you guys will be back on Monday
with a brand new docket of weird
wonderful technology the DARPA Robotics
Challenge WWDC is happening on Monday
there's a lot of stuff that we're gonna
have to talk about so don't miss it but
until then you can
Mina clock X is live in Texas
