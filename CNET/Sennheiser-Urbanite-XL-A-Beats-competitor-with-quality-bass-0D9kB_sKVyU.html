hipper more fashionable over the ear
headphone that retails for 249 and comes
in a few different color options hi I'm
David Carr Noy and welcome to another
CNET video review this new headphone is
a little bit of a departure for
Sennheiser which has staked out more of
an audiophile audience in the past the
Beats has had such a profound impact on
the market that Sennheiser's decided to
come out with a headphone with a little
more urban flair it seems designed to
appeal to the Beats audience there's
actually a smaller on your urbanite that
retails for $50 less or $1.99 but I
haven't gotten my hands on that one yet
what I will say is that this XL model is
quite comfortable and managed to
passively seal out a decent amount of
sound without clamping down on your head
to firmly the headphones fold up into a
more compact form factor and they come
with a carrying pouch but it's pretty
skimpy which is a little disappointing
well the headphones are mostly plastic
they do have metal hinges and seam
sturdily built they're not Lightford
over the ear model but they aren't heavy
either and they're designed for both
home and mobile use a detachable cable
with an integrated remote and microphone
is included and it will be iOS and
Android friendly versions of the
headphone as for the sound San Heiser
says the urbanite XL delivers massive
bass with the company's uncompromising
audio expertise I wouldn't say it goes
super deep but there's definitely a lot
of bass and it's pretty tight bass that
detail is also good and while this isn't
the warmest headphone it's pretty
forward sounding it does sound more open
than a lot of closed back headphones
we've tested this doesn't have the sound
profile of the more balanced son Heiser
momentum but we liked it overall and
it's certainly worth considering if you
want an exciting dynamic sounding
headphone in this price range
hopefully that price will come down a
bit as this seems more like a $200
headphone than a $250 headphone then
again beats are a little overpriced
too but that doesn't stop people from
buying them
I'm David Carr noise thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
