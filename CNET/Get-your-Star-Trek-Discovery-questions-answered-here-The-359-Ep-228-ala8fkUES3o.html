me is special guests CBS Interactive CEO
Jim lens out Jim I don't I'm super
excited
Jim as an introduction is the CEO of CBS
Interactive which is a vast conglomerate
which scene that is a big part of yeah
so he's here to talk about CBS all
access and specifically Star Trek
discovery which is one of the flagship
show that will be debuting sometime in
the fall can you get your suit specific
for you you're a fan I am a thing want
to leave oh yes sometime in the fall so
that's that's all we got that's all
we're saying so far we gonna get a
little more no tomorrow all right well
upfront our tomorrow so we might get
more details tomorrow hopefully but
let's talk about the show because you
know we've gotten a lot of smattering
details about casting news
Siddiq lamorne green fantastic a big fan
from Walking Dead is the lead actress
the show tell me a little about you know
what what can we expect from Star Trek
discovery um
well not me we it's true we are in the
middle of production and and we are not
saying a whole lot yet um other than
that you know it's it's a whole new Star
Trek and we are with CBS all access
which for those who don't know it's it's
our subscription video on-demand service
for CBS programming $5.99 a month $9.99
for the add free version where you know
we've historically it's been our library
of programming all the way back to I
Love Lucy it's over 9000 episodes of
shows you actually can watch your live
feed of your local CBS station so watch
NFL games watch the Grammys watch your
local news and then we announced that
we're doing our own original programming
the first one of which was an online
version of Big Brother the second one
was the sequel to The Good Wife which
launched in February called the good
fight and then Star Trek will be the
next okay well I mean tell us I mean
look we've got the movies which are
serve our broad based they kind of
they're they're definitely less for
Trekkies and more for everyone else and
they're the shows that were for the
hardcore trek is where does discovery
fallen we'll see I mean it's definitely
we see it's a series that will live
online and so but it's definitely being
done in a different way than it's been
done before it's going to be very
cinematic
very high production value and you know
grittier the way that that a lot of you
know premium cable shows are today
that's definitely the approach that that
the team is taking I'm gonna see hoping
Game of Thrones type sex to capitation
violence I mean I highly doubt that the
difference is that you you could if you
needed to right if I show runners and
creators wanted to tell that story they
could because living online they're
they're technically or no ratings but
you know in the past someone asked me
that question I said yeah theoretically
and then everybody went berserk saying I
can't believe you're gonna have naked
Klingons but no that's that's not no
seance then laugh that is a you know
that that's the intent is to make a
great Star Trek right and the people who
are doing the show which who are not CBS
executives they are you know very
talented show runners and um you know
they are people who are steeped in Star
Trek and you know are all very deep you
know into the history of the program and
I think the show reflects that and it's
an issue to take as a city code Green's
character his name is Michael which you
know had some people scratching their
heads she's not the captain it's like
the first show where it's not really
focused on the captain which is an
interesting thing she's like the first
officer what how does that change that
dynamic can't talk about that that's
that's too detailed but you know in the
future people could be named any thats
true judging based on a 20-17 but what
about the fact that we're focused on the
first officer as opposed to it the
captain who jason isaacs plays him but
it's an interesting dynamic it's
different than the normal show yeah
again i mean we are still too early to
talk about the exact details of that but
but certainly as you can see from you
know everything that's been put out
there so far it's it's a very diverse
cast yes it certainly is going to be
very original and and you know in a good
way different I think than what people
have seen before but that's always been
the history of Star Trek me is always
broken new ground
um you know culturally philosophically
it's it's a it's always been a very
intelligent smart show beyond the
dynamics of science fiction and visual
effect friend and everything so I think
you know knowing who's making the show
and the people who you know know who the
the creators are um you know they know
all that that's absolutely a big part of
the show awesome
all right well with upfront our tomorrow
so hopefully we'll get some more details
if so check them out and see that Roger
Chang this is Jim lens oh thanks for
listening</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
