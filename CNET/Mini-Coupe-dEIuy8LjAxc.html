Show circuit being teased and teased and
teased we finally have the real deal
here's the production trim mini coupe
now what makes it a coupe versus a
standard mini well first of all as with
any coupe it's the roofline instead of
coming back to that square little cam
back thing that minis do this one slopes
down kind of like it's wearing a giant
football helmet looks like it is a giant
football helmet although interestingly
this car is basically from the Beltline
down a mini Cabrio a mini of any garden
variety type it's all the stuff up here
and toward the back that's where it
changes a lot and of course the inside
is different this is the first two seats
full production many of the modern era I
know there was a John Cooper Works GP
but let's leave that out for now let's
see what the space is like inside okay
inside here pretty much standard mini a
couple small trim differences but really
that could just be model year as much as
model style so where things get
interesting is when you turn back here
and there are no rear seats that's a big
difference but let's see what's behind
what would be the rear seats so while
this car appears to be the dingiest of
the minis from the outside it's actually
one of the most spacious back here in
the cargo bay look at this it's not just
a big space too big usable space the big
old box and I guess we've got a nice
large pass-through up there as well for
really long stuff so this isn't one of
those impractical style statements
you'll actually enjoy lugging stuff in
this little thing if there's any
practical benefit to having a mini coop
it's the fact that you do cut down wind
resistance there's less of a mass in the
air and a lower center of gravity
there's less stuff sitting up high in
the superstructure all right so this
mini coop these coops are going to be
production cars come into the market
imminently we also hear of a roadster
version that's going to be coming to the
market probably sometime into mid to
late 2012 now if you configure one of
these you've got a lot of the same
choices you've got the same engines the
standard or the blown engine to give you
a 120
210 horsepower something around there
you've also got the same connectivity
options you see on that back wall
they're mini connected they are
emphasizing their Google search and
Twitter and web radio but again that's
stuff it's already on the mini platform
so this car is largely a top half body
styling stand but you know what they
might sell a lot of them just for their
kooky cuteness</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
