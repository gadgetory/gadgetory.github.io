another edition episode 215 of the 359
podcast and boy howdy do we have a
question for you today my name is bvg
and in the house we have Roger Cheng and
Alfred and guys what are we talking
about today we're gonna be talking about
the NES classic and how you soon won't
be able get one but today there is a
shot if you're our best buy
theoretically and willing to punch
people yeah elbow people out of the way
take your shot a day that's it so we
were talking the idea is classic I will
be talking about our colleague Scott
Stein story on what he would like to see
SNES classic the rumored you know update
for the layer this year and lastly we'll
talk a little bit about the March for
science event this past Saturday helped
across cities all over the world
honestly if they don't make an SNES
classic that would just be really stupid
of Nintendo I know it's like just it's
just they're just leaving money on the
table here zal Ison's to print money yep
yep here we go hopefully they make more
just skip the insects just go straight
to the gamecube classic i want no he
mastered no no no I want the SNES
classic that's that would be the main
console I'd like nobody likes the
gamecube like i was really surprised to
find out how this like the gamecube was
with like it's like but I thought an
incredible game maybe I'm wrong here but
you're probably not generation we grew
up with it well I grew up with the n64
okay and I still thought the gamecube
was better that which is I'm gonna get a
lot of hate comments actually there are
there are no games on the Gamecube that
I really remember like I was a little
bit older at that I was like I think was
a college at that point there's super
smash brothers there's mario kart double
dash there's a wind waker like like
legend of zelda their data for the
post-show okay let's let's get started
I'll give any questions as always live
in the comments section Brian will pick
up the best we will get to them to three
minutes and 59 seconds mario sunshine
that up three do
welcome to 315 I'm Roger Cheng I'm
Alfred aying the NES classic is here but
not for much longer best buy tweed that
limited quantities would be available
today Alfred if you only need to take a
field trip to best boy absolutely not I
made my own NES classic with a raspberry
pi like the day they announced it does
it there you go but I can see a lot of
people that will be rushing down to
bestbuy to grab one it's a huge my you
imagine riots breaking up for an NES
classic not riots I don't think it's
like a like friday love if they were
free maybe I mean but I mean bridge you
can't get them soon I mean it this is it
like that Nintendo's already just
continue these things so that's the
thing that supply yeah if you want to
make like a serious investment honestly
like to buy this for 60 bucks and then
they're gonna be out of sale very soon
right and then like they're going for
like 300 to 500 bucks on ebay if
anything that's like that's the way to
go uh yeah what is to buy them on ebay
from know who sells alimony oh yeah
that's the only reason why I would rush
to a best buy right now but that you
know what full of the game yeah no no
you really love them you would have a
like original nes i have one somewhere
yeah but it probably doesn't work yeah
I've like blowing all the cartridges and
like shoved it in the wrong way and
that's that's something original to me
time original nes azhar like super cheap
on ebay too it's the games that are hard
to get there you go yeah alright so next
up on a related note our colleague Scott
Steiner out a story last week basically
looking at what he would like to see in
an SNES classic that is the rumor next
console that Nintendo is going to put
out later this year and frankly if they
don't do it they're stupid yes it's a
pretty much a license to print money
yeah this is a this it's got like the
nintendo tons of classic games a what
game would you want to see on the
antenna yes NBA jam that's the thing the
so with the nes class like most of it I
mean was like Nintendo branded games yes
and with the SNES it's a little bit
different because like a lot of their
classic games aren't like straight from
Nintendo true you take a look at a game
like Chrono Trigger or you know NBA jam
ninja turtles turtles in time for yes
these are none of these are all of these
are classic SNES games but none of them
are like outside Nintendo Chrono Trigger
and actually well Street Fighter
obviously yes another capcom game and
was actually x-men I think his x-men
x-men vs sri fighter no Xmen apocalypse
afoul yeah this after terrible movie but
the I'd school game was kind of awesome
but I spent a lot to play that I would
love to see Scott bow talks a bit about
not the games but the features that he
wants to see you know while they were
pretty make a lot of sense right make
the controls wireless those NES classic
controllers controllers insanely short
they made no sense I couldn't even wear
them as a necklace include two
controllers in the box i would pay extra
for two controllers right on the box I
include the nes midi inside he talked
about this idea of this Russian nesting
doll strategy where you had like one
system with another system kind of like
a backwards compatibility yes exactly
keep using industry standard cables at
the hdmi and USB up we'll see cross by
download codes for the nintendo switch
and lastly make enough of them that
should have been first that should have
been easily first like we just talked
about the limited supply of NL you know
i think you wanted to end on a high note
yeah but yeah I mean what I'd love to
hear what viewers would want to see him
from the Super NES classic what games
would you want to see I lastly really
quickly March for science event was this
Saturday folks around the world went to
demonstrate you know science their love
of science obviously this year's event
was a little bit more politically tinged
with a lot of people thinking about
Donald Trump you actually rented two one
yeah I passed by the one in Washington
DC I was like making a pit stop there
I'm coming back from North Carolina um I
it's just interesting me that like we
actually have to protest this you know
like believe in facts that's such a
weird like this is the world that we
live in now happy to be fair they're not
necessary protesting yes like better
they're basically it's show support yeah
rich it's still weird to me like science
is just something you should believe in
it just doesn't make any sense there's
this sax and studies and in this engage
you can't take that for crying when T 17
alright for more of these stories check
us out and seen it I brought your Chang
I'm out for dang thanks real estate
oh we have some good stuff going on in
the head all right a suggestion from the
noid screw the nes just build a
raspberry pi true lezzie that's exactly
what I've seen it has a guide for how to
build a NES out of raspberry pi dan
graziano she wrote that up uh yeah that
was in 2014 before the interest classic
we haven't announced and it's actually
even easier now to build one because
before you actually had to go in and
like put all these like lines yep and
but now it's literally like you just put
it on like a micro SD card and then you
put it in your Raspberry Pi oh really
it's yeah I'm out it's so fun i do you
have one yes I brought it on my like
vacation trip just because I'm like this
all were doing nice Matthew in the chat
is on fire people at Nintendo need to be
slapped does Nintendo care nothing about
more care nothing about milking us for
money full disclosure the gamecube was
the first console ever bought I left
gamecube yes is a great console as I
liked how you get carrying around its
cubicle lunch box it's lunch box yeah i
don't know i still have a gamecube do
you really got me working i I just I use
a wii i sold my kia koup to get money
because it's backwards compatible but it
does not look as beautiful as the game
team does truth yeah well well you were
listing games earlier yes as we were
dragging out the intro yes what other
what games well i enlisted super smash
brothers melee first because that's the
horse easily the best game um and to get
an HD remake of that would be incredible
right just because like everyone's like
still playing and like doing all these
like big tournaments like on a game that
came out like more like 10 years ago
when she'll play that term yes yeah it's
still the most popular one over brawl
over all the rest yeah and the thing is
because it's like all these other get
like their sequels that just never
matched up to it I competitively they
were as good but they look at melee as
the one that really set the standard
yeah it's the original smash bros was
awesome yeah and then they perfected the
formula with male it's like how people
still play like street fighter third
strike even though like true fighter for
street fighter 5 like all came out right
right i mean it moved to street fighter
4 for a little bit now people are moving
back from street fighter 5 because it's
like
doesn't have that same like competitive
edge that the other ones had but for a
while like Street Fighter third strike
was like the most like competitive 1
i'll be honest i like after street flair
to after the many many many versions 340
like hunted to now that series turbo
edition champion today at alpha high
position yeah hyper fighter game and TV
throwing throwing a little shade in the
chat I would pretend what would I do for
a Nintendo classic I would pretend the
Nintendo switch it's powerful enough to
handle Triple A games oh wow ouch more
than breath the walls a triple a gay it
is yeah ran it doesn't we're just off to
a slow start we got to give it some time
yeah it sometime um here we go uh be
Josh not a thing I don't know why
everyone is freaking out about it I'd
rather buy the real nes console for way
less well we were talking about exactly
what i sat on the podcast like I mean
look can you really want to go through
the time to buy all these things and
then dig for all the games or kinda nice
to have it's it's all about the
annotation I mean that's why it's done
so well right because it's a cute little
things like yeah it's kind of it's a
nice novel to you to have and it's got a
bunch of your favorite games bundled in
so it's really easy to just sort of have
this one little thing yeah I mean a bomb
yeah exactly like most of them most of
the hype around is like oh I remember
that and then it's just you know I feel
like it's like parents that want it it's
tiny oh yeah yeah like underestimate
that factor like it's the cute little
console there enough like to get
hardcore fan I just feel like installed
you get the feeling a lot of the buyers
are just like parents i want to show
their kids like what they grew up
playing but also don't want to show them
like all the troubles that came with it
cuz like imagine like showing your kid
like a like a nes i was like and then
when it didn't work you have to just
blow into it writing really long time
and sometimes it still did well we
didn't just blow on it like art or
system we actually had to put like
weights to push it down further so we
would like read with them exactly yeah
whole messy complicated the drop-down
store was all a publicity stunt that was
there trying to make an interactive toy
right yeah more than anything else but
it was a mechanical it was a flawed
feature yeah yeah but also but back to
Scotts point though like I think the NES
classic could have been improved and
so many ways which I hope they do with
they with the super I really hope they
take the les hace for that like people
would pay up for that for those features
wireless controllers having two on the
box right just these little things kind
of make all the difference like there
were the NES classic was a smart idea
they're just execution why they just
kind of like go figure i mean stout when
you when you were talking about like
what would you do for an nes classic
though like did you actually want one or
yes I mean now that I know there's an
SNES classic coming and kinda don't want
one as much but like when I first came
out like that's yeah sweet I didn't know
how limited the supplies were when they
first announced it I wide one but like
it was more like I kept sending links to
it to my girlfriend's like hey you know
Christmas coming up check this out by
the way no no my wife was actually
thinking about doing like getting me one
the last min I kind of went like like
knowing that she'd have to like run
around yep finding one like would be
such a pain dad yeah I just told her
like that's actually worry about it when
I built my like in 10 raspberry pi 1
because it was during Christmas break
and then there's a acknowledgement that
I don't actually ever play games anymore
so yeah or watch TV I mean I don't play
games I didn't play games everyone until
I built that thing it's like so I mean
just like so would you just plug into
your TV like at the hotel yes i get hdmi
it's like an hdmi cable and then you
bought two while it's like they're part
of control no you can get like us be
super nintendo controllers oh you can't
yeah and then you can assign the keys to
like got it by whatever they're not
officially made by in ten dollars but
which I've it I have one they should do
I actually have a nintendo 64 USB cable
that i was using for roms for a while oh
um hey back to the chat gaming TV just
lighten it up if Nintendo wanted to they
could easily patch in the eShop make us
buy any ask digitally for five bucks
that's a good point they don't think
that that way yeah I sell they sell old
library of games you can do that in your
3ds but they could have just made that a
single package and like bypass the
hardware debacle that they went through
well that's the thing though is that
that's like the nostalgia factor right
that is the cell point I got the box
again yeah was what also like like I
thought about everyone's buying the
switch right yeah through there's
there's a guy think feel like there's a
different audience they buying the
classic versus this way yeah they've
been selling like old nes and
nintendo n64 games a really long time
the issue is that like it doesn't have a
nostalgia factor of hey look it's like
the tiny little NES again and I got the
little controller my head like out the
value of that yeah this is a client
console I was playing like sonic on my
3ds it just doesn't feel the same as
like roller but not everybody relies on
that hardware experience not everyone
grew up with the you know the little
rectangle yeah controller I mean he's
pointing out gaming TV again if it was a
digital purchase he would actually want
the nes classic uh not only would have
support Nintendo would keep people from
pirating it but that that's it and then
tell make it easy for us yes I save you
some money yeah stop giving us reasons
to get a month es classic they made it
hard like they just didn't make enough
of it they made it this this tour to go
on by the Palmer like I told my wife
like don't worry about it yeah yeah I'm
pretty sure on Amazon like the moment it
was available for pre-order was like it
done yeah this is the same thing with
the Nintendo switch they have problems
with that with like yep supply also uh
Matthew says I think NES classic is a
marketing disaster for toying with our
feelings I don't think it's a marketing
disaster for that I don't know like the
depend on how it turns out talking about
it there villain for toying with her
yeah but like that's that's Nintendo's
lagging is twisting their mustache if
anything I just think it's terrible that
they like discontinued it like why
create something like so like you know
want it and there's they go see you
later that is the big question mark is
what like they've got a hit on their
hands why not double down why are you
pulling back on this I don't know that I
spiritually theories always range from
like this was just a marketing stunt
they were actually losing money on
things weren't they weren't and then the
other thing too is like we interviewed
how did well how do you know that they
weren't they say that was that they were
they know they were making money off of
that they were yeah how do you know I
thought they mentioned in like a bunch
of interviews anything I mean like I we
interviewed um Reggie like right a few
months ago and he was talking about how
they were gonna make more Nintendo
closet and then I mean they did yeah
yeah they did for shorts second yeah
adopt ya feel like something went bad
behind the scenes there they just had to
pull the ripcord I don't think they
planned it like that I mean in my pen
own one of these yeah one of these days
we're gonna get like the
I'd store the NES classic it'll be that
they could no biggie tail behind the
console yeah exactly all right let's
talk about some of the games on the wish
list gaming TV says NBA Jam a degenerate
game that's that's great game I mean I
had it on my phone he's eating up yep
he's on fur I lost by one point last
week it's very disappointing did you
play the HD remake they made out of that
I played on the Raspberry Pi right right
but have you tried the bag doesn't like
they've got a Baba you got basically
like everybody yeah yeah it was a little
too kitschy I mean it was kind of fun
yeah I'm so trying to find the hack like
some guy like Mata did so that like
there was Obama and then Harambee was
also a player yeah no that's the one
that does a lot yeah cuz they did like
an HD remake for like PlayStation 4 like
Xbox okay okay live Margot gaming TV
says Mega Man X ever heard of it yes
great game no game not very fun for
multiplayer but you bet I series took a
nosedive but bring back the og yeah yeah
all that into what we spoke a lot about
the third-party titles but the first
party ones were great like nintendo
super mario world yoshi island the
island Zelda uh I mean that's its link
to the past right yeah I wasn't really a
fan of Zelda games until I got through I
mean I played Minish Cap a lot on like
Game Boy Advance mm-hmm there we go yeah
my favorite part of the gamecube was
Metroid Prime easily I still go back
yeah that's the one I'd always can go
back to bridging off going into more
Super Nintendo wish list illusion of
Gaia super metroid final fantasy 3
Chrono Trigger final flight three
turtles in time yes yeah yeah how many
of those are from Nintendo how many how
many of the wish list from that people
have been saying our games from Nintendo
that's the thing we're super metroid and
yeah yeah that's about it actually but
that's the issue is that like a lot of
like the SNES classics are like not from
Nintendo yeah nes classic um associative
to italy vs classic the game break down
there are still a good noise or third
party yeah they were able to get them
yeah the thing is that like a majority
of them were still like true you have to
wonder the next is that the lysis those
games yeah Capcom's in all kinds of
weird territories yeah
aquin square enix with still Squaresoft
you almost like synonymous with Nintendo
yeah like I'm willing to bet that like
Chrono Trigger is not going to be on the
Super Nintendo so now so be harder it'll
be about something yeah yeah take a look
at like the NES classic games and just
like how like they're like short like
they're like games for your iphone where
they're like really quick you can just
like play casually way to like they're
not gonna put chrono trigger on that
that's like a whole like thing it's like
a whole storyline and like all these I
don't know what to do do two different
versions SNES long Phineas classic
casual as any of our classic uh elite
ooh I like that let like like NBA Jam
makes the most sense like a short thing
you pick up you play with all right like
chrono triggers like a whole storyline
and is like you can play it over and
over again you biker trigger on iOS yes
you can actually yeah it's like ten
bucks yep uh I love this VIN draken says
I would tattoo seen its logo for an NES
or SNES classic and film the progress
Wow we have one of those we cannot
condone that no we have an NES class you
have a meetin we're not condoning that
where is he getting it tattooed we're
not condoning that I'm with Brian on
this one sorry Ben well I love the
dedication though so to bring a full
circle and wrap it up Matthew wants us
to speculate as to if we have any clue
why Nintendo did such a limited run we
just started kind of brushing on this a
few minutes ago but let why why would
they I think I think they either ran out
of supplies or just got somewhere in the
hole and just like I said had to pull
the ripcord I think it was not planned I
don't think they decided like we're
going to just dangle this carrot I don't
think it could be in the hole votes and
such high demand how is that even
possible I think maybe some of the
hardware that they were using hardware
distribution I think actually the more
expensive factory will be licensing
costs yeah yeah I mean paying those
third-party publishers to actually care
the games maybe that maybe that I feel
like they were those guys saw what was
they saw the demand is they want to reup
I don't know how worse like up the
contract negotiations but imagine the
cost has to be a factor here because
they if it's in demand like it is now to
pull away from this I me there has to be
some sort of reason has come down to
money yeah and there's a lot of people
in the chat discussing about how they're
resistant to outside help and so on and
so forth from like the third party
licensing so they've always been on this
weird little island just like when they
resistant to putting anything on iOS and
mobile and that's just Nintendo for you
I'm literally and figuratively on the
island yep one more thing to speculate
on do we think they're gonna continue
with this trend I would love to see an
n64 classic yeah I would like to see
other manufacturers jump on this train a
ps1 classic and so to speak oh yeah yeah
Sega's kind of already done it but it
was through third-party you can get this
like Genesis rehash out there in a
similar for you were you able to not
Saturn but to further Genesis rehash
like you still do pilot games for it
right or was it like preloaded with game
they had one of each they did have one
that had pre-loaded games that one that
was open to you could actually put ya
roms on an SD card and I think they had
one they had a bunch under the hood yeah
30 on board yeah and then Sega actually
I was like sold the rights that to like
a lot of third party like manufacturers
like I was in like a Duane Reade and I
saw like one of those like oh yeah I've
got one yeah little it's a at games i
think its manufacture and it's a little
portable system it looks nothing like
sake has ever made in his past but I
threw an SD card on there with like 60
games and I'm good to go yeah Wow nice
sega does that'll like they sold the
rights i know i would absolutely love to
see like a whole so retro you know it's
also return of all these systems but I
mean they never really went away yeah
it's that one of those things where the
nostalgia holds tighter than the new as
we keep seeing over and over again now
granted they're not to say there aren't
people who are religiously standing in
line for that new system yep but we all
can always speak fondly about like I've
cut my dreamcast to my gamecube alive
those are my Tim favorites the my
biggest regret getting rid of my Genesis
I just feel like they should just remake
those games for like newer consoles like
as like an HD remake for super smash
brothers I'm even care about the HD just
put them keep putting everything stopped
being picky stop being choosy put it all
back up on the air in the store I'm
saying like I'm not like really like
buying is a little like
hardware thing whereas I all we need to
make a specific console just for this
like just make like what pokemon does
when they like remake like from red to
fire red right from like pokemon gold to
like heartgold where it's like a much
better game and they improved on all the
flaws from like the original game but it
still got like that like nostalgia
factor to it just make make it a better
game and make it on something that I
already own and can play it on but how
much does it matter to you to maintain
that feel like when getting an NES
classic and get that controller then
everything just feels right I definitely
said about that that bundle of gay
because you can get keep getting those
like classic collection discs you can
buy it sort of like 15 bucks you know
I've got the Sonic Mega Collection and I
game key right going back and back and
back dating the hell out of myself but
uh yeah I mean those are okay yeah
they've run fine but is it the Symon
yeah if you want that like to be taken
back in time like I go ahead but I don't
know I'm just not really into the whole
like oh it needs to be precisely all
these things for like the right like
thing I played chrono trigger on my
phone like it's obviously not the same
but like their mother would translate to
the phone for ya but ya is for me it's
more about like the experience of the
gameplay then you know oh I'm not
playing it on a heads isn't sticky
enough ya feel right yeah alright that's
a good place all right yep let's uh
let's wrap things up we can ramble about
games all day I know alright if you
liked anything you saw or heard here
