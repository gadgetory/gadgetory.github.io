weird-looking just like a Prius but
Toyota sells as many pre I in a day as
these guys sell in a month
what gives let's drive the 2012 Nissan
Leaf SL and check the tech now a leaf
looks like a leaf for several reasons
one is packaging they wanted this car to
feel roomy inside and it definitely does
so it's kind of big in proportions
secondly aerodynamics define a lot of
what you see here and then you've got
this very unusual headlight setup in the
front that's quite signature very high
on the fenders and these are LED lights
standard by the way they use a lot less
of the electric energy that's so
precious in this car LED headlights are
still a real rarity in the industry
let's get inside
now Nissan Leafs don't come strips
they're positioning this car as a
premium not just alternative vehicle as
a result they've all got this seven-inch
very nicely done color LCD and what's
interesting about it is it's kind of
unique to the leaf this is not really
much at all your media sources are am/fm
satellite radio no HD radio
interestingly enough under the CD aux
button you're going to find bluetooth
streaming auxilary Jack USB ipod there's
also a disc slot for CDs and did you see
this goofy looking thing car wings what
the hell is that well that is the
connected services platform between your
smartphone and this vehicle with the app
you can check the cars charge status
tell it when and how to charge like in
terms of peak and off-peak and also set
the climate control system to get going
before you get in the car on hot and
cold days never there's no engine to
start so it can just start heating your
cooling cabin only the shifter control
down here is an oddball of course it's
an oddball powertrain so it should be
different you kind of slide and roll it
over for reverse you get your camera
right there which is pretty conventional
you've got trajectory but nothing too
unusual under the maps you do have
traffic and weather provided by your
satellite radio hookup and this is very
much Nissan stuff on this particular
screen kind of crunchy not too
attractive now see this little button
down here what does that say zero
emissions with a little leaf logo on it
when you hit that you get a bunch of
screens that are unique to this vehicle
this kind of vehicle getting navigation
energy consumption battery status all
kind of woven into one this is kind of
your sac bomber map where you can see
how far you can go on a charge how far
you might go on a charge and where the
nearest charging stations are to where
you are now now the fun continues over
here on the may instrument panel which
is a bizarre looking thing full of
brightly colored peacock feathers of LCD
video on the left is your charge on your
right is your range across the top looks
like an Audi logo gone nuts tons of
rings and that gives you an idea of your
green driving mode and this eyebrow
display on the top gives you basics like
time and speedometer but also shows you
another little eco gauge on the left
we'll check out later I think
grows trees or something if you drive
gently all right in the front of a leaf
there's no engine there's a motor you
don't even see the motor the motor is
down low at the front wheel area what
you're seeing primarily are control
modules and inverters that take the
battery power and send them to the motor
here are the numbers that motor is an 80
kilowatt unit powered by 48 separate
lithium-ion batteries like what's in
your laptop with a total of 24 kilowatt
hours of storage capacity 107 horsepower
207 foot-pounds of torque these EVs are
torquing machines
it's a 3,400 pound car to 60 in about
seven seconds while delivering 106 92
mpge
who cares about that all you want to
know is how long will it take to charge
and at what point will it strand me
it'll take you seven hours for a full
charge from nearly dead if you have a
240 volt circuit double that time for
your standard household outlet or if you
can find what they call a level 3
charger 480 volts you can do that charge
in about 30 minutes but that charger
connection on the car is optional by the
way now range is a funny word click on
that on the Nissan Leaf site and you
don't get a number you get this
convoluted looking thing this graphic
that makes no sense
let's get poked at it for a minute it
tells you you'll get 68 to 132 miles of
range on a full charge depending on
terrain conditions how you drive even
the weather now much is made about the
solar panels in this and some other
electric cars but this little guy by the
way which is optional doesn't do a whole
hell of a lot it helps trickle charge
the accessory battery you know the brick
like you have in your car it doesn't
charge the propulsion batteries but by
helping out on the little battery it
lets the car focus on recharging its own
big batteries with regeneration
but made no mistake about it driving the
Nissan Leaf is fun it's torquey
it's totally responsive it's an electric
car this one's particularly well dialed
in I've always thought that very smooth
the ride quality is nice it's not sloppy
and it's also not uptight or tense top
speed on this car by the way is 90 miles
an hour it's actually very low for cars
today not that you care but if you're in
Texas driving on that 85 mile or freeway
I guess you kind of might peter out run
it up a top-end but a car like this is
so smooth and quiet you'd hardly know
how fast you're going there's no
commotion that's attendant with a given
speed you have to get used to that
finally there's this idea of cost to
drive like I'm doing right now
this car is estimated by the EPA to cost
I think $600 a year in energy charges
compare that with a Prius at about a
thousand a little more than a grand I
think and a Honda Civic at 1,700 a year
so there are real savings to be earned
by driving one of these it's one of the
factors you take into account when you
consider its price which we'll get to in
a moment and decide if it's really a
good deal or not now pricing Alif is it
one simple and treacherous it starts off
a tick above 36 for the base car then
add about 2,000 to go to this SL trim
level which is tech ear that's more CNET
style so now we're a little bit over 38
but then come the various tax questions
then they're almost tax credits the feds
are currently doing seventy five hundred
bucks for one of these here in
California another 2500 is available but
your state could be wildly different
from that or have no incentive at all
and those by the way are tax credits
they're not cheques anybody sends you so
you've got to make sure they apply on
your particular tax status in all when
you price out a car like this it's
different you've got to look at the
price of the car the way the rebates and
credits factored in and look at the way
you're going to be able to recoup the
cost of its challenges in the way you
drive and the cost of energy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
