welcome to net picks where we attempt to
uncover what streaming online first up
let's talk about a brand new fitness
streaming service out there
it's called Beachbody on demand and it
costs three dollars per week now these
are the people behind those super
intense workout routines you've probably
seen on infomercials you get access to
programs like p90x and insanity
Beachbody is also adding new titles so
prepare yourself for turbo jam and yoga

a 30 day free trial speaking of free
stuff there's some new movies that just
hit Sony's crackle com service the Will
Smith superhero film Hancock just
arrived as did jean-claude Van Damme's
kickboxer now don't confuse kickboxer
with bloodsport cuz kick boxers about a
guy for an Avengers brother now blood
sports about a guy trying to avenge his
buddy got it otherwise you can check out
Mike Meyers and so I married an axe
murderer or Kevin Smith in an evening
with Kevin Smith a talk featuring some
legendary stories about Prince and a
movie that never happened Superman
reborn now let's take a look at what's
believing that flip soon on May 6 say
bye-bye to 14 28th May 12th grams of
snow white goes offline it's a
low-budget movie but a Netflix reviewer
said this is now perhaps my favorite
fairytale movie as it's not the typical
happy happy joy joy garbage usually put
out well said Full Metal Alchemist the
sacred star of Milo's is available until
May 13th and on May 15th the documentary
Buffalo girls leaves Netflix the movies
about eight-year-old Thai girls who are
underground Muay Thai fighters reality
