Washington recently announced a new
temporary exhibit called outside the
spacecraft celebrating 50 years of extra
vehicular activity in space the exhibit
features items that were aboard the
Apollo 11 spacecraft man by neil
armstrong and led to the first human
footsteps on the moon surface some of
the items on display were found in
Armstrong's closet by his widow Carol
Armstrong after his death in 2012 which
he found was a white cloth purse like
bag which was immediately identified by
NASA as a mcdivitt purse and was used
for stowing loose items in the
spacecraft a webpage dedicated to the
items of the McDivitt purse can be found
online at nasa.gov inside me alarm
strikes mcdivitt purse were a number of
items that have been confirmed by
experts as having made the journey to
the moon and back a few of these items
include a waste tether strap that was
part of the astronauts umbilical cord
which kept the astronauts tethered to
the spacecraft another item that was
found was a 16-millimeter film camera
that armstrong used to document the trip
these items are very significant because
they have not been seen by anyone for
over 45 years and remain in great
condition transcripts from the mission
do refer to the bag so it was known that
the contents were returning to earth
with the crew Armstrong called it just a
bunch of trash that we want to take back
well now it's our trash mr. Armstrong
and they are now known as space
artifacts you can read more about the
items found in Neil Armstrong's closet
