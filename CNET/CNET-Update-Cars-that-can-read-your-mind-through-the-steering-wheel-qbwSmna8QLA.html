get a self-driving car that also reads
your mind I'm Bridget Carey this is your
scene that update in the quest to make
are smarter than human drivers the good
folks at the Jaguar Land Rover
corporation are working on cars that can
read your mind I wish I was making this
up but Jaguar has a research team
looking into ways to read your
brainwaves to know if you're distracted
or getting sleepy behind the wheel but
instead of wearing sensors on your head
to read your mind it wants to measure
brain waves through your hands on the
steering wheel Jaguar is working with a
company called freer logic which made a
sensor that can be worn on the arm or
the wrist and it says it can measure the
electric current given off from the
neurons firing in your brain to detect
concentration levels the system is
supposed to ignore the electrical
signals from your heart and muscles the
company markets this body wave sensor
with the tagline explore command and
master your inner universe well the
whole mastering the universe thing is
fine I guess let's just first see if it
actually makes you a safer driver and
how many drivers are going to keep their
hands perfectly on the wheel sensors at
all times now along with reading your
mind Jaguar is also working on seats to
measure your heart rate and breathing
and that seems to make more practical
sense if something is wrong physically
or maybe it can tell you're not paying
attention the car could vibrate the
wheel or vibrate the pedal as a nudge to
pay attention but if this tech is put
into a self-driving car the car could
just take over control of it thinks the
driver is impaired in the meantime
Samsung has its own idea for helping
drivers Samsung has made a semi truck
that has a massive screen on the back
the screen displays a live video feed
captured by cameras placed on the front
of the truck so drivers can essentially
see through the truck to know if it's
safe to pass this prototype was tested
in Argentina but as good as this idea is
you know people are going to get
distracted trying to understand what the
heck it is in other news about tech
companies trying to outsmart humans
facebook says it developed her way to
recognize people in photos even if it
can't see your face facebook uses facial
recognition
G to suggest friends to tag you in
photos and you can turn that off in
settings but Facebook researchers have
taken the technology to the next step
teaching it to identify people
accurately based on other physical
characteristics like body type posture
or distinctive hair now Facebook
researchers have been able to identify
people when their faces are obstructed
with eighty-three percent accuracy New
Scientist was first to report the
findings Facebook and Google both just
came out with apps that can sort your
photos based on detecting people in the
photos so tech like this can make those
apps even more accurate and make the
world even more worried about privacy
that's it for this tech news roundup but
there's always more at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
