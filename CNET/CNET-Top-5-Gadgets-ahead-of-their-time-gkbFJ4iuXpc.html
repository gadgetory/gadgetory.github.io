that change the world and every one of
them must have sounded like the ravings
of a lunatic atomic energy space travel
the George Foreman grill but with enough
time these bold visions took root and
shaped the everyday world we live in
today the same is true for all the great
technology we use in our daily lives
Donald Bell and in this top 5 I'm
counting down the great unsung gadgets
that pave the way for the world of tech
we take for granted today starting off
at number 5 you Sega Dreamcast in a year
that will launch both the Xbox one and
the PlayStation 4 it seems only right to
trace things back to the Dreamcast
released in 1998 this was the first
console to render games with full frames
the first with a built-in modem for
online play and that candy-colored for
button controller looks pretty familiar
15 years after its debut you can still
see the influence of Sega's Dreamcast in
today's consoles
unfortunately for Sega it was the last
console they ever built at number 4 the
Logitech photo man also known as the die
cam model 1 this was the first practical
all-in-one digital camera sold to the
public released in 1990 with an early
adopters price tag of 995 dollars the
photo man boggles the mind with its
ability to store up to 32 photos that
you could transfer directly to your
computer and upload to your ugly awful
geo city's home page for those of you
who could afford one it was like holding
the future of photography in your hands
I mean yeah the resolution was like a
postage stamp and the thing only shot in
black and white but in a time where
digital cameras are now embedded in
every gadget you own you have to give
props to the photo man I give it one
year before they're selling replicas of
this thing at Urban Outfitters now a
real dinosaur comes in at number three
the Motorola DynaTAC 8000x the first
cellular phone anyone could go out and
actually buy
anyone with $4,000 at least released in
1984 the DynaTAC offered 30 minutes of
talk time and can store a whopping 30
phone numbers your kids may be surprised
to know this but in the 80s people
actually use their phones for talking
like conversations with their mouths
nothing said baller like holding this
brick up to your face and acting
important but if you really want to
trace back the paternity of the
smartphone in your pocket look no
further than number two the Palm Pilot
it was the poem that really popularized
the idea of the PDA no gross personal
digital assistant the Palm Pilot 1000
made its debut in 1996 and with it you
can store your calendar appointments
your contacts memos and a to-do list
features that are still at the core of
any modern smartphones but the real
groundbreaking feature of the Palm Pilot
was that you could connect it up to your
computer and sync your data we take it
for granted now that our desktop and our
mobile calendars and our contacts all
synchronized magically but it was Palme
who was really the first to make that
magic happen seriously stop so how do
you top the Palm Pilots influence on our
mobile craze state of technology well
coming at number one Web TV you didn't
see that one coming did you washed in
1996 the web TV set-top box allowed
anyone with a phone line to put the
Internet on their home TV the Web TV did
more than just predict today's current
Smart TV trend and the connected living
room it was also the first device that
grasped the idea that if you remove the
complexity of the desktop computer and
give people a straightforward way to get
online and check their email you could
reach a huge audience today with the
sales of desktops and laptops falling
off and more people picking up tablets
and phones to get online web TV's vision
for a simpler more affordable way to
jump onto the web has ultimately won out
so there you go five trailblazing
technologies that deserve credit for
shaping today's gadget build landscape
but if you disagree or have some other
worthy nominations you can give me a
shout on Twitter or better yet head over
to top-5 cnet.com leave a comment watch
some more videos until you're properly
in a full-on rage donald bell thanks for
