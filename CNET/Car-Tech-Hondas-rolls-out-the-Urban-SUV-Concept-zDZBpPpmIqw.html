Detroit Auto Show where honda has just
announced their urban SUV concept this
new car would be a complete new car in
their lineup when it goes in production
in 2014 it's a small SUV which fits
under the crv it's actually 9 inches
shorter than the crb in some ways it's
kind of like a honda fit on steroids
it's actually got the same kind of magic
seats as the honda fit so it's got a
very versatile interior normally you
have seating for five but then the rear
seats fold up and out of the way so you
can have like a lot of cargo area and
with this higher roofline than the fit
you probably get a lot of stuff back
there now since this is a concept
vehicle Honda didn't really offer much
in the way of engines facts or much
about what's going on underneath his car
inside but they did say it's going to
have their new earth dreams technology
engines which usually means direct
injection they said diesel in some
markets although not necessarily in the
u.s. also possibly a hybrid engine and
also no word on whether this will have
an all-wheel drive or just strictly
front-wheel drive version and for now it
is only a concept car so we definitely
see some concept car cues around here
like it's got those LED headlights and
some grill features that probably won't
make it to production now these compact
SUVs are becoming very popular these
days now these compact SUVs are becoming
really popular right now and with this
coming out in 2014 Honda's probably
hitting the market about the right time
I'm win Cunningham here at the 2013
