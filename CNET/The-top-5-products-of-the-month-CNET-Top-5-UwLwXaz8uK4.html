readers have been checking out in the
past 30 days we ran some metrics to see
what you guys were most interested in
during the past month if you disagree
with this ranking I'm honestly at a loss
coming at number five is the Samsung
Galaxy S 9 plus generally the plus is
similar to the s9 the biggest difference
between the two other than display size
is on the back the plus has two rear
cameras instead of just one it also
looks like the regular s9 is still
garnering interest it would be number
eight on this list the next Samsung S
phone is expected in the first half of
next year meanwhile the note 9 should
arrive in August at number four is the
Apple iPhone 10 it's got a big screen
its small body and that divisive notch
the iPhone 10 still has your attention
even after eight months of being on the
market we're in an odd time period since
there are so many rumors popping up for
the next iPhone the 10 should get an
update in September but right now the 10
is the best iPhone out there and number
three is a surprise the motorola moto G
6 it's an Android phone you can own for
under two hundred and fifty dollars
outright it has dual rear cameras which
take good enough photos no pics won't
look as good as top-tier phones but it
costs $250 the Moto G 6 also has some
nice styling with a glass back and a
very modern 18 by 9 aspect ratio screen
all that and Motorola even managed to
squeeze a fingerprint sensor on the
front the g6 is also running a near
stock version of Android what's not to
like
number two the Amazon fire TV Cube you
guys are really interested in this thing
it's a fire TV with Amazon's of voice
assistant built right in the cube can
handle switching inputs on your TV or
receiver using its IR emitters and
blasters a lexus voice comes through the
speakers of your system in our tests the
microphones pick up the wake word quite
well even when your speakers are going
one of the downsides of the fire TV cube
is that it does not function like a true
universal remote you'll have to keep
your original remotes or a harmony
for more complicated actions and the
number one thing you guys have been
going nuts over in the past thirty days
is the 2019 Honda Insight this is the
third-generation insight and it's a
built on the Civic Platform
one of the best things about the new
insight it's looks the insight is a
hybrid that doesn't look like a hybrid
we're looking at you Prius the 2019
Honda Insight pushes out 151 horsepower
and you'll get up to 55 miles per gallon
I can see why people would be checking
this out a lot any car purchase requires
lots of research before you plant down
thousands of dollars if for some reason
you're upset that a car was number one
here's what would have been number five
if we excluded cars the new Microsoft
Surface go that's the four hundred
dollar Windows 10 tablet from Microsoft
that was just introduced considering
it's so new and this top five covered
the past 30 days that suggests there is
tons of interest in the go what products
have you been eyeing these days let me
know in the comments or on Twitter
