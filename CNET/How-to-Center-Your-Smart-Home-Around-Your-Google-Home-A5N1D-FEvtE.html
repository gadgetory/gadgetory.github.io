home I mean if you already use Gmail
Google Maps Google Calendar or any of
Google's nearly ubiquitous services then
you might as well let Google help you
set up your smart home here are a few
simple steps to help you get started if
you have an Android it can do a lot of
the same stuff in theory but the Google
home makes it easy for any member of
your home to control your devices with a
simple command your family can control
the Google home whether or not they have
a caps but if they set one up you can
teach the Google home to recognize
voices after that you'll get
individualized responses if you ask
Google about your calendar or your route
to work find the perfect location
I'd recommend your kitchen or living
look for a spot near where your family
gathers you want people to be in
shouting range of the home as often as
possible for the most convenience what
do you want to automate at this point
the Google home works with quite a few
smart home partners a nest thermostat is
a popular place to start also consider a
Belkin switch or some color-changing
bulbs from life exten check out seen its
compatibility guide for more gear that
works with Google when you're ready to
expand use the Google home app to
organize your smart gear into rooms that
way you can turn off all the lights in
one room by saying turn off my living
room lights finally use the app to sync
with your different smart home gear
you're up and running and your Google
home is ready for your connect
