rtac
87 you dual-band wireless gigabit router
from Asus now this one here is the very
first on the market that support the 4
by 4 standard of the eight oh two point
seven AC Wi-Fi that means it has the top
speed on the five-year frequency band of
up to one thousand seven hundred and
thirty-four megabit per second and on a
2.4 frequency band up to six hundred
megabits per second for that reason it
now belonged to a new class of router
called
AC 2400 now this one here is a very
powerful router it has two dual-core
processors running at one gigahertz and
500 mega hood it also has 128 gigabyte
of flash storage and 256 gigabyte of
system memory basically has the same
power as a small server and the outcome
is great in my testing is a very first
Wi-Fi router on the market that actually
has the sustain real world Wi-Fi speed
of more than 1000 megabits per second
now obviously you need a 4x4 or at least
3 by 3 AC clients as a closed reign for
that kind of speed but there's one thing
about this new right here that all
existing Wi-Fi clients regardless of
their standards can enjoy the range it
has the longest effective brain ever
seen in a Wi-Fi router to date some 300
feet away it comes with a very robust
web interface that's both fun and easy
to use you can use is USB port to host
or carry things like 4G 3G dongle or
external hard drives now the rail right
here has one gigabit one or Internet
port and four Gigabit LAN ports but you
can change any of these LAN ports into a
second one port a dual one feature is
great when you want to use two internet
services at the same time such as cable
and DSL and that's more the router come
with two new feature called adaptive QoS
and a eye protection with adaptive
curious among other things you have this
great monitoring tool that show all the
internet activities of each connected
clients in
real tap is a great way to spy on your
loved one and the AI protection feature
powered by Trend Micro is desired to
protect your entire whole network again
the best stuff from the internet and if
a client has already been infected this
feature will also stop it from sending
personal information out to the world
now if you're wondering if there's
something bad about this router well
there are actually a few first the
design now take a look here this is a
huge router and it has a lot of space on
the back here but it has only four LAN
port
I believe that's enough space to add a
few more ports here and speaking of port
there is this USB 2.0 port so where's
the through pango well it's on the front
why I don't know it's not like we don't
have enough space on the back to begin
with and speaking of front look at these
fancy status light right here they are
facing down and that means when you look
at them from above they are as good as
being turned off now the second bad
thing about this right here is a price
270 dollars in the u.s. that's very
expensive I'm not saying that's not what
it is totally is but the high price mean
that far now it might just want to enjoy
by watching this video over and over
again as for me I do what I always do
where like something I get to right away
that's only because I don't know and
this has been the first look at the RT I
see 87 you router from Asus now don't
forget to go to self.com check out the
full review to find out more and don't
go getting all jealous on me okay</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
