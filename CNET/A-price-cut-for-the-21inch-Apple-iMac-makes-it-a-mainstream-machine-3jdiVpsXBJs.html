same price that you'd pay for a MacBook
Air well that's Apple's new 21.5 inch
model I'm Dan Ackerman and this is the
Apple iMac now this new iMac SKU is 1099
which is $200 less than the previous
least expensive version now that version
still exists this is actually an
entirely new model with components that
are closer to what you'd actually find
in the 13-inch MacBook Air which used to
be similarly $10.99 now that's actually
$100 less that's $9.99 so you get a dual
core Core i5 CPU which is fine for
general web surfing and office work and
even streaming you know HD video from
Netflix or wherever if you're gonna do a
lot of photo and video editing then I
would consider trading up to the
slightly more expensive $12.99 version
where you get a quad core Core i5 CPU
and a bigger hard drive that's the other
concession you're breaking here you're
just getting a basic 500 gigabyte
platter based hard drive you can upgrade
for about 250 dollars to a a fusion
drive that's what Apple call is a hybrid
drive and it's a one terabyte drive with
a 128 gig SSD that's actually a fairly
nice upgrade as well but still get you
back up to kind of what these things
used to cost and the entire point here
is you have a less expensive iMac you
still get the great design and
construction still very thin here at the
edge kind of bows out a bit in the
middle adjustable hinge like this and a
pretty generous selection of ports in
the back including four USB 3.0 parts
two thunderbolt ports that doubles mini
display ports and an Ethernet jack and
of course if you're using Wi-Fi you just
have that one single white power cable
coming out of it and even though you're
only paying 1099 you still get the
excellent Apple keyboard and wireless
mouse included you can even swap in the
Magic Trackpad
instead of the mats we'll try frankly
prefer so even though you're getting
basically you know ultra portable laptop
level performance out of a desktop
you're paying less for it than you did
before so if you're just doing basic
everyday online social media and web
surfing tasks you can actually get away
with using this and save a little bit of
money and if you're a student there's
probably even another 50 bucks off you
if you use apples that
popular education discount I'm done
Akron and that's Apple's new 21.5 inch
1099 IMAX</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
