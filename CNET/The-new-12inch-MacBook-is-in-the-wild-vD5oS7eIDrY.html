like a periscope to do anyway so that's
perfect okay okay yeah yeah you do that
I'll get it and I'll put in your office
he'll be there waiting for you awesome
ok I'll see other men all right max I I
would never wear something like this
what's up brian Tong here and welcome to
the apple byte for everything good and
bad inside the world of Apple that's
right today it's my birthday and it
feels good to turn 23 years old all
right let's get to it and there's plenty
of something for everyone this week the
new 12-inch MacBook is set to release on
April the 10th but that didn't stop
Vietnamese website tint a from posting
their own boxing of Apple's latest ultra
slim laptop it doesn't seem to be a
shipping model because it doesn't boot
up in OS 10 but you can see everything
from the USB type-c power adapter and
the packaging and no this is not appear
to be an April Fool's joke now the new
macbook will start at 12 99 I love the
design but like the original macbook air
it's a beauty but I had to wait a
generation or two for it to bring more
speed and power to the table I'll write
new pictures of what's believed to be a
mock-up of the ipad pro originating on a
dutch website appear to show either a
secondary lightning cable connection or
a USB type-c connector on one side of
the device the images also include one
of the headphone jacks with speakers
near it hinting at possible surround
sound for the first time as well now the
port on the side does match up with a
third-party case for the ipad pro from
january and it also includes openings
for speakers in four different places a
rumor report from The Wall Street
Journal talked about the potential move
to USB 3.0 to support a connection to a
keyboard or mouse as well and we know
nothing is official here but when you
add up all the reports we're expecting
an iPad pro with a high res display
between 12.2 and twelve point nine
inches an all-new a8x processor 2 gigs
of RAM touch ID with optional stylus
support and a release in the second half
of the year now in more Apple product
news we know Apple is working to take
over the household with home kit but new
reports point to Apple actually making a
connected toaster the project is
supposed to be a labor of love for
Johnny ive who even told Fast Company
you'd like to design cups when he's all
done with Apple now they followed up by
asking him with or without handles any
grin saying that's for me to know so
this could be potentially a fun side
project but you know this will be
another product that's all bread and
butter for Apple
see what I did there toast now nowhere
else fr recently posted leaked images
what could be the rear shell for the
alleged iphone 6c and if you can't tell
I'm rolling my eyes you'll notice the
similar plastic rear housing from the
iphone 5c with the two major differences
being the pill shaped cut out for the
dual LED flash and the two rows of
cutouts for speakers on the bottom now I
don't think I need to repeat myself but
you know how I feel about this Apple is
supposed to be the leader for innovation
and we in here talking about plastic I
mean listen we talking about plastic
alright the floodgates are officially
open after Apple announced they're
accepting all watch apps from
third-party developers the New York
Times uber and Flipboard are ready for
the Apple watch with updates to their
iOS apps that include i watch support
now any of the 1.2 million current apps
can submit updates including watch app
so get on it devs the clock is ticking
that's right I said it because it gets
me every time oh yes ok I'll stop
because I really appreciate all of you I
don't want you to leave you the Apple
biters that watch the show yeah ya know
what getting a bad apple right now but
you can't do that it's my birthday all
right back to earth now we're still
waiting for apples beats music service
but jay-z and his friends made a big
statement with their new streaming
service called tidal now the main
attraction is that its artists owned and
artists curated by some of the biggest
names in the biz like Madonna Daft Punk
Nicki Minaj Beyonce Usher and this guy
named Kanye West now the services making
a point that it's high fidelity music
streaming but you have to pay for it
it's 999 a month for the standard
service 1999 per month for higher
quality audio but there's no free plan
so it doesn't beat Spotify on price this
is really service for people who care
about audio quality and if we see enough
legit exclusives from the artist then it
might have a chance but the best part of
this announcement was when all the
artist signed a declaration on behalf of
title yes including Madonna yeah that
just happened all right that's gonna do
it for this week's show and I can't
believe you actually fell for the apples
making a toaster april fools joke admit
it you did I know you did so hit me up
on Twitter brian Tong or email me at the
Apple by to cnet com tell me if I got
you because I know a lot of your kind of
dumb like that I'll respond if I'm not
watering my plants alright thanks so
much for watching we'll catch you all
next time for another bite of the Apple
all right peace out periscope errs huh
what's this happy birthday oh look we're
happy it is so nice oh I love it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
