talk-show in the known universe yes talk
shows have more than one person these
are mini episodes new sets coming great
stuff what's it the headlines Microsoft
just released a video this week that
could change the way hand-drawn
animation is made the team works with
the University of Hong Kong and the
University of Tokyo to create what
they're calling autocomplete hand-drawn
animations the animation industry has
been using semi automated technology for
a while now with software like meander
and Draco doing some heavy lifting
during production for animators but this
new technology is pretty remarkable in
that a single stroke of an artist pen
allows the software to decide if you're
drawing the same figure in a new frame
so then the software can populate that
frame with the figure and the artist can
use it as a guide but also make changes
to the animations wireframes as an
artist sketches without anchor points or
keyframe markers or anything else that's
really in-depth patterns can be filled
in and colors can be applied across
frames as well this kind of technology
could be huge for indie animators or
anyone looking to speed up their
production schedule if it ever makes it
to a commercial product still it's some
really impressive stuff and worth your
time checking out okay so going from
animations on digital to actual
real-life animated dolls
Japan's a super dollfie dolls are
getting some really amazing robotic
makeovers from a youtuber named Rosen's
eben he's been customizing these dolls
for years now but this is the first I've
seen them and they are so cool that I
had to share Dolphy's are fully
customizable dolls and Rosen's a bit
took that customization to the next by
swapping out their doll bodies with
robotic skeletons as one does his most
recent video uploaded a few weeks ago
featured a katana sword wielding Dolphy
and other designs include a fan dancing
Dolphy a violin playing Dolphy and even
a Hatsune Miku dollfie if you're into
virtual Japanese pop stars honestly
there's no larger life-changing
application happening here but seriously
wouldn't Amazon sell a lot more Alexa's
if they were a little men and women
Dolphy's I think so you're welcome
Amazon it's a great idea alright our
last story of the day is about a German
does
who created a way for people to upcycle
their plastic bags into something a
little more special this is called
street plastic created by German
designer Stephanie Riddler the process
is simple drop in your old plastic bag
in the machine hand turn the crank on
the side of the device and voila a more
interesting and fun plastic bag pops out
of course there are some inherit scaling
solutions that play here you can't
really make a new bag without two bags
to start with and heating some cheaper
plastic bags could in fact release
harmful vapor into the environment which
is why Street plastic isn't meant for
mass adoption it's just an artistic
concept device that suggests a big idea
maybe if we make worthless objects a
little more valuable in the eyes of the
beholder people think twice about
discarding them so easily in the
landfills and trash bins and getting
people to think about their impact on
the environment even a little more than
usual is always a good thing that's it
for our headlines let's check out what's
new this week
