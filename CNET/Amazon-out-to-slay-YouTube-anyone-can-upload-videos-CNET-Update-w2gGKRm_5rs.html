way now it's taking on YouTube I'm
Bridget Carey this is your cnet update
amazon is launching its own version of
YouTube letting anyone upload video
clips to its video service it's called
Amazon video direct the name is a bit of
a mouthful but it gives people the power
to upload a free video with advertising
or charge money for it that means a
Video Creator can charge a subscription
for it or charge to rent or own the
video video creators also have
incentives to put their videos behind
the prime subscription pay wall if the
video is popular on Prime they could
earn bonus prize money amazon has been
making several deals to beef up its
prime video offerings to challenge
Netflix although anyone can upload video
Amazon did say may block videos with
inappropriate content such as videos
with hateful speech it does seem very
business focused right now Amazon is
courting online media outlets to be
among the first publishers some of which
include Conde Nast how stuff works the
Guardian stylehaul and Business Insider
but if you're looking for a new visual
entertainment you can now play classic
nintendo games in virtual reality with
google cardboard a person on reddit
posted a virtual boy emulator that
anyone with an android phone can play
while wearing a Google cardboard or a
Samsung gear VR headset the original
virtual boy was released in 1995 it was
a failed attempt at playing games in 3d
with a headset it caused I strain it was
pricey and it was pulled after a year
also in the world of video changes are
coming to Twitter's periscope videos
broadcasted from the app will be alive
forever by default unless you choose to
delete it right now videos only are
viewable for 24 hours by having video
stay up longer periscope is able to
better compete with Facebook's live
videos and you can expect more news
outlets to use these types of apps to
quickly broadcast footage with their
phone from a live event and not worry
about a disappearing periscope will also
soon add the ability to broadcast live
video shot with a DJ
I drone that's it for this update but
these updates are getting an update of
their own changes are coming soon find
out more tomorrow from our studios in
New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
