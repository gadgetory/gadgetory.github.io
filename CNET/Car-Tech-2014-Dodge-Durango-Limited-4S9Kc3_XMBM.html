body-on-frame truck like SUV that no one
got terribly excited about this one
there was a whole different story no
longer truck frame unibody now but it is
a sibling of the highly acclaimed Jeep
Grand Cherokee that gives us reason
enough to get intrigued let's try the
2014 dodge durango limited with a Hemi
and check the tech now being a sibling
of the Grand Cherokee we expect nice
ride quality and we've got it this is
not a truck like riding vehicle even
though it's in the volume you'd expect
to be a truck some story about the
platform not only is it shared with the
Grand Cherokee it actually dates back to
the bad marriage of Daimler Chrysler
therefore this is basically the same
underpinnings as a Mercedes GL if you
want to look for some nice pedigree and
as we're going to see when we return to
the road later the big headline here is
both a Hemi engine that we've optioned
up front and a new 8-speed automatic
right behind it inside a thoroughly
modern cabin a lot of tech and a lot of
LCDs this is something new here we have
a seven-inch LCD for most but not all of
our instrument panel it's a whole bunch
of information screens plus a digital or
analog speedometer and then around it
you still have physical gauges now in
the center you've got the 8.4 inch
square LCD one of the biggest and also
one of the more square in the industry
or what else does rectangular Dodge and
Chrysler kind of go in equal directions
navigation is here of course that is
optional however it doesn't cost much
those will see at the very end of the
piece here and it's one of the best
rated for simplicity great big buttons
easy to get around if you can't figure
this one out you can't figure out
anything 3d mode I think is new for this
year find nearest target there are
multiple entries for target for nine for
target now do you want yes starting
route guidance so look how simple that
is by one gulp and freeform brand or
category search as well as address you
just hit this thing and talk to it there
are more or less at the cutting edge of
doing good simple voice commander all
your media choices are here
unfortunately it's a hot mess how they
spread them around it's old-school
thinking
am FM HD of those and Sirius XM on one
screen media as if radio is not a medium
is on another screen that includes your
a/v Jack's in the back SD card down here
bluetooth streaming of course an optical
disc which is optional that's
interesting here in the cabin you don't
get that without paying a separate fee
and USB to pick up thumb drives or our
iPod iPod iPhone interface of course is
important it looks like this pretty good
use of meta tag space there with a
screen this big do they really have to
run the title off the side that could
have been formatted better so I don't
need to see scrolling it's one of the
things that the government is trying to
push into interfaces now is less
scrolling so you can glance once and get
back to the road not watch this thing do
this now we have the audio upgrade here
nine speakers one of those is a sub and
506 watts of output but it's nothing
crazy fancy with all kinds of spacial
soundstage modifications and surround
processing it's pretty straightforward
and then over here on the far right
you've got your apps there's more media
in there AHA as a form of media pandora
is a form of media iHeartRadio is media
so is slacker I do not like these little
triple estates what they're doing in
cars still the smarter car makers are
putting everything more or less together
under media now this is a press car so
it's a Jezebel everyone's used it at
least once a little hard for us to get
these apps working because they just
won't I think it's a registration issue
so I'm not going to knock the car for
that but no matter what I do get in this
weird loop of it initializing the app
and then telling me I've got to launch
another app on my phone called you
connect access and I do that and it
keeps telling me to do that again again
I think it's because this car has been
around the block a few times so I'm not
going to dock them on that but if that's
the case in general we've got a bug
you've also got a Wi-Fi hotspot
technology in this car parental controls
as you can see there's a lot of things
going on here that's why media should
come out Yelp is built-in it does not
require tethering the other apps do see
that 3G logo down there there's an early
effort at some 3G technology built into
this car and Yelp of course appears to
be voice-only so let's see how that
works
Yelp search after the beep
say something like carwash or pizza in
Chicago Car Wash in San Rafael
California
to make a phone call press the phone
pick up button do you want me to press
the phone button for you no it's not
what I asked please try again Pizza in
San Francisco do you want me to press
the phone button for you
no canceled pizza in San Francisco sorry
I missed that
Pizza in San Francisco to make a phone
call press the phone pick up button do
you want me to press the phone button
for do no I want you to go to hell this
has been going on for the three days
I've had this car this Yelp app and
mostly apps on here seem dumb as a post
so I'm disappointed by that let's move
on more successfully I hope to the drive
controls real simple and clean you've
got a rotary transmission control right
here Park reverse neutral Drive boom
that's it there's no sport mode you have
to get into or anything like that no
suspension settings per se but you do
have an eco mode down here and this is
going to primarily effect cylinder
deactivation you'll run on eight or four
cylinders when that's enabled when it's
disabled you're going to run on eight
all the time and of course you have the
trademark back of the wheel Chrysler
controls so not just these buttons but
these ones back here you can't see
there's a button in the middle and
there's an up and down rocker around it
on both sides for volume seek source
mode things like that takes a little
getting used to because they're not
labeled obviously in back there's an
optional rear seat entertainment system
that is notable for its blu-ray ability
and dual HDMI inputs but otherwise it's
a common dual nine-inch headrest rig
that isn't very interesting the seat and
steering wheel heaters actually do
double duty warming you or making
pop-tarts yes they get that hot now
under the hood on our car we've optioned
up the Hemi the 5.7 liter v8 base on
this guy is going to be a Pentastar v-6
but that's another story
numbers on this guy are three hundred
and sixty horse 390 foot pounds of
torque it's a Torquay beast base is out
through an 8-speed automatic and
rear-wheel drive
you can also option up all-wheel drive
same gearbox the new 8-speed automatic
from ZF it's a real nice transmission 50
100 pounds-plus
on this
i all hemming and four-wheel-drive dup
you're going to get 18 25 mpg though
that's pretty good thank that cylinder
deactivation for part of that and zero
to 60 if you really care on this vehicle
is six point six seconds with the big
engine a full second faster than the v6
let's see how it all comes together on
the road okay on the road I'm gonna kick
this thing into manual mode so I can
really get that Hemi working unless you
can pick that up or not but there's a
nice Hemi growl in there so exhaust
system is there but not intrusive just
like it should be the paddle shifting is
pretty quick for a vehicle of this type
and price I wish there was a sport mode
because you've got to either get into
manual mode here or go into an automatic
mode that is just too sleepy the kick
down on the automatic mode is just numb
so I'm in here shifting a lot which I'd
rather not be to be honest suspensions
to wallowing for my tastes in fact
people were in this car we were driving
around they kept grabbing first stuff
which is never a good sign because the
thing feels pretty tippy there is no
sports suspension on the limited the r/t
the next one up you can get a sports
suspension
it also has greater towing rating it's
7400 pounds towing on the r/t 6200 on
this guy
but overall the driving experience is
it's very American let's face it it's
large its powerful its isolated from the
road and pretty numb this is no Cayenne
killer outward visibility is pretty bad
to the rear quarters I mean that's a
huge sale panel back there I wouldn't
even call it a seat pillar it's just a
cave just keep going forward luckily
this backup camera is large and it is
standard but it doesn't help you when
you're in forward motion for that we do
have passive blind spot and cross
traffic alert technology on this guys is
also available a forward collision alert
with adaptive cruise control
let's price our Durango limited which is
pretty close to the top it's thirty
seven thousand or so with destination
charge but we're not seeing that style
yet we're not even this style you want
to add that Hemi as twenty eight hundred
dollars more another twenty four hundred
for all wheel drive should that matter
2395 for the premium group that brings
you a lot of CNET style stuff including
the upgraded audio navigation system
power liftgate these bigger fancier
wheels and tires and the power
sunroof now here's the kicker if you
want a CD drive to go with that that's
450 bucks extra
they're basically telling you you don't
the rear seat entertainment system is
impressive technically with blu-ray and
HDMI and dual nine inch screens but for
two thousand dollars I'd pass on that
all day and get the kids a couple
tablets now I'm not sure the world needs
another Grand Cherokee but in the Dodge
aficionado circles this is your
huckleberry it's a nicely put together
vehicle real solid it does the big
things right in terms of tech but have
some issues around the fringe on the
fine details</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
