technology where maybe we don't we hope
one of you find a thrifty text key SUV
and we try to find out the truth behind
ECU tuning for power this is seen at
roadside assistance episode number 48
for March 15 2012 this is the show where
we basically take a look at your
questions and comments and try to get
you some answers and uh and that sort of
thing I'm antuan goodwin alongside Wayne
Cunningham with Mitchell Chang at the
control chiming in occasionally so let's
jump right into the emails because i
think it's the first one is actually
pretty interesting comes in from thomas
he says hi guys I'm in the market for a
new or used seven passenger SUV in the
next few months now originally I was
thinking a three or four year old audi
q7 or cadillac escalade but the atrocity
the atrocious gas mileage i've been
reading about for both vehicles makes me
wonder if spending a little bit more on
a new ford explorer or dodge durango
would be better i was hoping to be
closer to 30 k than 40k in price but i
really want a lot of tech in this
vehicle and the better gas mileage will
be nice as i plan to own it for six to
eight years any suggestions hmm yeah
seven passenger SUV so that puts that
puts it in a very defined segment in
good gas mileage is not a marker of that
segment really but he is mentioning the
Ford Explorer and so the port export
with the v6 they're saying that 20 28
miles per gallon which is way bad yeah
the escalade from a few years ago that's
you know you look at 15 to 20 right or
less even I think and what's the fuel
economy on the Escalade you can get that
with the EcoBoost right or the Explorer
I think so I know yet explore it's what
I'm thinking about yeah they've got just
right on the top of their site they've
got the the v6 listed with a under
30,000 actually although drove some tech
in there it's going to throw it over 30
so this is fitting all all thomas's
requirements right away and they've got
the updated MyFord Touch system too so
that's good
I'm just trying to yeah they do have the
EcoBoost engine as well will be
available that one will probably cost a
little bit more let's just check that
out here so this is actually a 4
cylinder engine and I don't think we've
tested this the Explorer with the
EcoBoost engine but we did test the edge
the what is the other one the flex with
the EcoBoost right and I think it
wouldn't be that much different in
performance I think the weight of those
vehicles would be about the same you
know what that that flex actually wasn't
the force on marika but it wasn't it was
a 6-cylinder yeah okay and that was
powerful that was fast actually does the
same engine they used in the taurus sho
hmm being the in the Explorer they're
talking about doing the the
four-cylinder EcoBoost which may not be
enough power for that car yeah I'm
wondering about that because we did try
it out in the edge which is a smaller
vehicle mm-hm and I think it was good in
that car and and I'm wondering if
further for the deficit of power like
are you really getting that much better
fuel economy out of the turbo for
because I've heard reports that it
doesn't actually do very well as far as
like really being a significant jump in
fuel economy for the additional price
tekken and power loss yeah one thing to
note too is if you do get the EcoBoost
engine you only get front-wheel drive
you don't get four wheel drive so four
wheel drive is a consideration then
you'll you'll definitely want the be
looking at probably and explore with the
v6 mm-hmm you know which I think that
power is adequate in there it's not
super powerful but it's enough all right
to get you around but other options to
not not just sticking with Ford here
it's also trying to think of other of
economical seven passenger vehicles
first one the jumps daman mine is the
highlander hybrid yeah that's going to
be closer to 40 though I mean I think to
get started on that when I'm singing on
Toyota site about 38 5 so it's at the
top end of what your price range is but
I mean it's a hybrid it gets 2828 the
combined 28 yeah yeah you can pretty
much reliably get close to 30 miles per
gallon with that right and it's at seven
with a
third the third row fold flat seat a
four-wheel drive it's basically lexus rx
with the next row of seats and yeah well
I think we really i really like the new
lexus RX hybrid in the way that it
handles its all-wheel drive and the way
that it actually handles as a vehicle
can you get that is that the price for
the highlander with a four-wheel drive
or two less that's the hybrid the hybrid
is four-wheel drive I'll just standard
just is yeah okay because they use an
electric motor on the rear axle right
for for fake all-wheel drive yes real
all-wheel-drive there's no drive shaft
another option i was thinking of it was
actually the honda pilot which is also a
seven passenger and that's a you know
how does v6 in that hmm so you know it's
just a straight v6 like the Explorer you
don't and and it's pretty decent power
from that engine I think it's probably
about 100 and or two hundred and sixty
or so horse know you know they've been
making that forever yep it's the same
3.5 v6 they pretty much toss in anything
that needs a v6 yeah fuel economy on
that I think it probably looking at low
20s with it with his big a vehicle as
the pilot I think we tested the vehicle
at two years ago and i'm fairly certain
hasn't changed significantly since then
yeah yeah dig up our cnet review on that
and i'm sure my opinion today is the
same as it was then with the cadillac
escalade there is a hybrid version of
that car and that'll get you about 20
miles per gallon was it like a hundred
thousand dollars yeah it was expensive
anybody you know i think finding a used
one will still be pretty pricey it's an
it's a really nice car to drive around
what was that like Chevy hybrid that
they made for like a year was it like a
Tahoe Hybrid day I think you're thinking
of the Dodge had the durango hybrid yeah
yeah yeah that's the one I'm thinking
about yeah they pretty much cancelled it
you know after they got it like got two
of them on the lot yeah that was very
short-lived and that's of course I'm
they go through all the financial
problems do which is why they cut it
we'll see what happens down thrown by
Fiat you know maybe they'll bring
something like that back now I'm just
trying to think if there's any other
really I mean seven passenger vehicles
there's a minivan yeah many started
getting into the week starts talking
Sienna's and I doubt a big time is what
I think that was wants to go there see
why not he did it in a tq7 i'm trying to
think what engine is in the q7 it's it's
you know if it was the 3.2 liter v6 that
Audi's had around for long though that's
actually a really good engine but i kind
of don't think i think they got
something bigger in the q7 just look
this up really quickly here and they
went Awards q7 and q7 q7 we can get the
diesel q7 I'm sure that's going to be
above the 48 the 40k cap yeah I mean
yeah out he's a premium brand and these
are definitely pricey although it's
interesting I mean touareg is there's
seven passenger touareg mmm VW touareg
and you could look for that in diesel
yeah the thing though I think that that
he's also asking for is a lot of tech
and as these vehicles go the Escalade
probably not going to have the best
cabin tech package as far as like having
an older generation Cadillac system yeah
it's decent but yeah it's not really
cutting-edge you know it's a solid
system but yeah anytime you're looking
at the used vehicle and the tech has
changed so rapidly in the past day and
we also when you're looking at a used
vehicle you're kind of looking for a
vehicle that already has that in it you
can't go and say I want to used yeah
this with this in it it's you have to
kind of find the vehicle that has that
tech package in it so it's a little bit
harder to spec the tech that you want
when you're going used that's true you
know I'm thinking just from looking at
all the stuff here and by the way the q7
was under the same price on that as base
price is 46 so yeah that's pretty far
over you know that that's not sure
that's a TDR enough but anyway base
price 3046 so that's kind of pricey I'm
thinking the best option around here
looks like the ford explorer with the v6
I'm thinking highlander hybrid yeah yeah
I think that they the the the fuel
economy you'll get from the hybrid is
probably worth the couple extra bucks
that you
pay for the the the the luxury of having
a hybrid vehicle but I think as fuel
gets more expensive it'll start
balancing out in the long run especially
if you're keeping it for six or eight
years that that makes sense but you know
where I'm where I would say maybe lean
towards the Ford is the tech the cabin
tech is going to be a little bit better
in the Ford I don't think they have
toyota in tune for the highlander yet
they don't have in tune but they got
bluetooth yeah they've got ipod
connectivity and for I mean depending on
on on what is being what Thomas is
looking for I mean maybe that's just
what he wants is really good tech is I
want navigation with traffic and getting
able to plug my ipod up yeah they do
cover your basics there it you know may
not be the most cutting-edge but they
cover all the really things that we
consider the really necessary you know
cabin technology pieces so yeah and also
you know I think the fact that the
Toyota has all-wheel drive standard that
you know may tip the scales that way to
I'm sure Thomas lives here I don't think
he gave us a location nip that's not
like that but anyway so so I think it
boils down to probably the ford explorer
or the twitter highlander hybrid yep i
think it just really depends on if
you're going if you're going new then
it's pretty it really depends on how
much you want to spend if you're going
use been i think we gave them a lot of
good choices to kind of expand his field
of what he's looking for and then of
course just test drive the vehicle yeah
make sure you can live with it and yeah
as a dark horse maybe yeah maybe the pwr
diesel might be something to look for in
the used market hmm alright we got
another question here from victor in
pasadena he says I see always I often
see the misconception about the hydrogen
added into the fuel system as being used
or intended to be used as fuel of course
at what work is fuel since it would
become a perpetual-motion mobile I think
hydrogen was intended as a catalyst to
help burn gasoline that is not burned
think of this adding direct injection do
an existing gas engine adds about thirty
percent more power approximately he's
just thrown a number out there adding
hydrogen to the mix is trying to do the
same thing to help ignite the previously
unburned gas
he says I haven't tried this or planty
always wanted to dispel the notion that
hydrogen was intended as added fuel so
this is talking about the idea of
putting a system in a car that will
electrolyze or use the you know the
electricity generated by the engine to
do electrolysis on the water on a tank
of water splitting the hydrogen and
oxygen and running the hydrogen into the
fuel stream and it's a good point that
Victor is making here is that instead of
having the hydrogen burn and cause
combustion in the chamber the idea is
that it will actually cause the gasoline
cause all of the gasoline or help all
the gasoline burn mm-hmm because you
know this is inefficiency is when you
leave you know gasoline unburnt in the
cylinder yeah its inefficiency and that
you're not expecting as much energy so
you're having a use more gas to get the
same amount of energy also it hurts your
figure your missions because the
unburned gasoline coming out of the the
exhaust pipe is probably it's not it's
not a good thing yeah long story short
so but again I'm not a hundred percent
sure on the science behind that or or
how it works that I'm more of a
mechanical engineering guy less of a
chemical engineering guy yeah I mean I
you know when you do ignite the hydrogen
it'll certainly you know cause you know
cause additional combustion in the
chamber mmm yeah what I intend to do
actually I'm sure on the web somebody's
tested the system out and probably found
that it doesn't really add much and I
would just say just the idea of you know
filling up your water tank and adding
however my gallons of water you need to
you know run hydrogen in the fuel stream
that that could you know maybe a very
little bit or it could be a lot and I'm
not sure how much how did you need
you're going to get out of electrolysis
because electrolysis is a fairly your
electrolyzing water is a fairly gives
you a thin stream of hydrogen so I don't
know how much not sure how much you're
really going to add into the system yeah
the the the efficiency the percentage of
efficiency would have to it have to be
pretty high to justify the the energy
loss and actually creating the hydrogen
in the first place yeah kind of like a
supercharger where you both supercharger
on to your engine and now
percentage of the torque generated by
the engine is being diverted to actually
spinning the compressor on the
supercharger fortunately it's so
efficient that you usually get more
power out of the system than you put in
just buy buy it by the only account of
how it works but I mean again if you're
if you're doing this with with hydrogen
you're going to have to put some energy
into the the electrolysis of that water
in order to get something out and if the
amount of energy you're putting in is
less than the amount of energy you're
getting out probably just best not to
deal with it and again I don't have
numbers on either of those but it's
interesting to see this other sort of
perspective on it yeah oh yeah my my
work today actually caused a better fuel
burn and yeah that might add some / said
you know direct injection I don't think
direct injection is really adds thirty
percent efficiency it's certainly you
know you get get a lot more I mean it's
precise yeah definitely yeah that's why
it's pretty brilliant stuff I mean you
do get you know we see new engines
coming out of direct injection and they
get more horsepower and better fuel
economy over there you know over the
equivalents but I usually see numbers
cited the gains of like maybe ten
percent or so ten to fifteen percent
tens good yeah I'm very good at nothing
to scoff at that that's for sure all
right we got another email coming in
that says I wouldn't have a name on this
one but it says hi I saw your piece on
car tech and car tech live about the BMW
328i that was last week before last
afore we went to Geneva it says and the
rant against the auto start/stop
function I Drive the 118 d which we
don't actually get here in the United
States and it has the auto start/stop
function but with a manual transmission
he thinks this configuration is more
suited for auto start/stop because when
the car stops he's in neutral and
depresses the clutch and it starts right
up when he puts the clutch back in and
it takes time for the engine to restart
but then he also has to put the
transmission in gear and can't drive
away immediately so he's not really
hurried he says indeed if you feel your
engine restarting even more so with the
diesel in this way it says indeed you
feel your engine restarting even more so
because it's with a diesel in a small
car but after a while you get used to it
and you get stellar miles per gallon
he's also driven automatic gearboxes but
he prefers the manual and doesn't
understand why many people aren't able
to drive with him because we're American
yeah yeah dude funny is referring to in
in brine coolies video on the 328i this
car came with us an idle stop function
so and it also had an automatic
transmission so you come into the light
you put you know put the breakdown hold
it stopped and the engine shuts off and
then as soon as you lift off the brake
the engine kicks in again and this saves
you gas every time you're waiting at a
light for you know five minutes or
whatever mmm and cool he ranted coolly
hated this function and he was really
happy to find the button that let you
define it on turn the idle stop thing
off because in the 328i it was really
obvious when the engine kicked on and
off it was it was a kind of a rougher
system that I would expect from BMW
right but the 118d he's taught that our
readers talking about here or
correspondent is talking about here is a
I drove something similar in Europe I
drove the mini cooper clubman it was a
gasoline version but it had the idol
stop function and and a manual
transmission and it worked pretty well
yeah we had the roof we had the 123d in
yeah a couple years ago and that had the
start/stop function on it to manual
transmission 1 series hatchback yeah
love that car yeah and it makes sense I
would you know if you lift from if you
lift the clutch and then the engine
kicks in again or I know I guess it when
you depress the clutch they didn't kicks
in mmm which makes sense and yeah that
gives you you have a little more time
because you know before you start
because you also have to put it in gear
and everything like that and so it gives
the engine time to really kick in as
opposed to just lifting off the brake
and the engine has to and you kind of
want to go immediately but the engine
has a little time there and oh yeah it's
sort of like the mental timing yeah of
it and I think you're not in an
automatic gearbox car it's just you're
just mentally used to I'm off the brake
up on the gas on the gas i'm on the
brake and that's sort of it's sort of
digital so if you're if you're on one
you're on the other
or you're not on either but it's like an
on/off switch sort of thing whereas in a
manual transmission car there's a little
bit more timing a lot more every limbs
working in it so it's everything I mean
for the most part takes a little bit
longer to happen yeah and in in in that
sense and that sense when you're stopped
at a light i mean i think if you
understand how a manual transmission
works you understand the engines not
actually connected to the drive wheels
anymore when you're just sitting there
so the the concept of the Indian
spinning and wasting fuel makes a little
bit more sense there I think it's easier
to get over psychologically yeah the
Porsche 911 we have in now I also has
the idol stop function hmmm that has
pushes a dual-clutch manual gearbox the
Porsche doppelkupplung hey which I said
right okay yeah yeah I think there might
be a few other syllables on the end of
that but I missed but the but it works
pretty smoothly it definitely works more
smoothly than the one in the BMW and
well we'll see cool he's gonna be in
that car on this weekend so we'll find
out what he thinks of this rant my
street right yes but I think idle stop
systems are going to become more common
and people are gonna have to get used to
them the one in the buick lacrosse we
tested not too long ago which has a mild
hybrid system mm-hmm was fine because
they had that mild hybrid system it's
basically cheating yeah yeah you could
get moving right away you know as soon
as you hit the gas yeah and I think um
you know as as as I guess things like
you using mild hybrid systems cheat I
think Mazda is working on some sort of
technology that sort of doesn't have to
use a starter motor to get the engine
going I think I heard about this last
year where they basically tend the
engine where one of the the piston stops
at top dead center so that when it's
time to go it just fires and you start
moving again you don't have to actually
get that sort of like using a an
electric starter motor to get the engine
going again yeah as they start smoothing
it out I think people will just get used
to it but then you know again I think
that the simple solution is to add
cheater electric motor so that you don't
really feel it and if the price starts
dropping on that electrification
technology if it
ever does I think we'll start seeing
more of that yeah it's certainly nice
you know I've certainly gotten used to
the idea and I love the idea you know
when I was 12 * drive in that Portia and
I was my first stop lightin in the agent
cut out as like good you know I've just
gotten you to the notion that he after
sitting there not moving wasting gas is
annoying it is i mean that's perfectly
good guess that you could be using for
having fun with yeah yeah you want that
gas for when you're putting you and your
push on the pedal yeah so okay I guess
but before we move on to the next meal
email I just kind of wanted to touch on
his the what European seem to be more I
guess less averse to the idea of a
manual transmission versus in North
America less than ten percent of the new
vehicle sold our our our manuals like
why do you think that is oh well I think
it's partly because the gas prices for
one thing I think the u.s. you know
we've had cheap gas for a long long time
and so we could get away with
inefficient torque converter automatic
transmissions and in Europe gas is so
precious that every little thing that
would get you better mileage you know
they went they went for and so you know
it really drove the adoption of manuals
in Europe and so it's not so much that
Europeans are more in tune with their
cars or something like that now it's
just that you know necessities of yes I
wonder also if it's high fuel costs
higher insurance costs congestion
charges that sort of thing is it just
more expensive to own a car just to own
a car in a country like for example the
UK so you know maybe spending twelve
hundred extra bucks or pounds on an
automatic transmission just doesn't
really make sense yeah that would that
make sense you know that definitely part
of the equation to I would imagine the
you know in the fact that you know we've
had such an adoption or such such a
widespread adoption of automatics here
means that there isn't there often isn't
a price prima anymore a foreign
automatic right you know you don't pay
an extra you know certainly in the low
you know very low-end car market you
know the very base twelve thousand
dollar model of you know like the verse
or something only comes with the manual
yeah you know then you go up a level and
you can actually get the automatic and I
guess yeah we've had automatic so long
that the price you know in in cars you
know in a higher range 20,000 and above
yeah it becomes pretty much you know
either the automatic a standard you
can't even get a man yeah this is the
case with the Jaguar that's down there
oh yeah yes prices just built in yeah
seeing that little stupid gear selector
knob is still annoying when blipping the
throttle makes it sound so good like you
can't even just you know sit at a light
look over at someone and give it that
quick romp I'm like yeah ours awesome
isn't it I gotta put it in neutral then
blip the throttle and then step on the
brake and put it back in the drive and
by then they're gone but yeah I think I
think that is sort of interesting and a
lot of people i know just can't even
drive automatic like people i know can't
drive automatics either but that's the
completely different story I was yeah
you mentioned that ten percent figure
though it's a and I think people that
are in the cars would be surprised at
that but yeah my only ten percent of
cards and new cars in the US are sold
with Daniels yeah so sad day said no I
don't think about that anyway I got
another email comes in from a chris from
California he says hi guys i just
purchased a new 2012 tiguan with the 2
point 0 liter TSI turbo engine and have
been doing a little reading into the
various ECU upgrades from companies like
a PR and Jack and says they claim to be
able to do to remap timing booths
pressure etc to offer 60 horsepower and
90 foot pound increases over the stock
programming my question are do they seem
like legitimate claims how much would
such upgrades affect reliability with
this void my warranty and if I were to
go ahead and get the upgrade should I
wait until the break-in periods over and
I have significant miles on the engine
thank you guys and I love all of the car
tech content and that's again Chris
macaela for Nia all right VW tiguan with
it that's funny that doing a performance
ship upgrade in a you want it I hope
that's the all-wheel-drive models you
get the front wheel drive model you're
just gonna spin those skinny tires yeah
I'm not you know it's funny I'm not sure
why you would
didn't wash up a chip at equal why not
here's the thing I mean okay are you
sure Chris bought the take one and
because he needed a small SUV but now he
wants to have a little bit of fun and
yeah you can't really fault a guy for
that and what's interesting is I've
actually just been helping a friend do a
ton of research on a similar thing he
owns a mazdaspeed 3 and he's doing a lot
of like ECU upgrades for things the
trend of Nikki's car more efficient and
more powerful and whatnot and so there
are a lot of things that well for
starters when you're working with a
turbo engine of remap 222 tuning could
easily add 60 horsepower because a lot
of times a vehicle like the tiguan is
tuned for efficiency so it's it's tuned
in such a way that you know maybe it's
you know set up to get the best fuel
economy but with a couple of tweaks you
can get more horsepower out of a turbo
engine pretty easily yeah that makes
sense i mean i know from the BMW side of
things non turbocharged cars you can get
you know the seems legitimate claims you
can get maybe an extra 15 horsepower so
20 horsepower but yeah not not like
these numbers here but a turbo could ya
make a huge difference yeah doing
something like cranking up the boost
pressure it's it does almost logarithmic
the amount of power that you can add the
thing is that there there are a lot of
things that you want to think about
before you do that for starters is that
there's more to an engine than the
engine itself in the case of I really do
you jump back to mazdaspeed3 but in case
of the must be three once you start
ramping up power once you start adding
booth pressure the engine has to add
more fuel to accommodate the extra air
that it's sucking in its cramming into
the cylinder and so usually what they
start doing is they fight they find that
their fuel pump can't keep up with it
and you start running lean and you get
engine issues so you want to make sure
that there are talked to other people
who have done similar monster their cars
and make sure that things like your fuel
system your intake and then the other
sort of support systems that help the
engine to get that air and fuel into the
combustion chamber can keep up with the
remapped programming
the other thing is yes you are
definitely voiding your warranty if you
get caught ya doing something like using
an aftermarket oil filter you're
protected under the law for that but
then once you start tinkering around
with the computer there's not really
much protection for that so you get
caught if you blow your engine up and
they find out that you've been messing
with your ECU pretty much counter
warranty is null and void yeah you don't
get a new warranty based on that or new
engine based on that also I got to
mention two on the same line is in
California you probably also can't renew
your registration yeah they find out
that you've adjusted in getting your
vehicle small checked yeah sometimes
it's an automatic vision will fail yeah
and yeah it creates all sorts of issues
there actually you said life is in
California so yeah yeah you certainly
have to check if it'll pass smog in
California you know see what this
company claims and see what other people
said because yeah you definitely wanna
make sure your car can pass smog right
so as far as waiting till the
breaking-in period is over I would
recommend that if before you do any mod
wait till the break amperes over because
like the first thing you're going to
want to do is floor it and you don't
want to be doing that in the first like
you know 6,000 miles for the Rings have
had a chance to set and the engine sort
of like good and and and and broken in
so yeah I mean maybe not significant
mouths but definitely before the
breaking-in period is over you're gonna
you're going to want to hold off on that
yeah it's usually about 500 miles I
think most cars I'm a little more more
generous than that but yeah I owned well
I've actually never owned a new car so
yeah so I'm just free much going on with
what my father told me right yeah a 60
horsepower and 90 foot pounds of torque
that that's a big boost and and yeah if
that engine really hasn't had time to
get all its parts settled in like you
said then yeah they could be big problem
right but you don't wait too long
because once you get high mileage
vehicle like once if you don't wanna
wait so you have like a 120,000 miles on
your engine before you start trying to
you know up the boost pressure because
then hell yeah and you've got all sorts
of like possible points of failure that
could be like worn out
so but I mean I think you know well
after you after your you're breaking
period you're kind of in a sweet spot
for doing upgrades just understand that
you want to make sure that the rest of
your vehicle keep up with a car and in
the case of the take one I would say
you're probably better buying new tires
stickier tires and the ones that come on
it because the the bone stock TSI I take
one that we tested last year spun tires
away from every light yeah without going
particularly fast and that's because
it's got those kind of lower rolling
resistant all season tires and if you
want to actually have fun with it you're
going to want some summer tires and I
think that the power that tick one makes
you'll probably see a pretty big
definitely if you're going to be adding
60 more a horsepower you're going to
want to make sure that you can actually
put that power to the road but yeah so
we got a our next user next a listener
comment here comes from Matt bat called
himself and he says on episode 45
roadside assistance Wayne myself went on
and on about ugly car mounts for phones
see he says when I needed him out for my
samsung moment they didn't make any
pretty mouth so I built one I body belt
holster for my phone for five dollars a
garmin windshield mount for three
dollars on ebay handed tube of epoxy for
six dollars at home depot I cut the clip
off of I cut the clip off of the belt
clip i made the garmin adapter flat and
glued the two together the only problem
I had was that I attached the garment to
the center of the phone I made a second
one that I attached near the top and
made it easier mounting on the raked
windshield of my 07 mazda6 though he's
got some pictures he let me just Eve
bring here we go yeah it actually looks
like a pretty nice mountain looks nice
and professional here that's actually
the that's the garmin mount okay then in
the next shot he's got the the belt clip
where he sanded off the looks like that
nipple that you would use to connect to
the clip then if you go down a little
bit further
sir and I'll see any pictures of the
finished one but I can see what he's
doing there yeah and how that would
would work yeah sort of DIY in a decent
i plowed DIY yeah I think it's actually
pretty awesome when people figure out to
do that thing do things like that I I
would like to see a picture of the
finished the finished product but I
don't see one of the flickr gallery here
yeah but yeah I'm again all for do it
yourself if you can't find the clip that
does what you want it to do yeah make
one and I mean what would he spent looks
like under 15 bucks yeah which is great
because I know proclip is a pretty
popular brand for this kind of stuff but
their mounds cost fifty bucks or so and
you know I think they might pretty good
of course those are mount into the
dashboard which you could probably also
DIY too yeah I mean yeah if you look at
a lot of the proclip thing there the
just precision-built bit metal a lot of
cases and so what they're doing is
saving you the trouble of taking your
car apart measuring where the bolts are
going like patterning out like metal
then getting like a like a bender and
doing all of that yeah that you saving
you from having to crease your own
aluminum for amount and that's what you
pay for in that case and it's worth the
money I think actually but if you do
have a sort of do-it-yourself spirit you
can again I think I think I said on the
last show pretty much anything you can
buy in a store odds are you could do it
yourself if you just kind of want to do
it well I like this idea to of taking a
like this belt clip it's just an amount
which is designed for specific phones
and they have those all over the place
you can usually find them on a table on
the sidewalk somebody selling them yeah
yeah and in adapting those with ya epoxy
will bring plastic pieces will hold
flashing pieces together yeah I want to
add epoxy to my do everything tool kit
all right there along zip ties duct tape
and epoxy I think you could rule the
world with those well I think I got to
say about the solution to is lots of
times the amount you know the pre-made
bounce you find in stores
have things you don't necessarily aren't
necessarily use either maybe a power
adapter or you know some kind of a you
know aux cable adapter or something like
that and you know so getting one with
just the pieces you want on him you know
you might have to go to DIY build it
yourself and then you know just go out
like it's got he went on ebay bought
like a garment suction cup for three
dollars like which is great I wonder if
that included shipping um it probably
had to i'm sure people just given those
things away or just to go to a thrift
store and like you see something laying
around this actually has me wanting to
go through my box of junk to see if
there's anything that I could like take
apart and may be used for similar summer
situations because with my my my
Thunderbolt like I have an issue where
no car mount that I've actually and I
only really use the ones that are laying
around the office I refuse to buy one
because car tech editor yeah but none of
the ones that I have linger around the
office like fit the phone right they all
either hold down the volume button when
they grip the phone by the sides or
they're not deep enough to hang on to my
phone with the extended battery I like a
perfectly good belt clip sort of thingy
in a drawer right now and I'm thinking I
might go home and do something similar
this afternoon I sent your next how-to
article essence essence so I think
that's going to be maybe yeah look for
that coming up soon all right let's move
on to Brian from Connecticut who sent us
an email and he's he plods us for our
excellent show oh yeah thank you right
and he's mentioned a yes Tobias last
year about a car stereo and Antoine Doug
gave him some good advice there and I
says now I'm looking for a used car the
problem is that i'm looking for to
submodels a 1996 to 2,000 only honda
civic DX or HX I want something simple
because I do my own maintenance so that
means timing belts clutches and all that
I also did not want a sunroof in fear of
it leaking something reliable simple and
nicer looking than my older car which is
a 91 Civic and he says I plan to keep
this 91 Civic and one day restore it but
that's another day what other used cars
sites are there I tried
the obvious cars com craigslist org ebay
and local forms but does anyone else
have any ideas so places define a used
cars online and you certainly named the
big ones yeah those are actually the
ones that usually pop into mind for me
yeah and you know cars com also they get
a lot of listings from like local
newspapers and things like that too so
they pretty well cover the used car
market you know what's out there is
they've got a pretty good line on that
there there aren't really anything as
baby compete with that or craigslist or
ebay motors as well ebay motors is
pretty comprehensive I think doesn't
Edmonds have a edmunds com has a good
used car locator but I don't know if
they use someone else's or if they have
their own sort of like search algorithm
kind of going through right now and it
looks yeah they're they're pretty
they're pretty granular looks like on
Edmonds yeah and they do they also let
you see what I guess blue book prices
are or you know what the prices should
be and you you get to compare that to
you know press on to bar offering so
that that can help you in finding a good
value but you know I think the thing is
if you're looking for a particular car
like this you know the DX are they
checks and lately probably people are
holding on to their DX's because the you
know the mileage is is so good that with
it with upper prices it might be hard to
find one but yeah looking at you know
these submodels that there might not be
as many around and people might be you
know loath to give them up at this point
you just have to really play the waiting
game yep yeah I don't think I'm put like
alerts in in ebay motors or something
like that but you know eventually one of
them was going to crop up yeah you can I
think yet would alerts an ebay motors
for like this is the car that I want due
to the years that I'm interested in this
the price I'm willing to pay and when
you when something pops up you can get
alerted to that but yeah you put it
perfectly there it's kind of when you're
looking for something specific I think
we kind of mentioned this in the the
first email that we read today when
you're looking for something specific
that like whether i'd say a used
explorer with the navigation package its
you kind of gotta
expand your search look nationwide and
just kind of wait for something to come
available yeah and there are like used
car dealers have networks computerized
networks of the cars that are available
in there lots and so they can trade back
and forth and you know cars calm and
edmunds com that those I think those
happen to this similar network so they
like us get a look at them so yeah
there's really you know not much else
out there really define these cars I
mean you could always you know if you
see DX or an HX drivin on your
neighborhood walk up to the driver yeah
yeah 500 bucks yeah make it one I have a
car yeah yeah look for one that's just
sitting you know rusting in a yard
somewhere not don't look for one of
resting the rest is the worst thing that
you want to see on a car you're about to
buy because for every square inch of
rest if you see there are four that you
don't yeah and Brian here says he's from
Connecticut too so yeah that's going to
be that's that's one of those states
where cars do rust not like we get out
you're in California so I guess that's
uh wraps up the emails that we get this
