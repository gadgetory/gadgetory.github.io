this is real but don't expect to see it
on the road anytime soon welcome to what
the future on today's show
BMW self-driving motorcycle california's
plan to fight climate change from space
and we finally learned who will be the
first paying passenger on a SpaceX
mission to the moon ok this might be the
coolest video you see all week
BMW modified this motorcycle to drive
itself now the bike can't start on its
own somebody has to get it balanced and
moving but once it's going it can do
pretty much everything else
righto brake steer and stay balanced
this is just a prototype the goal isn't
to put it into production but BMW is
using this to study writing dynamics and
hopefully build new safety technologies
in the future so think features like
Lane Assist and automatic braking who
knows when any of that would actually go
into production bikes but BMW says it
hopes to implement findings from this
research soon all right governor
Moonbeam is living up to his nickname
California's Governor Jerry Brown says
his state will launch satellites to
monitor climate change actually he said
so we're gonna launch our own satellite
our own damn satellite ok why the
fighting words Brown suggested that the
Trump administration isn't using NASA
enough for climate research California
has teamed up with a company called
planet labs it specializes in tiny
satellites in fact there are more than
150 planet lab satellites taking images
of the earth right now the plan is to
develop satellites that can pinpoint the
source of a pollutant that data would be
made available to the public along with
the help of the Environmental Defense
Fund no timetable on when California
would launch its first satellites
we do know when SpaceX plans to send a
torch to the moon and we know who it is
on Monday Newland musk said you sakae
ozawa will be the first paying SpaceX
passenger
he's the Japanese billionaire that
founded online fashion models o town and
he's not going alone
he says he'll invite six to eight
artists he hopes they'll create art
based on their experience or a project
he's calling dear moon Misawa hasn't
said how will select the lucky few but
if you're watching I like to consider
myself a bit of an artiste it's not
clear how much coin II drop for this all
we know is has already put a deposit
down that must called a quote
non-trivial amount now if all goes as
planned the mission launches in 2023 and
one more note NASA's tests has sent back
its first image and the satellite has
already found its first new planet
scientists call it a super earth that's
orbiting a star nearly identical to our
own Sun all right what makes you say WTF
let us know in the comments that's going
to do it for this week thank you for
watching what the future
I'm Andy Altman we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
