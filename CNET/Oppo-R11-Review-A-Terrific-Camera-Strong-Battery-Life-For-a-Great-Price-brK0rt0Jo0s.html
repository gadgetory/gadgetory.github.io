iphone money you're in luck there are a
lot of great phones out there for less
than $500 the latest is the Opera or
11th yep it looks like an iPhone and no
it's not available through carriers in
the US but for those concessions you get
a premium feeling phone with a terrific
camera and plenty of battery life the
stars of the show here are there are 11s
dual cameras they'll shoot bouquet star
portrait photos which will give you a
spiffy new face book display picture
with depth of field effect the camera
also does well in landscape and
low-light settings making it a strong
all-rounder it's not perfect though
Apple didn't just inspire opera's
hardware the software has also modeled
after iOS and you'll notice that most
when using the camera while the qualcomm
snapdragon 616 generally performs well
you will notice a lag when taking photos
it's one small sacrifice to make though
considering the r11 performed similarly
to Google's excellent pixel phones in
our benchmark tests another highlight
here is battery life I never had a
problem getting through a day and that's
with constant use of music podcasts and
the occasional video stream in our tests
the battery lasted 14 hours and 45
minutes that's behind the Samsung Galaxy
s8 but ahead of the iPhone 7 plus if
you're in Australia you can pick up the
r11 for $650 those in the US and UK will
have to import from China though you'll
spend roughly $440 or 340 pounds
it may be edged out slightly by the 1
plus 5 thanks to that further superior
processor but the r11 is definitely
worth considering if Samsung or Apple
are too pricey for your tastes</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
