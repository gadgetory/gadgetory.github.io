payment app I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your cnet update snapchat the app
infamous for data breaches and teen
sexting is expanding into finance
snapchat has updated its app with snap
cash it's a new feature that lets you
send money to friends through chat all
you have to do is type a dollar sign and
number to send that amount to a friend
as long as that friend is also signed up
for snap cash the transaction takes
about a day to process it's all powered
by Square and many people trust square
with their mobile transactions but it's
hard to trust snapchat which has proven
to be easily hackable 100,000 private
user photos have been exposed online and
millions of phone numbers have been
leaked in a data breach earlier this
year kind of makes you think twice about
trusting it with your checking account
it's only available for Android now it
won't be long before other messaging
apps get into mobile payments there's
been talk of Facebook working on a
similar service to send money over chats
but speaking of secure messaging
whatsapp just leveled up its privacy
standards and now offers end-to-end
encryption it's nearly impossible for
hackers or government agencies to snoop
on text conversations making whatsapp
one of the most secure text messaging
apps available the encryption is only
for the Android version of the app and
only for texting not photos or videos or
group messages but what's app will
expand encryption to other features in
time as well as for apple's ios app the
car pickup service uber has been
criticized for unsavory business
practices and it's once again in the
media spotlight for bad behavior a top
uber executive Emile Michael was at a
dinner event boasting to guess about how
he wants to spend a million dollars to
dig up dirt on reporters that are
critical of the uber app and to also spy
on those reporters families this was
said openly in front of a BuzzFeed
editor the uber executive targeted his
comments particularly against one
journalist Sarah Lacy
editor of the Silicon Valley website
Pando daily who has written articles
calling out uber for sexist practices
after the story came out the uber
executive apologized but this is yet
another example of ubers leaders acting
like bullies it's been reported that
uber staff plays dirty by attacking
competing car pickup apps like lyft and
get by flooding these apps with fake
orders and canceling the rides an uber
continues to grow and expand new
partnerships with all of this uber just
made a deal with Spotify to let writers
stream the music service to the car
stereo that's your tech news update and
there's always more at cnet com from our
studios in New York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
