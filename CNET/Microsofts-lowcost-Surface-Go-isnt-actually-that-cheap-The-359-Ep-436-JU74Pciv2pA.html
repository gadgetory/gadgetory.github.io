August 2nd this is episode 436 of the
359 podcast and today's episode is being
sponsored by USB technology the USB
implementers forum reminds consumers
that USB if' logos are displayed on
certified USB products so the next time
you're shopping for a reliable USB
charger cable or device look for the
logos get the whole story at USB excuse
me and enabling USB org and now here
your host we got the entire dream team
Ben Fox Ruben Roger Chang and Alfred
what are you doing I'm trying to start
the podcast with a positive message for
our viewers all right I don't know why
you guys are always so cynical all the
time but I'm trying to come from a place
of jaded journalists right we're
supposed to be you were saying right
before we were getting started that
Apple is on the cusp Apple's on the
verge of hitting 1 trillion dollars in
market valuation it's a little bit less
than a dollar wait stock prices it needs
to hit two hundred and seven dollars and
five cents the magic number will keep
you updated as this goes on but in the
meantime we're gonna be talking about
the Microsoft Surface go dan Ackerman's
got a review of that we'll break it down
for you we'll talk a little bit about
t-mobile and why it doesn't think it
needs to raise prices for its unlimited
data plans and lastly a surprises -
which had the most hottest selling
console in June a little alfred doesn't
think it's much of a surprise but as
always if you have any questions leave
in the comments section but I will pay
out the best and we'll get to them in 3
minutes and 59 seconds hang on everybody
we'll see you back in the chat shortly
and here we go for the recording and 3 -
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
Ben Fox ribbon I'm Alfred Aang CNET is
out with its review of the surface go
and while it's a decent casual computing
device our own Dan Ackerman says that
this supposedly affordable - and one
isn't actually that cheap it actually
was started 399 which nuanced on the
surface haha is a decent price but then
if you tack on the
a keyboard cover which cost $129 stylus
which is $100 and more ram which is
another $150 then all of a sudden you've
got pricey device yeah yeah the mouse
nice you try Microsoft but you're not
tricking me on this one when I think
when they first announced house like oh
that's a pretty good price I'll probably
get it and then I saw a review of it
where it was like oh if you actually
want it to be the thing it you know says
it is that's an extra like $300 so yeah
it's actually more than $300 it's like
300 which which means that like maybe at
that point you're in the market for a
surface pro which is you know obviously
more expensive the thing that Dan
mentions though is that the surface go
is not particularly new concept from
Microsoft there was a surfaced three
from 2015 yeah and that was also 10-inch
so maybe it's better different I don't
know yeah look I don't know problems I
don't know what this competes against is
it had Pro competitors an iPad
competitor yeah I think it's more so an
iPad competitor but the case I could
rather just get the iPad okay that's you
you do you Roger let's talk about
t-mobile I posted blow out numbers
yesterday particularly with phone
subscriber growth once again leading the
industry in that metric but more
importantly I got a chance to talk with
the CFO Braxton Carter who told me that
they weren't expecting to raise prices
for the limited and plans anytime soon
now that's important because we've seen
over the last few weeks 18 t Verizon and
Sprint all either introduce new plans or
new tiers of plans that have been more
expensive so for for awhile now this has
been like sort of a golden age for
bargain seekers in the wireless world
but it seemed like this was gonna change
but at least t-mobile's kind of holding
steady and saying they're not raising
prices right and they're kind of the
they're the ones that changed everything
up they want to keep getting in new
customers but are they making a lot of
money to like they've they've done well
with getting customers but is it showing
on their bottom line yeah they're so
their profits were up year over year
certain in particular service revenue
which is a pretty key metric there that
was also up there they're basically
growing by adding new customers and
that's basically what the CFO said was
the big
want to sacrifice any kind of long-term
gains for sort of the short-term bump of
like getting more money out of customers
in the near term can you tell us a bit
about why they would want to merge with
Sprint uh ultimately it's about spectrum
and sort of the the assets that Sprint
has that they can use to expand their 5g
network they talked a lot about 5g
yesterday and the combination of
Sprint's assets with t-mobile's assets
would give them a deeper broader network
so wait what's the catch though why
aren't they increasing their prices I
don't think it's because they're very
nice no it's not about nice it's about
customer growth they think that if they
keep their prices lower they can keep
customer growth going which has been
true they've led the industry in
customer growth for 18 consecutive
quarters so it's been working there's
still number three though right they are
still number three they're in terms of
the base they're still pretty far off
from Verizon AT&amp;amp;T so they think there's
a lot of runway to grow nice alright
lastly pop quiz you tell me which was
the best selling console in June I mean
I'll just I don't I love it do it
Nintendo switch wrong you're totally
wrong shocking surprise I don't believe
it it's the NES classic which was
brought back at the end of the month and
that's what I think is most impressive
to me is it was the top selling console
despite coming out on June 29th
basically three days left in the month
outsold all the other ones obviously
from a sales perspective a revenue
perspective Sony's ps4 actually was the
top-selling
yeah I mean it makes the most sense that
they sold a ton of units considering
there was only $40 in the last time it
was available for sale it was like
everybody was scrambling to get it
because they thought they wouldn't be
able to get it again although I have to
say my buddy bought one we turn it on
also I realized I didn't really like any
of the games yeah yeah anyways they're
more these stories check us out CNET I'm
Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred
Aang thanks for sitting
and thank you for joining us for the
recording of the audio podcast and to
drive fast I know my camera sucks it's
the only one that will fit in here go
ahead and submit your questions and
comments now so we can keep this
conversation going from the NES classic
- why the hell yeah what I will say like
I was souvenirs classic and furthermore
the NES classic we're excited to like
turn it on and like play the contra game
I realize it wasn't the contrary
membered did you play super contra and
said I think it was super contra yes
super contra would not run on NES well
yeah I think that's why he was like this
isn't a contra played this isn't the
contrary played it's not the it's not
the Nintendo version that's part of that
game because it's how they judge you
remember how they jump they did that
three flips in the air while they're
jumping I always do
did you actually count the flips it was
a lot of flips no ridiculous it was like
it was like just joy have you seen those
guys they're pretty they're pretty Jack
that's how real Contras jump dude yeah
yeah having the machine gun doesn't slow
you down an infinite amount of bullets
yeah that's right that's right anyways
that's when we loaded that game up and
started playing we're like wait there's
something like one of my friends was
swore that this was the game and the
abreast of us were like no this seems
all wrong this sucks
it's not great so yeah yeah I was
disappointed after that we just switched
between that and like the
three-foot-long table these are like I'm
done with this know my SNES classic yeah
then did you play super contra on that
yeah just plain metal it's that super
chondral so I don't know what the name
of the game is on the NES classic is it
like contra NES or SNES cloud with that
contract just contra no that's the thing
it's not like it's not the Nintendo
contract oh hey growing up it was like
the Japanese for Mario and Mario country
you say it Ben I'm not walking into that
one so I did all right
refused let's play metal wait how do you
say it's like much better I
I know but like it's a much better game
Thank You contribute to this
conversation because I have an NES
classic but I refuse to open it it's
gonna be I'm gonna keep it in my attic
for like 2500 because they're gonna come
out the NES classic classic right and
completely like destroy the value of my
NES ethic you can't contribute to this
conversation because you have a speech
impediment you're poaching people with
speech impediments can still contribute
a contribution yes yes it's Thursday
folks there we go we're already off the
rails is Thursday the 359 s Friday and
by the way in terms of the Apple update
we're about 20 30 cents away it's 200
6.66 why do again Joker's 207 tell
people why this matters why is that
interesting I don't I don't care about
that but I mean you I don't care if you
don't care yeah I know but why why do
people care about it it's it's a big
number one trillion dollars it's a huge
number it's a big milestone there's only
been one company that's ever briefly
touched and that's was a Chinese company
this is the first tech company to do it
obviously there's been a lot of talk
about whether or not Google Apple or
Amazon we're gonna be the first to hit
this milestone it's a big milestone but
like I guess I just don't celebrate when
other people get really rich it's like
how does that affect me affect our
viewers and our listeners I love our
viewers who are fans of Apple or
interested what happens when Apple has
we invested in them that we invested yes
right so also just some extent it's
really like pretty incredible and
telling to see them hit a trillion
dollars in market valuation considering
that the company was at death's doorstep
you know a couple decades ago wasn't
alive at that point yeah to continue to
consider the fact that this is a company
that was getting absolutely clobbered in
the market could not get a foothold
against Microsoft and is now like very
very close to reaching a trillion well
what this new Asia I guess weeks to how
powerful like the enormous strength of
Apple at this point would this be like
the equivalent of like in in like 30
years from now like snapchat is all of
us is like about to hit like a trillion
dollars is that like put it another way
it's like it's one a like an athlete
sets a record and yes you're not
benefiting from that record but it's
still interesting to see right like when
Michael Phelps hits 12 I guess yes I
also did not care about that but you're
just a pathetic in general this is true
yeah yeah I mean I guess it's a it's a
thing that people will talk about years
from now Apple was the first tech
company to reach a trillion dollar
company yes
I just don't see how it affects me no
it's always about me that's a good point
though I mean like it's not like we're a
business podcast it's I I appreciate you
being a wet blanket all the time all the
time I want my own podcast where it's
just called everything sucks and I just
bring up it wasn't that it wasn't enough
like it is an episode is the Netflix
show is the show where I just go on and
I'm not enthusiastic like this all sucks
yeah that's that's your the top test of
the day none of it matters just go out
and do something fun why are you wanting
yeah yeah where I got any sadder let's
get to questions yes bro hey question
time let's talk a bunch about the
tablets let's talk about that surface go
with that over the hellenistic oh it's
called alright got it see I'm not the
tech expert here I'm just the button
pusher siddhart says how does it compare
with the Samsung Tab 4 ooh for one the
tap for is Android so it's a little bit
more limited this is obviously Windows
it's a bit more full-fledged it's it is
a PC
they call it two-in-one you can't really
confuse the Samsung with this one
because the tab is still an Android
based one right at the same time as Dan
mentions in a story because it's got a
Pentium chip it's not as powerful as you
would get with like a regular Windows
laptop or even the surface pro so that's
definitely something that you should
consider if you are actually on the
market for something like this next up
from Timothy dude does it have a SIM
card slot
oh man very specific question Oh we
needed to get Dan in today about
unfortunately the issue we were trying
to get Dan in he was working from home
so that's why we're a little flat-footed
when it comes to the specific answers to
to like the tech specs but expects yeah
I don't think it does have a sim card
slot though because it doesn't have the
qualcomm trip to do that kind of like no
sim card slot I'm not seeing anywhere in
our review let's take one from marius
lund well actually let's combine a bunch
of them together from Marius lon
- drew Nielson if they had sold this
with a keyboard it would have been a
good product the fact that they are
starting to partition off all the
essential core things to make a computer
a computer is a little disheartening but
drew Nielsen files it up saying but will
casual tablet users need a keyboard and
a stylus key word being casual but if
you're a casual tablet user you would
just got a tablet but you wouldn't get a
surface at all I guess that price maybe
the argument there like if you were
Microsoft the counter-argument was like
yeah you can get this it's a tablet but
also it can do more productivity stuff
if you want to put money into it but
it's just an affordable alternative to
an iPad I'm not buying it they should
have just kept the stylus on the pen
with it I mean the keyboard with it I
think it's useless without those but I
mean I also like if it were just that I
would just get like an Android tablet
right or like the Galaxy Tab s were yeah
I just an Android tap or Chromebook I
mean yeah yes you really want to save
money Chromebook is probably actually
your best bet yeah it's like they went
after the market that's like oh we were
trying to reduce the prices here but
then it's like oh nope we're just gonna
like if you actually wanted to use it as
like a computer with a keyboard and the
stylus then your that's like an extra
like a couple hundred well no the the
Galaxy Tab as for all the names sort of
confuse me after a while it's 650 bucks
so it's significantly more expensive but
it does come with the tablet built in
alright sorry a stylist There s pro
stylist S Pen Stylus included no
keyboard no keyboard
well that's a good segue into a question
from Josh Boyd uh would you recommend
the surface go over a higher tier
Chromebook or Samsung Chromebook plus uh
uh depends on the price your Chromebook
yeah I would just recommend the
Chromebook just get the Chromebook if
you're worried about productivity I
think the Chromebooks I mean I think the
idea is that you know you don't get a
Chromebook when you want to do something
that like Chrome OS or Android doesn't
support in the sense oh I need to edit
photos I need a video I need to like
code or something like that but I use my
I like I have my like work computer
where I like edit photos and videos on
right and make bad also argue that if
you've got a surface go and you're
running something extensive like
Photoshop it probably isn't the best
success that's great for that do it but
it's not it might be frustrating yeah so
if you just need like web browsing stuff
I would recommend just getting a
Chromebook if you need like actual stuff
outside of that then just get don't get
the surface go the surface pro or
something a little bit more
sophisticated would probably be better
suited for you
the real Phantom zero asks can you
install desktop software on it on the
surface go yes go yeah yes right just
like I said it's probably not gonna run
super fast and chips a little slow you
would have to have it on Windows 10 and
not Windows 10s which is kind of like
the locked version of it but it's it
should still have like desktop apps that
are approved for Windows 10 on it but
like you have to get it through the
Windows Store so you might not be able
to get Chrome Oh true yeah good point
a follow-up for Michael Brown says I
think the new Samsung tab should have
run Chrome OS what do you guys think I
agree I think most tablets should be
running on Chrome OS I think like
obviously Google has this whole like
identity crisis going on with like
alright so this is Chrome OS and this is
Android and this is whatever but they
are making this push toward nakumo as
like everything on mobile is Chrome OS
they're trying to I feel like there's
there's definitely a concerted effort to
get them to merge but there's - yeah two
different places because it's really
frustrating cuz on my on my Chromebook
it's like I have Chrome OS on it but
it's the version that like you can
download android apps on but if you open
up the Android app it only opens up in
the small
window as if it's like on a phone I
would argue uh sort of like the
Chromebook Chromebooks in general or
more considered like cheaper devices
there a lot of high-end high-end chrome
bowties them like the most popular ones
are like the cheaper ones yeah where is
I think in there in Samsung's mind like
having an Android tablet would still be
considered technically a high-end device
yeah but like Chrome OS is like much
better as a browsing experience I would
argue then like on Android and you know
for me I can just speak from a level of
like security wise it's like much more
secure than Android is right well I
think it's the the counter-argument
there are those the breadth of apps
yeah the usefulness of Android versus
Chrome so anything they should just do
what Chromebooks do where like they give
you Chrome OS but you can put Android
apps on it right so Chrome OS and
Android are more likely to merge than
Mac OS and iOS correct well according to
the folks at Apple yes because they had
that big banner that said no no that's
right yeah I mean they've done things to
kind of get native work together
Josh Boyd a points out that technically
removing the keyboard is in fact cutting
costs good point there Michael Brown
wants to know why can't you do photo
editing on the pixel book I mean you can
but it's like you can't get like
Photoshop honor there are apps like that
you can use for it but I'm most used to
photoshop and there are just some
features on it that like I really use a
lot that aren't available on the photo
editing apps that I used on my
Chromebook gotcha
from the real phantom zero they'd like
us to try to compare the performance of
the surface go to another device what is
their closest facsimile for comparison
sake
candy ass classic ouch oh my god jeez
that's tough one they do a lot of I mean
like Dan tends to do a lot of
benchmarking in the PC lab so I feel
like he'd probably be a better word
handful of like Qualcomm Snapdragon
powered laptops that were announced at
the beginning at the end of last year
that we're not sure
every year true I mean like it's still a
Pentium chip so that means these were
these were armed ships armed ship
powered ones this is this is still x86
right right so it's so it's a Pentium
chip it's not like they put in an Intel
mobile chip writing like that so you're
probably gonna get like better power
than like whatever the core em lineup
was a couple years ago but I think like
this might actually be a stepped-up
version of that we're not a hundred
percent sure but you're probably gonna
get more power than a mobile chip but
less than you would for like like a
higher level like it's not it doesn't
have guys no JIT PC with like
top-of-the-line or even like a
mainstream yeah and and to the extent
that you would probably notice the
difference like with a lot of these
things like we talked about the
difference between iPhone one year
versus the next year they say like this
is so much faster it's like generally
speaking I don't really notice yeah with
this type of a situation if you're like
stepping down from surface pro to a
surface go you probably will notice like
a difference in performance yeah there
you go I mean I guess the comparison
over though it's not really a KERS
probably to an iPad right like an iPad
like yeah an iPad not an iPad pro yeah I
would go there it's about in terms of
how you use it right because this is
really meant more for a casual browsing
I mean it you're not doing anything too
intensive and that's kind of what you're
doing on your iPad - hmm before we
switch gears into another topic from DS
Eng do previous versions of the keyboard
cover work with the new surface go or
surface pro I don't I I don't believe so
it needs to be the right size yeah so I
don't know if you're talking about like
first surface 3 but sorry you can't
answer it so if it didn't work though I
mean I like fit fit you know outside of
the argument here like it is it's pretty
much just a Bluetooth keyboard right
yeah we're just saying like if it would
actually like it needs to feel like and
we click in it so if it doesn't even if
it does click in like if it's the right
size like if the if it would look weird
being larger like surface area I I don't
I don't know we're gonna take all your
text back questions well we'll mail them
to Diggs
we will get Dan to to answer all your
questions and get really mad at him for
working from home one day horrible one
day that we need him from Congo Lux is
the new tab s for ip68 and does they
have gorilla glass brain you're killing
don't blame me blame the chat they got
there's stumping you this they got good
question yes i I don't know if it's ip68
I would suspect girl glasses yes that
seems to be I don't know which version
of gorilla glass but I don't know did
have they put they done water resistance
on their tablets I don't know I don't
know that much of a terrible some
tablets sorry
especially yeah that the tablet
particular I know that just like it just
launched but we I know but I'm not gonna
say it you know nice because you guys
ignored me earlier today are from Mike
Shaw is Apple now big enough to be its
own country oh it has been for a long
time and yeah I think there are only
like 15 countries with the same GDP is
its market cap so it's pretty staggering
yeah yeah it can be its own country you
could break out of California nice I
mean California tried to break itself up
at their own island that's why the
headquarters is shaped like a spaceship
can you reach a trillion it go and they
like make their own islands I would
actually care about that because there's
a new place that I could possibly visit
and you would be welcome to cheap he
would not be welcome we got time for a
couple more what is the maximum
recommended TV size for the SNES classic
I would say not that big right since the
things like about 720 you know what we
my buddies we played it on a like a
projector that one gets the wall it's
fine so you're already kind of like
forgiving some of the fidelity because
exactly vector so the graphics yeah they
are what they are like it's it's yeah
it's I'm gonna get any kind of input lag
because it's you're doing it on like
through like HDMI as opposed to like VGA
cables
I don't I like when you played it was it
ratio to be a square or was it like yeah
so you don't really need that large of a
TV for it no you don't but I think like
for folks who I mean who have big TVs
now it's yeah it's not like it's not a
concern like I wouldn't be worried
you're not gonna specifically buy a
small TV for it but if you want to play
without the ratio without like those
black bars on the sides and like try to
find a square TV which I don't even know
if they make those anymore TVs no not
that CTR is but I'm saying like the TV
that's like it could be a flat-screen
but just like in the shape of a square
you can't even do it on a CTR because
it's an HDMI cable oh that's true yeah
yeah so which is why you're not really
getting at input lag boy yeah I don't
like something with a square ratio
probably makes the most sense
Alfred you had a little input lag there
for a second good because the TV size
here is wrong for the record you have
inspired Drive fast who says their goal
is to become apathetic but they don't
want to put any effort into reaching
that goal a better writer than any of us
okay so on the way out the door right
now what do we think is the next classic
console coming up Timothy do thinks
maybe the PlayStation classic that's a
good thought I would put my money on the
n64 I think oh yeah they would do the
n64 you know at this point of the year
they would have already announced it I'm
wondering if it's happening this year
maybe the wait till next year I mean
they're bringing back the NES classic
and they brought back the SNES classic
for a little while maybe they'll wait a
year these are finding anchors for these
guys because obviously I would like many
versions of all of these and they're
just there like to be are a lot of p1
money make and I believe they're they're
probably extremely profitable like how
expensive can that be you know what
they're gonna do they're gonna make the
Wii they're gonna jump ahead of
everything and just do the the Wii U
classic Maisel at all and I think we
have all these left over it's just very
$5 classic everybody yeah Nancy I would
say the n64 is next I just I don't know
what it's gonna come i I'm surprised it
hasn't been announced already but who
else is gonna jump on this train we've
seen there are big
so sick right um so I guys got that
third party one and it's not that great
at games I have one who it's called at
games they function fine the emulator
can get a little wonky in the sound chip
yeah I think that's the issue Atari and
Sega have done that and I don't know if
the experience isn't as slick yeah
seeing like PlayStation Classic I don't
really I don't expect it to happen I
think Nintendo is gonna keep the train
running but I don't know maybe an xbox
classic original sighs what would the
what would the PlayStation classic yeah
yeah the Xbox would include like a giant
brake controller the problems like
classics for like these other like
consoles is that like they're not more
that and like they're not the ones that
are making these games like Nintendo
like that's truly the right song yeah
and even though like contra they don't
have the rights to it but like they're
able to negotiate that the Konami game
right boy like for a Playstation like
think of all the classic PlayStation
games are out there it's none of them
are like really made by Sony that's a
good point that's exactly what it Caixin
is saying in the chat that there there
would be major licensing problems yeah a
lot of these well Xbox is got well
really just got halo which is why money
to be made they'll make it work and even
with Halo that's Bungie like if it came
out in an instant oh well I think but
they split off from microphone now but
they own the rights yeah but my point is
like like think about like the n64
classic like a lot of the good games
were there like are from rare which like
they don't own anymore so I don't know
if they still have the rights to banjo
kazooie and I can put it back out there
have to be associated on in charge of
putting out their own classics which
they have been doing and yes software
bundles well as far as like a heart I'd
imagine they'd play ball though
yeah like but you're right in that
Nintendo is in a unique position where
the majority of their titles are first
party yes opposed a third party so I
don't know I don't think I'd buy an xbox
classic for what it's worth I think it
would be like Forza and Halo or the
first part of games that are any of them
a bowl of fable that's right I don't
know what
that's it yeah that's not great line up
did they have NBA Jam those are all
you're talking you're talking about only
first party yeah yeah and also ma jam
isn't on the Super NES or it is super
it's on Super NES classic because so I
didn't have Chrono Trigger which is the
best game for the SNES classica I'll
fight anyone in the comments only in the
comments so not physically careful
everybody he's heating up Ricky B and
Josh Boyd pointing out we're overlooking
game boys I think with the success of
which and its portability option that's
a very viable option although I think we
might see something more likely to a
virtual console version of these for the
switch before we see a console version
release kind of maybe I don't know maybe
I'm off base on them the other thing
that Nintendo is trying to do with the
new like subscription service that
they're doing come like September
October or so is that every month you're
getting like a free like classic game I
could imagine them post box live does
yeah does the same thing to where I can
imagine them doing the exact same thing
with but like for Game Boy games there
but I still think they're gonna continue
selling these like classic consoles like
even with like they're they're the
classic games on like the Nintendo
market right if they brought back the
Gameboy would it be in color classic
gameboy color was just literally ya know
but no the one that I play the one that
I played was basically like like a
calculator screen yeah yeah I only
played Tetris on that I only played
Tetris on it like me you really play
only Tetris
[Laughter]
it's Pokemon considered a first party I
believe it is you know it's yeah I antic
but Niantic belongs
pokemon its a pokemon company antic yeah
Niantic his Pokemon God that my bed
there is a Pokemon company that Nintendo
owns part of a super complicated
yeah they don't actually own the full
rights to it there's like a there's a
shareholder in the company that deals
with the cards and the games every
Pokemon should have reached a trillion
dollars first no I care about that it
might have after Pokemon go but that was
a whole deal with Nintendo stop
I remember a Nintendo stock surged on
Pokemon go until I get one point like
one of the executives reminded people
like actually we don't know that we
don't hold that company they were okay
one thing to think about on the way out
the door
drive fastest we should get 359 episode
classics read reviewing old tech could
you just see us doing like an mst3k type
thing we're watching our old episodes
and reviewing oh my god they were so
miserable we could do it back in the old
studio too so we could do it in the
podcast studio we could do that or we
would well it would be us like in a
studio with a screening room and we'd
watch the old episode and we'd like to
have it on
I'm not rewiring that whole damn studio
again that'll be the fourth time oh wow
why don't we just have the commercial
market here's the part where benzos
Mario again let me make fun of it we
just have a super code that or yeah I'm
kind of me fumbling the introduction
I've been trying to avoid saying Mario
this whole episode but no you said it
twice yeah earlier no I didn't
yeah you said Mario nice I only say it
the right way which is my way get it out
of your system New Jersey Philly Philly
