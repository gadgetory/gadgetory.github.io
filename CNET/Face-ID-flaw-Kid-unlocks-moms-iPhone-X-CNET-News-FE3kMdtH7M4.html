crack face ID on the iPhone 10 maybe you
just have to be a kid that looks a lot
like your mom or dad apples facial
recognition system is facing new
criticism after a ten-year-old kid was
able to unlock his mom's iPhone the
family posted a video to YouTube showing
the trick in an interview with wired the
father at Ulla Malik said that he and
his wife were surprised when their son
just unlocked her phone with a glance
and although it was funny at first now
the mom knows she can't keep things
secret on her phone using face ID as for
the dad's phone his son was able to
unlock it once but it didn't work again
since the father shared these details on
a blog post he wrote on LinkedIn now
Apple has said the biometric security
system can be fooled by family members
that look alike but this is the first
time we're hearing reports of a young
child unlocking their parents phones
showing how face ID is less secure than
a fingerprint scam reporters at Wired
asked the mom sana sherwani to register
her face with the system under different
lighting conditions to see what would
happen and they found that when her face
was registered with indoor nighttime
lighting it was easier for her son to
fool the phone so if your kid could
unlock your phone maybe try reteaching
the system your face under better
lighting or just give up on biometrics
and use a passcode every time like a
barbarian if you have had any issues
with face ID be sure to list snow in the
comments I'm Bridget Carey and for more
details on the tech behind face ID head
