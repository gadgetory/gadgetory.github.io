shop on our phones I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update going shopping
on your phone can sometimes be a bit of
a clunky experience sure you can easily
search for a specific thing on Amazon
and buy it with one click but if you
want to browse like you do at a mall you
might be opening up multiple apps and
websites for each store or you may
issues Pinterest to collect inspiration
but it's not simple to just buy
something you see on Pinterest well
there are some apps right now that are
trying new methods for mobile shopping
you may have heard about fancy that's
sort of like Pinterest you can follow
other users but you also can purchase
what you see right away and there's a
brand new shopping app getting buzz it's
called spring it acts like a virtual
mall with storefronts for 70 brands
tucked inside of it the app claims that
450 brands will be on it by next year
spring takes a percentage cut of each
sale it has this Instagram feel to it
where you flip through photos and it's
really easy to buy something they make
it a quick process before you have time
to second-guess yourself but this app
isn't for everyone it's focused on high
fashion and that means high price tags
personally I rather hunt through a sale
rack than pay these prices but with the
way it's designed I wouldn't be
surprised if this model is copied by
others now if you're in the market for a
SmartWatch this fall will be the time to
do some tech shopping Motorola is
holding an event September 4th to show
off its sleek round moto 360 smartwatch
the first two weeks of September are
going to be busy with new product
announcements you have Samsung showing
off a new gadget or two a day before
Motorola and then a week after on
September 9th Apple is expected to show
off the new iPhone but let's go back to
smartwatches
the fashion brand gues is working on
putting some high tech and its
fashionable watches with the help of
Martian now you may not know about
Martian but they have made several
Bluetooth connected watches including
the affordable and stylish Martian
notifier that's priced at 120 dollars
you can find more information about it
on CNET
guests said that it would also work with
Martian on other types of smart
accessories but wearable tech is not
only about style intel is working on a
SmartWatch that can help with
researching Parkinson's disease the
SmartWatch is able to collect lots of
exact data so for example instead of
just telling the doctor that you had a
tremor the doctor knows the intensity
and exactly how long it lasted intel is
working with the Michael J Fox
foundation so that this tech may help
researchers better understand the
behavior of the disease that your tech
