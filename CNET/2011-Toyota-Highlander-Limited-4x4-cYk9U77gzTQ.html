crossover segment of the car business
but more than that a lesson in how just
fine can be just fine let's drive the
2011 Highlander Limited and check the
tack now if Toyota is anything it's a
conservative company with the possible
exception of the FJ Cruiser these guys
just don't take chances with anything
the Celica the mr2 the Supra long gone
so it's hard to characterize the
Highlander as much of anything in
particular but it was the first
mid-sized crossover and it maintains its
role as a vehicle you won't have to
explain why you bought now inside you're
gonna find a lot of familiar Toyota DNA
this steering wheel those gauges which
are very good-looking by the way and
that head unit this by the way is
top-of-the-line we've loaded this car up
with the full JBL plus navigation option
there's very little about this system
that would wow you on paper but using it
is just absolutely Pleasant I never once
went back at the damn thing you know for
me that's kind of rare this is DVD bass
but notice how smoothly and quickly I
can get around with touchscreen inputs
now the resolutions not great this is
not like you'd find on a higher trim
Toyota or a lexus where you'd have a
much finer dot pitch but that
cost-cutting move doesn't bother me when
the underlying performance is good
entering an address is easy the screen
is properly responsive and I found the
voice command was also very solid now
once you're under guidance you've got
some very interesting map views useful
ones you have full screen or you can go
dual map that's gonna give you a split
you can also go to this compass mode if
you're one of those who never knows what
direction you're pointing and you find
that fascinating it's got your Latin
your long of where you're going and
where you are and when you're underway
you can also say show me my next turn in
detail or show me my turn list like a
list from a MapQuest thing about the
only thing missing here as I mentioned
is hard drive based or flash based this
guy requires an annual DVD upgrade to
keep your data up to date by the way the
discs live in here for audio discs can
play on this guy because we have nap if
we just had an audio system without nav
you'd have a six disc changer your audio
choices are am/fm no HD radio and now
into the disc aux button you see some
more fun stuff here's our aux Jack right
here by the shifter
next to that is our USB connector for a
thumb drive or for an iPod connector
this is not a great place for a USB or
aux Jack you're gonna either break your
thumb drive or break your thumb you can
also get to your sources via these tabs
we do have bluetooth streaming on this
upgraded JBL head unit with or without
navigation
there's our aux and here's what my USB
looks like when I want to go through
artists there it's surprisingly slow to
go through things on this guy I wasn't
crazy about the data read rate across
here so you've got all the basics all
the greatest hits of modern day media
you're missing kind of the oddball ones
internal hard drive HD radio - that
haven't really caught on that well in
terms of sound again it's GVL audio but
it's nothing to fancy when it goes to
DSP it's not surround or anything it's
just an automatic sound level or like
every cars had for the last 15 years and
the JBL sound is eight speakers plus a
sub if you don't go JBL you get a little
more hollow sounding system with six
speakers and that's about it now right
above the big screen is the little
screen and all of these guys are going
to have one of those for example my rear
view camera which shows up on the big
LCD here would be shown on the little
LCD in a limited if I didn't get the
navigation option so you're never left
without this display button here on the
wheel moves you through a few things and
includes your climate control you can
keep that separate and on all the time
which I kind of like interesting choice
no sacrifice in terms of transmission
we've got a v6 the top motor in this guy
but we have a 5-speed automatic if I had
a four-cylinder lower trim Highlander
I'd have a 6-speed automatic that
doesn't seem fair little Sport shifting
gate over here and a sport mode if you
just leave it on that side no paddles
you do have a snow mode on this vehicle
right here all wheel drive on a limited
that's how they come and there's also a
downhill ascent control right there to
crawl down the steep stuff okay up here
in the engine bay we've got a three and
a half liter v6 270 horsepower 248
foot-pounds of torque gets this big boy
up to 16 about 7.2 quite respectable and
the mpg respectable 1722 this is no
econo box and what doesn't help that
number is the fact that all Limited's
are all wheel drives as I mentioned also
5-speed automatic is your only choice on
this
okay so if you're into spotting
generations of Highlanders I mean it's
not quite as big a hobby of spotting
vintage Ferrari but I'm sure there's
some of you who do it
the face is where you go our car tech
video producer Mitch Chang has one of
these guys and he says compared to his
earlier edition this one looks more like
a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger I can't
disagree now let's check out the volume
the packaging in the back here you've
got a third row these kind of thin very
small seats ideal for your kids
Brian tongue and they fold flat really
easily I like that this is interesting
Toyota has just about the most ambitious
emergency kit ever seen here's a hose
clamp this is one of those things that
those bike people wear here's a survival
rap an air gage a flashlight hose repair
tape Oh a little heat resistant glove no
this two of them I'm not sure it's safe
for family television it's a whistle the
compass on the end you think they got
kind of worried about safety after the
last couple of years or so shabby
knockoff Leatherman tool this is a
wonder box I'm gonna buy one of these I
mean the car by the way a number of you
wrote in asking for a quick comparison
of a Highlander Hybrid
this v6 gas engine version well they
stack up like this comparably equipped
the hybrid cost sixty six hundred and
fifty bucks more than the gas engine v6
the hybrids rated in twenty eight City
twenty eight highway 28 average mpg
compare that to the 17 city 22 highway
19 average of the gas engine v6 and that
in spite of the hybrid weighing 300
pounds more assuming you drive 15,000
miles a year and keep paying 325 a
gallon for gas you would earn back the
extra cost of the hybrid Highlander in
12.7 years in other words you wouldn't
you need to drive more like 20,000 miles
a year and expect to be paying five
dollars a gallon for gas to earn back
the price premium in a more realistic
3.9 years but even then you're not
exactly getting free money every time
you go to the pump and we just had the
new 2011 Ford Explorer in right before
the Highlander so it gave me a chance to
compare them while they're both fresh in
my mind
the Highlander has more spirited
throttle response from a same sized v6 a
little less listing in corners a little
less Rocking
back and forth but not a big difference
the Explorer just felt more heavy and
present neither was extremely this or
that in its driving dynamics more a
matter of your text okay I know you guys
like it best when I smell blood in the
water and go nuts on these cars but I
can't lead ooh that with the highlander
it's sort of the official flagship of
the good enough is good enough crowd
when it comes to crossover SUVs it does
a good job
let's price it 37 1 is your base that's
for the limited which is the highest
trim of the gas engine car and it's
all-wheel drive as well lots of niceties
on top of that you have three choices to
go CNET style 650 gets you JBL audio
mostly better sound
26:50 gets you that plus the DVD GPS
navigation system 1750 for rear seat
entertainment that 9 inch single screen
right in the way of your rear view
mirror I'll skip that one thank you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
