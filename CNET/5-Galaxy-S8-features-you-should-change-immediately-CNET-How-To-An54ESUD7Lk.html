in typical Samsung fashion which means
it's setup for how Samsung thinks people
will want to use the phone or to show
off specific features luckily you can
fine tune your new phone to work how you
want it to with just a few tabs here are
five settings you should change on the
Galaxy s8 as soon as possible
despite touting the super sharp qHD
display is a key selling point of the s8
line Samsung shifts the s8 and s8 plus
with the resolution scale back to full
HD plus or 2220 by 1080 pixels you can
change the resolution to qHD by going
through settings display and screen
resolution move the slider to the right
and tap apply just keep in mind that
you'll be sacrificing some noticeable
battery life for a little extra
sharpness on the screen in an attempt to
make app icons more uniform Samsung has
started adding frames to them while some
may appreciate the way it looks other
users would prefer app icons to be left
alone open settings display and icon
frames then select icons only to change
them back base widgets are the widgets
you see on the always-on display after
you double tap on the clock after you
double tap you can then scroll through
each face widget to control music
playback your schedule and upcoming
alarms the last two widgets are turned
off by default but can be turned on by
going to settings lockscreen and
security information and face widgets
and then face widgets a hidden feature
that's sure to catch on fast is the
option to turn the fingerprint sensor
into a trackpad a swipe down on the
sensor reveals a notification shade and
a swipe up will launch Samsung pay when
you're viewing the home screen to enable
either gesture open settings advanced
features than open finger sensor
gestures compared to what Google has
done with its Nexus and pixel phones
along with nearly all competing Android
phone makers Samsung has always reversed
the back end recent apps buttons on its
devices if you've always used a Samsung
device you may have become used to it or
not know the difference and can skip
this tip for those who are switching
from another Android device go to
settings display navigation bar and then
button layout and select the option that
puts the back button on the left
