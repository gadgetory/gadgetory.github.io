universe I'm Ashley together and I'm
Jeff kanata and today is headlines day
and of course because it's today we have
to start the show talking about hollow
portation Microsoft uploaded a video
showing off the hololens demo late last
week describing it on their dev vlog as
quote a new type of 3d capture
technology that allows high quality 3d
models of people to be reconstructed
compressed and transmitted anywhere in
the world in real time unquote could
this be the future of video call apps
like Skype and hangouts I think it might
be this is this is Mike TV is what this
is this is pretty awesome am i coming in
clear I said am i coming in clear that's
my kids ask your parents what willy
wonka's you're oh yeah it is a little
tiny Mike TV and then he shows up in
your lair it's amazing so cool I'm
excited about it I want a holographic I
mean it's it's Star Wars I do any kind
of its holograms that you can talk to
it's really good stuff speaking of
really good stuff yeah Autodesk has a
very interesting 3d printing array that
is going to enable people to print
really big stuff project asure is a
network of 3d printers designed to print
different pieces of the same item at the
same time meaning it could print
something large and complicated in a
much shorter amount of time than
printing out one part at a time the
software for project assure splits up
the plans into little slices and then
gives each slice its own 3d print
station that is part of an array so each
slice gets printed all at the same time
and at the end the result is a fully
completed piece so they talk about
printing you know rotors and all sorts
of really big things even 3d printing a
car but then I got to put it together
well no it's all done I know but it's in
pieces pieces of a thing like really big
pieces of stuff and then it's like much
less than you know just printing these
sort of small things one at a time and
it's really neat because you can they
said you can scale this huge you can
make 50 for 3d printing
box that are all part of the same array
all printing something at the same time
that's pretty amazing I especially like
the fact that you can it will cut the
printing time down because you you're
doing using multiple parentals all at
once yeah they said 80 to 90% efficiency
improvement which which story should we
talk about on Thursday because hollow
portation feels it's really cool but I
feel like there might be actually more
to Futuristics like items and technology
in the 3d printing story all right I
will I will go with your 3d printing
story but I want to be hollow porting
immediately if not sooner
guys get out your hololens is clearly we
all have them don't you 30k for a whole
million dogs if you guys want to talk
about what we talk about on the show
feel free to the hashtag hate TV yeah if
you've got a comment about printing
large things and you want to be involved
in our conversation we'd love to
incorporate what you say into our
discussion on Thursday so they use that
hashtag and be great
tell us what massive thing you would 3d
print with a giant 3d printing array
from autodesk project yeah sure because
I'm really curious that's the way you
guys come up with
I would 3d print a hollow portation
device Oh giant robot okay there's that
I would just make a hundred foot tall
version of Genghis that's literally what
I would do
all right guys let's talk about our
photogra for the day
today's photog refer of the day is Aiden
who took this on his iPhone 5s and it
looks like he use a little panorama mode
yeah it's pretty delightful he's see he
wrote to us and said hi guys I am Aiden
I love your show I took this picture
while skiing in northern Minnesota on my
iPhone 5s and I totally give you
permission to use it in the show and
that was uh this looks like a winter
wonderland even though it is almost
April yeah
looks untouched freshly freshly dropped
snowpack yeah I bet all those people in
the lifts are excited yeah you're like
oh I'm gonna get up there I'm gonna ride
down the hill how often do you use the
pano
effect I like it a lot but it's hard to
look at them on my phone I have to
download them to a computer's yes I it's
very hard to look at on your phone and
then but I always like to use it in
situations like that where it's so clean
like a really nice clean panoramic shot
there's few things better I agree well
done Aidan yeah high fives if you want
to send me your photogra feets tomorrow
at cnet.com yeah that's where you send
it in make sure you tell us what device
you took it on give us permission to use
it on the show tell us a little story
about why you took that particular photo
cuz we love hearing about that stuff
yeah honestly we might start doing
themes we get so much phone tog Rafi I'm
we might have to set up some like themes
for the month we could do a phone talker
for collage of the day yeah it would be
kind of fun where we'd be like okay the
theme of this month is selfies like
chose your best selfie or whatever so
actually email us Pandora's box you
don't know please send us your ideas for
themes for phone tog Rafi because I
actually think we could we could we
gotta up everyone's game because they're
all too good you're saying they're also
good yeah that is it for today's show
we'll be back tomorrow with a brand new
jacket of science fact meetings science
fiction gonna be a little et and Elliot
no kids ask your parents that's right
until then be good human you guys next
time bye</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
