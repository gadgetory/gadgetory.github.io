cnet.com and I'm here with the H MDX Jam
Plus this is the successor to the
original Jam which is one of the most
popular Bluetooth speakers a lot of it
had to do with the way it was packaged
it was packaged to sort of look like a
jar of jam this comes in multiple colors
and the key thing about this speaker is
that it's a little bit bigger and most
importantly you compare it with a second
jam plus speaker and put it into stereo
mode that's right one speaker can be the
left speaker on one speaker can be the
right speaker that feature is pretty new
this is one of the first speakers to
offer it but it is going to become more
prevalent with Bluetooth speakers it is
very easy to set up you simply set the
switch for one of the speakers to left
on the bottom of the device and the
other one to right and you can set them
up they are fifty dollars each so that
turns it into a hundred dollar purchase
but at least you can expand the system
if you want to the jam plus does sound a
little bit better than the original Jam
it is a little bit bigger speaker so
there's a little bit more bass doesn't
sound fantastic it's a little bit thin
and placement of this speaker is
important you'll get a little bit more
bass if you place it in the corner of a
room for instance or against a wall but
it does sound a little bit better than
the original Jam so that's a good thing
in terms of battery life you get about
four hours of battery life that isn't
great for one of these speakers but it's
okay this is as I said a wireless
bluetooth speaker so you get about a
30-foot range from it and it does have
some controls on the front but most
people will use their smartphone or
tablet as the remote there also is an
audio input so you could use this as a
computer speaker or use it with devices
that don't have bluetooth so all in all
this is a nice sequel to the original
Jam does sound a little bit better and
the fact that you can pair it with
another speaker definitely is a nice
feature to be able to go into stereo
mode you will get a bigger sound with
that and get that stereo separation I'm
David Carr noise and that's the H MDX
