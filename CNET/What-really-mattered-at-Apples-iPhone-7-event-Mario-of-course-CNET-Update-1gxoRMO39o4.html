long-awaited iPhone 7 and it showed off
a new waterproof Apple watch with GPS
both of which come out next week but the
most exciting news wasn't even about
Apple's gadgets it was about Mario and a
surprise announcement Apple revealed
that a new Nintendo Mario game is coming
to the iPhone and the popular Pokemon Go
game is going to soon be playable
through the Apple watch more on that in
a minute but first let's break down all
the facts you need to know about Apple's
next iPhone in under three minutes it
comes in two sizes the iPhone 7 and 7
plus so what's new well as you expect
Apple improve the processors and the
battery life and the screen is
water-resistant so it may just survive
an accidental drop in the toilet oops it
comes in a black and a glossy jet black
color the home button it's now sensitive
to the force of your press and you're
going to get more vibration feedback
with different activities the camera
sensors they got a big boost and if you
go for the larger plus-size phone it's
gonna have two lenses on the back that
lets you take 2 X zoom shots and in a
software update coming later this year
owners will be able to take portrait
photos where the subject is in focus and
the background is blurry if you think
two camera lens is on the back is
special let me remind you that Apple is
not the first to do this but back to the
iPhone 7 both models have stereo
speakers and that headphone jack
yep it's gone and there's an adapter
included so you can still listen to
traditional headphones through the
Lightning power port but apple also has
created these new wireless earbuds
called ear pods they have 5 hours of
battery life but there's a battery case
to give you more juice and you can
access Siri with a double tap and talk
through them just like those nerdy
Bluetooth earpieces who used to make fun
of people wearing years ago those buds
come out late October 4 about $160 as
for the phones they will cost the same
as before starting at six hundred and
fifty dollars or payment plan of about
27 dollars a month but good news the
storage is doubled with the entry model
sporting 32 gigs of memory it's about
time pre-orders begin Friday and it
arrives a week later on September 16th
also on Friday you can pre-order the new
Apple watch it's called series 2 at
first
lancet looks the same as the original
watch but the processor is better and it
comes in a ceramic option it's also
waterproof so you can wear it while
swimming and it has GPS these all start
at three hundred and seventy dollars
they arrive with the new iPhone 7 on
September 16th now there wasn't much
surprise with the iPhone and the watch
with all these early leaks and such but
the news that guy gaming geeks going
crazy is that Nintendo is bringing Mario
to the iPhone with his first mobile game
it's called Super Mario run it's a game
you play one-handed and you can compete
against players around the world the
cost of the game was not announced yet
and it is coming out in December those
are the big highlights but if you want
to dive in deeper head to sina.com slash
