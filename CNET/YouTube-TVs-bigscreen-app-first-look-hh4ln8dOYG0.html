of 40 odd channels stream live for 35
bucks a month was restricted to an app
on your phone to watch on an actual TV
you had to connect a Google chromecast
and use your phone for control now you
can use an actual remote to the new
YouTube TV app is coming to numerous TV
devices soon well let's take a look the
new big-screen app is organized much
like the YouTube TV mobile app with
three main sections home live and
library but the menus are darker than
the mobile app and whatever you're
watching continues playing in the
background home has rows like top picks
for you movies shows family and more
like the mobile version each one
responds to your viewing habits serving
up stuff YouTube thinks you're going to
like clicking on a show page reveals
extra options including cast information
and more that aren't available on the
mobile app but where the extra big
screen real estate really shows up is in
the live section it's a real grid style
program guide prettier than a typical
cable box but otherwise very similar you
can record future shows from here and
quickly browse and many channels have
their own curated sections there's no
way to customize the grid yet with
favorite channels for example but
YouTube says that feature could come
soon the library section is where you'll
find all the recorded and on-demand
shows you've elected to watch by
clicking a little plus icon since
YouTube TV's cloud DVR doesn't have any
storage limits the number of available
episodes can quickly get overwhelming
the top section highlights newly aired
episodes making them easier to find
there's also plenty of categories to
browse and my demo is easy to pause play
and fast-forward through recorded and
on-demand shows using the remote and the
big screen interface looked a lot like
YouTube itself there's a cool mini guide
that lets you flip through what's on now
at lightning speed and responses in
general are very quick YouTube TV claims
with the majority of viewing is already
done on TVs via chromecast and its users
watch an average of 4 to 5 hours every
day on their TVs
with the addition of apps for other
platforms including Roku Apple TV
Android TV Xbox one and Smart TVs from
Samsung and LG by the end of 2017 it's
now an even more appealing choice for
people who want a ditch cable TV
