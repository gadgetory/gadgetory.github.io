that UK podcast miss episode 41 44
Friday to 12 to December 2014 we're
stepping into virtual reality as the
first major VR product hits the market
stepping into the past by extracting DNA
from ancient manuscripts and into space
as we check out a Superman show without
Superman I returned my majority our
high-tech moments to do this week is
handy glue hello you came to me first I
did come see I mean I get to say hi
before Luke yeah well nothing back you
botched it so you're honest i'm luke
luke westaway is also a secure you see
if you can do any better than that well
the good thing about you guys Randy
first is it gives me more time you think
about what I'm something funny to say
and instead of something funny this time
I've come up with that searing insights
so you're welcome stay tuned for more of
this kind of more this kind of podcast
gold why don't we kick off with the
knees
hooray for VR virtual reality tech fans
yeah or acronym funds yeah this I mean
there's so many people who are going to
be excited about this you're in yes so
it's Samsung's V our gear VR virtual
reality headset that has finally gone on
sale but I see you already getting very
excited your blankie staring lifeless
faces and those dead shark eyes my face
is not lifeless not you know it's pallid
but it's not actually dead so Andy you
tried the gift so well I have tried it
but the thing to not the reason not to
be excited yet is because it's only
going on sale in the US so far and it's
only being launched through AT&amp;amp;T to
website and some of Samsung's own
retailers i believe so it's only on
quite limited release but you're right
Owens you have to have a samsung galaxy
note 4 as well that is the other problem
with that seriously are one of those oh
yeah so actually addressing this news to
a UK centric podcast is kind of like an
insult to the listeners but it's
interesting to know that it is on sale
and maybe it's going to soon come over
here and so yeah I have been and I have
had to go without other gear VR and
actually had this great demo where I'm
samsung had filmed just 360 degree video
from a camera mounted below a helicopter
flying over a glass here so i was i was
put the headset on and then as I look
around move around I'm seeing the entire
view of this glass here and full HD as
I'm as I'm looking around which really
was actually incredible and genuinely
this was impressive i was i was
seriously I mean it's almost a bit
sickening yes there's a flying right
over da sein is quite unnerving that
perfectly simulated being tied to the
underside of a helicopter yeah which was
which is great we will be right you do
have to have a note for ya I'm a note
for it's about 600 pounds and then the
gear VR itself is launching in the US
for two hundred dollars mmm that's a
hell of a lot of money to spend so this
helicopter landed wouldn't it have
squashed a camera don't ask questions
like that Luke we're going to go into us
a rabbit warren of darkness that's the
end of the simulation the camera lands
you die yeah you get a squad if I envy
are you die in real life so this I mean
this is significant I guess because I
mean there are virtual reality products
out there we have had virtually RT for
years and years but of the current kind
of wave of interest in it this is
significant because they've beaten
Sony's project Morpheus and they've been
oculus as well which was the kind of
company that reservation turist in VR
and they they've really been taking
their time so it's a yes I suppose
Santa's got the resources yeah well
sounds like there's hasn't been bought
by Facebook but after that deal went
through we just heard nothing really i
mean i don't sure if they're even doing
anything with it but yes it's something
the first of all though Samsung's is
definitely it's a weaker product in
terms of what it can do it's just a hat
it's a hat it's a pony yeah it's not
proper virtuality like that doesn't have
it posh hat yeah it doesn't have its own
screen doesn't have its own processing
it's all done through the phone whereas
oculus is a is a complete unit that
would effectively doing complete unit
you complete unit yes well thank you for
ruining the complete package so you came
you came close to actually making this a
meaningful point Ned so no no I wasn't
you think I wasn't even close so this
thing costs a two hundred dollars yet
you're in America yeah and look how
readers think of that ich bin i know'd
it's been I nerd in the comment says so
you're telling me they expect me to pay
two hundred dollars for a glorified
smartphone accessory I wouldn't call it
glorified that's what this is right a
smartphone accessory yeah right so that
is what we're telling you you 99 nurture
bad news I mean he'll come over here
that's that there hopefully working yeah
it's a luckily it's diminishing trend
stuff that we don't get in the UK like
the the Apple watch they've not
mentioned a UK release date for that so
it seems likely at the moment that maybe
we'll have to wait a little bit Andrew I
said Andy has a stick of Brighton Rock
hidden behind is a zoning for it I sure
when who knows the camera is on someone
else are in so that you can just have a
little bit of rock I like Brighton Rock
it's colorful look at all the colors
yeah brilliant it's very colorful apart
from the end that you've sucked all the
color don't put it in your mouth and
it's the fruity Wally not no one goes
but in
is awful that is this is noisy package
this is audio gold I just like to use do
just like to apologize to everyone knows
Rock rising rock is this is a UK podcast
that's Giuliana strip and so they go
yeah stuff that you can't buy is going
in the UK there's also an American Way
okay going on in the news okay well
black phone and now this is the the
smartphone released for ultra security
conscious people that can't be hacked
and it admit you can make secure phone
calls and texts well it has just got its
own app store right opening in January
yeah you know a lot more about this rich
don't you because you wrote about the
black phone I believe I did yes so this
is yeah like you say it's May it's a
kind of collaboration between a company
called geeksphone which makes the
hardware and a service called silent
circle which does this kind of
encryption of secure messages and texts
so you make a focal and in theory it
can't be can't be listened to and so
yeah so this phone it's an
android-powered phone but up until now
we first saw it I think you'd februari
at mobile Congress and you'll be able to
buy it really I think since summer but
um yeah it's android phone but you can't
amazon appstore and obviously if you buy
this secure phone and then you download
apps on tick some of them are going to
be quite quite leaky it's going to be
over but a bit of a point of something
security so I'm and you there's always
controversy that we're hearing about
that but apps taking charge of your
camera and all that kind of yeah the
idea is that that the black phone are
going to kind of vet these apps they're
not going to have games or social
network stuff but they're going to vet
this stuff like Apple dough social I
that work why don't you know why not
well I think it because it's too
frivolous be frivolous for someone who's
security minded exactly yeah you can't
be wasting time on games when you should
get about who's watching you yeah you
don't want to be playing tetris when
they the black helicopters kick down
your door yeah yeah I helicopter
couldn't kick down the door so as I
thanked quickly and used its runners
that's just what the idea is the one of
the one sets of people there selling it
to the main probably sir except people
are saying to is people are going to be
business users so I think the idea is
that they're going to have business
focused apps so that people can this can
become a viable alternative to to say a
blackberry or a samsung phone well mr.
freeze 574 in the comment says why not
just use a blackberry how long have you
got
yeah its mysteries with her this is a
very short podcast so yeah there you go
it's the idea with this app store and
and all the security stuff that these
controlling apps that will sort of
frivolously sell your data or use your
data in certain ways is up is that part
of it they just a variation as various
parts of it it's the if they don't want
it to be leaky and you know apps I use
they don't get malware on there they
don't to be leaky than your personal
details can be you know that can get can
be got access through the apps they
don't have mono social networks which is
a shame it's like so I mean I don't want
a phone that denies me from every onto
social networks well that's true that
your social no you obviously you aren't
taking your privacy and security
seriously I think that this year will
actually or next year 2015 I think will
be a year when security goes mainstream
in terms of my phones and mobile device
I think that sounds so boring it did
crucial and useful but but are we going
to any years time gonna rip this was
here security when mainstream mr. like
review of the year 2050 what it ideas on
them what a year it's been for security
well actually I'm writing a review of
like the year at the moment and looking
back it's in that's not enough it's not
been a whale of a time it's like
remember GCHQ and all supposed to been a
boring year someone asked me just a
couple of days ago so what what android
smartphone you're using a moment because
I review our phone so I tend to have
like all of the best ones and off well
my point is is that I I'm just so not
excited about any of them like was
there's nothing that's really standing
out as making me go that's cool i'm
gonna use this one I'm going to talk to
you about this phone point but we're
talking about teams of the year my theme
is that god I'm really bored I'm
seriously bored it's time to knock this
annoying people get bored yeah yeah tell
mama say knock this Andy on the head and
Thor out another one okay he's become
self-aware another Andy so fresh-faced
excited about phones again well if I
mean that we did see it my work on wrist
so that last year in the year before
there was very incremental stuff wasn't
there that was the works already excited
yeah you knew pause and I mean the black
phone was the kind of exciting new
product in that was as was like Firefox
OS and a bun co bun do you look really
cool and that was actually quite
exciting as its new
different and we're not seen anything of
it and so yeah there's more slightly
different looking android phones please
basically all's yeah so warning off the
point but Sir mobile Congress will be in
February so we're actually that far off
seeing our next year's was it March now
thanks what it is go somewhere birthday
they moved it so now I'm gonna be a
mobile phone trade show on my birthday
you're so think of the party yeah just
think of how many phones so many party
okay got well that's looking ahead to
the future but now let's look back to
the past what a good segue nose gets a
goy as a futuristic device so let's hop
off that segue rich and get on a horse
and cart oh yeah you see where I was
going okay um so let me first tell you
quickly about about what a parchment is
yes what is about a parchment Luke and
rich unpaid audiences is it's not paper
though it's actually made from flattened
calf skin and hides of animal yes you're
wrong to be disgusted because what we
found out you from researchers at
University of York and Trinity College
in Dublin found that they have been able
to find out about British farming
practices by studying the DNA of these
parchments because they are from living
animals have actually been able to use
DNA find out what these animals were fed
at the time and then be able to learn
about farming practices or last clevis
office by seven five seven hundred years
ago a long time ago and this is possible
because obviously animal DNA wouldn't
would have sort of disappeared over the
years or decayed yeah its own but
parchment is looked after very carefully
in libraries and archives yes and also
the preservation process to make the
parchment as well means that it won't
erode as quickly as just a dead coward
well I think then the next thing the
next stage is obvious really i think
that that scientists have to create
theme park with cloned british horrible
animals like we call it term we could
call it arable world oh it's arable
farming our agricultural world don't
know they're both great names husbandry
world husbandry park I Sergey me
look at how normal this cow looks has
not been selectively bred to be like an
enormous big cow
marshmallow so there's actually I didn't
know part was I thought paper parchment
was her was just paper that's been had
tea spilled on its Bert around the edges
anyway cool else's we going on what get
can I was like we've lost Andy little
Annie regardless of it also can also
just point out that in seven hundred
years yeah historians aren't going to
know anything about our farming hmm
conditions from our paper so you know so
who's that who's the jerk now oh yeah
who's histories fool yeah they will be
able to tell quite a lot about farming
practices of I'd sort of the fossilized
barn full of like 10 million chickens
crammed into 2-foot square yeah which is
our current way we do it yeah anyway
more history stuff and the layout of a
medieval city of medieval underground
city this is in Old Sarum in Salsbury
old sour I don't know if I'm planting
sterile ceram Old Sarum oh I don't know
I don't know I've never known both
somewhere in Salisbury ok good old
Salisbury they has been able to reveal
there's not the entire layout of it
underground city using digital mapping
technologies so I was completely
non-invasive so we haven't had to go and
dig up half of Salisbury to be able to
really see underground see what the
stuff looks like so he doesn't actually
look at using technologies yet island
using tech that's good as well cuz it
means that no one's unlocked the curse
so it doesn't mean Tony Robinson's out
of a job but yes yeah yeah it a good run
but is going we can see this back to
about 5,000 years ago so it's good that
we could using all these new tech to
find things isn't it farming we're
looking at old city's underground that's
more little thing to listening to Taylor
Swift yep I'll listen excited so yeah
but that's the next new story well like
smoothly into their be king of taylor
swift rich now I knew what you wanted me
to say yeah bob has fam is now on iOS
and Luke is really tells mom yeah he's
probably him you've probably never heard
of Baba thing which is completely
reasonable status of existence because
it's not nearly as popular i think is
many of the other streaming services but
it's quite interesting because
it's platform agnostic so what that
means is you go to bobfm yeah and you
sort of play a song through their
streaming service and what that's doing
is it's pulling the music from another
platform so you can set up a playlist
and some some of them will be sort of
like pulling from YouTube with a music
video some of them will be pulling from
Spotify so the idea is you can make a
playlist it has some stuff that's not
Spotify some stuff that's not on
soundcloud I think it's primarily
Spotify SoundCloud and YouTube but it's
pretty impressed about you because I
think everything is on youtube because
most artists have an official mmm
channel page so what I believe just rip
it and put on YouTube for fun yeah I
think it will I don't know exactly how
it the it finds it i don't know if it's
all searching from some sort of youtube
provide a database like video yeah yeah
but I used it for a while now is pretty
good though some songs I couldn't find
any ac/dc or something through and then
when I went to youtube but there was
like an ac/dc channel or something along
those lines but but it is a cool idea
and it gets around the problem of taylor
swift not being on spotify so the
beatles if you had the Beatles or 15 it
says it not ACDC it's been around for a
for a short while I'm but yeah now it's
got an iOS app so you pay for it then or
would you if you were no sorry premium
Spotify subscriber with that my body i
link my account or well what I do know
is that if you have an iOS device you
have to have the Spotify app installed
in order for it to work so i think yes
in that case you would need to be a
premium subscriber to use it on your
phone so it's a bit kind of it's not
like seamless or that smooth to be
honest all that good mmm well i mean
it's sort of like it it it's kind of if
I rat if I couldn't find something on
Spotify it might be where I would go
instead of straight to YouTube for
example it seems like the sort of thing
that's going to be around until
everybody sorts their head out about
streaming service isn't it yeah
disappear but for the meantime you know
if you want to tell the Beatles or
whatever then it's just one way of doing
it on your phone okay cool and what's
going on well that is a new Superman TV
show oh yes well before there is no sign
of Superman in it Desiree
okay how that sounds great well you can
tell them I will tell you what are you
probably if those you're watching the
video you'll see Russell Crowe on the on
there on the screen there in Man of
Steel by CNN's dad see anything to do
with it he well he's not well let me
tell you Luke let me know so he in
malice till he plays Sigma's dad and
this new TV show is called Krypton and
it's set on Superman's home planet of
Krypton and it's all about his family
specifically his grandfather okay and so
it's coming about history in the past of
Krypton it so it's a it's so Superman
isn't even in it or kal-el as he was
known as I'm not Carl as you Carl yep
who's friends with the piece of
spider-man cut spoke john-john
spider-man yeah I'm so yeah I mean it's
it's a it's it's I don't know it's kind
of an interesting idea but some i don't
know i read an obstacle that's what a
realistic well Peter de Silva says so
we're planet of aliens with no powers
and no Superman till its last day okay
that would be the incredible climax of
this show if you stick with it for all
eight seasons or whatever in the lines
everybody died yeah in the last episode
everyone will die and this sort of super
human being will with with immense power
yeah will emerge and then it'll be 10
minutes again David Whitehead says
Kryptonian teen angst I'll pass win soul
says don't forget they are also the
network that brought us the rebooted
Battlestar Galactica there is hope as to
cusan sci-fi yeah because when I saw
this I thought like oh so they've DC has
seen the incredibly good response to
Gotham and decided to make that again
but with characters unless well like I
said I mean so the problem the problem
that I have with this is it's it's
produced well written and developed by a
couple people including David Goyer who
is the guy who wrote man of steel and
there is a lot of Krypton stuff in in
Man of Steel so yep he's presumably
recycling that he's wilbert building on
the mythology that he's kind of
developed there which was kind of
interesting but the thing is man of
steel was terrible and David Goyer is
literally the worst I mean he's like the
go-to guy for these geek properties
because he wrote The Dark Knight movie
we worked and don't like movies he'd be
previously worked on blade and all this
kind of thing and he's currently he's
just written as Batman vs Superman but
he's
for I mean Man of Steel absolute
template I don't know if this is going
to be any good but if you had Michael
Shannon in it my BS appointments about
this my big disappointment is that you
wrote in your headline grin of Steel
which I thought was genuinely what it
was called which I thought sounds
brilliant grin of Steel that's to know
this definitely should reboot super
ground that's what they should do get
cydia and forget Gotham bring back super
ground then the super grand banana man
crossover if a 2020 absolutely yeah i
can ask a geeky question yeah good um
are all of the people on Krypton also
Superman's or are they only Superman's
because on earth the gravity is
different and his son is it's another
ground seriously it's the sun's rays yes
so there would be Superman's if they
went to if they went to it in fact I say
not Superman's then a normal man's and
von havoc on Krypton yeah their claims
yet I regular everyday right working
folk like you and me okay I thought
maybe everyone was a Superman so ever so
like it would be sort of like level the
playing field everyone was really strong
though just living together yeah in a
world of the supermen who is the
Superman the one-eyed man actually no he
would be he'd be flattened absolutely
luxury you witless thanks very much and
finally one last story yes GTA 5 we all
know about the controversy around GTA 5
and it's woman beating and wine why is
this particularly flared up again now so
there is little to the wider view yes so
there has been a what's the word looking
for here update no expansion pack no
rerelease people giving signatures to
ban some competition I / thank you
petition was let go this what's to
change in the game that's that's oh so
recently there's a first-person view in
Grand Theft Auto 5 now which allows you
this is the HD green HD remake based
upon and against one yet allows you not
your character you're seeing through the
eyes of your character so you are going
out and theoretically stabbing women in
the face or beating people up or having
sex with prostitutes and then killing
them and it's now all first person
that's not my first person instead of
you seeing a character do it which a lot
people argue that is a bit
big difference because no disconnect
between Yoona character anymore yeah it
is you doing his thing and yeah a
petition was started unchanged at all
which reach over 50,000 signatures and
was successful in getting copies of GTA
5 pulled from Kmart and target in
Australia right in response to that
almost quite comically because they did
it's a bit of a parody and never changed
her petition came up which actually got
more signatures to get the Bible banned
from those supermarkets for the same
reasons they they they quoted the
violence against women and how it's okay
to burn a man should be able to burn his
daughter if she is a whore I'm it their
words not mine and and how it's okay to
stone them to death and stuff so they
argue that the Bible is promoting
similar violence against women I quite
bad it's not arresting interesting point
yeah yeah yeah actually then turned out
of the target then pointed out that they
don't actually sell the Bible so it
should have done a little bit more
research on their own campaign air
before beginning really well this is I
mean Australia is is quite tight on
games aren't they they're cut they're
quite they write down knots or violent
games yeah they do they a little little
more heavy-handed than other countries
with some banning and censorship but
this game is not banned in australia
it's just it's just the shops have
decided not to sell not to tell it yeah
but it could be given their size it
could be that more more shops do yeah
well I mean there's loads of shops that
sort of don't sell things like we were
talking about this earlier it's like W
there's there's some like magazines some
extreme shall we say magazines that like
wh smiths doesn't sell its not going on
oh yeah okay yes I thank you you know
it's not an it's not because those sort
of magazines are necessarily sort of
band or outlawed or anything it's just a
gasm if you know where to look yeah on
the rail railway so yeah
pinned by the massive pressures so it's
going to go completely over the head of
everyone born after nineteen eighty-four
lame i think really exactly what's a
railway ill say um god I just tweaked my
way to Birmingham but yeah yeah so I
personally don't really see this as as
like a extreme sort of active sure like
censorship or anything like that I think
that it was very much a bit of a parody
bit of China just trying to prove a
point with this with this second
petition yeah and you know there's so
many arguments you can have about when
we're not going to try and decide here
whether or not GTA 5 is right or wrong
in what it does and so but there's
obviously the argument that well the
shop should be much more concerned about
making sure that they're not selling to
underage because it's an addled game
it's all rated an 18 rated and is only
it's designed for adults and for adults
to buy but so many game shops they just
do not they are not strict at all about
selling it to a parents need to
understand as well just because
something's a video game doesn't it's
not necessarily for you know they can't
just don't buy a game and then just hand
it straight so that's definitely not for
kids this mark absolutely not gonna
fight a final note on this I think if
you are interested in the topic I would
absolutely suggest you do a Google
search on google.com for our gamespot
colleague Danny O'Dwyer's excellent
video on the subject which which is kind
of a just video discussion piece around
sort of this he says that this this kind
of first-person mode in GTA 5 while he's
a lot like long term gamer a big fan of
the series he did make him feel guilt
right and so like it is there is some
stuffing than that's troubling yes I do
a search for things like that gamespot
found a games then they do all the games
i actually don't like first person view
I think it's too difficult anyway some
point that's that's very nice I'll show
you what what a reader saying about this
actually we're not going to do it to you
just if you want to have an argument
between gamers and people who really
love the Bible then yeah games if you
will literally feel years taking off
your life then go to read the comments
on this story but that's entirely up to
alright cool speaking of comments and
stuff let's see what you guys been
saying this week's feedback
okay first of all we have a bit of
correspondence from X of this parish
Nate Langston thanks on it Andy that's
your brother it is my brother good old
mate like long-term podcast listeners
will remember Nate and he's written to
us yeah he says I know I wasn't on the
podcast last week's this does make any
sense to me but this is so we're having
a little discussion about inflation and
the humble space really crisp and you
later Nate says the story there I
listened intently to your discussion
about the space rated crisp I to mourned
the day these pocketable sacks of
extraterrestrial nutrition crumbled
under a blow delivered by the hands of
economics like the mouth of a warrior
pulverizing the crisp in question
betwixt tongue and palate that is until
the arrival of a messiah known
singularly as tesco so what what
happened was that space where the prices
went up by 5p and death threats were
sent up like this we had to trim this
for length honestly no yeah once he gets
going on the subject of crisps yeah you
listen to about a tenth of this message
it was really impressive one of the
things you can get particularly
passionate about right yeah so you're
the poster the price went up five feet
and then there was a huge outcry against
this and the price winter was taking
about down but there was a temporary and
the place has since crept back up again
of there no longer 10-3 crisps that is
until until until Tesco arrived space
Raiders were once again Nate write
effectively a ten pence purchase the
multi by was the saving grace of the 10p
space Raider that's right which is best
Nate thank you very much night thank you
always good to it was good tip and again
I cannot stress how much we have had to
truncate that for a sort of time time
constraints absolutely it really was the
language really know yet he might now
the gutter yeah cool and well snapping
mike batt says why do birds suddenly
appear when I'm near to you well he's
got the title wrong there for a start
yeah is close to you also Mike bats the
well-known songwriter uh you wrote the
the wombles song you think you think
he'd you know pay more attention to the
unit of the carpenters so thank you for
your comment much thank you Mike check
that you're not covered in grain Jeff
Lucan says I'm still waiting for android
lollipop for my nexus 7 2013 Wi-Fi I'm
in the UK Sam we what a coincident
yeah um yeah Oh Jeff Jeff lovely Jeff
how much longer do I need to wait or am
I just unlucky and so we lollipop is
supposed to be coming to the nexus 7
2013 and 2012 i think ok um so the only
of those we can really give is be
patient and sort of check for updates
because even when it's you'll getting
this direct from google they do sort of
roll it out in stages yeah so bruster's
of updates i think it shouldn't be
shouldn't be too long but then you know
you may also be unlucky we just don't
know it is annoying to have to wait
though yes it is dan pointer says does
small portable amps make any noticeable
difference to mp3 files Andy uh no no if
you are listening to low quality mp3
files if you've got really high quality
ones or lossless files then yes and if
you're playing through like a cheap
phone but you probably aren't putting
lossless files and cheap phone because
they're massive files he probably got a
high res audio player and it really has
its own amp built in so you don't need
it and some can upscale your music is
certain amount but again only if you
starting with a good file to begin with
cool alright and one last question
Phillip Thompson says hi after what has
happened with the release plan for
street fighter 5 do you think that
something should be done about console
exclusive games so anybody should do
something something should be done bad
mystic ville so a bit of background to
this so street fighter 5 isn't coming to
xbox one it's only going to be on ps4
and that is because Capcom insisted on
open cross-platform plates listen this
is the rumor anyway that's obvious and
Microsoft isn't isn't interested in
having games that are compatible it can
be you can cross-platform play on web
games flagged as rumor and that's
something that Microsoft won't budge on
Microsoft has snapped up a similar
exclusive deal with rise of the Tomb
Raider so understandably maybe a lot of
gamers are annoyed that this
much-anticipated title may not be coming
out for things that they've paid
hundreds of pounds for and so back to
Philips question should something be
done about console exclusive ok so I'm
going to be annoyed I can absolutely
understand why you'd be annoyed um I
wouldn't say though that something
particularly should be done because this
isn't sort of i mean not like i've
always got the back of kind of normal
people instead of sort of like big
montrose companies but these sort of
deals do kind of keep the whole
entertainment industry going like you
see this every it's not it's not just
games on consoles like with music we've
already talked about like Taylor Swift
is kind of not on Spotify yeah because
you know that's just sort of something a
record company has decided in movies you
know certain movies only come out and
certain like branches of cinema and you
know stuff like that all those kind of
distribution deals like everything like
everything is kind of like since the
netflix yeah netflix has exclusive well
that's the guy sleeping you can hear is
mega time are cutting us off so oh boy
we're gonna have to decide it there that
is it earning if i'm ever shuts up thank
you for all your questions everybody
marks mark nearly just dropped mega
timer which would have killed us in our
producer Mark II will never see just
heroically threw himself a Collins duty
behind the scene in many ways what's
happening over there is much more
interesting that's what's happening if
only we could turn the cameras around we
do actually have one that sort of
rotates but it doesn't rotate that far I
don't think I knew even if it did
there's another camera in the way so
maybe maybe in future weeks all right
well thank you actually feedback
everybody keep coming yes please keep
contacting us emailing us at our email
addresses on the bottle to look at it
seen it UK podcast at CBS I comm coll
right thank you very muchly thanks thank
you and thank you heroic producer Mark
who you will never see right roses you
