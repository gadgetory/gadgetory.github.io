full of smart phones in his trunk
no this isn't a shady Craigslist deal or
some undercover operation with the
police this is Randy and he works for
route metrics based in Washington state
route metrics send scouts all around the
country to test the coverage of the four
major carriers in addition to measuring
download and upload data speeds it has
calling and texting performance its
reports are also cited by carriers
themselves usually when the results are
favorable of course they swung by Cena
and took us on a ride-along you usually
do testing on the street to where well
our Scouters go all over the country so
we have 125 Metro markets that we test
twice a year when you know you talk to
friends do they ever ask you you know
what's the best Network what network
should I get absolutely all the time we
kind of look at it from a sort of nation
to neighborhood perspective so we're
measuring the country all 50 states but
also we're looking at different aspects
of mobile networks depends on how you
use your phone so consistently would you
recommend a network like if someone said
just flat out I'm in San Francisco what
should I get
well I point them to the our latest
route score report for San Francisco
where Verizon won our overall ranked
nationwide Verizon scored the best and
overall performance in the latest round
of testing it also led a network
reliability speed data and call
performance but don't feel too bad if
you're using the other carriers AT&amp;amp;T
often comes in as a close second in the
same category
and while t-mobile doesn't usually win
on a national or state wide scale route
metrics says it does notably well in
densely populated metro areas as for
Sprint its third in overall performance
and it's making significant headway for
its LTE coverage but given all these
numbers and stats what carriers do the
people at route metrics actually use a
Verizon
I use a TNT so how are these tests
conducted in general a Scout heads to
one of the predetermined locations set
on a GPS and uses phones that work best
with each carrier Randy here is carrying
a galaxy s6 edge for Verizon a galaxy
note5 for AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile and a galaxy
s6 for Sprint to test the networks at
this local grocery Randy leaves one set
running in a van parked outside he then
goes inside with another set all phones
are making calls sending texts and
measuring download and upload rates the
data is then being back to their servers
in Washington where the numbers are
crunched we were curious to see what
networks have the fastest data speeds in
our own building I assume Verizon was
going to be the leader but it only
scored the fastest upload speed for the
fastest download speeds however t-mobile
dominated the competition of course our
office is just one location and tests
were conducted at a single random point
in the day the best network for our
building city or even state isn't going
to be the same for another knowing what
network to choose is difficult
especially when you consider pricing and
family plans and data buckets and
throttling but when it comes to
performance it's nice to know there's a
third party out there that's doing the
dirty work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
