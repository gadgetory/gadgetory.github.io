long drive or a tedious commute than
sitting in a 416 their flagship sedan
hasn't changed much but did it need to
let's drive this 15 LS 460 an L the long
wheelbase and check the tip now let's be
honest the current LS is a little bit
long in the tooth it's been on the stage
for a while this I think is its fifth
model year and the current guys we're
probably going to get one more and then
it gets a heavy refresh so no you're
buying late into the cycle our sample
today is what I think is a smart way to
go it's an L LS 460 L the L means long
wheelbase to me when you get a car of
this size and presence to cheat the rear
seat passengers out of real comfort kind
of makes a mockery of the whole concept
the only other major derivation you
could do on this car is to select all
wheel drive or with rear wheel drive
today
now inside the ELS a lot of things are
familiar we do have a very large 12 inch
widescreen LCD here the downside is how
you control it
unless it's by voice using this thing
the remote touch controller which
unfortunately has not been jettisoned on
the LS some other LexA I are moving away
from this it's like playing an 80s video
game with a worn-out joystick the map
now has 3d and Birds Eye views traffic
is now predictive it may suggest a new
route along the way much like Google
Maps on your phone already does you've
got a pretty comprehensive app suite
here which is in conjunction with the m4
map on your phone I think we've seen
just about all of these before
you've got Pandora Yelp Open Table I
Heart Radio and Bing I don't know that
you're gonna use Facebook places so much
and you do also have slacker over here
as another audio choice okay so a
navigation command you can drive all of
this by pretty good voice command and
that also lets you do a navigation
address as a full phrase that's
essential these days the last thing
that's new in this cabin tech wise is
they now have adopted support for Siri
eyes free with your recent iPhone so
when you hit the voice button you can
get into Apple's voice system not
necessarily the one built into the car
inside one of the most hidden engines in
the business lie eight cylinders and a V
developing 386 horsepower and 367 pounds
of torque
all of which you need given the weight
of this car can run as high as forty
nine hundred pounds if you don't wan
wheelbase all-wheel drive and get the
fancy rear seating package even then
though zero to sixty never straight is
above six seconds delivered through an
8-speed automatic real-world mpg you're
gonna see maybe twenty maybe less on
average everyday use well the first
thing you notice about the LS is it's
still an LS super smooth isolated to be
honest this is not that sort of high
engagement car now I've got this control
knob here with comfort Eco normal and
Sport Sport+ modes even if I get over to
Sport Plus I don't get a big difference
in the powertrain delivering the big
difference is it definitely brings in
the more aggressive part of the adaptive
suspension to tighten up the ride nicely
that's noticeable I don't think anybody
does a micro polish of the wooden part
of the wheel better it always amazes me
how smooth the polished part of the
steering wheel is these are big cars and
they do push 5,000 pounds in some
configurations but it never feels tubby
or lardy I got to hand that to them
beyond this central knob by the way
there are no real serious drive controls
no paddles for example and the shift
ability over here on this stick tells
you that they don't really intend you to
do a lot of that generally I find the
sport of your drive modes on the LS
almost out of place and since it never
matches the more raw aggression of some
of its German competitors I prefer to
enjoy this car in its default position
where it is really satisfying done uh
far away in LS is about $100,000 car
once you add all-wheel drive adaptive
LED headlights all the driver assist
technology Levinson audio and a pricey
ultra luxury package I don't want but is
required by everything else the LS
represents the traditional end of what
made Lexus smooth coddling comfort with
uniquely exacting precision
and a nice complement of technologies
held back by a dated interface and a
frustrating controller so what is the LS
it's basically the s-class or the 7
Series or the a8 for the person who
frankly wants to spend a little less
have a little more residual at the other
end and isn't quite concerned as much
about the status of the badge you've got
tremendous comfort and serene quality
here
the payoff though is that you don't have
quite as much driver involvement as the
German competitors get it with a long
wheelbase although I don't think that
that executive rear seat thing is worth
it not for the price of another car to
get it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
