Chang I'm
Alfred Eng I'm Alexander Abel Gmail is
getting a massive update Google's
ubiquitous email service gets a fresh
coat of paint as well as some new
features like self-destructing emails
and two-factor authentication for some
messages and also use AI to nudge you on
important emails you may have missed I
know it's coming out to G sweet
customers or people who use Gmail for
work but folks can access some of these
features at least some folks can I
wasn't able to but go to the city there
go into the settings menu and locating
the try the new Gmail option and yeah I
don't have it that's it's like every
time there's a new gmail update and they
switch you to the new Gmail the new
calendar the new hangouts like I don't
want it and I go back and this is the
first time that I've read something like
about the new Gmail's like give me this
I want like a yeah some of this stuff is
awesome the self-destruct the email
thing I mean taking a page out of
snapchat a little bit and then really I
mean that's really easy yeah I also
think the the other security feature
where like you can set it so that this
email can't be forwarded or printed yeah
I got that is like incredibly useful too
and I mean you can still take a screen
cap but you're right it definitely makes
it a lot harder for people to move that
email yeah I feel like I'm gonna set all
my emails to self-destruct now great I'm
more excited for the calendar feature
since I'm in meetings constantly at all
times of the day and I think it'll be a
lot easier but how's it going
well because it's already built into
Gmail which I have open all the time but
I don't always have my calendar so I'm
always freaked out that I'm gonna miss a
meeting and I just think that having
that built-in integration is gonna be a
lot easier especially for people like me
who have meetings all the time yeah I
mean this is definitely a time where
people are spending more time on things
like slack or whatsapp to coordinate
things I feel like this is Google's
response to that yeah hopefully we can
spend less time on slack now next up
developers have found a flaw and Alexa
that let lets malicious developers use
the digital system record audio
indefinitely
Alfred you have the story in this or the
details yeah so you know how when you're
Alexa like doesn't hear you properly it
says like hey can you please like repeat
that again or something so they
developed a skill for like widgets
basically it's apps that would keep
listening but it wouldn't say can you
please repeat that so we would keep
listening until you told it to stop they
didn't have a calculator app so it was
like hey what's 7 times 6 and then Alexa
answers 42 and then you think it's done
but it just keeps listening for them
Amazon said they fixed this that
happened around April 10th when they
fixed it and then the news came out
today but the idea was before they had
fixed it any developer could have gone
and like made an app that did that and
so that's the that's a critical thing
like do we know if any developers had
done it from what I understand this has
not been spotted in the wild yet or like
before where Amazon had fixed it like
there weren't any apps that were doing
this and I from what I understand Amazon
did like scan through all these skills
that were available to see if any of
them were taking advantage of this
opening but no it didn't happen but
these researchers did report it to
Amazon when they described it and so the
key is this is this is sort of a
loophole that got closed up yeah and the
argument was was you know you know the
ring is still lit when you like it's
rational but the idea is like how often
do you look at your you know echo like
when you're using it the whole point is
to not have to look at it right alright
lastly the last story in our follow the
money package looks at mobile payments
and cryptocurrency and how you might be
able to help the poor specifically these
technologies might give people who don't
have access to bank accounts access to
financial services and allow them to
move money around without high fees or
even start just simply saving money it's
kind of a good feel good story there no
yeah it's it's it's a really good look
at how you know we're not really driven
by like paper money anymore and or like
banks even for that matter where you can
you can you know store all your cash
will cash I say that with like quote
more exam yeah yeah no and look this is
a we talk a lot about technology and
gadgets and how it you know often times
this is for people who can afford all
these fancy toys it's kind of nice to
have a story or looking at how
technology can help folks who are a
little bit less privileged so as always
check us out on CNN I'm Roger Chang I'm
Alfred Engel thanks for listening
and thanks to everybody for joining us
on the live recording it's weird why
don't we just call this radio now it's a
live podcast just radio what the hell is
a radio you're like that what's the
lapis I like Pandora yeah exactly
so uh thanks everybody go ahead and
submit your questions and comments in
the Chapman to start fishing on through
and I just sorry I laughed at myself I
had to like mute my mic because you said
when it when the echo gets lit I can't
yeah like it's crazy there so if you if
you listen back on that I was like kinda
like trying to figure out a way to
phrase it was like I have to say light
damage
yeah well wait so is the Alexa still
listening does that have anything to do
with when Alexa was randomly cackling no
no that's completely different but it's
weird right that she was that she would
have unprompted responses and and now it
turns out that there was this flaw where
I was still listening well I don't know
if that was related to like any like one
specific skill or not I don't know what
the cause of the Alexa like laughing
like no we didn't really yeah they
patched it but they never really
explained it this looked like this was
something that would specifically W have
to buy developed by a to have a specific
purpose of listening yeah and so they
don't get the recording of you and they
don't get to hook like listen in
real-time of like what you're saying but
they do get a transcript of what you're
saying in real time right some might
argue like better than a recording yeah
yeah actually like written proof yeah
but so developers always like can get
access to to a partial transcript but
they don't get a full transcript so they
don't hear every word that you're saying
but like so for example if I asked in
the calculator app if I had asked like
what's six times seven it would just say
six times seven instead of like what is
six times seven or like six times seven
but then it would go on yeah yeah but
like so it you would have you basically
have like the cliff notes of like a
conversation for legit skills like how
long do they actually record your voice
they're suppose it's supposed to stop
recording like once it fulfills the
request okay yeah like when you use it
like that light goes off once it like
does what you write what
yeah yeah so part of Amazon's fix was
that they limited how long it could do
it at all okay so like it would have to
be like at most like 2 or 3 minutes now
to like listen New York West which like
if you take 2 or 3 minutes to make voice
requests yeah maybe you consider not
having a voice assistant yeah maybe
consider a real assistant we talked to
the voice you aru and so when I'm back
in California I use my echo every
morning what do you do she wakes me up
by listening to podcasts and but I do
nine podcast obviously yeah and actually
I wake up at five so I don't think you
guys are up that early and puppet eight
o'clock yes turn time which is luckier
times our podcast yeah I don't think the
podcast but I do we do come in later in
the day yeah so we replaced the tech
today that starts the morning off so if
you need that for your morning commute
and then in the evening finale you can
get the 3:59 refresher it's on my
commute home on the ferry but I do like
that you know sometimes with those
specific commands you have to phrase
them in a certain way so I do like that
she listens after but keeping what I'm
saying is a little bit freaky to me yeah
I didn't even know that they they kept
transcripts that day yeah I didn't know
that either that was a new discovery
learn something new um do you know how
long they keep the transcripts or how
long may I
it might be a different set of rules for
developers versus like what Amazon guts
because Amazon actually gets the
recordings but yeah you can control that
you can you can delete that on your own
I'm not sure you can delete what
developers get right because if they get
access to the transcripts it's not like
you can tell somebody delete it yeah
listen yeah this er goes back to the
whole Cambridge analytic approach yeah
that's all that's its own issue all
right let's talk about Gmail for a
little bit yeah specifically email
clients does anybody still use Yahoo
when are we gettin that I you know I
whenever I log into something that I
knows well why would you have a burner
that's already that's bad you can
piron's Gmail it's tender it's cinder no
no no it's not I signed up for this
after all this happened I've checked it
it's not compromised actually is it's
only fine it's an account that whenever
I know that there's gonna be spam I have
a personal gmail account I tend not to
sign up for things on that unless it's
like really critical all the kind of
like if I sign up for like but like
promotional orders it's usually but you
can make a burner gmail account yeah
like why would you I don't I don't like
I don't know I just like having the
separation I feel like there's some
weird karma and play that you're
punishing yahoo have all this spam yeah
kinda that kind of is well also I you
know when they the reason I did is
because when Yahoo offered up those new
email domains like I was able to get my
name for Yahoo I can't get my name of
Gmail right but it's a burner though so
why would you need your name on and she
won yeah I think I have logic is all
flawed so tell us about these new yahoo
email features I think I still have like
a burner I just use like my old middle
school email that's on Yahoo but is not
my hobby like I just I think you know
he's got a Netscape on his outlook way
well
wait you don't my my burner name is just
this kid that I didn't like in
elementary oh I sign I sign him up for a
bunch of stuff but I mean I get it like
I get the emails but I'm just like yeah
I don't know it's probably cool now he's
probably like a cool person I know I
really want to know like yeah I have
this person on the show right yes like
not tell Alfred just have a usual reason
why from getting all these like he
probably gets like all these like weird
mail what doesn't get the emails though
cuz it's my account like I just you use
his name and so yes you probably tried
to find an email address with his name
and he couldn't find one I feel like
there's an editorial here like the deep
dark secrets of how you hide your email
and where the Karma plays out and how
you what it all means
yeah subconscious level yeah
this this weird karmic well for the time
that's subconscious it's pretty direct
right yeah I mean like I I stopped like
having a grudge by like middle school
just one of those things where I was
like I already have a nice just let it
go man
so are we excited about these new
features most off what you want your top
three are I'm totally excited I like
that this two-factor authentication for
certain emails if it's like a fairly
critical email I like a great example is
if ever I'm sending stuff to my
accountant right I could be sending me
information critical advice however I
like for like two-factor authentication
to be in place exploding or these self
Denning emails are kind of Awesome I can
see the two factor authentication thing
being like really useful to like
stopping like phishing attacks yes in
the sense that like oh hey you got your
credit card was compromised click on
this to log back in and then like I my
feeling is if it doesn't have two factor
authentication like I would know like
this is a scam although world companies
you think I'm easily savvy enough to use
it they should be yeah absolutely should
be should be but will they that's the
biggest no but then this this new email
cuz it works for a way does it only work
within Gmail or can you can this work
with fin like I think it only works
within Gmail so that's that's the thing
counter emails don't a lot of corporate
accounts though use Gmail no I mean it's
growing it's still a minority of really
corporate Gmail I am a locked in that
exactly myself outlook is still by far
the most widely used I am a big fan of
the feature that doesn't let you like
forward anything though because this
yeah yeah every time I write an email
now I'm always like really mindful of
the idea like whatever you write can be
forwarded to anybody I write emails
knowing that like if this is this could
be broadcast on Twitter tomorrow hmm
right so that paper trail man you know
ya know that's the thing you just have
to be mindful of that yeah the idea that
you can't Ford you can't it's kind of a
great little feature there Alexander I'm
with you I'm really excited about the
calendar integration cuz I live and die
by my Google Calendar it doesn't tell me
to brush my teeth I don't brush my teeth
I have
release saying you guys give me all the
crap today yeah I have to keep that
straight it's so true it's like so many
different meetings so many things to do
I have to block out time when I need to
do like my actual job I use it to
organize all of the studio scheduling
here exactly like it's so important to
me to have like a good seamless calendar
and my personal calendars on iCal and I
love iCal
but you know having like my work on
Google calendar just makes my life so
much easier and having that built-in
integration is just I'm so excited the
one feature that I hope that Gmail never
adds or any email company like feature
platform ever is what Facebook
messengers and like iMessage has done
with like red tags because there are so
many emails that I ignore that if they
if they knew that like I opened it and
like read it and just didn't want to
reply please don't please don't that's
that's not cool I purposely ignore 90%
of my yeah let me ignore people in peace
yeah I mean I've always loved the
filtering yeah Gmail actually yeah I've
never used that but I hear great thank
you ladies it saves me so much grief
because I get notifications anytime
anything's trending on Twitter and I and
I can be a little bit yeah 30,000 yeah I
also like the smart reply I just
realized that that was going to be it is
such a great feature but I would I
really use I use it all the time I only
my my only thing is I wish they could
let us custom them
oh my comes up with like what I usually
say so like when I get requests to post
something and yeah it's not Alexander
respond Google yeah it's like God to be
more authentic with my response I really
like I'd really like one that's just
like I'm not interested in this press
release there are there are like thanks
but I'm not in its called the spam
button
can you yeah you can't program in your
response I they should you should be
able to but I don't think I haven't been
yeah you can create a filter that you
know if you have those certain keywords
yes I've done it for blockchain
and some other thing that I forgot but
yeah who is it Zack Whittaker he always
gets weird blockchain email repressor
requests and he's like worst I think
every tech report we all I haven't I'm
pretty pumped props to you Alexander two
for your Ruth Bader Ginsburg sticker
that's right up front Centuri I just
realized that I'm sorry can I have this
strand I have to represent the strand
and then I have taco cuz tacos are my
favorite right I have seen it because I
love Cena calm because we have I haven't
I haven't gotten the seen that sticker
yet so if anybody wants to we have
autonomy I have a certainty
I look up see they say this once it's on
you can't take it off you don't go back
I mean I think that's okay this is like
my third work compute and then you show
up oh yeah you show up to events and
then it's just like settled wait for the
day somebody walks up is like what's
Canet the next time you show up to an
event where you know your laptop has to
be out you should wear all your CNET
swag you should wear like those I wear
my socks I wear like leisure from
t-mobile and yeah exactly
so I'm a mile away at comic-con brand
that's the next like swag we should have
seen at jumpsuits like just about like
romp in you see on the rocks yeah yo see
no onesies would be kind of cool
actually it's like we don't we don't
even I don't sleep we just work all the
time like for adults or for kids no for
adults okay no no no I mean see that was
easy I mean yeah that would be cute but
I think I seen it onesie for adults I
have a t-mobile onesie it lights up and
everything's just cuz t-mobile loves you
I'll get right on that guys okay we only
have a few minutes left let's try to get
through a few can Google prevent an
exchange or other user from forwarding
that's from dacher
yeah features as you'll be able to
select how nobody's asking right if your
recipient is like not using Gmail though
like they're using X Joe yeah that's
different right that I think this one
works within Gmail yeah I'm I'm like
working on a story about like the
privacy features from it so I can I can
ask a little bit we could definitely
fall out with you though all right
coming in from Josh boy uh sorry I was
just knee-deep in my coffee my college
is on Outlook is there a way to link it
with my Google Calendar yeah I did that
and I did that in college like top three
right yeah standard pop yeah no but
that's calendar though Oh have three
email but can't you sync them yeah yeah
you're able to you're about like so on
your Google Calendar you should be able
to import calendars from like other like
accounts let's take another one from
syringe Roy doesn't Google also hear us
all the time this is obviously pedaling
back into the echo I mean yes this is
definitely actually hearing or like scan
your emails sorry like we're Jamie from
topic to topic which I think he's saying
here is okay Google yeah Google also
hear us all the time Google my activity
log shows the not gonna say the
activation word audio recorded with the
following instruction yeah so that's
this is arguing it was like Siri and
Alexa in the sense that they don't
they're hearing but they're not like
recording or like water they're they're
literally only hearing for like the wake
word which would be that so that's their
argument but like the the other side of
the story is well if they're always
listening for the weak word then
technically aren't they always listening
yeah let's take one from Alex Mitchell I
use Google inbox and it's amazing I
never looked back but why does Google
have to have email like to multiple
email apps I feel like that is just the
Google way yeah there's inboxes Gmail
they they have multiple chat apps that's
just not worst
it's just how it works allo cheetah
Hangouts I mean hello or you know a
Louis oh yeah so it's voice look a lot
of this is Google I think experimenting
with different features I think inbox
came out and focus on a number of
different features I think it was like
prioritization
it was like oh it was being able to like
hit snooze on a message
I think Gmail is still like the
centerpiece email service that Google
has that's but those are the you can
tell it like this is where they're
putting their resources behind mm-hmm
but Dad I mean I agree it's knowing that
Google like likes to experiment with
these one-off projects and like
sometimes they support them sometimes
they don't we got just enough time for
two more questions from old fan Ryan
Williams welcome back sir hey it's been
a while I see Gmail was updated by only
use inbox is there a big change that
should make me go back can we as as
users as editorial recommend the the
switch back for our dear friend Ryan
switch back to old-school Gmail standard
Gmail I use standard Gmail like from
standard from and the new features that
just came out he's saying he's only been
using his onboard inbox app should he
switch back to a formal Gmail oh I don't
know I don't know like how they're gonna
separate the features for like apps got
it yeah that's also like it just just
wait a bit because like right now the
all these new features aren't really
available for all Gmail users yeah this
is right now for professional users and
do we have a date of when this is gonna
roll out publicly no this is public now
certain select Gmail personal account
users are able to try it out but
everyone could get it if I feel burnt
I'm a power user yeah if you're a G
suite user like we are at work see that
is a gmail shop it's really up to the
account administrator to basically turn
on but it's available now it just it's
dependent upon each company whether or
not they want to take advantage of this
yeah I would wait a bit though before
like jumping back to like the Gmail app
if that but like in the sense I don't
want you to like download the Gmail app
again and then like realize that the
features aren't there yet and then like
have to delete it again so I would like
wait a bit yeah and one more for the
road let's pivot right back over to find
digital finance from AIPAC
I wish the mobile payment services would
just be one or two apps that I can use
anywhere like Apple and
hey I really don't want each store to
have their own app why are they doing
this why is Netflix and Hulu and Disney
and Showtime and all of the video
streaming trying to consolidate their
own individual services at the same time
but yeah I'd be the same deal like every
company want control has yeah exactly
they want control over the the the user
over the customer that's why Starbucks
isn't that interested in Apple pay
because they have a successful mobile
app themselves and more importantly they
have access to that data Apple pay is
kind of like this neutral part a same
with Android pay or Google pay and
Samsung pay Android pay I was getting
all confused but the idea that they
serve as neutral parties and so they're
not giving up the data to the retailer's
and so for them it's why they why are
they putting the money into investing in
new terminals that take the stuff if
they're not getting the data whereas
someone like Starbucks as well as a
number of other retailers are really
kind of pushing their own kinds of apps
but the problem is obviously it's super
fragmented and you'll have to have like
15 apps on your phone in order to be
able to pay for everything you want
welcome to the a la carte world yeah
well doesn't it also like what works
with what bank and and sort of the
relationship that these apps would have
with the bank like then Moe you know it
kind of depends on which bank but then
Zell we know who sells the banks right
right so I think that also plays into
you know why they haven't all
consolidated well it's not just that
you're talking about exchange of digital
money online I was just talking about
paying at like the register oh okay
Apple pay I mean which is two different
things I think it's a good illustration
of why it's so fragmented because those
are like two different universes with
different kinds of players Apple is
trying to do that with iMessage right
basically be able to exchange money like
Benbow but it's not available to
everyone because it's not everyone's an
Apple users right yeah I think it's just
sorry let's just the point that it's
super fragmented and there are companies
that have their own vested interest in
keeping things to themselves and that's
why there aren't universal standards out
there and that is just about gonna do it
for us today thanks everybody for
joining us and a special happy birthday

30th birthday yeah awesome and
