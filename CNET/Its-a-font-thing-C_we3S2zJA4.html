long forgotten film and cue on the
street hang on tight it's starting now
what's going on in rich demuro with CNN
TV and you are in the queue the only
tech news show that hasn't sued vonage
for patent infringement let's get you
started with your must click moment
that's a very personal question she
asked me what font i use on my computer
what welcome what's fun to do you use
how fitting for a show that revolves
around letters to talk about fonts the
chatty exchange about aureole Geneva and
Helvetica started when Vanna asked Pat
what font he uses while Pat evades the
tough question Vanna lets us in on a few
of her favorite typefaces and I'd like
to say thank you will a fortune for
forcing conversations about this taboo
topic maybe now parents will talk to
their kids about fonts moving through
the queue you know you your loved one
has one of them those undeveloped rolls
of film rattling around a junk drawer
now promotion by photoworks will develop
and digitize them for free yes before
megapixels SD cards and photo sharing
sites there was good old film you
snapped and hope for a good shot then
repeated the process between 24 and 27
more times before dropping off your
hard-earned pics at a drugstore
photoworks is forgotten film developing
promotion will develop and scan up to
five rolls of film for free through
november 20 seconds time for the beta
you know digital videos everywhere these
days and stand out jobs hopes to make
recruiting a bit more fun and video
filled the site combines various video
job announcement ads mostly from web two
point O companies with a sense of humor
the ads let jobseekers get an inside
look at companies for a better idea of
the culture and what the workplace is
all about right now it looks like
they're mostly compiling ads pre made by
companies but since they're hiring video
ographers it seems they'll eventually
help make Help Wanted videos too if you

watch mark the intern here in Times
Square you know nowadays you don't have
to be tied to your couch in order to

Yorkers if they use cell phones or the
Internet to watch their favorite TV
shows TV TV is bigger it's more reliable
than internet TV what if the internet
goes out and you can't watch a TV on 2d
deadly spores if I miss nothing on the
game I consider watching the highlight
or whatever I don't have time to watch
them I just kind of watch them over the
weekend when I have sometimes do so over
the Internet well I don't often catch
the shows that I'd like to watch so I do
