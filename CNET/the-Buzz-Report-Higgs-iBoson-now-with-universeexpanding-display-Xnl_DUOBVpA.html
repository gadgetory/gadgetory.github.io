to the buzz report the show about the
tech news that everyone is talking about
this week I think you know what everyone
is talking about so first the gadget of
the week and the big news of the week
the gadget of the week is the new iPad
obviously and actually it appears that
the new iPad is the only name it's going
to get which should really embarrass all
of us who actually speculated about what
the product would be named yes Apple
stirred up a media frenzy once again
shocker as to the iPad i'm sure you know
the specs by now but let's recap it has
the super high-resolution Retina display
which is probably its biggest selling
point I mean stunning there's also a
dual-core a5x processor with a quad-core
GPU the new iPad also gets 4g LTE on
verizon and AT&amp;amp;T in the US actually
beating the iphone to the 4g punch it
also gets a 5 megapixel camera on the
back that's very similar to the one on
the iphone 4 so assume it's very good
1080p HD video recording although the
weight goes back up to 1.4 pounds so
don't be thinking you're going to record
like a whole parade or something it's
heavy there's voice dictation built-in
on the keyboard but strangely the ipad
doesn't get the full siri product that's
found on the iPhone I don't know why an
apple says battery life will still be 10
hours and nine hours on 4G which is
insane more insane the fact that the 16
gig model will still cost 499 bucks just
like the old 16 gig model pricing is the
same across the board how I cannot wait
to see the tear down on that sucker
meanwhile the ipad 2 remains on sale but
gets a hundred dollar price cut across
the board it starts at 399 take that
kindle fire apple also introduced a new
version of iphoto for the ipad that
looks very cool and we know because we
saw every single feature of it in the
world's longest demo but i admit it does
look amazing in fact everything was
amazing just ask Apple brand new amazing
application amazing new project
amazingly thin amazing incredible
amazing amazing color and resolution
and it is amazing in other news apple
also announced a new 1080p Apple TV for
ninety nine dollars yeah I know I didn't
really care either alright let's do some
other news real quick before the next
round of I rumors starts up the FBI this
week arrested five alleged Lowell SEC
hackers who they found after they
arrested and turned the original leader
of the Lowell sec group yeah ouch
apparently the hacker known as Sabu was
arrested last summer and had been acting
as an FBI informant for months mainly
because the feds had threatened to take
away his two young sons if he didn't
help them huh nothing lolz about that
but have you guys been watching mob
wives on vh1 because I have and that
would not happen in the mob amazon might
be making its own original content
according to a very brief moment in time
unlinked it amazon exec joe lewis
briefly listed his title as vice
president of original television at
amazon then he changed it real quick to
vice president of production at amazon
studios when fortune asked for more
details if amazon is getting into TV
they would join netflix hulu and youtube
in producing content that can be seen on
demand on connected tvs the web and
mobile devices and possibly replace all
those shows that the big networks won't
allow to be seen on connected TVs the
web and mobile devices and in news
that's far more important than iPads or
TV scientists say they are closing in
fast on the elusive higgs boson particle
so far all researchers have is some
strong hints that the particle is out
there but us physicists presented
research in italy this week that closely
matches some of the findings CERN
scientists have recorded at the Large
Hadron Collider and since more tests are
coming at the LHC at the end of this
year scientists feel confident that a
discovery could come in 2012 and if that
happens we will know massively more
about the fundamental workings of the
universe like maybe even how the
universe was born but really unless we
call it the I boson will anyone care and
that's the buzz report for this week
everyone I'm Mollywood and thank you for
