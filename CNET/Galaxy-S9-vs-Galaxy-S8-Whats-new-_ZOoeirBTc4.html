between the galaxy s 9s and last year's
essays at least on the surface so what's
different about Samsung's two new
flagships the s9 has new colors to
choose from it has slightly slimmer
bezels and a brighter screen and it's
gained a little weight but the biggest
design change is the position of the
fingerprint scanner it's moved from the
side to below the camera on the s9
making it easier to access and aside
from your fingerprint the s8 could use
either your iris or your face as a
method to unlock the s9 however uses
intelligent scan a combination of both
of these biometric authenticators giving
the s9 potentially more reliable and
secure method to unlock than the s8 the
s9 kept the headphone jack intact but
it's amped up the speaker's relative to
the s8 it's the first Galaxy S phone to
buy AKG with Dolby Atmos codec so in
theory it should sound louder and better
than the s8 both the SAS and the s9 s
have a 12 megapixel main shooter with
optical image stabilization but what's
new on the s 9s is the aperture which
can change from F 1 point 5 2 X 2.4
depending on the lighting conditions it
also allows users to control the
aperture from pro mode and it added a
super slo-mo feature of 960 frames per
second the aperture on the s8 is fixed
and it can only do slo-mo of up to two
hundred and sixty frames per second and
this time around the s9 Plus also got a
second telephoto lens similar to that of
the note eight for optical zoom and DSLR
style portraits the only difference
between the s8 and the si+ was size and
the s9 can also take your emoji game to
the next level with a are emojis like
apples and emojis on the iPhone 10 the
s9 uses your face to control the
movement of emojis using the cameras or
you can let your phone render your own
AR avatar by taking a photo of your face
bixby vision also has a few more tricks
up its sleeve on the s9 with things like
real-time translation virtual makeup and
calorie count in food and of course you
have those incremental changes that
you'd expect from one generation to the
next
better processor software updates and
more storage options but ultimately the
biggest reason to upgrade would probably
be for the camera so check out all RS 9
