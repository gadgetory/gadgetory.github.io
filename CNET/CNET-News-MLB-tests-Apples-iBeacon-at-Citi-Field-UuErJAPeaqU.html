peanuts and crackerjacks but now it also
involves your smartphone Major League
Baseball's
at the ballpark app has new features
coming out next year where you could
take your smartphone around in different
parts of the park and get pop-ups based
on beacons this is all part of iOS 7
ibeacon technology these beacons around
the park are sending out Bluetooth
signals so when I walk around I'm gonna
get different messages and when I enter
I just got a welcome to City field
message every stadium has different
points of interest and here at Citi
Field it tells me to walk near the
homerun Apple to learn more about it now
in this example I walk in my ticket was
just scanned and oh I just got a pop-up
for $2 off a hot dog now this is just a
demo because here is rewarding my first
time at Citi Field but if I came on the
10th time I might get something
different and different stadiums will
probably offer different things it's all
up to each stadium here at the Mets
merchandise store there's a beacon in
here as well and I just got a pop up for
20% off Major League Baseball is working
with different stadiums to determine
where these beacons are going to be
located but you can expect to start to
see them in 2014 and yes they are
talking about putting this on Android
phones as well
but for now it's just another way to
enhance your experience at the ballpark
at Citi Field I'm Bridget Carey
