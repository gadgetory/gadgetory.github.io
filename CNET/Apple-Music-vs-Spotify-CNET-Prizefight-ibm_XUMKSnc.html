and hold on to your butts for the best
streaming music service battle it's a
Throwdown showdown between Apple music
and Spotify the judge and the jury for
this fight is you know who regulate a
ding tone
there will be no scoring in this fight
but I'll decide a winner for each round
the final prize fight King of the Ring
will be the competitor with the most
rounds one let's get it on round one is
design and Apple is known for the
cleanest and minimalist design in the
world but that's not the case with Apple
music it's a visual overload with album
art galore different themes of graphics
and a navigation bar that's always there
what almost looks like five different
apps in one with for you new music video
Kinect and my music it's really a mess
now Spotify takes a cleaner approach
with the navigation bar on the side that
makes the overall app look cleaner it's
made home screen features chart-toppers
new releases and a list of icons for
different genres that's straightforward
but I wish there was a faster way to
have my playlists right on the main
screen both apps feature the song bar
that you tap to expand and swipe down
and put it away but it only offers
playing pods control unless you expand
it overall Spotify keeps it simpler and
takes this first round next round as
values
we're breaking up value into two
separate rounds because these services
really have two different offerings
first up paid subscribers now Spotify
and Apple both offer a $10 per month
subscription plan that gives you access
to their entire library online or
offline but when you're talking about a
family plan Apple allows six accounts to
share an Apple music plan for just $15
now that's a steal because each
additional member you add on Spotify
will cost $5 a month so do the math and
six people sharing a Spotify plan will
cost 35 bucks a month compared to six
people on an Apple music plan for $15 a
month after music takes round two
now round three is all about free this
is where Spotify strikes back with an
ad-supported unlimited streaming plan
that works on both your desktop and
mobile devices this is a huge win and
something that Apple can't even come
close to Apple musics free plan gives
you a three month trial of the service
Apple Radio looks to remain free for now
but you won't have access to Apple's
music library at all
Spotify takes around three and it's the
biggest differentiator between these
services round four is music selection
both services have a music library of
roughly 30 million songs and growing but
Apple music has shown it's getting more
exclusive content with big-time names
like Taylor Swift's 1989 and dr. Dre's
the chronic albums only being available
on Apple music and new songs released by
Pharrell Nine Inch Nails and Eminem
again only being available on Apple
music they've already shown that they're
serious about content that you can't get
anywhere else
now Spotify is radio stations including
arrows like the 80s and 90s are nowhere
to be found on Apple radio but exclusive
content is king here and Apple music
takes round four we're tied at two
rounds apiece the final round that
decides it all in species Spotify
streams had a 320 kilobits per second
bitrate Apple streams that are reported
to 56th but they won't officially reveal
that the most people won't be able to
tell the truth through earbuds but it's
still a difference Apple users benefit
from Siri integration that allows you to
call up chart-toppers and more beats one
is the biggest Apple music feature with
its unique 24-hour radio station that I
love but you can listen to it with or
without a subscription the killer
Spotify feature is Spotify running that
detects the tempo you're running at and
matches it with music from a music genre
that you pick and really it's awesome
but the biggest difference to me is that
Spotify allows you to bring in your
current music library through their
desktop app and mix it in with a
subscription service compared to Apple
music that forces their matching feature
now the problem Apple musics matching
can completely destroy your current
library change the album art change the
metadata and replace explicit lyric
versions with clean versions and I stay
away from it completely Spotify takes
round 5 so let's check out the final
results and in another prizefight
slobberknocker
Apple music and Spotify went back and
forth but in the end
Spotify takes this prizefight three
rounds of two and as your prize fight
winner now sometimes the service you end
up picking comes down to the ecosystem
you're in but in this first battle of
many more to come
Spotify is the King of the Ring i'm
brian tong thanks watching and we'll
catch you all next time for another
prize bye well better
yeah
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
