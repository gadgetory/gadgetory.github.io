all-new Pegasus to from promise now this
is the very first thunderbolt to start
device on the market if you notice thing
I'm holding it the big box here with my
one arm that's not because I'm strong
because in the empty box because the
actual device that is so heavy
I do need both arms right here and now
I'm going to skip a jig now this
particular one here is the Pegasus to r8
because have it into a drive on the
inside there's also the r4 and r6 that
have a four or six drive on inside
respectively now this one here is the
upgrade to the previous speakers drive
such as the r6 and I also hear here
there you go we're gonna skip the gym
today night it yesterday now the only
difference between the two is this one
here support funny ball and this one
right here is supported on a ball two on
the back here you're gonna see there are
two thunderbolt ports you already want
to make it work with a computer but the
other one you can use to connect another
turnable device to it you can
daisy-chain about sick devices together
with now performant degradation now at
20 gigabit per second Thunderbolt 2 is
very fast but there's a catch you do
need new computer that's supported and
for that reason I have to use this brand
new MacBook Pro with Retina screen here
to test it instead of the other macbook
pro that's just slightly less new now in
my testing the picketers to here was
actually very fast offering the sustain
will will speed up some 360 megabyte per
second for writing and some 380 megabyte
per second for reading that is actually
very fast and almost double that of the
older pegasus this device here is a
hardware rate system and that means you
can configure is internal drive into all
the retro figuration available for the
amount of drives it has for example the
rit has support read 0 raid 1 raid 10
raid 5 raid 6 and raid 5
oh it includes and software utility for
you to manage and build the
rates it's very easy to do it's also
very easy to replace the drive by
yourself on the front right here and
despite the large size and also very
large spans here on the back it's
actually very quiet now the picketers -
is clearly a desktop store device and it
didn't work very well with the laptop in
a sense that when the laptop go to sleep
mode it would disconnect by itself and
when the machine wakes up it would not
reconnect by itself the only way for you
to reconnect it you have to unplug from
power and plug it back in in an
always-on environment that is not a big
deal but for that you need a micro which
is a lot more expensive than the MacBook
Pro now for most consumer I would say
that this short device is overkill but
if you want speed or edit 4k video in
will Tam this is it you'll be very happy
with it in a sense the proof that money
cannot really buy happiness unless the
few thousand dollars but because a few
thousand don't know it exactly what you
need to get it but this top tier already
here cost some 4600 432 terrible or
$3,600 for 24 terabyte
you can also offer the r6 or the r44 as
low as 1500 for 8 ter by now for more on
this check out my full review calm and
still this is my last video of 2013
merry christmas and happy new everybody
and you can see me like shear and you're
gonna be happy that you do and that's
because i'm don't know and this has been
the first look and the pictures - from
