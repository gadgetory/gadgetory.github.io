pertains to iTunes in the cloud as you
recall iTunes in the cloud is just for
the music that you've purchased from the
iTunes Store
now at 14 billion songs 15 billion
excuse me that's a lot of songs out
there
they've been purchased from iTunes Music
Store but you may have some that you
ripped yourself and there's three ways
you can deal with that one you can sync
your new devices over Wi-Fi or cable
cable and you only have to sync them
once just to get that music on them and
then you can rely on iCloud to take care
of getting all your new purchases off
iTunes onto that device or if it's just
a few songs you love you don't leave
behind you can buy those songs that
you'll miss on iTunes we're gonna offer
a third way which is called iTunes Match
what does iTunes Match well iTunes Match
uses the fact that we've got 18 million
songs now in the iTunes Music Store and
the chances are awfully good that we've
got the songs in our store that you've
ripped and so we wrote software to scan
those CDs the rip scene on iTunes music
and match it up with those songs we have
in the store right and so we can give
that music the same benefits as music
purchase from iTunes and it takes just
minutes not weeks if you have to upload
your whole library into some Locker in
the sky that literally takes weeks this
takes minutes because we're scanning and
matching your library so we don't need
to upload that that large part of your
library and the few songs that remain
well we'll upload them but with 18
million saw
most likely to have what you've got
in addition iTunes Match will upgrade
those songs that match the 256 kilobits
AAC
and iTunes Match cost just $24.99 a year
so if you've got a bunch of music if
you've got a bunch of music that you
didn't buy from iTunes you can get all
the benefits of the cloud service and
more in terms of upgrading your music
for $24.99 a year now if you look and
compare that to some competitors let's
just look at Apple and Amazon and Google
you kind of get surprised because again
the library in the cloud we scan and
match the other guys you got to upload
your whole music library again it's
gonna take weeks music apps on your Mac
and PC well you're stuck with a web app
instead of iTunes upgrade to 256
kilobits per second the other guys
aren't upgrading you at all the annual
price for 5,000 songs we're $24.99
Amazon charges you $50 for the storage
and Google hasn't announced their
pricing yet even at 20,000 songs we
charge one flat price amazon's up to
$200 for the storage and google has an
announcer pricing</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
