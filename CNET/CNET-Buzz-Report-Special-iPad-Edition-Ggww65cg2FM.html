buzz report the show about the tech news
that everyone is talking about this week
it's a bear giving birth on a webcam oh
alright the only news this week was the
apple tablet it happened steve jobs
announced the long-awaited touchscreen
tablet like device this week at a
special event in San Francisco and it
shall be called the ipad I've made
enough jokes so let me just show you
what was trending on Twitter immediately
after the announcement so I think that
about covers that for now and now for
the specs here's what we know about the
ipad in case you don't live here on
earth it's got a 9.7 inch LCD with an
LED backlight it's based on the iphone
OS but some of the apps like itunes the
games and i work are specific to the pad
and are more robust it comes in three
sizes 16 32 and 64 gigabytes and it's
available with only Wi-Fi or with 3g for
an extra hundred thirty dollars the data
plan costs fifteen dollars a month for
250 megabytes or thirty dollars for
unlimited data and it's running on the
AT&amp;amp;T network mmm it's very pretty it has
a cool multi-touch touch screen it has
those new redesigned core apps that look
really good and there's a new ebook
store and a book app that syncs with
your iPhone while you're reading so
that's cool prices range from 499 at the
low end to eight hundred twenty nine
dollars for the top-of-the-line model
with 3g and that's not counting the data
plans so what's missing well there's no
multitasking you can still only run one
app at a time no camera you can't use it
to make skype webcam calls or even video
chat with Grandma come on no flash Steve
Jobs may say it's the best browsing
experience you'll ever have but it's
still not as good as the real internet
which uses a lot of flash for things
like video which I would imagine look
pretty good on the iPad that's it it's
also missing widescreen 16 by 9 video
support and on top of that there's no
hdmi
to your TV and watch video there's no SD
card slot you'll have to pay extra for a
camera kit adapter there's no e ink so
reading books will be hard on your eyes
there is existing technology that can
flip screens from e ink to backlit LCD
and back again but that's not in here
and there's no kickstand to keep it
standing up you'll have to pay extra for
a dock or a case that includes a dock or
an external keyboard that includes a
dock so there's all that and then okay I
know I've been saying this for a while
but let's make it official in song form
I've had absolutely no one who needs
this thing alright well let's see if we
can figure it out here are some of the
neat things it can do it has the new
york times app so the paper looks all
slick and you can move around the
columns and watch video in place good
then there's the bookstore which is also
good it makes the books look all
animated and pretty and it's a nice way
to read the paper and books and it might
be good for students who don't want to
carry around a lot of textbooks
certainly e-textbooks can be cheaper
than regular ones as long as you can
make notes in the margin or annotate or
whatever should be able to do that and
then you do get all those itunes apps
like games and the calendar and the cool
I photo thing and then there's the
painting app which looks pretty fun
Steve Jobs said artists would like that
probably not like starving artists or
art students unless they have rich
parents or trust funds so okay let's
review you've got your New York Times
liberal intellectuals students studying
and disciplines that offer a lot of
electronic textbooks and artists who
have a bunch of extra money so I added
it up and ya know I think I was right
like 800 people are gonna buy the ipad
oh but there's also just rich people who
love new gadgets from Apple that's
probably like another 2,000
but you know what let's get back to the
name I'm gonna let the internet make the
bulk of the jokes for me because well
they are doing a great job but I will
say this I've never had an easier
clogging the tubes thank you mad TV for
predicting this entire debacle way back
in two thousand six why use a maxi pad
when there's the new ipad from apple
ipod what's a new ipad i just hook up my
apple to my and seriously ipad apple put
some women on your focus group next time
and that's the buzz report for this week
everyone i'm molly wood and thank you
for watching absolutely no one see it
