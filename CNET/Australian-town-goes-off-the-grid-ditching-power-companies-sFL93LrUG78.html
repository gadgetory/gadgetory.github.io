would have a need for solar-powered
bikes but here in the town of targum on
the east coast of Australia they want to
remove their dependence on the
electricity grid and go completely
renewable so toggle energy project is a
community energy project that aims to
take the whole town of talcum and the
surrounding village off grid and make
them carbon neutral using renewable
energy only whilst being off-grid was an
important goal being carbon neutral was
probably more important so an important
step in becoming carbon neutral more
importantly than off-grid is becoming as
efficient as possible with how you use
energy so one way we do that is install
energy monitors within their meter box
and that goes to a web portal and people
can then have a look at graphs of their
data and time and use data to match up
when they were using energy for how much
they were using this town we want it to
be off grid and we want people to value
the fact that they've got a say in the
cost of energy I think Australia
generally with our renewable policy is
it's not progressive at all and we've
got so much more capability we've got
the technical expertise we've got the
land we've got the availability we just
need the foresight and the and the
leadership as soon as I grow you know it
was just like wow how come I haven't
been here before it's just a great vibe
when I came in as I went up to one of
the little cafes up the road and it's
just this little hidden world out here
that I wasn't aware of so I bought the
old butter factory down the road and it
was this big cool building that didn't
have much use for it and I thought what
what could I do with this building here
in relationship to educating the general
public about sustainability and
yeah renewable energy in general my
name's paladin Nova and I work in the
Bakehouse I like a lot of people here
I've got you know a few different things
I don't with I know small towns at the
end of the grid it sometimes costs more
to send power that far down the grid we
often get power cuts so I think as an
introductory kind of pilot exercise it's
great to look at this with small towns
like us the cafe that I'm involved with
we have a system that covers 30 to 40
percent of our use and we're also
looking to do it with some of the other
businesses in town our first solar
system that was put in takes the energy
direct and puts it into a system that
we're using during the day so where is
all the solar power going to come from
well right now the people of targum have
solar panels on their roofs but the goal
is to eventually take this paddock and
put in a giant covered walkway covered
with enough solar panels to power the
entire town and beyond now in our case
that's enough to provide the majority of
power that we use in the township itself
wouldn't give us the ability to retail
or have any over and above power but
would certainly be enough to offset most
of our usage we have identified another
area just out of town we would put on
more like a commercial solar array and
that's probably what we'd be using for
our retail or commercial side coal is
necessarily obviously you know we're
wedded to coal for the time being but we
need to be phasing out of it I'm hoping
that algum will be a pilot an example
and a good one that will show others
that this is what can be done</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
