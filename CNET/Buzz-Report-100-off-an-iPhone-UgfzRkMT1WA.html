Wood who finally realized being spit up
on it's still better than a day back at
the office welcome to the buzz report
first our gadget of the week it's the
iphone not wait wait the refurbished
iphone apple just added these
hand-me-down versions of the most
desirable thing ever to the apple store
for a 100 dollar discount each that's
about twenty percent off the 4 gigabyte
model not bad but the damn things will
have been on the market a couple of
months how many retrans can they have
already well let's see there was buzz a
couple weeks back that Apple was doing a
lot of warranty exchanges due to low
caller volume and lousy battery life and
there will be some masochist who bought
their iPhone and then brought it back
deciding they just didn't deserve the
coolest gadget ever invented but I bet
the iphone refurb warehouse smells like
beer never before have so many folks
made so many friends at so many bars
just because they bought a new cell
phone and there's always that guy who
knocks over the pitcher and then your
new iphone suddenly stopped charging
right right thought so now the news what
do you get when you combine the power of
Microsoft with the massive hypnotist a
bunch of crap that would be the urge
music service those two companies ran
jointly non-starter so the rumor is MTV
is now going to try hooking up with real
networks to make another run at building
an iTunes killer this time based on
rhapsody i'm not sure which of these two
should be more nervous about the other
real by teaming up with perhaps the
hippest major media company that doesn't
have an important internet play or MTV
if it gets in bed with rhapsody which is
way past the go big or go home point in
comparison to itunes maybe MTV should
just purge itself of the whole idea and
stick with what it knows best TV for by
and about morons oh it may be the 21st
century but a pair
deals done in smoky back rooms over
rubber banded wads of filthy lucre still
happen I mean what else could explain
paramount and DreamWorks announcing they
will embrace HD DVD / blu-ray
exclusively huh I'd have an easier time
understanding a bet on Michael Vick to
be super bowl MVP in this season but
paramount and DreamWorks are now
committed to the distant runner-up in
the high-def disc sales race I guess in
a way they're doing their part to end
consumer angst over which format to buy
because with this much confusion now
it's easier than ever to just get both
and finally frozen smoke sounds like a
hallucinogenic you'd buy from the back
door of the musical ice cream truck
doesn't it but it's not rather
scientists are proclaiming this a
material that will change the world and
no these aren't the same scientist who
did the Segway this is a silica gel
which has the water removed and co2
added back in and result is it looks
like frozen smoke but it's able to
withstand the force of a bomb blast or
heat as high as 1,300 degrees Celsius
finally a material they can make sony
laptop batteries out of i'm brian cooley
thanks for watching the buzz report
