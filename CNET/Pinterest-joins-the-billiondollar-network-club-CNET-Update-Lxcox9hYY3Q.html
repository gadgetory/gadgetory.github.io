protecting your privacy and paying your
taxes and Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update it's time to welcome
Pinterest to the billion-dollar network
club last month we saw Instagram you
bought up four billion dollars by
facebook now Pinterest another social
photo sharing network has been valued at
1.5 billion dollars the valuation came
after a Japanese ecommerce site invested
fifty million dollars into pinterest and
what's so unsettling about this is that
Pinterest makes no money it sells no ads
there's no revenue whatsoever but then
again that was the same case with
Instagram you can put your money on one
thing though investors will start to
integrate ecommerce tools into the site
making it easy for users to buy items
posted if you haven't used Pinterest
it's a place to share interesting photos
of things you've discovered it could be
your own photo or bookmark something you
found online and it's presented so
beautifully but you could just lose
yourself in the site think of it as
window shopping at the mall or flipping
through an endless magazine of neat
things people put their finds into
categories some of the more popular uses
are for sharing fashion design tips or
recipes but you can pin anything
facebook co-founder eduardo saverin said
he has to pay hundreds of millions of
dollars in taxes on everything he's
earned while he was a US citizen Saverin
who has resided for the past few years
in singapore caused a big stir by
dropping his citizenship just a few days
before he would rake in billions from
facebook going public and here not a US
citizen no need to pay us taxes from
what you earn it even angered some
senators who proposed a law to punish
sovereign and anyone who drops his and
shipped to duck out of paying taxes
Severin said he didn't drop his
citizenship to avoid paying taxes and he
will continue to pay any taxes he owes
to the US government you now have the
option to block Twitter from collecting
data on your usage habits twitter is
working with Firefox's Do Not Track
feature so our web giants like Yahoo
Google and AOL but as for facebook yeah
you can't turn that tracking feature off
tracking you is their bread and butter
and today we're keeping an eye on
you apps that have some fresh upgrades
Flipboard a news reader app on the iPad
just added SoundCloud support for
listening to news reports evernote a
note-taking management tool has a snazzy
new look on android you can organize
photos audio and text notes much easier
now and the weather channel just
beautified its iPhone app and made it
more social so you can instantly share
your photos of the weather wherever you
are that's your tech news update for
