let's begin its episode 2 so date of the
359 podcast I and B G and then yeah
Roger and Alfred here - Wow
1a and G happy Tuesday everyone say
happy Monday but it's not Monday
it's amazing Monday and that's a very
short week for us in the 359 we're gonna
have an all AI themed episode today I
know the Galaxy Note 8 reviews just came
out but they literally came out as the
podcast was getting set up so I haven't
had a chance to really break it all down
we can still talk about it no we won't
oh yes if you have questions about it go
for it we'll try to will try to ad-lib a
little because we haven't read the
review yet but we will talk about
tomorrow but on - today we're gonna be
talking about a couple of AI theme
stories of talking alexa dominating the
ether trade show in Berlin we'll never
talk about Alfred's road trip story out
Vegas and how a I was able to is able to
protect the city of Vegas from the
cybersecurity threats and then lastly
Elon Musk stirring up all those AI fear
back again with the AI will kill us all
there you go World War 3 coming it also
he's a lot smarter than I am so maybe
and richer probably right smarter and
richer so yeah hi so as always if you
have any questions in the comment
section Brian will pick up the best
we'll get to them three minutes and 59
seconds from 3 - welcome to the 359 I'm
Roger Chang I'm Alfred Aang Alexa was
everywhere the ephah trade showed Berlin
last week Cina estimates that there were
roughly 30 products tied to Amazon's
digital system this comes at a time when
Google is trying to make headway with
its own assistant and Apple is prepping
its Siri powered home pod Alfred sure is
your hope dominated by election I have
three in my house now right and I echo
products I have three echo dots in my
house you're a part of it's not that big
it's not but I bought one and then I got
two for free because of Amazon's mistake
shipping the coupon thing so I got two
of those places how about your hubby's
reported it's I don't know it's like
it's like the size of a bus I guess I
got a new apartment it's like way larger
than my own on a bus yeah just take
analogy this is like railroad style car
so what do you what do you connect to
the literally only speakers because I
don't have any bluetooth I don't have
any Internet of Things objects but
that's more of like I'm really paranoid
about security I've actually started
setting up like I've connected to an AC
I just connected to two lights my
bedroom lights yesterday so it's kind of
all those things were like when I did
really when I didn't have it really care
about it was I set it up like I was
bringing home my laundry yesterday and I
was like putting it down and it was
really dark and I was like I really wish
I had uh write more Paul Breitner yeah
I've also seen that it's connected to
smart vacuums which like I feel like
that's something I would actually use
home but again like all that stuff but
that that basically that's the future
all right so next up want to talk about
CNET road trip you wrote the latest
installment which is uh well you did it
while you're at DEFCON blackhat Vegas
but tell me more about this this AI
cyber security so cyber security you
know it's obviously a large role at
blackhat at DEFCON one of the people
that I spoke to was the CTO of Las Vegas
like the city itself yeah Mike Sherwood
and he talks about how how they handle
security for the city and it's all AI
based because when I asked him the size
of his team it said it was about three
people and he can afford to have only
three people on his team because he has
dark trays in a security company that's
one of the first companies that's really
like autonomous where that totally
sounds ominous tres yes right but it
works completely on its own so while I
was talking to him his whole team was
that blackhat like learning a
chilled-out yeah I'm like so who's
watching like security for your city is
like oh doctor he says like this machine
is able to basically search through its
entire network and if something goes
haywire it automatically stops it on its
own so it doesn't really need a person
there that's an interesting idea because
you know the fear is hackers can figure
out ways or
yeah so there's also a fear that there's
a rule that AI plays in security in like
the other side of it and cybercrime
right where they're gonna use it to
create malware to basically attack
because basically what a yeah pretty
much
and I spoke with Hyrum Anderson who is
the founder or one of the you know
directors of endgame another security
company and he created an a.1 a I'm al
where that automatically makes like
variations to it until it can defeat
like the interest protection and that's
why like I think humans are always gonna
be necessary for this because like the
creativity level of it you know changing
things like an AI it's not gonna
recognize it but the person like will
well it's a good segue to the next story
which is Elon Musk
once again sparking fears of AI being
the catalyst for World War 3 in a tweet
of course in a tweet it's just a console
because you're talking about AI like
what you penny one AI versus another
you've got all these countries
developing their own AI security systems
like how far we eventually it's going to
get to that level where it's AI versus
AI because we're not gonna be able to be
like do like a million samples of
malware or like protections in a second
like AI can write and it just gets to an
issue of like scaling and I think that's
what Elon Musk II was warning about
where it's basically there's gonna be so
much out there and it's just gonna be AI
versus AI and you know that there's a
lot of concerns when it comes to that
all right
plenty of AI top and we'll run out of
time for those stories of more chicks on
scene it
I brought to Chang I'm out for hang
thanks for the same so Alfred do you
make your echo dots compete for your
love I actually named them all different
names because what are their names
it's computer echo and Alexa because I
had all echo as you all sort of yeah you
know I'm like no no too many people it's
true if only they could all sync up
together
which I mean they kinda announced the
multi room thing yeah but they don't
work with Bluetooth speakers like they
have to be plugged into a Lego speaker
which makes no sense
it's dumb
I'm sure they'll fix it and if if
somehow I get a fourth one it might end
up in my restroom I don't I don't know
what do you I don't know what to do with
all do you want to Alexa to be in your
restroom that's weird man like to find
out like the weather and the Newt is
basically a radio for me at this is
literally I only play music on it yeah I
play kids music and I control my lights
of my my air conditioner what do you do
with your Alexa or any sort of home
assistant yeah let's not let's not I
will say about the ephah stuff Google
home but no thief of stuff I can't
believe that it's on a piano yeah I
don't know why why not I mean a bigger
question it's it's not even that's smart
as like an assistant I asked it how to
thaw like seaweed salad yesterday I
didn't note that I'm sure Google home
would have known that we do ask it
whether or not it could be human no I
saw I saw been doing that though
check the did that well you got much
more I'm not very conversational with my
echo and I know that was the point of
Ben's article about you know basically
you just say beds articles wrong no no
I'm saying like a bizarre that he's not
here look all I'm saying the point of
his article was like you know Amazon's
effort to make Alexa more human yes and
I'm like okay I don't do that but I'm
sure obviously I do sometimes I say
thank you I say goodnight to it as a
joke to look like a loser and my joke is
it really like I'll tell my girlfriend
goodnight and then I'll be like Alexa
goodnight and then yeah then I look like
a loser so okay mission accomplished
alright so it's time to take questions
of comments in the chat go ahead and
send them on in we're gonna shout out
Irene Jeffrey Staci Abdul and our good
buddy Matthew Dasher who today by saying
Alfred has issues haha
what issues could you specify what
issues in particulars of the the massive
why I chose is it the fact that he says
goodnight to pretend to be a loser what
what are the issues man you know real
issues of CNET Maggie
the latest edition which has come out
which will be in newsstands when is it
coming out I don't know
sometime a quarterly it's really hard so
in the chat the - uses Alexa to control
lights play music and sent morning alarm
Josh uses as Google home to play music
control lights and Google things yeah
sounds about what you're gonna do goes
for lights mostly yeah I'm not gonna
like I'm not gonna Google things with
maybe that's something I could have done
and then I was like oh nope you can't
can't do that so it doesn't really help
you out I'm surprised it may be like you
have to download a skill or something
yeah but that defeats the whole purpose
of like having a voice assistant I don't
know yeah I mean there's amount of like
if you really wanted to work well there
is a bit of I will say this so Amazon
was really smart and making the the echo
dot like as cheap as it was yeah because
and also making Alexa like open-source
where it could be on like literally
everything yeah I really wish Google had
done the same thing I'm pretty sure
they're gonna come out with their
version there are a number of products
that Aoife that have Google system yeah
but do they have like a $30 or like
Google home yet not yet yeah that's
gonna that's like probably gonna happen
yeah and I wish that that had come out
sooner because now have three echo dots
and I'm like I'm like deeply embedded
yeah yeah there's no way you're buying
home now right you're just like I'm in
the echo ecosystem so you know if Google
wants to have some kind of accidental
glitch where they give them out for free
I'm here alright right that was the
Amazon that was the only reason why I
have three so you caught on in time for
that glitch
yeah that's great all right my wife was
pissed that I didn't catch on fast
enough like you wore for a text say how
did you not know about this I was at a
meeting it's it's good nature to not
exploit that though yeah say wait what
never mind I would have exploded great
mr. lizard shout-out great mr. looser
than chat do you think Google would
announce any new info on the home this
fall oh that's a good question I would
say yeah that's that's a really high
chance sure
but yeah yeah either some sort of update
these capabilities or actual do hardware
updates fingers crossed on the cheaper
home yeah please like a cheaper version
yes yeah give me like a like a budget
$30 like like a chromecast pricing yeah
Google's done before right yeah he just
mentioned the chromecast cuz right now
like the my echo doesn't play nice with
like my chromecast so I can't play stuff
on my TV and I'm like I'm not gonna get
like a fire stick for this yeah so you
know either play nice with each other or
let me get a cheaper version of Google
stuff because I like to use their
ecosystem way more yeah I myself into
and kind of stuck in the echo ecosystem
but I do have a fire stick which I like
yeah so it plays nice with that though
right like you can play stuff on your TV
from that that's brand-new though that
the you an older fire stick right I have
an older fire stand so it doesn't really
make a difference not much not much and
then I wonder like once there's newer
versions of the home and once there's
you know you know like Google assistant
on like Sony speaker or whatever yeah do
you think that it's gonna suffer from
the same fragmentation issue that
Android does other people tweak it yeah
or like it's not gonna get updates at
the same time as like everything else is
that's I don't know because there are so
many different hoops that you could jump
to you for a phone update yeah there's
the carrier whether it's the handset
maker it might be a little bit different
with Google's with the digital systems
and just like speakers because yeah
they're not it's not complicated right
it's not as complicated running through
an operating system yeah
Alfred I'd like to hear more about your
trip to Vegas I know that we always have
to kind of breeze over stuff yeah like
that in a forum in a podcast but hey
that's the glory of the show or minutes
baby no yeah I was really cool to see
like the way that all the things that
they were protecting there's like
thousands of devices in this little
neighborhood that they have called like
the innovation district which I thought
was great because it wasn't anything
like the smart city right no yeah it was
like really rundown it was like there
was like I passed by like three Bail
Bonds shops and to be fair like yeah
there are huge parts of Vegas that when
you're outside of this trip that don't
look yes but they're China like Rihanna
like like rejuvenate the neighborhood I
guess with like smart
like light bulbs and smart like
stoplight or things like that
yeah and it's and it's all it's it's all
like really small sensors which like
when you have sensors like that
Security's not really like the biggest
thing on it so they have to protect all
of this and they only have like three
people and the AI definitely helps out a
lot with that but as I point out in my
story that you know there's always gonna
be like a need for somebody there to
watch over it only because there's other
AI attack you you spoke to Garry
Kasparov yes former Chester oh yeah a
show Garry Kasparov if you're not
familiar with him he is the former world
chess champion that lost a deep-blue
IBM's deep blue computer and he he's now
become kind of like the face of you know
humans being outsmarted by machines
because at the time everyone thought
like you know he's like these computers
are pretty good but they're not good
enough to outsmart like humans until
1997 when he lost that chess match and
he brings up like a lot of really good
points where basically you know even
deep blue was like kind of dumb like I
needed like people to like kind of
program it and it's like if it plays on
its own like enough times like the best
you can get is a draw with it but like
it's not you're not gonna beat it you're
not gonna beat deep blue but there's
there's always ways like you can develop
an AI to make it like get to a draw
right yeah but yeah I mean AI is it's
like the way that it's scaling up is
like so insane to the point where you
can launch so many attacks with AI and
like it can block so many but then it
gets to a point where eventually it'll
get figured out right and I think that
it's important to have like a person
there to like like stop that like extra
step you know let's jump back into home
assistance real quick Richard says I'm
totally waiting for the home pod and
then razz mojo expands do you think
Apple will win against the echo No wow
that was fast
I would obviously not out the gate
nothing's gonna be it's definitely gonna
be tough there's a battle it's gonna
sell well don't get me wrong there are
enough Apple fanboys out there that at
least early reaction to it will be
strong but it's that's always miss thing
right like there are always people who
gonna line up for an Apple product I
think a year two years three years down
the line
see how well that ecosystem works and
how open Apple is I mean that's kind of
the issue that's the thing yeah they're
not open at all and it's like super
expensive you're not gonna see this in
every home like the way you see an echo
in every home right well I mean I
imagine old dole eventually come out
with a cheaper version but even even
that version is gonna be like yeah
budget Oh pod hard to imagine something
that's so late to the game usurping the
guys that are really kind of like
crowning I think now that is yes sir
with AI is that AI takes a lot of data
takes a lot of human input to get better
that's what Amazon's been working on
with seating the market with cheap
echoes that they did a really good job
with it
Apple has not only play catch-up but
they've got to get a large enough base
of customers to submit data they're
probably catch up on a field that they
cracked into first to like they like but
I think no one uses series that's my
point yeah so if nobody uses Syria who's
gonna spend all this money on a really
expensive speaker which should be fair
that speakers like gonna be really nice
I'm sure and then for Siri on it doesn't
mean like well Syria is supposed to be a
lot better this next story yeah I mean
I'm just saying like for that value you
could just buy like a really nice
speaker and then just like connect an
echo to it would yeah people do that is
sort of the counter-argument against yes
Sony's already come out with like their
speakers which is like I either better
better or on par with the the home pod
speakers and it's gonna be like a lot
you could always get much higher end
speakers and connect those to it yeah so
cheap yeah that's the thing like Amazon
has like the advantage of scale and like
yep I mean there's so many pleasing
advantage that and I don't want discount
Apple offhand because the advantage
battle has is the huge base of users if
you put in features and tricks and
capabilities that are compelling and
that only work with your iPhone that
helps a lot right like if you can't if
there if it does something that's useful
and I don't know what that is
at this point cuz no one people smarter
than me Jefe this out but they could
figure out capabilities that are enabled
by your iPhone that you can only use
with your iPhone that's what I mean
that's it a lot of people are Apple
hardware loyalists not necessarily Apple
software
amazon is a household name recognized by
people who are in and out of tech and
varying degrees and to throw down 50
bucks to get this little thing that
helps them do this that in the other or
is kind of a fun toy i think it's an
easier mark I don't think there's that
many useful features yet for like a home
assistant like yes we were just talking
really only saying that ik again that's
the x-factor what to apple's credit
they're really good at get convincing
you that this new capability or feature
is something you want your life right
they're gonna sell like wireless
charging is rumored to come out with
next iPhone mm-hmm they represent it
like they freakin invented wireless
charging and people also know people are
gonna go crazy for it because most folks
have never even heard of it cuz they'd
be using iPhones all this time they
don't know what wireless charging is and
so Apple has real knack for presenting
different features different
capabilities in a way that other people
sort of gravitate towards so I don't
know that that's why I wouldn't
completely discount them from the home
speaker market let's talk about
customization and exclusives I want to
reach out and Christopher Finn he says I
want Google assistant to replace Siri on
my phone is their way to do that after a
jailbreak now none of us here are expert
jailbreakers but I'm sure if you fish
out into the chat right now you'll find
somebody while we're at it the great mr.
lizard I'm hoping Google will expand on
some partnerships with TV manufacturers
the building functionality of the Vizio
displays with Google home is pretty neat
now that's a smart idea start putting
the assistant in regular everyday
commodity yeah cast in the TV remote
control beat the speaker input like
you'd speak as opposed to stick you
already have the Alexa built in to the
remote control but it's restricted to
the functionality of television right if
that could be expanded upon I mean is
that gonna turn into a world where we
walk around with our TV remote in her
pocket though my only like thing I feel
like that would be like that was being
so did you ever have to like fight your
siblings over like what channel a while
yes so imagine that with voice control
in the house oh my god how five tell
Evan yeah that'd be fun
but the good thing though about the
Google assistant that the Amazon in this
world anymore Amazon doesn't have yet is
that it has the ability to pick up like
different voices yes like it can tell
the difference between my voice and
Rogers voice if like we're talking a
Google assistant yeah Amazon doesn't
have that yet so I'm wondering you know
if that were on the TV I think you could
get banned like certain white pitches or
something we're like if you're a child
you're not gonna be like the TV kind of
thing that's pretty good I like it I
think that's a good idea
alright before we call it a day let's
revisit Elon do we think he's being a
little too paranoid no I mean I think
the scaling of a legitimate non
rhetorical question I know I think it's
uh I mean you can admit you could easily
laugh it off on the surface but if you
think of theory like well there's I mean
it's one possible logical conclusion I
mean the joke we keep making is have you
seen terminator I mean he made his
statements about AI starting World War
three or in response to a statement from
Vladimir Putin when he spoke with
students saying that the country that
develops that masters AI first will rule
the world right so this isn't this is it
like you know how much it's coming out
like saying World War three yeah yeah
which to be fair food is a pretty scary
guy yeah but like think about like how
much like AI can do for for like an
entire country if it were like in a
perfect state or like in a perfect world
you know like manufacturing the economy
yeah I'm like I'm not talking about like
Alexa like turning the lights on in your
home like whatever that's you're talking
like building cars by itself
yeah cars driving themselves it's like
different things that like can be
applied with AI and you know for him to
say that you know that AI liked can lead
to a lot of crazy things like and
including like war if you think about
like tanks that can operate themselves
with drones that know how to write
themselves and like attack targets and
things like that do not see the list
Fast &amp;amp; Furious movie with all the
self-driving cars because I could taste
yeah it was entertaining until you think
about it that's if you should rocket
grab a torpedo and throw it well to be
fair he like kicked it a little and it
made sense I were being fair now too
fast appearance of course and now we're
dancing
yeah but not like that that whole world
of like all those AI although that was
kind of possible all those cars being
controlled by a hacker to basically
cause mayhem I mean that's
it seems far-fetched in that movie but
we're not that far away from that
potential reality I mean in a less
Hollywood cinema accent yes very boring
I saw car hacking when I was at DEFCON
er it's not Charlize Theron on a
touchscreen controlling where the cars
are going true Charlize Theron does make
everything seem cooler yeah one more
question from the chat this one's for
Alfred while you were at Vegas Tom Hanks
is really Tom house it's it's the big
Hank's Tom Hanks is there any way to
detect if someone is stealing data from
your backdoors yeah you can you don't
have to in your you can have something
to like monitor your traffic there's the
name of a website that like helps you do
it but basically if it's on your Wi-Fi
network you can basically detect like
all the different places you're like
traffic is going to and it should be
like a normal thing like so if you're
going rila if your tribe is going like
Google servers or YouTube servers then
like that's normal but if like your
traffic is also going on like some like
IP address that you're not familiar with
then you should probably look into that
interesting there's no like automatic
app though that's I was like this is
sending information of this like kind of
thing scary yeah
we'll include a link to that in the in
the show description when it goes up for
on-demand following here but on that
note we're pretty much out of questions
for the day yeah good coverage a long
weekend I think we'll talk about the no
date review tomorrow once we have a
chance to digest all of it just
literally came out as the show was
starting up so we didn't have a chance
to process it but if you have a bunch of
Galaxy Note 8 questions come back
tomorrow yeah and on that note Roger
bring us home all right if you like Dave
that you saw or heard here check this
out on CNET our podcast is also
available on iTunes
TuneIn stitcher SoundCloud P burner and
Google Play Music we'll see you all
tomorrow see you tomorrow thanks
