the race towards Mars
it must be NASA's why does everyone's
favourite space agency gets its seniors
card what does the future hold and
what's this I hear about a second moon
I'm Claire Reilly welcome to watch this
space from the Senate studios in Sydney
this is your weekly guide to everything
on earth you need to know about space
tonight we're taking a look at the
little space agency that could as NASA
turn 60 and like most six-year-olds NASA
has a soft spot for the Eisenhower years
while the US had a National Advisory
Committee for Aeronautics created back
in 1915 it wasn't until the 50s when the
space race was really heading up that
NACA was replaced by NASA on July 29
1958 President Dwight d Eisenhower
signed the National Aeronautics and
Space Act into law thanks Ike
just two months later on October 1st
NASA officially opened its proverbial
pod bay doors and started work and they
had a lot of work to do why well in the
words of that 1960s classic the Russians
were coming just don't panic the Soviets
had already sent the Sputnik satellite
up into space
in October of 57 dubbing at the second
moon classic Russia and then just a
month later they sent Sputnik 2 up with
a dog inside but the United States no
doubt wanting to secure some of those
high paying moon jobs for their own
all-american canines couldn't let
sleeping dogs lie especially if they
were Russkies just 10 days after
officially setting up shop in 1958 NASA
launched its first spacecraft the
Pioneer one five months later pioneer
one made its first lunar flyby past the
real non Sputnik moon and in April 1960
we got our first TV images of Earth from
space looking good earth the winds kept
coming May 5th 1961 Alan Shepard became
the first American to travel to space
for all of 15 minutes February 20 1962
John Glenn became the first American to
orbit the earth then the big news came
in 1969 when the world sat glued to
their TV sets eating their moon pies as
two homegrown boys named Neil Armstrong
and Buzz all
drum set foot on the moon but it hasn't
all been smooth space sailing for NASA
even the projects that have made it off
the ground haven't all gone safely in
2003 seven NASA crew members died when
the space shuttle Columbia disintegrated
as it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere
and who could forget the images beamed
around the world of the Challenger Space
Shuttle breaking apart shortly after
takeoff in 1986 even NASA's bid to reach
the moon faced early troubles when a
fire killed all three crew members of
the Apollo 1 in 1967 but even beyond the
tragedy nASA has still had its setbacks
why
turns out space exploration is really
slow and expensive shocking NASA has
faced plenty of criticism over the years
for budget blowouts and delays case in
point the successor to the Hubble
telescope the James Webb Space Telescope
has been plagued with problems including
years of delays to its slated launch
date and an estimated 1.5 billion
dollars in cost overruns but that's not
the only issue for NASA in the words of
another 60s icon and their times they
are changing and it's no longer just
about beating the Soviets to operation
space pup now it's all about the Mars
race which leads us to this week's
edition of watch this space X thanks
Claire think of SpaceX kind of like the
NKOTB of the modern space race cool
cashed up and led by the Donnie Wahlberg
of the tech community Elon Musk
alongside Blue Origin which is the space
exploration company headed up by
Amazon's Jeff Bezos who I guess is the
Marky Mark in this situation SpaceX is
giving NASA a run for its money and
changing the shape of modern space
exploration in may 2018 US President
Donald Trump issued Space policy
directive to catchy name which aims to
expand the role of commercial companies
in space exploration but SpaceX is no
stranger to NASA's work it's been
delivering cargo to the International
Space Station for NASA for some years
now and alongside bowling it will soon
be responsible for getting astronauts to
the ISS as well so nASA has the
expertise but they still rely on
government budgets and without their
support they could end up hanging tough
private space companies certainly have
deeper
pockets but they are still the new kids
on the block looks like companies like
SpaceX will have to work with NASA to
take us into the new Space Age step by
step so what's next for NASA well we're
looking at going back to the moon and
taking those first steps towards Mars
for the next era of space exploration
that is of course if we can make it past
president Trump's spaceports to get
there but whatever the future holds NASA
has been its own force for good spurring
scientific discovery inspiring
generations of bright minds and
advancing its own original stated goal
of peaceful progress in space for all
humankind so on behalf of all of us here
at CNN
happy birthday NASA and from this nerdy
kid all the way down in Australia thanks
for opening up the skies that's it for
