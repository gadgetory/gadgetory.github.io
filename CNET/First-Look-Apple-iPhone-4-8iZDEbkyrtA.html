2010 and here I have two of my new
friends the first look at the iPhone 4
we got it in black we got in white let's
just check out some of the killer
features of this guy if you look really
closely we have the front-facing camera
this is what it was all about FaceTime
the first phone fully integrated with a
seamless video chat what makes it great
it does work over Wi-Fi only right now
in 2010 they're gonna work with the
carriers to make that happen in the
future hopefully over 3G we'll probably
see it over 4G networks but what you
also have here is the ability to use the
camera on the back side so that they can
see what you're seeing and this phone
here was all about the camera it's a
five megapixel still camera with an LED
flash
it also takes HD video at 720p 30 frames
per second and then when you add all
that together you have the ability to
get their application iMovie for the
iPhone instantly enables you to edit
video with themes transitions take
picture assets music assets as well as
transitions and make a polish video all
on this little device now we also know
it's a really slim form factor this is
9.3 millimeters the slimmest smartphone
to date and some unique features here is
its stainless steel frame this frame
what makes a difference is that they've
actually built technology into it that
allow to serve as the antenna so not
only is it the structure for the phone
but you can get signals to your 3G or
Bluetooth and your Wi-Fi this is the
antenna now another feature you guys may
not really be able to see is its Retina
display so if you compare it to the
original iPhone of the iPhone 3GS the
pixels on here are four times the amount
in a one inch square you've got super
sharp images and text here looks super
clean but this is one of those things
that you really just have to hold in
your hand hold it up next to another
iPhone and see to believe one thing I
really didn't expect to see and it
wasn't on this iPhone is 4G
compatibility this is still a 3G phone
that will be operating on a tMT's
network and for all you AT&amp;amp;T current
iPhone users if your contract expires in
2010 you have the ability to upgrade to
this phone without paying any early
termination fees so here's the breakdown
these come in black and white cool sexy
colors the 16 gig models are $1.99 the
32 gig models are $2.99 they'll be
available in five countries us included
on June
a fourth and then worldwide sometime in
September there you have it a first look
at the new iPhone 4
