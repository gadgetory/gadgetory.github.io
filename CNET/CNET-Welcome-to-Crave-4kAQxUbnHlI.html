crave video podcast i'm veronica belmont
and i'm james kim so what is crave
exactly well its name says it all it's
true crave will cover the coolest
hottest and sexiest little gadget or e
that you lust after whether it be the
thinnest phone the latest ipod or in
this case hot off the factory floor the
new t-mobile dash you'll find it right
here on crave and you can check out the
blog that this video podcast is based on
over at crave sina com we'll be covering
some of our favorite gadgets from the
blog right here on this show every week
will also be dissing products on
technology too because there's a lot of
bad technology there's a lot of it out
there i think i might see something
anyway first I think we should show you
some of the stuff that we've been really
hot for lately so what exactly is that
by the world this is this is something
I've been craving lately because I've
just really been into robotics and I saw
this a target they have a robotic
section oh really yes and uh yes this is
a robotic chimp wait the thing I'm
baffled by sweet target has a robotic
section yes they do it's fairly
sophisticated everything nothing goes
over two hundred dollars but okay this
guy right here is it's pretty amazing
he's got animatronics very lifelike and
he reacts to his environment so if you
sort of tap him on the head or rub them
on the chin you know it's sort of like a
realistic Furby kind of a scary Furby
really terrifying yes so the child I
would be running for the hills come on
you brought that thing into my house
he's got feelings too anyway what's this
see now this I was obsessed with this
thing I first saw it online and it's
called the nebosh tag and also known as
the Wi-Fi rabbana stick and they had it
out in France and for months and months
and months I was waiting and waiting and
waiting for it to be released in the US
and they finally did on thinkgeek com I
bought it the day it came out I don't
know why I mean it's one hundred fifty
dollars and it's really cute but it
reads do your RSS feeds I'll tell you
when you get a new email it'll tell you
the weather based on what colors light
up on its belly I can't plug it in now
but that's really get the idea it's
definitely cuter than this guy he talks
to you in a sweet little British accent
really
yeah actually I made her a she but make
it gets kind of gender nonspecific I see
some robots though right now we should
go to our new segment called robot watch
because as if these weren't cool enough
there's even more going on in Japan as
usual they have something even more
high-tech than the two of these it kind
of brings elements of both of those
gadgets together yeah it's called the
pup hero and in those 500 words it can
tell you the weather just like lambast
tag and if there's an intruder in the
house it will recognize that there's a
person there whose faces it doesn't know
and it will tell you that there's a
stranger in the house that it's like it
like a really adorable watch it's really
adorable too i want one of those so
badly we got to order one
oh did you hear it was all konnichiwa
and adorable I just want to hold it and
love it and whisper sweet little things
in its plastic here well you can't
because it's only available in Japan
right now all the good stuff is yeah but
speaking of things that you can get or
will be able to get legions of people
are gonna be clamoring over this thing
this is the dash like hey we showed you
earlier Bonnie Charter Review actually
said it was gonna be a motorola q killer
yeah well it is really awesome it feels
really good to hold in the hand I mean
the queue is a little more boxy than
this one is contoured yeah so it feels
more like a normal phone it doesn't kind
of give you the bulk of a normal
smartphone yeah I like the interface too
yeah so this is gonna be a huge hit
probably for the holidays and for anyone
who just wants a smartphone that looks
really good yeah also definitely read
about on the crave blog okay so if
there's a product that you crave send us
an email at crave at cnet com especially
if you have photos or a link to a video
we might even include it in our own
video podcast well be back next week to
show you more the hottest gear from all
around the world see you next adios</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
