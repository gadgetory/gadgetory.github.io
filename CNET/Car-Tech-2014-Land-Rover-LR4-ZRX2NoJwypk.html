landrover sold in the North American
market everything else is going kind of
Sidda fide nice vehicles but this has
got the essence the look let's drive
this lr4 in the high-end luxe trim and
check the tech now the LR 4 has that
kind of look where you'd expect the
Queen's security detail to come piling
out at a stop sign with their MP fives
barely hidden under their Savile Row
jackets it's got that sort of
combination of British handsomeness and
capability the signature design feature
on the lr 4 has to be those windows in
between the C and D pillars on the sides
they look like kind of a different
interpretation of what a Vista Cruiser
wagon used to have but unfortunately
that rap over glass is just for looks
there's basically bodywork up there at
the top the lines are handsome and
square and says I know what I'm doing
off-road and caring up to seven people
in the optional three row configuration
the second and third rows fold more or
less flat for the inevitable antiquing
but do it from the front not the back or
with power as some slick minivans do
Batman would love this thing he could
get his gobos in the puddle lamps
the first you're going to notice about
an lr4 is that it feels inside like it
looks outside tall angular and airy this
is a really cool greenhouse to be in
which a lot of SUVs and crossovers are
trending away from I wish this is a
panoramic roof but it's not it's in two
pieces and this glass moving part up
here doesn't really get out of the way
very much so it's a little bit
frustrating in that respect now let's
get to the main event the head unit with
all of our infotainment function hello
it's my old Palm Treo calling yeah
what's up okay I'll pass that on yeah it
wants its interface designer back this
is what we call in the vernacular of the
tech industry god-awful it's a very
dated design it wastes a lot of space on
chrome and lines and boxes it has a lot
of dead space in it for example if you
go to the radio I just want to see more
information on what I'm listening to
right now not a majority of kind of
standard utility buttons that I may not
use for minutes or hours lots of
truncation of what I want to read the
screen itself is small by today's
standards especially on a pricey vehicle
navigation navigation go to go to
address navigation go to address please
say the city name or say change search
area San Francisco sorry okay you lost
me at San Francisco as soon as a system
wants information little onesie twosie
buckets like that I know we're back in
the 90s no thanks on the audio system
you've got several levels of Meridian
sound they've dumped Harman Kardon we
have the high end system which is some
17 speakers and 800 plus watts your
sources are all good you've got
basically everything here you might want
I've never been able to get the
Bluetooth streaming to work maybe it's
just my phone though no other card ever
tested it has a problem with my phone
but this one does beyond that you've got
your USB and aux connection you can get
a rear seat entertainment system that
appears to be
USB and mp4 biased not so much disc
am/fm HD and satellite radio of course
are all in here there's an EPS package
called in control but our LR 4 is one
year too old to have it 15s and later
can pull up I Heart Radio glimpse for
location sharing siddik offline
navigation which is probably better than
the factory rig and seldom seen choices
like news onboard and mobile day they've
moved the place where you plug in your
portables from in the console and I'll
show you why in a minute to one of the
two glove boxes the upper one now has a
little dock over there with your USB in
your ox it's handy to have it up high on
its own little bin unless you're driving
alone in which case you can't reach it
here's why the USB stuff isn't in the
console anymore because we've got a
little fridge in here you can turn that
on keep things cool as you drive bigger
organ onyx screw up once we turn the
drive controls if you're a 6-footer like
me there is actually no way you can
lower the seat enough and raise the
steering wheel enough to see the gauges
I have lost everything between 1 and
6,000 rpm and I can't see anything
between 50 and 110 miles an hour I think
I would use those ranges in day-to-day
driving if I could see them now your
automatic transmission is one of these
rise to your hand knobs that jag Land
Rover is so big on you've also got shift
paddles over here for your standard one
choice automatic transmission we'll get
to the powertrain in a minute under the
hood over here is your terrain response
system where you can dial in very simply
a little pictogram of whatever kind of
terrain challenge you are facing you've
also got your height adjustment rear
differential lock crawl control and
whether or not you're going to be in
high or low on your transfer case we
have the optional two-speed transfer
case they don't all come with it
no longer a 5-liter v8 found up here now
it's a much smaller 3 liter but
supercharged v6 340 horsepower but only
332 pound-feet of torque
I normally expect a supercharged engine
of a very high torque number this one
not really and it has to move over fifty
six hundred pounds of British squared
off tradition still it gets up to 60 and
7.7 seconds pretty respectable and does
that through a one choice only 8-speed
automatic where it used to have a
six-speed Automatic nice improvement
there as well and obviously these are
all four-wheel-drive your mpg is rated
at fourteen nineteen that really needs
fourteen in everyday living pretty sure
there is some efficiency tech here
helping prop it up as much as it does
that would include auto start-stop
technology and brake energy regeneration
to reduce some of the alternator lag but
overall this is not light on the fuel or
light on the pavement Lelaina this is a
serious capable off-roader the ride
quality is outstanding
it's basically luxury car which is
basically you have to do these days to
play in this market at this price
now power is power is kind of
disconnected it's not the worst I've
driven but there's no sharp throttle
response here you get a burst of power a
moment after you press the throttle
that's more than you really want and
then you're backing it off and reining
it in so it's kind of a lumpy yo-yo II
drive quality it's not too out of
character with this kind of vehicle
though and there is ample power and it's
very linear once it does come on now in
terms of visibility tech you've got
blind spot monitoring I get indicators
here in the mirror nothing active about
it cross traffic alert in the back we
have adaptive cruise control on this
particular sample there's no forward
collision tech though no warning or
automatic braking and you can also get a
surround camera as well as we have the
sort of porpoise nose camera here that
looks out left and right for when you're
nosing out of a blind alley or something
like that now I've got no place to
really check out the off-road ability of
this terrain response system
here in urban Greater San Francisco but
it's as you've seen easy to operate very
straightforward and the air suspension
can grant a big degree of additional
lift here when you do go off-road I'm
coming to a stop sign here let's see how
the start/stop technology works off we
go and now I'm gonna lift off the brake
and it's actually among the quickest
I've driven which would surprise you
considering I'm comparing it to some
fine German sporting sedans but this one
fires quickly it's fairly unobtrusive
and perhaps because of the sheer weight
of the vehicle it doesn't shake the
whole cabin so it's actually very
satisfying
you can get into an lr44 as little as
about 50,000 and change but we've got
the lux package so we're starting at
about sixty one five then we add on the
key options which start with the HD
package if you want the serious
two-speed transfer case satellite and HD
radio are insultingly Alucard at seven
hundred and fifty dollars for the
package the apps suite is four hundred
and thirty dollars afraid I couldn't
test it and tell you if it's worth it
adaptive cruise is thirteen hundred
dollars but as I mentioned has no
forward collision warning tech and
vision assist which includes Auto high
beams the blind spot and surround camera
tech as well as that front Junction
camera is sixteen hundred more all in
you're looking at about sixty seven
thousand dollars CNET style for a
vehicle that's been dramatically
modernized and refreshed as it comes
into this model year and yet retains a
certain traditional British</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
