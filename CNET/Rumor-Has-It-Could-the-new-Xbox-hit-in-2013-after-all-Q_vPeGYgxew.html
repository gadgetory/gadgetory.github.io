Bell and for Kareem leaving welcome to
rumor has it the show where we round up
the week's hottest tech rumors and we
vote on which rumors we think are true
and which ones we think our total bunk
but the best part is that you get to
vote too so don't go anywhere let's jump
right into the biggest rumor of the week
a 56-page powerpoint allegedly outlines
microsoft's product plans through the
year 2015 the juiciest bit that the xbox
720 will drop in time for christmas 2013
this excites me way more than an
appletini and i think the interesting
part here is that they're also
introducing a new connect and some
augmented reality glasses for 2015 this
could very well be fake but it is in
line with the timeframe that we've been
hearing for a while so whether or not
those images of what looks like Jughead
or Veronica dancing to some sort of new
Xbox Kinect are real when are you going
to release a new console alright so this
is the question every gamer wants to
know when will we see a new Xbox is
going to be this year next year or all
the way in 2014 i'm a pessimist so i say
2014 that's what we've been hearing all
year and i don't really think that that
product roadmap looks real I think
you're being weighted down on this whole
thing it could happen this year right no
probably not because they just refreshed
the hardware last year 2014 I things way
too far off to everyone wants to seem to
happen i think 2013 is the perfect year
so if you're watching on cnet cast your
vote right now using the thumbs up or
the thumbs down right next to emily's
head using the interactive player do you
have the next 30 seconds to vote in the
meantime we're going to take this
question to the streets of San Francisco
but don't go anywhere because when we
come back we're going to reveal whether
what you think is the same as the cnet
Council of experts
do you think that the new xbox is gonna
come out this year next year or the year
after I think it's gonna come out the
year after been waiting for for a while
I think they'll come around Christmas
this year yes here I have no idea I'm
hoping this year but maybe next year
this year this year in time for
Christmas I don't know if I like this
next year I probably have to say it'll
be two or three years two or three years
so it could be as late as 2014 yeah
that's what I'm thinking that's what I'm
thinking to finalize with me thank you
got it okay well the people on the
street are pretty optimistic only one
guy agrees with me let's go upstairs and
hear some more rumors and reveal with
the cnet Council of experts thinks our
second rumor comes from our good friends
over at digit times and a bunch of you
also emailed us rumor is that Amazon may
be planning to introduce several
versions of the kindle fire in three
sizes all I know is that I don't care
about bigger versions all I want is a
faster kindle fire yeah 3 version seems
pretty excessive but I think people
wanted a 10 inch version of that kindle
fire ever since the first one came out
our third rumor comes from an anonymous
developer speaking to TechCrunch so take
it with a grain of salt or 100 this
developer thinks that the new auto
layout feature in iOS 6 is the smoking
gun that proves that the next iPhone
will be bigger all right so it looks
like this whole auto layout thing is
just there for developers to be able to
resize their apps across a wide range of
different screen sizes I like this rumor
but i think is probably more about apple
TV than the iphone since Apple has
already solved the whole resolution
thing with their iphones pretty well
yeah and between iphones and ipads but
it could mean that we're going to see an
iphone that has a bigger or different
aspect ratio and finally The Wall Street
Journal says that samsung's new CEO
wants to strengthen their software
capabilities we're wondering a samsung
may finally abandoned Android in all
their smartphones and just make their
own OS since Google is now in the
hardware business with Motorola maybe
Samsung is feeling threatened and
they've sort of made overtures in this
direction before because they bought an
OS called bada but then we never saw
them do anything with it yeah I think I
don't really believe in this room for
that much because I think android is one
of the best things that ever happened to
Samsung exactly the CEO probably just
talking about making more customizations
on Android also just don't do it Samsung
don't do it they waited too long if they
do it now Google and Apple have the
patent on everything and they're going
to be lawyers sitting in some dark room
somewhere being like just try it Samsung
just try it may also be cheering yeah we
will get the Richer ok back to our first
rumor let's see what the cnet council
thinks of the Xbox the cnet council is
composed of five Cena experts who cast
their votes anonymously opinions org
estimates expressed by the cnet Council
are not an endorsement by cnet or CBS
interactive obviously because these are
rumors folks and the cnet verdict is yay
they think that the xbox 720 is going to
come out in 2013 they're smart people
those cnet councillors two of them
agreed with me three of them agreed with
me so it's fine so you win but most
importantly check out how you guys did
see the results there right there and
that's our show everyone tune in next
week for more rumors in the meantime if
you've got a comment a room or you just
want to chat with us call us at 1 800
750 cnet i'm not sure we'll answer but
you can leave a message or write us at
rumor has it at cnet com and meanwhile
our comment of the week goes to Tony x42
who said Android is like driving a stick
shift you have way more power and
options but it takes a little bit of
work whereas iOS is like an automatic
it's easier but you're limited smart
smart I still don't know if that's pro
war against but I like to comment I
think it's both are good sure so leave
us more comments and don't forget to
follow us on Twitter Facebook and
Google+ ok see you next week on rumor
has it
