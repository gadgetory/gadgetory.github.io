glad you're able to make it can I get
you something to drink yeah all right
look I know why you're here and
everything is going to be okay you're
not the first iPhone owner who's thought
about upgrading to a pixel two instead
of an iPhone 10 know what phone do you
have right now oh the 5s
oh man you know make them like this
anymore do they Wow
the SE but you don't I mean right now
normally you would upgrade from this -
well this the iPhone 10 right yeah but
you're thinking about upgrading to this
the pixel - the good news is I've been
using both of these phones their last
few months and I got to be honest the
pixel 2 is the best Android phone for
those iPhone owners looking to break up
with Apple let's talk price so an iPhone
10 with 64 gigabytes of storage cost
$999 us the pixel - with the same
storage costs $650 us that's 350 dollars
less I mean come on right
but what do you get for that let's take
a look at what's in the box so for the
iPhone 10 you get a pair of headphones
and a lightning connector you get a
headphone dongle and you get a charging
cable and charger for the pixel - you
get this strange-looking doohickey it
plugs into the bottom of your phone and
you could transfer your old photos
videos and music from your iPhone to
your pixel - there's no headphone jack
and there's no headphones but there's a
dongle and there's also a wall charger
and cable but this is not an ordinary
wall charger and cable no this is a
quick charger and after 15 minutes can
add seven hours of battery life to the
pixel - I mean come on
all right now the iPhone 10
it can quick charge to just not with a
cable that comes in the box
you have to buy a lightning to USB C
cable and a higher wattage power adapter
which costs like an extra 74 dollars I
mean come on right all right let's talk
design so the iPhone 10 and it's it's
that's beautiful stainless steel band
the back is glass it kind of looks like
a movie prop from a futuristic sci-fi
movie notice anything missing that's
right no home button which means no
fingerprint sensor which means you and
lock this phone with your face no no no
no no not like that
let me show you like that and it works
really well now since there's no home
button they've added a few new gestures
which at first are kind of annoying to
remember but you know within a couple
weeks they're like second nature let's
talk about the pixel twos design it
looks pretty much like most cell phones
have for the last few years there's a
chin and forehead on the top and bottom
bezels on either side but Google has
made it look pretty slick on the back
here you have a glass top and the bottom
here it's coated in plastic and it feels
fantastic
oh what's this it's a fingerprint reader
just like the one in your iPhone 5s this
is just on the back of the phone you
know as good as the hardware is though
another thing you need to consider is
the software have you ever used Android
before you know what for a lot of iPhone
owners old versions of Android are
chaotic and well not very secure but
that has cage Android Oreo is fantastic
and it works just as well in the pixel
to as iOS 11 does on the iPhone 10 now
there are some differences but for most
things Android and iOS are pretty well
matched hmm take a look at the back
again notice anything
yeah so the pixel two has one camera and
the iPhone 10 has two rear cameras but
they took they both take amazing photos
in fact I would say the pixel twos
photos have just a little bit more
detail and a little bit better dynamic
range in low light it is not to say that
this iPhone 10 takes bad photos that's
just to say that this pixel 2 has that
good of a camera now the second camera
on the iPhone does something pretty cool
it gives you two times optical zoom
which lets you get well 2 times closer
to your subject and the neat thing is
unlike digital zoom the images look
amazing some other things are think
about the iPhone 10 does have a faster
processor but the pixel 2 has a longer
battery life at the end of the day the
pixel 2 is the best choice for an iPhone
owner looking not to upgrade to the
iPhone 10 it's cheaper than the iPhone
10 has as good if not a better camera
than the iPhone 10 has a longer battery
life of the iPhone 10 and it runs
Android Orio which would surprise even
the most devout iOS user with its fit
and finish you know what I'm gonna keep
your 5s because I want to give you your
new pixel to
how you feeling now thought so</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
