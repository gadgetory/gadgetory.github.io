intended well we're going to stay until
we die you know I'm saying there are
about 8,400 vacant properties in the
city of Louisville Kentucky and they can
cause problems for homeowners like
George and Gail Drummond live next door
to an abandoned house I went around to
the back and I voted up some stuff
because they had torn it off now my
problem is they're going back there and
they're using drugs evidence is back
there a lot of vacant property fires are
caused by squatters or legal activity
and by the time of neighbor notices a
fire started in a vacant property it's
often too late back some time ago we
were in a house and the neighbor across
the street looked at over at that house
and he saw flashing flames if he hadn't
been sitting on his porch what would
have happened because we were in the
house we really didn't think about
the city turned to the local civic
hacker community for a solution to
vacant property fires Casper is a device
that listens for smoke detectors
sometimes we call it a smoke detector
detector and it's basically what it is
it's got a microphone it listens for the
specific frequency that smoke detectors
a signal app and then it sends a signal
to the cloud using a cell modem and we
process that flag and we send a text
message and calls out to city government
to myself to neighbors and they get a
notification that says this vacant house
is on fire it needs attention let's take
care of the problem before it becomes a
bigger problem the city has placed to
caspers and smoke detectors in 8
abandoned houses to test the system
solar panels keep the caspere's running
and you can see them in the windows or
hanging from the awnings of the test
houses cancer is a great idea thus far
we haven't had any problem with it and
it would be great to see it funded and
rolled out to all of our vacant Metro
properties especially in neighborhoods
in areas that have a high number of
vacancies it's a good thing for that
alone to be up there because we land up
in your sleep and we don't know until
the fire truck is out here flashing red
use I'm saying the pilot program runs
through March then the city will decide
if it's worth while to put more
caspere's in vacant houses throughout
Louisville the more devices we can put
inside these houses the more coverage
you have in a neighborhood and that
helps people feel safer and feel better
about their their living situation
it would just break my heart if I come
on that side of my house in front of my
house and finds out at least we know
somebody's looking out for some and and
trying to do something</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
