more interesting than you would think at
first glance
I'm Jessica dull court from CNN this is
the Samsung Galaxy rush for Boost Mobile
that means that it is a no-contract
phone one of the interesting things
about it is that it's small as you can
see it's got a 3.5 inch display it does
look really nice I do like the dedicated
camera button on the side everything
else about this phone is attractive the
design looks nice and it's got a kind of
a nice bubbly look and feel to it so I
approve of the design but I also approve
of is Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich is
the operating system it's very cool on
this phone and it's got all the whistles
and bells here with Samsung's TouchWiz
interface so there's a lot that you can
do in a relatively small package it's
nice another thing that's on here is
Boost ID which originally started as
sprint ID and basically that means that
you can switch from one profile to
another profile you can do this as many
times as you want and it will load
background wallpaper maybe some apps and
other shortcuts and there are plenty of
them prepackaged here if you don't want
to use them it's definitely not gonna
get in the way if you do want to use
them that's available for you there's a
3.2 megapixel camera with flash on the
back I was not impressed with photo
quality at all 1.3 megapixel camera on
the front for video chats and other
things like that
the one gigahertz processor on this
phone is surprisingly good most phones
with Android 4.0 have at least dual-core
processors and while there's a little
bit of lag I think it does pretty well
over 4 gigabytes of internal storage and
a micro SD card slot that takes up to 32
gigabytes in all the price is one of my
favorite parts $149.99 without a
contract that is very decent upfront for
Ice Cream Sandwich I think it does have
3G not 4G but the phone costs less than
half the price of
mobiles 4G Ice Cream Sandwich phone so
if you are looking for a bargain you
don't mind the slower speeds you don't
mind something petite then I would
definitely keep this in the running
