the future of computers that will be
true for the next half century but fifty
years ago in 1965 the co-founder of
Intel Gordon Moore made a prediction
that holds true today he noticed that
every year since the computer chip was
invented those chips were becoming twice
as complex his theory was that this
would continue and it has about every
two years man has been able to make
computer chips faster cheaper and
smaller I'm Bridget Carey and on this
CNET inside scoop I'm joined by a
colleague Ben Rubin who has reporting on
this theory known as Moore's law now
it's 50 years later since this theory
came about so what's the significance
now looking back the concept of Moore's
law first started as an observation and
now it's basically turned into a fact
it's turned into a timeline that all
chip manufacturers software developers
device makers follow along and expect
and for chip manufacturers especially if
you kind of fall behind this two-year
timeline that was first observed 50
years ago you could become irrelevant
all your factories all your scientists
all your research could all of a sudden
just go up poof nobody really cares
about your chips anymore because you're
just not moving fast enough for
consumers Moore's law has meant that
basically the internet smartphones all
the different types of technology that
we see today wouldn't really be possible
without the complexity of these chips
growing as quickly as it has in your
research what surprised you the thing
that I would say first of all that
surprised me in that I spent a lot of
time learning about was just how small
the different parts of a chip are today
the first transistor which is the most
important part of a chip was built by
hand and these days they can make them
with machines that produce them to be
smaller than a virus transistors today
you could fit more than a hundred
million of them on a pinhead which is
just kind of like you know mind-blowing
to think about if you lesion yeah
exactly and and they don't just make one
transistor they make more than a billion
of them to fit on any chip and then they
make billions and billions of chips a
year so just two
consider the precision necessary to do
this type of work it's really pretty
incredible I went out to Oregon and saw
Intel's research facilities over there
and to really get like a full
perspective of just how much work and
effort is needed to do this kind of work
I took a helicopter ride to see the 300
acre facility one of their newest
facilities they started in the 90s and
it's just absolutely enormous in this
effort to try to develop and manufacture
chips is there a point we're reaching
where people are thinking that we're not
gonna be able to make transistors any
smaller we can't keep making chips you
know twice as good every two years yeah
I mean ever since Moore's law was was
first coined or considered there's
always been predictions that it's going
to end at some point and if probably in
some way it probably will and they're
just you know physics dictates that you
just can't keep making this stuff
smaller and smaller it's gonna happen I
don't think that from from my research
it seems that the in the immediate
future that's probably not going to be
the case like we're not in danger of
this happening anytime soon and even
then scientists plan to kind of pivot
where they're gonna find a way to make
chips faster and cheaper but maybe not
through the same way that they've been
doing by making transistors smaller well
