future
but how does the glittering era we
currently inhabit to compare to our
long-held benchmark for technological
progress back to the future part to the
Year 2015
as visited by Marty McFly it got a lot
of things right about today's tech but
in other ways our modern contraptions
are way beyond anything we could have
imagined back in the 80s here are the
tech predictions but back to the future
got right and bought it missed let's
start with something the movie got right
the rise of the smart home Marty's
future house is absolutely packed with
gadgets from flat-screen tvs used for
video calls to fingerprint scanning door
locks and voice control just about
everywhere
it's dangerous to enter without lights
on right yes in our own 2015 meanwhile
one of the year's biggest trends has
been giving our own home appliances a
similar high-tech makeover our door
locks sense our presence our thermostats
can be controlled from anywhere our
lights change color our homes can be
viewed remotely while bizarre robots
roam our carpets
hydrate level-4 please admittedly modern
smart homes still can't cook a pizza in
seconds but there is one more similarity
both McFly's and today's tech enabled
household to struggle to make voice
control work yes Siri where's the fruit
let me think about that here's what I
found on the web Phil yes Siri where's
the fruit there is one thing missing
from marty smart home and it's the
biggest problem with the film's vision
of the future where's the internet the
internet has been without a doubt the
greatest tech revolution of the last 25
years offering instant digital
communication between devices and
putting the sum of human knowledge at
our fingertips but in Marty's 2015
there's no sign that various gadgets are
talking to each other indeed there's not
even a hint of email with fax machines
still the primary method of
communication fax is one thing but when
it comes to a technology that's been
steadily evolving over the last half a
century back to the future proves
remarkably prescient modern television
has come a long way since the medium
started gaining traction in the middle
of the last century and back to the
future source several changes coming for
one thing our TVs our flat panels and
their multifunctional handling all
manner of apps including video chat and
while we don't tend to watch six
channels at once the modern phenomenon
of second screen viewing does divide our
attention with IMDB or reactions on
Twitter never far from our field of
vision speaking of those second screens
one thing nobody in the 80s could have
anticipated was the role that mobile
gadgets would play in our lives
the McFly kids of 2015 might have
something resembling Google glass but
it's not as personal or powerful as a
modern smartphone these goggles are
hooked up to a shared telephone line for
goodness sake it is for you and speaking
of personal tech where are all the
social networks if Marty jr. had really
wanted to avoid Griff and his gang he
could have just checked his Instagram
let's talk about entertainment an area
in which Back to the Future made some
very solid predictions indeed take young
Elijah woods discussed that 80's gaming
involved using your hands and then
consider motion based advances such as
Microsoft's Kinect all the
oculus rift and while we're not watching
jaws 19 in hallo max the modern cinema
landscape is dominated by sequels and
franchises man and the DeLorean is cool
and indeed Back to the Future did make
some great predictions about innovation
in the automotive industry it just
didn't quite guess where that innovation
was happening our future lacks
commercially available flying vehicles
but we've got self-driving cars looming
on the horizon and fully electric cars
are rapidly gaining traction which is
pretty darn cool don't forget that while
the DeLoreans time circuits are powered
by the trash consuming mr. fusion the
car itself still ran on gasoline chalk
one up for the non-fictional time line
so all things considered how accurate
was back to the future
well bearing in mind the makers of the
movie were probably more concerned with
making an entertaining film and playing
Nostradamus a lot of it is pretty
spot-on I mean apart from the hoverboard
of course which let's be honest is the
only thing that any of us ever really
wanted of course it's always possible
that not to defect the facts the future
did predict exists precisely because it
was in the film offering humanity a
glittering vision of what to aim for in
fact it's almost as if the film itself
was a message sent back from the future
to our past selves creating multiple
technological timelines this is Harry
you
what do you fancy doing now attend a
rhythmic ceremonial ritual
