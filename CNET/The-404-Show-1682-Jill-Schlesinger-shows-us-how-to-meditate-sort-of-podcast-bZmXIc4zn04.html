so much for tuning in to the 404 show
it's Friday November 4 2016 two very
special people are here with us today
mr. Russ fresh day hello hello and to
his left the one the only Jill gentlemen
I wonder if people can notice the
difference in the way this sounds phonic
Lee because we are actually recording in
the old 404 studio behind the old 404
boomerang very large yeah room we're in
which is different I would not are you
okay with it it's very intimidating yeah
you I've been looking at him since we
walked in here and his 100
person oh yeah nervous sweating bullets
uh first of all I I'm sorry that when I
first walked in i had a panic attack
Islamic oh no is this video and i have
no makeup on right i was gonna say next
time regardless maybe you do a favor and
just come in i put on a base I wouldn't
know we're fine you yeah a shin
day-to-day base your your your routine
yeah well what then I thought well
remember when I wore my green adidas on
the air and and they got made it to the
404 and then you might be able to see
had we had video my cool new red pumas
everywhere why do you think that's like
the coolest thing ever it's not the
coolest thing ever just think about me
so cool I think sky where I used to work
Pumas a lot Puma you were in a little
fred perry action there but I told you
it's old school in real time a tennis
person yes I was oh so that's why you
know not everyone knows the fred perry
perry ellis right Perry else that's his
cousin okay the Perry family notice how
i pivoted away from your disdain of my
sneakers yeah yeah that was not nice I'm
sorry I brought you cookies you did I
believe there she said absolutely not
yeah where are they from Zabar's I'll
tell you where they're from okay they're
from this event that I did last night ok
ok let me get into this first right let
me just get this off my chest is
picturing you walking to event and like
with a bucket
just like scoop and cookies there's a
lot of things that have to get off a lot
of chests today start with yours how
about your chest yours is smaller than
mine chest wise Oh writers are actual
blows ooh this yours is bigger but do
you want to like get into her do you
want to like what do you want to do did
you say we just gotta do a real quick so
I was in here last week Russ I didn't
listen that show but you know so she was
good my brother listen he says okay Shay
a Shannon was in we talked about music
stuff as per huge yeah so if that was
very good but yeah you were not in so i
wasn't in because i had some pretty
shitty go down in my family
unfortunately to two Sundays ago my mom
had a stroke and it's very upsetting is
very sad is devastating um she was in
the hospital for for a while and she's
finally out of it and she's she's in
rehab now so she's doing physical
therapy occupational therapy and speech
therapy and it's she's improving she's
doing better but though but the first
couple of days were it was just the
worst week of my life to be honest and
yeah I don't know I'm at a point now
where I'm you know I'm almost two weeks
you know passed since like day one since
day zero and you know it's obviously
easier now to talk about it and I've
cried all I think I can cry so yeah
that's the story I have to tell people
because I just can't have it linger I
just need to like front-load things with
it uh and you know although you are not
a religious person I am 100 not you we
would say that perhaps you were a
religious right sure out but there are
many studies that find that prayer is
very helpful there's sick people I swear
there's no way so we wait wait wait
let's football this down because so
you're saying someone that is sick
should pray or your other people oh you
mean comforting
okay so what I'm saying I think those
studies are probably statistically bad
because the fact that someone is praying
for you indicates people care about you
and therefore you're getting better care
the prayer shouldn't be getting the
credit it should be the command
compassion than credit let's just let
this is let's wipe the slate clean yeah
I jumper Jill come in here just me like
you're gonna drop this man can't just
like cherry pick stats Joe it is a good
sexual oppression look up I'm pretty
sure about this I look I am not
religious I know you're not a three year
anniversary of my father's death but
when my dad was sick someone sent me
this link that was like the that there
was some indication that when people
prayed for others that there was some
impact low so let me just go back and
tell you people would say to me who were
religious and you know I'm praying for
you and your family at first I'd like
roll my eyes and be like good luck with
that yeah like because guess what this
infection is going to be a little bit
stronger than your prayer right I was
right that said I started to kind of
feel comforted in that of course baby
even not that I would pray cuz there's
not one time while he was sick were like
God please help i am yeah i did get this
like nice warm feeling when people say
to me you know what I lit a candle for
your phone away that's so nice that is
so you just you know unpacked what you
were saying to the program now okay with
what you said because what you meant was
it's just nice to have people coming out
and say that there isn't like magic God
powers that's gotta be dominate your
emotional is all of the 404 universe
think of how about think about my mom
have one little moment okay yeah about
it sad siege or you sure that's okay now
it's like a Las Vegas thing very Jewish
alright I couldn't pray for you but I
brought you a cookie yeah it sounds like
they were free cookies that's gonna make
you feel better how social so she she
regifting a terrific you know I didn't
even read give me gifts there was a cost
these dang this baggage alright so let's
okay so she's
so can we just have a moment for Sue
sure just like no she's still with like
think about her and think about which
best she's she's doing a lot better I
mean that's a very incremental better
thing um you know she's got to get a lot
of things back yeah ah but yeah you know
me such a nice note after my father died
she did yeah yeah she did your mom your
mom my mom met who I lakeview I went out
to dinner one time with them yeah but it
was such as hopefully we'll be able to
do that again ya soon oh my god this is
your weird ploy to get me to New Jersey
I mean dinner are you gonna McGee to my
kid broke cars right now yeah mate my
doing it that's true are you guys at
home see my I'm real likely they do
playing the sick mother card gets me out
sooner Dylan I'm not saying she doesn't
care about doing I care about her but
it's like I'm much actually I'm this is
so weird but I'm much more comfortable
around sick aging people than most
people are I don't get it out by it okay
so I tend to do that more often well
that's none of the things that are
happening to sue you know she's just in
a interesting time in her life right now
uh but again like the the main thing to
keep in mind is like she's that progress
is moving forward she's exactly where
she needs to be and you know I think you
can kind of feel good about that oh yeah
we're here for you baby thank you I
appreciate that so that's that's my
story I want to get that out of the way
and I talked about it on yesterday's
he's cast podcast but that was uh that
was something hanging over me then I'm
glad also if people are out there and
they'd been through this or they have
some suggestions you have some
neurologist fans sure doesn't it doesn't
hurt to hear from people if that's what
you want to do no pressure you don't be
very careful that to send dopey things
and I will determine what is dopey and
what is not right Jonah dopey screener
because like I'd never forget when my ex
had cancer and then people started
saying like oh you know what you know
what she should do yeah she'd like have
this this this
herb thing and I'd go to the oncologist
and he'd look at me and be like first of
all that's never been tested yeah yeah
yeah no you're not doing that yeah now
that I'm certain looking for advice you
need medical story were nice right and
that's the thing everyone has a good
story of recovery or stuff like that and
you know that's what that's what makes
it easier to swallow yeah okay let's
talk about you Jill what happened let's
talk about the free cookies cuz you do I
mean again I can't eat them cuz why we
dairy oh you want to try them no I would
just felt like there is be some sort of
thunder of the mind unless they're like
spectacular amazing I can't vouch for
them ok so I'm picturing just normal
chocolate chip cookies they're not all
right so shut yourselves the orange bag
right and you take the first down it's
like a sunflower right oh yeah those
cookies that's like an event cookie what
that is that's right that's like you
would get as like yeah as you're walking
right and those are like the super thick
shortbread cookies these are from
floories finales in uh nesconset New
York I get a lot of those kind of
cookies during the holidays from like
companies will send like a holiday gift
I don't be ladies look great ok so I'm
sorry Russ that I didn't know that you
had did no dairy that's okay do you want
to split this pumpkin one no I chances
on the air okay so here's what happened
I a an acquaintance and I mean a loose
acquaintance someone who I admit one
time just the executive director of a
big nonprofit out on Long Island okay
some corporation wrong and it's really
it's a nice like like I'll just say
whatever it's called island harvest is
that the major food bank for all those
it rings a bell I think I've heard of it
they see it like three hundred sixteen
thousand people of Long Island and when
you start digging into the stats 200,000
people on long island which has like one
of the richest counties Nassau County
has one of the richest counties 200,000
people live in poverty among Graceland
which is that's a lot crazy right yeah
so she's like oh you know I want to do
this big event your Queens you're losing
weight
loose acquaintance this is an email you
got yep okay and remember I met you on
the beach three years ago with so-and-so
no no yeah but like I knew her as a
friend of a friend okay and so would you
do this event and we're thinking I just
would like you to be able to do like oh
and a thing for my big donors basically
a night of appreciation sure okay yeah I
said great well what are you thinking do
you need me to talk about the
organization do you want me to make the
ask am I trying to get money for them i
will be Jack's right what am i doing or
whatever yeah I etc she said you know
what night with Lily just like maybe
like a nice thing like an event like a
speaking engagement where you know you
talk a little bit about you know some of
the stats about what's going on in the
economy and I said well what if I did
like a big overview of kind of like
what's been going on in the economy like
15 20 years and long-term trends and
income inequality and how there are so
many people living on the edge I didn't
realize that until the financial crisis
hit yeah and that's why this is even
more important than sir you're a good
figure right back okay so I get that all
together I do this they say it's in this
beautiful restaurant which was donated
and you know it's great because they get
a lot of restaurants and a lot of
organizations that basically give them
all the food that they're like that's
close to the edge knock on Bajor and
they give it to the food bank and the
food bank then distributes it to other
places yeah so great cause right yeah
absolutely all right i schlep out I've
got to take an hour long train there's a
Huntington Long Island yeah thnkx
Farrell that's not close it's an hour on
the train yeah just like that okay I get
there beautiful place you're looking
over the the water it's really nice to
me with voice Nana remember okay who's
lovely there's some Italian joint got
rhyme something-something primed right
okay so get there schmooze a little bit
and everyone's eating now I get up there
and I do my gig goes well and then I
said any questions guy raises his hand
immediately who's sitting at the like
the head table of where the executive
director is sitting and he says I don't
have a question I have a comment
oh oh boy okay oh no cuties of the worse
okay here we go you're like cool I
didn't ask for that but continues on for
I would say five minute rant holy
about like uh and you know I talked
about a little bit about my background
in my career and I'm from Westchester
and editor and he says I'm not really
interested in what you think is going on
in the economy oh my god that's how he
says it that's how you start how many
people are in this room let's say like
50 ok ok and ok now i'm alive i would
love to see the look on our favor so you
have to understand it's like I I'm
perimenopausal like I'm going through
menopause almost I'm always hot anyway
sure feel the beads of sweat forming on
my brow going into my back like the back
of my neck it's getting wet and I'm like
I'm wearing a nice Ascot address and
this is gonna be bad like it's gonna be
disgusting all right now he keeps going
and he starts saying you know instead of
talking about this and talking about
income inequality why don't you do
something you what you do something the
hell is it what is he talking about why
you go do you come here from Westchester
why don't you give to this organization
huh am I not doing that as I so game so
while this is happening the director
that asked you to come is at that same
table right nobody you should like I
feel it Joe so what's happening where
was your what's the look on your friends
face your queen even look at her because
I'm looking directly at this emmer effer
yeah you're looking into the eyes of
Satan himself zactly and he had had
shoulder surgery his arm was in a sling
and I was trying to think about how I
could get the other arm but though you
aim for the arm that's in a fun way the
tray yeah or maybe just like shove his
hand up his ass and then know what
happened there uncomfortable ok so he
goes on are you on a stage I'm on like a
damn in front of like a little lecture
sure ok what I'm very upset with this
person right yes ok so now I'd also by
the way I hadn't really like how to
drink or anything I was like hunger
a because I don't like to eat before I
do is speaking so now it's like they're
eight o'clock it's yeah you're like what
and I did not oh wait a second did i
mention that i woke up at three thirty
seven yesterday morning ok let's go
there so so okay that well that's par
for the course but wait so what's the
vibe in the room like our other people
are gasping no one was like huh like
there was a little bit of a gas right
I'll be like shifting uncomfortable
we're like what's my rounds I suppose
this guy yeah and then I say to him I
said oh I don't recall your name what
because I had met him earlier how's my
name service there's one guy in the
audience is like throw shade I was like
what okay I did I did lead to remember
Snape didn't remember your name Robert I
said well Robert if I may and he goes
don't interrupt me I listen to you you
don't want to me girly cow Jill yeah I
was the director I would have been
mortified and july's equation should
have tackled him hit there and then but
it was so weird because there's like
this element of theirs decorum right
sure so you don't want to actually for
me what did I really want to say obvious
like that is going in my bag my head and
then I'm like wait a minute what is
Michelle Obama say oh when you don't
know when they go you guys so how am I
gonna like rise above this just compare
of the Trump I think that's a good step
one I don't realize that I'm not gonna
convince him of anything sure there's
nothing you can I was what I did I very
high said Robert said I understand
that's how you feel and I appreciate
that you have come here tonight and
given money to this organization and i
said and i'm here on my time trying to
help this organization as well raise
anyone else have a question good write
it down and was like but but you're
supposed to you're supposed to be in and
that was it yeah w while i was rocked
you guys sure i was so your adrenaline
must have been totally like Hello it up
cuz you basically got heckled by you're
doing Santa but you got heckled
ya do ya I got heckled and bitch slap
yeah essentially yeah and then I'm like
and you know like I you don't know what
to do there so then there's a lot of
questions after and people were very
nice and so many people came up to me
after college I go I'm sure god they're
so uncomfortable he always comes here we
don't invite him buddy oh he's always
here so the executive directors like I'm
so sorry oh my god yeah I'm so sorry do
you hate me you know when someone says
that I was just like um well it's so
first of all I hate when people say it's
the worst it's the worst first thing
that happens everyone's done right okay
and they're leaving and I take like a
deep breath and then I go back to the
bar which and I say to the bartender do
not close that bar yeah I said could I
get a Macallan neat make it a double
yeah yeah damn straight I have a couple
zips need you like a new yet ok just
like truth after that certainly I would
take a need big 236 yes relax then she
comes up to me at the bar the executive
John says do you hate me what is the
right response to that well they think
here's here's a you go well yeah said
and so I didn't say anything I just
looked at her and I was like hold my
scotch oh yeah I was like well this is
helping right now yeah and then she said
you know what that guy is an ass and the
first he doesn't really speak nicely to
people and I'm thinking to myself then
why are you inviting him yeah then comes
the night you don't know how good crazy
wait what would you think was a big
donation question is a result for this
mission so they feed they fear two
thousand people so that's a big big d
organization yeah i'm gonna say 20 grand
I was losing 50 i would think 20 is a
big number for them last night he
offered to buy her a new truck for a
hundred grand and wrote and committed to
it so here's what I until you don't drop
a hundred grand like he'd lease it no no
like they're buying Hesh
yeah like I'm writing you a check Roger
Graham yeah yeah okay yeah right but
that said he is a dick and he's writing
a chapter and therefore what I am saying
to you is that I got paid in one two
three four five cookies last night and
in exchange for what my normal speaking
engagement fee is which is a little bit
higher than five foot right what's about
as a result I feel like those were not
free hey we're not for 100 person hey
came at a price they did indeed it was I
sweat equity went into these cookies dad
I mean I got home and Jackie's like
what's wrong like that and what it what
happened and then you have to sit on a
train for another hour oh thank ya there
was like a consultant it was so great
these guys who are like consultants to
the organization yeah like they do i
gotta say i would have gone you if I was
asking to do that I would've gotten your
car to and from the city was like you
know what the funny thing is yes I would
have thought that also but also but then
I was like I don't want to sit on the
l.i.e in a car anyway no I do I got a
ride back that's good then you know his
funny she's talking about the
organization and I am sort of thinking
like asha right a thousand-dollar check
like that would be a nice very nice I'm
not so sure that's the big man you those
people and like we're seeing it with
Trump like these people that like think
that all you need to do is is I mean not
the trunk actually gives the money that
he says he is but all you need to do for
a lot of these people is donate a bunch
of money and for them that instantly
makes you a good person they don't need
to do anything else in their lives to
make themselves a good person that's
what I find yet that's what I find so
conflicting is like how could this dude
who i'm sure them right off I'm sure to
write off buddy celebrated great makes a
lot of money I got a douchebag really
come on yeah I blow and there's also
people that like a hundred grand is
nothing to like John work if blue
burgundy that's right it's like a
pleasant note right 100 grand to a lot
of people's like with ten dollars which
not blink and I sure liked the fact that
he has he can donate this amount of
money that doesn't mean clearly like
there's no way he'd donate if it was
like hurting him in any way
right if he could donate this amount of
money and it doesn't hurt him and he
feels like he can talk to people like
 because of it that what gets his g
of like clearly some people just get off
on that snow he was probably yeah that's
nice a wild why oh my sorry that have
their go so okay so I get home and I am
wired sure completely yeah what times
you get home i got home at like 1030
okay i don't get to sleep till say no no
midnight okay and you know up again at
four thirty you want a tip banana tea we
got it from the sleep doctor it's been
working like a charm manatee manatee so
tell russ tell jill has make banana so
for people that i know we've talked
about a little violent show before so
you take an organic banana you cut the
two sides off but you don't take the
peel off uh-huh you put it in boiling
water for 10 minutes pour out the ball
boiling water and drink the boiling
water you can add a little honey to make
it taste a little better it puts you out
like i have never like an organic sleep
aid I've never felt like how would you
compare that to say 10 milligrams of
Valium I've never taken value oh don't i
would say it will spin it feels like i
know you love it but like it's it feels
like i took like a night call Mike don't
you Michael yeah because there's a lot
of magnesium really put see the message
by doing this you're extracting the
magnesium at a better rate than you
would from consuming it's better than I
open a that valium stuffs been making it
in while but I got to sleep it was fine
yeah do you know do you know what notice
anything else about me an aura about me
besides my red shows that you need to
yeah I don't know am I supposed to look
at something I feel bad you know if your
hair looks very nice yeah this long uh
did you not think it would not be nice
not a visual I really got upset you Sam
be like oh my god did to her hair don't
forget your boobs lifted now I died your
eyes don't look at your boobs like that
I'm not supposed to do that you won't be
do we can I don't care
it sounds like she wouldn't mind okay
but there's something else that's been
going on okay maybe you can sort of
definitely not we can't sense any now I
can't even look at it seems like a great
thing yeah it is and I have been
meditating okay so this goes back to the
power situation a little bit it all
comes a circle we got new age do
essentially ur who's like all cheat out
yeah okay I can sort of see I saw dr.
strangelets last night and that is dr.
strange I was that good not really it is
all about like Eastern philosophy and
like mysticism and stuff like that so
not that into the mysticism that let me
tell you what I'm into okay wait so
let's back this up why did this why did
this come into play what what in your
life caused you to have a meditational
epiphany because I was getting so
completely wrapped around the axle about
the election yeah i'm gonna lay I wife
too over the last couple my lacks it's
gonna be fine don't say that's mean
right into a tailspin right below your
right gonna be okay so here's what
happen i started like and and
obsessively listening to podcasts about
my wife she's making love her already so
you know 538 why is this why does
confessed but apple campus well that you
don't have friends with john dickerson
oh yeah scented yeah i'm like sending
notes i'm like i should i worry he's
like start to worry like in LA it's
great yeah fantastic so on I so Jackie
and I went away in the beginning of
October his place up in the Berkshires
and they did this thing I could guided
meditation okay so I was like I had to
do this and someone had told me about a
an app that they liked for meditation so
I had downloaded the app and I did the
guided meditation I'm like you know what
I can do this cuz I used to be like I'm
a bad meditator yeah first of all we get
to this thing and it's like it's like
you know those a New Yorker cartoons of
like the Upper West Side Jewish ladies
would be frizzy hey my therapist like
it's that woman she's a guy she's the
guide for our meditation and I said she
just have a seat it's like eight of us
in the room I'm sitting in a circle and
I said on the floor she's like no
that's uncomfortable sit in the chair
alrighty the time that I've been laying
a meditation I'm like my e knees hurt my
head start Yeah right she's like be
comfortable exactly so she takes us
through it and at the end of the things
we talked and she says you know there's
a great app if you're interested called
headspace they said that I made yeah and
I 40 hours no zero so I she goes try it
there's ten I say oh my god i just
downloaded it or I got here oh really
yeah it was like the exact same one she
just search meditation on cuz a friend
of mine had said that she wanted to just
see she had heard this guy's TED talk
and she liked her so she said you get 10
free here's a guy Andy puta home okay I
think that's a ppt home welcome to head
space I think he's your Australian okay
and head space head space as so I've
been doing that so yeah 10 free I don't
even know how much it costs like 10
bucks a month or sometimes and so I
figured I'll just do it and my
brother-in-law had been doing it and
he's like do it for a couple of months
and you won't need it anymore it's like
it'll be part of your habit I've been
waking up early in the morning before
the dogs get up before Jackie gets up
and I've been meditating 10 minutes it's
3am though for a for is any I am no one
meditates at 4am you're sleeping no well
you you would be but I am the best
meditator for it the thing that's
interesting is that people can do it at
any time sure right but there is you
have to do it in am where you know you
can do it every day yeah and the time I
know I can do it is when like after I
wake up I have a half a cup of coffee I
get my mind working but what happens for
me is because I wake up so early and
then I have to get into work I start
like kind of going off and then my whole
day gets away from her so I don't feel
like I could do it in the afternoon or
the evening or at night II this is kind
of crazy so that's what I've been doing
that's why I'd say 10 minutes of
meditations completely change you know
it hasn't completely changed my life in
fact I came home and I can i drop an
f-bomb here or not yeah i guess what's
fun I said this meditation isn't
helping
no quickly how quickly you were to just
throw it out the window and there are
limits to what meditation to do and that
guy tested it so let me ask you when
you're meditating so like I've tried
though if I tried it if you tried to try
I've tried meditation and I've been in
yoga classes certainly so I've like see
you know thanks Emily I wouldn't put you
a shut up yeah I'm very limber no you
are you not actually very now I'm very
inflexible p um but I feel like the end
goal is to clear your mind right not
necessarily oh so that was the
misconception that I operated on sure
well because I kept thinking I can't
because I describe it as like I feel
like I have a ticker tape running yeah
my header yeah right around the bottom
and it's like too much and Andy my dear
friend Andy Pete at home yes says you're
not really trying to clear your mind
you're trying to let the thoughts pass
oh yeah I've heard that too right so the
thing that I was trying to do was like
I'd be caught in a thought and then be
like oh I'm failing yeah he's like man I
just kind of bring it back to your
breath yeah that's it yeah and so that's
clears a little bit different like
almost like you're looking in the sky
the sky is there right blue beautiful
sky and cloud cloud passes yeah glad to
wait yeah the way I think of it is like
I'll have a thought if I'm trying to
clear my mind I'll have a thought and
then I'll picture like a white piece of
paper I'll crumpled up the piece of
paper internally and throw it away and
then it's gone I don't think about it
works really well that's great yeah
there's like all different ways that you
can kind of approach it yeah look I mean
whatever I've been doing it for three
weeks so right he's a pro I wouldn't say
that you levitate off the table but it's
you know it's a problem for me doing it
say after yoga we are in shavasana yoga
right and you feel so awesome yeah it's
really what you're trying to do is get
to that moment right before you fall
asleep where you're feeling like kind of
like very mellow you almost feel your
heart rate going there much more slowly
and you're like you really do feel at
peace yeah not sure so i've been using
it i don't know if you noticed i've been
using an Apple watch for the last few
weeks yeah I've I was meaning to make
fun of you okay you can feel free so the
Apple watch which has been cool actually
I've been
got to go a bit but i actually have
anyone it's yeah it's one of the newer
to this is to yeah and it has an app
called breathe on it which kind of acted
activates like once or twice a day you
can set the frequency of it and you
start it and it'll there's a little icon
on the watch and a like pulse based at
you know supposed to match it with your
breathing but it also uses the vibration
in your watch so the vibrational go tick
tick this is it like matching your
breath and then you're supposed to go to
do so you feel it on your wrist interest
to match the breathing and so I've been
doing it like on the subway sitting on
this like of the apple start and I'll
just do like a breathing exercise on the
subway and it like works and it's not
that I wouldn't normally do I understand
college me down okay look if you feel
calm yeah all right I don't think I just
don't not like my problem with all these
trackers and all this yeah like no
one has come out and been like this is
really help what people have come out
and said meditation is helpful yes and
that's essentially what I'm doing it's
just encouraging it's like some rest or
meditation so reminder to do it well I'm
not saying don't do it because you're
gonna hurt yourself I might hurt I just
stop forget to breathe I need my watch
to tell me in out you know but it's I
don't know I think that it's whatever
gets you to do it but total right so
doesn't matter and I think that what's
kind of interesting is that if you can
have that moment on the subway where
sometimes you know when you're on the
subway and you're like I hate that guy
right over there like bugging the crap
out of me and then you have like a
moment you're like you know what I'm
just gonna breathe let me just do like
I'm gonna breathe in and out I'm gonna
count to 10 I'm gonna repeat it five
times let's see how that goes yeah you
forget about that idiot yeah I should I
let that idiot kike encroach on my
thoughts one hundred percent you know
it's a way to screw people like screw
you for getting into my thoughts yeah
when you talked about meditation
focusing on the thoughts passing yeah
what does that mean well when you for me
i'll just talk about me that when they a
thought comes into your mind you can
kind of sort of perseverate on it which
is like a psychological term like it can
spin inside your head and drive you a
little nutty sure that's okay
it's called being Jewish for those of
you listening confess during your in
your mind it's not a healthy thing and
so whether it's crumpling up that paper
or it's like this thought is going in my
mind but actually don't have to sit here
and stew on it right just let him pass
through yes there is this thing uh you
know frankly when my dad was sick I did
this all the time which is like I'd
worry so much like oh my God he's gonna
die and then I was like okay like I
can't actually change that right now
he's sick he's here today let us not
talk about his death right this second
right although if you go to Facebook
gotta look at the pictures I put up
about he looks so studly in those pics
are you showing me before the show I
don't know where it went I'm kidding
back there anyway it's that thought past
so that's I've talked a lot about me and
Jeff I just maybe you breathe a little
bit no matter how I feel like it's weird
like hospital settings rehab centers
they're not this is calming of place now
it sounds like a weird ecosystem right
and whatever you can do to just like
have a moment of peace I think I've been
able to do that in the last 72 hours I
think I finally had um the ability to
calm myself down I did play hockey this
week as I would hope and there's a mixed
experience where you you you are
completely you know sedentary 440 yeah
eight days straight and then you have to
go you know zero to 60 this intense day
I reached the point in the second period
where I was like okay yeah I'm gonna
pass it yeah right are you looking
forward to coming back to work yeah
monday wasn't good yeah um I but i think
by wednesday i was in a good place yeah
i think it like at least some level of
normalcy yeah because that's the thing
like it's always it's it's gotta be
everybody considering their health right
you so um that's important and you know
i think when you concentrate on that and
you understand that you're able to do it
can we give you can't give you a few
aunt Jill tips of like navigating some
of this stuff sure are you ready for my
biggest one you know have to ply anyone
who's taking care of an
ill relative or friend with food oh no
the is like redonkulous it works there's
ya whenever unfortunately this happens
there is such an outpouring of like too
much food right and then you just like
you go into the hospital are you going
to the rehab yeah like look my friend
gave me these five cookies she had to
suffer right again each worth 20 grand
exactly reach work at an axle on a truck
but I couldn't believe how much people
appreciated this you know my dad did
when he was in the hospital this cracked
me cuz he was in ICU for so long and he
was very much aware while he was there
so every Monday night while he was there
so I guess he was there for like eight
Monday's he bought the entire nursing
staff dinner from the Second Avenue deli
and had it delivered all her that's the
move Madame believe it is equality right
yeah I guess guess who got the greatest
care oh yeah yeah like the IT guy you
are supposed to be very good friends
with your nurses oh you're in point I
learned that quickly right you almost
sometimes you got to give them the money
that's in your wallet you know what this
is crazy I am never told anybody this
but it so I feel like I can share with
you and all of our lives in holladay did
you you have a history of paying off
nurses know my thought there is a woman
who took care of my father with that she
was so wonderful to him and uh he had
been in and out of the hospital quite a
bit and it's the same hospital and he
knew a lot of the people there and she
like came into work one night and she
was like kind of weepy and he goes oh my
god what's wrong and she's like you know
what like my ex-husband's an asshole
blah blah blah and you didn't he wants
more money and my father says how much
money would make you comfortable right
now it what this is so al be like this
is crazy and she's like well you know
whatever he's like well you know could
you work over to him and then the next
day he says to me bring my checkbook
into the hospital should your dad's a
baller Wow then he wrote her a check huh
and you just made it go away wow crazy
yeah just like that
man so what did I but my dad was nice he
was nice to he was very nice to the
nursing staff wasn't so nice to us but
very nice nursing wow yeah that's that's
that's really interesting is it
physically crazy to tea was already dude
who's you just trying to get lucky yeah
god that's what I got that's where was
going on for a second ex-husband and
there's drama no no it's a bad right
that's work unfortunately that's where
my filthy disgusting brain would not I
swear that's not where it was all right
we'll just take your word for it Oh me
let's pivot a little less do a pivot you
have to do a spot or something um we
might have to do one so look let's see
if we can do a spot right here hey Russ

blocks okay well first want to talk
about the new macbook oh yeah per second
right yeah so did you hear about what's
going on i know i have a macbook all
right did you see they announced new
ones last week yeah but what like who
gives a crap didn't seem that don't care
really care but like I I truly believe
this look app apples not a company in
trouble right yeah they're they're doing
okay but I don't follow that I have a
for the first time in many years because
of sagging iphone sales they did have a
lot of day yep and how's the loss for
the quarter right yep I think this could
potentially be a turning point for their
macbook pro line would you say like bad
bad like like this is our jump the shark
moment elements I do think that touchpad
thing that I so is so novelty Sony glass
yeah their biggest thing is like look at
all the emojis you can fit on it wow
you're just really reinforcing the
notion that you are selling a
two-thousand-dollar Facebook machine and
I also say like it like the one they
show I think they should premiere my
controls but it's like if you're using
premiere on a day-to-day basis for video
editing you don't know the shortcuts to
like crop something know if you do know
that do know them really a visual
indication and that's where i'm getting
at when I was in college you had a Mac
because you were creative right yeah you
were an artist yeah and you and you
thought differently little Adam no but
like I didn't even mean to say that okay
I don't mean to play into their slogan
sure but you you couldn't do you the
program's you needed to use yeah your
enemies your inner photo shops they
worked better on and that was their
brand and I was right they want that to
other risk yeah I think this is the
first time where I'm like I don't know
if I trust that macbook pro to get me to
be able to do what i want to do raise
few issues that I think people called
out which I'd certainly agree with the
it maxes out at 16 gigs of RAM that's
not very problem that's not doing video
editing that's a big problem the port
okay so real quick this is gonna get
real nerdy but we're gonna talk about us
bc for a second you were all so do you
know the whole new USB that's coming out
okay so us bc right it's us bc yes it is
is the port and there's for them on the
new macbook pro and I'm all in favor of
you bc a USBC i think it's a great idea
i like the idea that like android phones
and apple phones hopefully God willing
they'll ditch lightning and everything
will be us bc moms would have to think
about it and you plug it in either way
you can paint an upside down whatever it
doesn't matter right that makes me so
happy just a little things but right now
because of this weird middle ground
world that we're living in it's bizarre
but you have no way to plug in your
iphone into the new macbook pro without
an adapter right and that is i think
it's a big problem for them and I think
they it's crazy I mean it's okay without
the dongle yeah because the next queen
of iphone and you can't plug it into
then you can't do it I have that tho i
have the i have just plain old macbook
all right that has USB zonda prob like
standard ones know this oh she's my
macbook the little man little one I came
out here oh so it's got nothing yes I
got it is good boy you must be seen as
one us bc which is quite the fright so I
why don't you get that so here's why I
said I'll tell you why I'm okay cuz i
schlep it everywhere others are great
yeah areas once a personnel airs really
light a fire I understand like freedom
remember on that day April what I needed
for you yeah it's like I don't know ok
button it's easy and I do schlep a lot
so I'm but that the whole dongle thing
is such a very dongle company that's
redic I think I honestly do believe that
it will change in the next year because
they're gonna release the new iphone
next year that's going to be the big
revamp and it God willing we'll have us
bc and wireless charging and all of
their devices
work together and God willing all their
devices will work with other devices not
God is going to plan this it's free
crater could make this happen all their
devices will theoretically work with
other devices they use us bc and that'll
make me very happy but in this weird
nation period where we're in between
generations it sucks and i would never
ever encourage someone right now to make
a dive on a big purchase it's pretty
much buy anything there because because
it's just like you're you're in the
middle of this territory in there
everything is a big deal there there in
the middle of a big transit is my magnet
charging yeah why did they get rid of
that well you can't have magnet charging
n do us bc i guess what they need to
figure it out I know so it's a drag I
think there's going to be I think over
the next as I said next year they're
gonna like iron a lot of the stuff out
but I agree and they tend Microsoft ate
their lunch a little bit days in
Microsoft was like oh wow we were kind
of expecting you guys to like push the
macbook pro brand forward and we've just
leapfrogged you yeah isn't that wild
though how like that company Microsoft
which seemed like such an old fart out
of vogue right sure that's really done a
much better job better better job
they've done a better job a better a
better job in and of itself or better
job relative to the fact that I think
it's relative right yeah I think its
relative to their specific situation you
have to look don't forget about how many
millions of corporations still use trim
Microsoft still use it I don't change
you guys at CBS I still does Google or
Google yeah cuz you know at CBS News we
ran out look its just oh yeah that's it
and there's no there's no chat component
they don't use slack oh hey Debs no chat
at the most so do you know the amount of
emails there now the process through the
news division crazy I'm telling you that
every goddamned Trump's speech Hillary
sink oh yeah this pull that and it goes
CND news right so my entire news
department gets everything yeah that's
not it's like I must tie into their like
the way they mark the stories of like
important it yeah oh it doesn't tie into
that
no that's kind of why I thought there
would have to be stuck with it yeah yeah
yeah I you know it's that's kind of
amazing uh but Microsoft's good they're
putting up a thing that's gonna compete
with slack they're going on with their
own thing called team good luck that's
the problem with Microsoft traditionally
and even though I agree like their
hardware announcements recently have
been very encouraging right look cool
it's very hardware and it makes me
excited as a software company they have
been such a dinosaur and I think a lot
of that culturally has to do with the
fact that Microsoft was built around
this idea of like every department
having their little say in each so all
of these pieces of software are bloated
and like heavy with all this bulk that
you don't need you have an app like
slack which just does chat it's all it's
doing yeah and it works great and
obviously that's a start up company and
they were very focused on just arresting
those slack came as a result of a failed
company moment I remember yeah that is
so cool you know yeah because basically
they were like we need we were trying to
create a game right and they and they
wanted to come with a communication
system so the engineers and the guys who
were starting the company could all talk
yeah and that was the but the byproduct
was slack yeah that's that really
amazing yeah like that's pretty standard
for for socom valley like people kind of
accidentally falling into it actually in
Silicon Valley the show they talk like
that's sort of what's the show is about
which is he's making this lame music
sharing thing right but it turned out it
was the best compression engine ever
right and that became their business so
like that's a very common thing it's
like discovering the polio vaccine
essentially its name by mistake yeah
yeah i mean i don't know i think their
hardware leaves a little bit to be
desired but i do think he's getting
better getting better yeah I also think
Windows 10 is evolving in a way that I'm
just not super excited but I do not like
it every two days it just restarts well
it's like oh I want to shut this
computer down boy you're gonna have to
update it if you want to do that yeah I
can I can shut down my mac and not have
it update that is an option I have right
it might still bug me about updates but
it won't force and I'm gonna force it I
think the forcing is like a liability
thing sucks I and it breaks it's broken
y components on my
I have to update version the original
version 10 was very I thought was very
good and whatever it's at now it's
gotten to a point where never see yo
 is uh but yeah that's all I really
want to bring up about the max situation
what about money stuff woody yeah i
don't know like i Vil I have plenty for
you after the show I got a question yeah
ok so the elections on Tuesday yes it's
big yard in case you've heard um let's
say Trump wins okay let's what are we
looking at in terms of a hit to the
economy so I feel like brexit level
beyond beyond well beyond yeah Thomas
I'm all right I you need a translation
no I know what you're saying I'm just
look I don't want to upset people who
might well but I don't care about that
we're not just with numbers yeah this is
the impression that the market has
regarding mr. Trump wins here's the deal
markets and investors there they're
betting on probabilities right and so
the probability before a week ago Yeah
right through let's say noon last Friday
was Hillary Clinton presidents yeah and
the markets could deal with it right
part of it is they kind of get her that
the big financial firms and the people
that run those firms know her because
she was the senator from New York and
they know how like she has dealt with
Wall Street and much to the chagrin of
the Bernie bros tough you know like
she really does understand that like to
be the senator from New York you have to
actually represent that industry because
it's a big one yeah okay so that news
comes out from the Justice Department be
I was very spotty and but we're from the
FBI oh yeah ridiculous and and we saw
some interesting flutters in the market
okay and so what was also interesting is
that two economists had done a really
interesting analysis of trying to say
what do we believe the markets will do
with a trump presidency it was before
the Justice before the FBI sure and so
their conclusion was that a trump
presidency would amount to a ten to
fifteen percent decline in US
British stocks the mexican peso would
get hammered their gold would go up yeah
why a couple of reasons one the most
important one is that the market does
not expect that outcome right okay
that's the biggest one yeah too there is
a concern sorry I'm one so essentially
the market doesn't expect it so people
take their money out because because of
the x factor that's going on they don't
know how to deal with it once they if
there is an unexpected outcome then
people go oh my god get me out yeah
scary yeah that's not what I thought was
gonna happen sit in my cash on the
sidelines because this could get worse
right that's what happened with brexit
except it was a smaller loss rate the
dow is down 611 points the day after
brexit three-point-two percent sure they
are saying ten to fifteen percent that
would mean as if we woke up on wednesday
morning and i got on the air and i was
like uh now we're looking at the dow
futures down 1800 points okay okay now
the other square this is that I Trump's
economic policies are how shall we say
in the vernacular claptrap like it's
just nothing there yeah so you look it
even his tax plan would add like
trillions of dollars to the deficit and
he says no it wouldn't because I would
because I'm so smart I would just make
the economy grow and I'm gonna have a
three and a half or four percent growth
rate well we're not even close to that
right now it was honestly the person
with a problem with bernie is that his
plan was in current why expecting a
level of growth that we've not seen in
decibel just impossible right okay so
growth is like if we were at like two
point eight percent gdp I'd be psyched
right now too yeah okay so if you think
you're getting two three and a half or
four you are smoking something yeah ok
Johnson I so the problem with the Trump
platform is that it's kind of scary to
economists into investors because if
you're ripping up trade deals who is
that bad for that's bad for a big
multinational company and if you have a
trump presidency and you really have no
idea what he's going to do
he could not follow through on anything
hey Zed good but we have no idea but we
have no idea and companies would not
spend money so if you look at what's
going on with brexit right now no one's
spending money in Great Britain right
now no companies are because they're
waiting to see what happens yeah yeah
and so if you're a big company
especially if you're one that does
business abroad or you're a big
import-export company you're like um I
don't know what the outcomes gonna be so
you know what I'm gonna do nothing and
that becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy
also would point out to you that even if
Hillary were to get him we are at a
point in the market cycle and a point in
this recovery and we're in like economic
growth sure we are getting a little bit
long in the tooth keyword ivory has been
going on for eighty eight months yeah
average recover Robert eat world war 2
60 months yeah so this is the robe or
little do so this is a fourth longest
expansion on record okay over the next
four years whoever gets into office
they're gonna have it it's gonna be
recession yeah there's gonna be a
recession that's the deal okay we just I
mean I'm not on that too complicated it
just like Leo stop potatoes so you did
land the length of this recovery is
mostly due the fact of how bad the
Depression was essentially i love that
you called it a depression that's so
good when they're yours I'll just
escalate yeah I think that it speaks to
that it also speaks to the type of
recession we had one of the reasons that
the recession was so bad is that it's a
particular kind of recession called a
balance sheet recession and a balance
sheet recession means it is a recession
caused by so much borrowing and lending
that a credit bubble form sure and the
credit bubble purse so that that ink
that asset is vanish Suzanne the acid
vanishes you're stuck with the liability
and you spend many many months just
getting out from under that debt ya know
we're out from under it now that I mean
part of it is because people would
bankrupt part of it because some debt
was forgiven but the reality is that at
this point in the cycle who again
whoever is the next president it's
probably going to face some tough tough
choices sure and I think the market is
so a nerve
by the erratic nature of Trump that they
don't trust it by the way I mean just
like not fond of fun but like no one in
finance that I know who is a smart
person is supporting from hmm there are
people who will vote for Trump who I
know who are voting just a based on
taxes that's it right you but you
realize like in response to that people
who like Trump would say oh the reason
that they like Hillary the finance
people is because she is easy on Finance
Bill Weber she's tight with the finance
sure I think that an end and you know
she's she actually it's funny because in
her her dealings with Wall Street she
wasn't actually so easy I sure but I
think that a lot of the Trump voters are
falling for these incredibly simplistic
mantras to get our cut just pound their
job but they're not realistic so I think
some of hers are ridiculous also but her
to hear someone say I'm gonna bring
manufacturing jobs back what does that
even mean how do you you can't help it
just like or not like let's say you did
let's say that all these companies
brought their manufacturing jobs back
these same idiots who say oh isn't that
great well your job will be actually be
done by a robot Thanks yes yeah here can
I introduce you to a concept called
universal basic income possesses we're
going for your skills yeah so do i think
that that both sides are simplistic and
it's ridiculous yeah but his are so
antithetical even if you like you're a
real conservative you're freaked out by
this right totally yeah man joins me
worried well i'll tell you how worried I
am ok ok I want to say like you've been
this worried before I've been this
worried about politics I've been a bit
worried well you know I remember the
government shutdown one of the
government shutdown scratching man got
you go in there i forget the debt all
right
right right so there was a government
shutdown I was worried I was been I was
worried about greased yeah and I was
worried during the financial crisis
right you didn't know me then but uh
just FYI I gotta love Jewish allure I
remember coming back from temple in 2008
turning the television on and my
brother-in-law and I looking at each
other and he's like holy this is so
scary we literally came back from you
skir and the dow is down 800 points and
were like what has just happened I'm
please pray to God no just then I'm so
so I I am on edge yeah okay markets are
on edge investors are on edge and it's
gonna be a rough couple of days he's
worried about politics I was actually
when I was a you know bleeding heart
liberal college student um we are pretty
worried about certain things we were
wrong but we were worried about things
like what when were you in college I
Greg twittered and I guess anyone can
probably find this out of a school
graduate in 1987 so you're in a year
than in the 80s mm-hmm um that's
actually worried about the first Gulf
War because I really experienced war
sure so but that was like late 80s Early
90s right um I was very worried when
George W Bush won the election and I was
extremely uptight about this because I
remember getting into a fight with a
Republican friend who called me an
idiotic liberal maniac oh my god yeah
and I said you I don't understand like
what you think is cuz I'm just not a
believer in supply side economics i
think it's baloney yeah so uh or is Joe
Biden would say malarkey yeah uh but I
was very concerned and when he was
reelected I was even more concerned yeah
I was so uptight about two young to care
then no it's dumb no I was too young to
die now yeah I was too young oh yeah I
was young and dumb no I so I was worried
then I'm I'm not like look uh when
people get in my face about this and
they say you know well Trump's gonna be
better for your taxes I said
I don't vote just based on bike that's
worthless and for me and if you I think
that's the one sort of focal point you
can zero in on and just sort of say to
yourself like i understand i will pay
more I'm okay with that and I think
that's I think that separates people
from like being Beatles people or
Rolling Stones in like really like I
think that you let you learn a lot about
somebody and look they're entitled to
whatever they want to do but I think at
some point it comes to a personal
decision where it's like I understood
can't operate in a rational functional
capacity right with that kind of
disparity yeah and that's what I finally
said obviously you're paying you know
okay let's say you know you're paying
less taxes but but you know socially
maybe the let's say you're in support of
gay marriage and someone you know as a
gia one of the GOP Stander's is bringing
back Defense of Marriage Act or whatever
was whatever that ridiculous platform
was so like that's what you're giving up
your you might make 10 watt hours more
on a paycheck absolutely I like I mean
it's so funny because yeah pro-choice
prove you know your neighbors these you
know sentenced to a life of humiliation
what supported reported right place
thanks very much cool that's it it's
also kind of a scary in my lifetime so
right I'm 50 years old yeah that I don't
really remit and vicious about stuff I
don't remember the electorate getting so
nasty and so vicious and you hear some
of the audio from spruce line rally oh
it's terrible it's really scary and is
Jews we should be frightened that like
there's this thing called the Albright
who are essentially like Nazis right so
like let's just call them what they are
yeah and so while I think that it was
too bad that Hillary said the basket of
deplorable there's a freakin basket of
deplorable Xin that party and no one's
calling him out like where are these
wimpy Republican guy John McCain this
guy has to insult you forever and like
the fact that he says something mean
about women or you like makes
disgusting comment about women that's
what does it for you I know yeah I is
that true justice yeah it's strange all
right yeah meditation how much is
working it's really not doing anything
I'm sorry too like that was like more
political than I think we've ever gotten
and I apologize for doing in there
because I realize it's not what the show
is about as someone that does not really
plug into parks at all because I feel
like it's exhausting and I have no
control over it as we talked about
earlier like things I have no control
over apart from my vote um yeah it's
just it has been a major point of stress
and I am so looking forward to choose
that Wednesday really you know I hope it
goes a certain way but like we've been
having it out of my mind space of like
something that's gonna believe my ears
yeah the least it'll be done yeah just
like such a weight I don't know there's
like I had to make some sort of creative
adjustment because there is look I like
I hate to be like super Jewish about
this but like I'd like to actually
always consider like the worst-case
scenario I'm trying to figure out how do
I live through that worst-case scenario
like I walk myself back from that and
you're freaking me out of jail I'm just
telling you look I I'm that the the
reason it's part of like the financial
planner in me it's like well what would
be the worst thing that happens to this
person's financial it can we get rid get
repaired yes and then I come back and
you recover value determined by you
invest and yeah and so I'm not one I'm
not gonna move to Canada I'm not gonna
move to Australia although Australia's
lovely sure is lovely but that canadian
dollars not doing so hey now i'm doing
well actually related that real quick i
realize for no better than real quick
could someone make a mint by selling
short before and and having Trump win
yeah of course but what happens is you
can sell short he doesn't and then you
right you gotta be late-ish and
obviously it's a big bet against what
the likelihood is I didn't see what the
odds were in Vegas did you see a nice
time I looked there were plus 600 for
Trump ah which is you he would still be
the underdog right he's still the
underdog and I think it's now like
turning into like a 60-40 based on the
polls yeah just FYI I don't know you
