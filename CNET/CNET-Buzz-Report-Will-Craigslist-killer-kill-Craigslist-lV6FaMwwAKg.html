buzz report the show about the tech news
that everybody's talking about this week
it's hackers the Craigslist killer and
that's pretty much it let's begin with
the gadget of the week Wednesday was
Earth Day which led to a green frenzy
that even seen it was not immune to
check out our new green show on Sina TV
but this week's gadget of the week is
designed to show you that you can go
green without having to go let's say
hippy dippy wimpy for lack of a better
phrase it's the cnet editors choice HP
Firebird 803 with voodoo DNA it's got a
gorgeous design lots of gaming firepower
despite its lack of upgradeable graphics
and its power consumption is about half
that of the competition in some cases
three times less so you can frag away on
crisis and save the earth see good for
everyone okay now for the news the one
tech story everyone really is talking
about this week the Craigslist killer
police arrested Philip Markoff and
charged him with murder armed robbery
and kidnapping in the death of a woman
who posted ads for erotic massage on
craigslist he is also implicated in two
other robberies now all that happened
right on the heels of the usual
craigslist prostitution stings and
officials are now calling on craigslist
again to work harder to police at sex
posts craigslist has had this hands-off
policy about this for years now in fact
only last year did they start
cooperating with police and requiring a
credit card and a small fee for erotic
services postings they donate that money
to charity but many analysts think that
the personals and sex posts account for
most of craigslist revenue now say what
you will about Craigslist moral duties
here what's amazing to me is that from a
business perspective craigslist would
just let craigslist become such a CD
neighborhood I for one I'm gonna go back
to buying my gray market TVs in shady
back alleys like I used to cuz
craigslist gives me the creeps okay now
on to way happier news not hackers are
going crazy this week first came reports
that hackers broke into the Pentagon's
300 billion dollar fighter jet program
and may have even hacked the air force
air traffic control system
Pentagon officials said that no critical
data was stolen about the Jets as if
they would actually tell us that all
signs by the way point to China
officials also reported that they're
looking for hackers in the Ukraine
hoping to break up a massive botnet made
up of 1.9 million infected pcs it's not
configure which has its own 3 million
pcs it's something else entirely super
and to symantec researchers say they've
uncovered the first serious Trojan horse
aimed at infecting max so you Apple
people not safe either ah frankly after
all that I found it merely amusing that
New Zealand hackers had taken down the
country's msn homepage and replaced it
with a picture of Bill Gates being hit
in the face with a pie of course the
photo probably dropped a payload on
those machines and started a whole new
botnet that's bound to destroy the world
that's great luckily most of the
internet wasn't as focused on all this
bad news as I was this week because
after all something truly newsworthy
happened Oprah got on Twitter Oh Twitter
you virus vector waiting to happen you
and that's the buzz report for this week
everyone I'm Molly wood and thank you
for watching
shut up Dave Navarro's on Twitter</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
