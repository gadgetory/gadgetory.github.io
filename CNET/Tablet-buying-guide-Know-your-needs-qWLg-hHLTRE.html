buying a new one can be a little
daunting I'm Sharon Vaknin and we're
here at Best Buy with tablet expert Eric
Franklin to make this process a whole
lot easier Eric what should we look for
in a tablet well before you get even
close to buying a tablet I say figure
out what your needs are
let's say you want to watch movies on
the train while you commute to work then
you're gonna want to tap it with a
really nice screen and access to a lot
of movies and TV shows kind of like this
have you seen this movie before I have
it check that out nice screen size for
watching a movie and it's really light
too this is the iPad air by the way so
what if I want to get work done though
if you want to get work done then you're
definitely gonna want to tablet it with
a nice comfortable keyboard and access
to a you know a nice productivity suite
like this so this one's a little heavier
but yeah yeah that's pretty cool yeah
that is cool
so I'd say know your needs ok so once we
know what our needs are what about
budget how does that play into my
purchase well budgets very important
obviously I would say the thing that
affects budget the most or affects price
the most for tablets is storage space
the more storage space you want to store
those movies and TV shows the more
you're gonna pay also I would say there
are a lot of affordable tablets out
there but they're not always the best
quality so but thankfully Amazon and
Google have found a way to release high
quality tablets at really affordable
prices well we talked about budget but
does it really matter how much you spend
is it really worth spending an extra 100
bucks on a tablet you know sometimes it
is like there a lot of tablets that are
under a hundred bucks and they look
really appealing but you know you really
get what you pay for when you go that
low ok so stay away from those sub $100
tablets now before we go I know that
some tablets have some extra tricks up
their sleeves so tell me about those
yeah a few of them do like the Samsung
tablets have an IR sensor that you can
use to use the tablet to control your
entire entertainment center
that's that kind of the biggest remote
I've ever seen but still a neat trick
definitely and then the Kindle Fire
tablets if you're a parent you want to
share your Kindle Fire with your kids
they have this kids mode that allows you
to decide what kind of access you're
gonna have on the tablet so they don't
use up your credit card and they don't
access sites that you rather not have
them access now that is a useful feature
well thank you Eric and hopefully by now
you have a better idea of what you need
in order to buy your next tablet for
