Technology why SUVs winding through the
streets of Mountain View California
yielding to pedestrians and navigating
intersections sounds ordinary but these
are Google's self-driving cars which a
handful of journalists had the chance to
test drive here on the book Google
self-driving car is a car that's been
outfitted with the latest in lidar and
other sensing technologies to drive your
car without a human behind the wheel
using that tech the vehicle detects
every car person and object in the
immediate area it's driving itself but
after about five minutes everyone's you
know well is that all it does it's just
incredibly common once you get used to
it google has been developing these
autonomous vehicles since 2009 and aims
to make them available by 2017
previously they'd been really restricted
to freeway test conditions and now they
are working in an actual city which is a
much more complex driving situation in
many ways the cars handled the streets
better than humans by avoiding other
cars blind spots and shifting slightly
in the lane to make room for cyclists
but the software in these vehicles is
far from being ready to ship in a
parking lot there are no lane lines and
many cars are reversing it's a challenge
that engineers at Google haven't solved
just yet Google is racing against other
car makers like Audi GM Ford and Volvo
to develop autonomous driving technology
in Mountain View California I'm see me
