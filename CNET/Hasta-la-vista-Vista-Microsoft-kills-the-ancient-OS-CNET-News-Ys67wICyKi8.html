finally dead Microsoft will no longer
and gave the 10 year old operating
system any security updates or fixes
there won't even be the option to pay
for extended support poor Vista was
never loved as much as Microsoft's other
children you see when the operating
system first launched in January of 2007
it was the first big update since
Windows XP and people thought it looked
pretty nifty with Windows that had this
frosted glass style transparency and
there was this Aero theme that required
a good graphics card because it was
visually complex and it was a bit
unnecessary because it left your
computer feeling slow and bloated if it
didn't have the latest and fastest
hardware
not to mention updating broke a lot of
software because it wasn't compatible
with everything so workplace IT
departments were not upgrading to the
new OS and they just skipped over Vista
and jumped to Windows 7 after a few
years there's hardly anyone still using
Vista
according to net market share only a
measly 0.7% of PCs online are using
Vista compare that to 7% that are still
on Windows XP and 50% using Windows 7
now Microsoft suggests that if you still
use Vista it's probably time for you to
buy a new computer
good advice Microsoft good advice I'm
Richard Carey and for you Vista users
that need advice on what new computer to
buy because dang it's been 10 years and
you have some catching up to do
