fast it's slow it works or it doesn't
but to the discerning connoisseur of 802
dot eleven Wireless local area networks
there's a whole alphabet of Wi-Fi
flavors you get your a/b/g/n and the
most recent addition AC AC standard is
the fastest most badass Wi-Fi on the
planet and to explain why I'm going to
use this handy table showing channel
bandwidth constellation density and
spatial streams or not instead how about
we count down this list of the best 802
dot eleven AC routers you can go out and
buy right now handpicked by C net senior
editor don't know starting off at number
five Apple Airport Extreme Base Station
I suspect Apple isn't happy at being at
the bottom of this list so let me just
say that they have the number one router
that looks like a box of Kleenex they
can chop up that soundbite however they
like $199 buys you speed and ease of use
but if you're looking for ports and
features and flexibility this is not the
router for you so how about number four
the trend net AC 1900 dual band wireless
router at $180 this is the most
affordable option on this list on top of
the AC signal you also get a second band
of wireless n there's a wealth of
connections on the back including both
USB 2 for connecting a printer and USB 3
for connecting a hard drive
unfortunately we couldn't get the router
to recognize any of the drives we
attached to it but if network storage
isn't a big deal for you this is the
best bargain out there at number three
the Linksys wrt54g features plenty of
customization options and unlike the
TRENDnet this thing kills it on network
storage attach a drive to the USB 3.0
port and you'll get the fastest
read/write speeds of any router on this
list potentially faster than a dedicated
Nass server it also has a retro router
look thing going on
I didn't know was a thing until now it's
kind of cool coming in at number two the
Netgear Nighthawk AC 1900 smart Wi-Fi
router this one answers the question
which router would Batman buy but price
of two hundred dollars you don't have to
be Bruce Wayne to buy this thing it's
fast it has all the features you'd want
it's even time capsule compatible making
it a great alternative to the base
station for Mac users the only trouble
is this thing is gigantic they designed
it to look like a stealth bomber so that
you wouldn't notice its girth but I see
you Nighthawk chunky router but for the
best fastest and arguably the prettiest
802 11 AC router on the market check out
our number one pick the soos our TAC 68
u dual band wireless AC nineteen hundred
gigabit router not the catchiest name
and arguably the advanced features here
are far beyond what most people are
looking for but if you're looking for
fast the asustor that by a significant
margin $220 puts it in the ballpark of
everything else here and my favorite
feature is totally trivial but there's a
switch on the back to turn off the
routers LEDs for some reason the router
in my home is like the brightest light
in my house I shouldn't have to put duct
tape over my router just to get some
sleep
so there you go five blazing fast
wireless routers that use the new 802
dot eleven AC standard that everything
is moving towards for more suggestions
