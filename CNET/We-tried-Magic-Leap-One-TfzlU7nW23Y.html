glowing and ghostly and especially the
particles begin to really feel like
they're they're you you can't see
everywhere but when you when it comes
into your view of things kind of slowly
drift in we're outside Fort Lauderdale
Florida and magic leaps headquarters
magic leaps technology has been a
mystery to this point but Here I am
wearing magically one magically didn't
allow us to show you what we saw through
the headset though and we're upset about
that because the reality of magic leaves
technology has already been under
scrutiny I was able to demo the headset
for over half an hour experiencing a
variety of apps games and some launch
experiences that'll be available on the
device I'll try to explain what I saw to
the best of my ability
there's definitely awareness of where my
hands are first let's look at the
headset the metrically boynes headset
kind of looks pretty steampunk and it
has circular lenses and inside have
little displays if you can make them out
that are using lightful technology that
creates those holographic projections
that I like to see the real world and
see things projected on top of it there
are speakers inside in the band which
handle 3d audio and pretty well done
actually the only thing I've tried
that's been like that has been oculus go
but this is projecting in a room while
you're still listening to everything
else that's in the room yeah the sound
is very seamless to the position of
things and it actually really helps find
where things are so I'm finding as I
move around
cues to where I need to look start
happening in audio and then I know that
maybe something's over there that I
might have missed the band is adjustable
and it angles up a bit but it actually
felt pretty comfortable to wear the
cameras that are studded all throughout
here these are mostly for spatial
tracking this has an ability to mesh up
and map the world around you to a degree
that I haven't seen in any other headset
it did a really impressive job of
tracking walls floor and furnitures in
the demo rooms that I
testing it in to be able to get that map
and then to be able to lay her 3d effect
so they can actually hide behind some
things if they wanted to or rest on top
of them now it's supposed to be able to
remember that mesh so that when you come
back there later you can still use that
space and even set apps up to work in
that space
this is corded down to a wearable pack
this is where the processor and the
battery are this has an Nvidia processor
inside the handle graphics it has a heat
vent and it's basically a wearable PC
this is the controller and if you've
used VR this is pretty familiar in terms
of the ability to have full tracking a
touchpad here a home button a trigger a
second button over here and also haptic
so this vibrates a bit when you use it
it also a six degree of freedom tracking
so it's a step up from other one
controller headsets in VR so this also
has the ability to work in combination
with things like hand gestures and
motions so magically one notices where
your hands are and a lot of apps don't
even need to use the control at all I'm
creating a vortex out of my hands that's
drifting and becoming this sparkling I
mean the best way I could describe it is
that everything is definitely around me
but you're seeing ghostly layers that
are living along alongside with you and
right now the music just disappeared
into a little black hole okay forgive
the weird descriptive beat poetry I'm
trying the sigur r√≥s musical AR app -
nandi which creates music in a sort of
undersea forest air is hard to explain
much like microsoft hololens magically
projects as 3d illusions into the real
world but has a limited field of view
magic leap wouldn't let us record what I
got to see and experience through the
headset but the company did make its own
videos for some of the apps it
represents the graphic level of what I
tried pretty well but keep in mind that
what I saw was all in 3d and the viewing
area where the field of view is far
narrower than what you see here it's
more like seeing ghosts through a small
window
I can still see my entire room but
having virtual things and only part of
my vision can disrupt the illusion I
also got to try magic lips create app
which is an art toolkit that allowed me
to paint in the air and also drop
dinosaurs and knights and other cartoon
things and have them run around the room
also this headset didn't work with my
glasses I needed contacts and anyone who
tries it will need special prescription
lenses to pop into it I wear glasses and
so they were kind enough in the demo
version that I saw today to take into
account my prescription but that will be
the same for other people who are buying
this headset when it comes out and if
you're wondering how it feels and fits
on your head I have to say it's pretty
good they spent a lot of time figuring
out the weight distribution so it slides
over your head and you pull out on the
back to adjust to your head size and you
wear it tilted up and if you've tried
other VR gear you know that it can be
very heavy in the front and pull your
head down a little bit and that's not
what happens here they actually are
gonna have two sizes of this headset
based on the distribution of how far
your eyes are set apart and they also
take into account that the bridge of
your nose which is where this is going
to sit it's different for everyone and
that addresses the comfort issue so
we'll have five different inserts that
you can choose and that will be fitted
to suit you when you get your headset
so how do we feel well it's a lot to
take in and I really wish that I had
been able to share a lot of what that
looked like with you that's the hardest
part with any of these experiences so
when you can't do that then you're left
for counting it the experiences I had I
can tell you I was shooting robots that
were sprouting from a wall kind of like
early hololens demos that I tried years
ago but this time with better graphics
the better sound and with a controller
that was able to morph into a gun it
seems like every major tech player has
aspirations for AR magiclip one might be
the most complete hardware at the moment
but it feels extremely experimental a
bit of a magic step forward not a leap</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
