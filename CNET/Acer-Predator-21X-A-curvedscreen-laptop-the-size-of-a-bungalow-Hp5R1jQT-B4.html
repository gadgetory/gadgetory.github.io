that pushes the boundaries and is
something that definitely pushes the
boundaries of what you could call a
laptop possibly also pushing the
boundaries of sense it's aces predator
21x so where to begin this is an
absolutely gigantic gaming laptop this
is a 21 inch display it's got eight 2560
by 1080 pixel resolution and it's curved
which is really unusual for a laptop but
then everything about this is reasonably
unusual now this is only a mock-up so we
can't switch this on but we know that
it's going to ultimately weigh about
eight kilograms which is a lot I mean
obviously this is really pushing the
bounds of portability though some fun
details though I like this little glass
window that lets you see the fan this
number pad over here flips over to
double as a trackpad and this plenty of
power on the inside as you probably
would expect so you're going to get dual
in video GTX 1080
graphics in SLI and seventh generation
Intel Core processors there's no price
yet but I would expect this to cost a
lot it's going to be on sale next year
so when we asked ASA the crucial
question which is why why have you done
this they talked about how they want to
push technology drive technology to the
limits and they've definitely achieved
that so I think it's a really
interesting product and I want to know
if you think you could find a use for it
that's all for now check out cnet.com
