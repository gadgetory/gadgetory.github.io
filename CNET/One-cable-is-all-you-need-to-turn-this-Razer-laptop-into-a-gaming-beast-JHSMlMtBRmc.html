laptop from Razer it's a little bit
different than what you've seen before
instead of being an ultra powerful
gaming laptop it's trying to be the best
ultra book you can buy a thin quality
machine with a USBC charging port so you
can charge it anywhere using a simple
adapter and if you want to game on it as
well you'll plug it into this box back
here the Razer core you just use this
single cable to charge it and add the
power of a discreet external graphics
card in one fell swoop you can put any
graphics card you like into this AMD or
Nvidia as long as it's fairly recent and
has some support supports a double wide
graphics card in this aluminum box you
can just pull out a handle and swap in
your own graphics card whenever you like
starting at just 999 dollars this laptop
will come with a core i7 processor eight
gigabytes of RAM at 128 gigabytes of
solid-state storage and you can trade up
to a 4k screen and up to 512 gigabytes
of storage for $600 more we're not yet
sure what the core is going to cost to
get you that external graphics but it
should arrive in the first half of the
year the Razer Blade stealth also has
the first individually RGB backlit
keyboard in a laptop which is a fancy
way of saying there's an LED under each
and every one of these keys that light
up and up to sixteen point eight million
different colors so you can have them
cycle through all kinds of patterns
we've seen some cool ripples and waves
that happen just when you tap on these
keys but I need to look at at the razor
blades don't</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
