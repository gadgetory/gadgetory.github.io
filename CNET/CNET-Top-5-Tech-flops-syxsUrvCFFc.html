time we meet we count down another hot
cnet list I'm Tom Merritt now while ago
cnet blogger Steve tobik compiled the
list of the top technology flops we must
learn from history he points out so
let's count down the top-5 tech flops at
number five head-up displays yes they
use these in airplanes but computer
monitors of all kinds were supposed to
be revolutionized by these cool looking
futuristic information delivery systems
turns out some cars have these have you
seen one with those cuz i have it coming
in to number four pen computing I
remember as early as the mid 80s the
light pen was going to rid us of
keyboards how's that pen in her face
working for you Bucky I know tablet PCs
exist but again how many of you use one
be honest up to number three information
appliances now during the late 1990s the
internet was poised to infest everything
yet throw away some garbage and then the
garbage can would tell the fridge what
to order from Webvan and then you could
use your spot watch to tell if they're
late when check scores to sliding in at
number two speech recognition forget
like pens we're supposed to be able to
just talk to everything by now I'm
granted this one is making progress so
it might unlock but for now windows
vista and telephone support aside we're
not where Star Trek thought we'd be
before we get to number one let's check
in on the back half of the list admit it
in 1985 sport in your hot new armitron
you never thought you'd hear a ticking
watch again did you all right let's get
to our number one the biggest tech flop
so far at number one it's virtual
reality a mean flop this is amazing it's
like I'm in a whole other world except
it's not plugged in and I made it myself
you know I suppose second life in World
of Warcraft or the first signs that this
technology might also unlock but that's
not really what we mean we were supposed
to put on weird visors and get lost in
the war
indistinguishable from our own it was
supposed to become a horrible social
problem that would wreck your life you
know like in strange day starting ray
Fiennes well that's it for this edition
of CNN top 5 as Steve points out in his
blog post some of these flops still have
a shot so don't give up on him yet
scientists I'm Tom Merritt see you in
the future yeah I'm already there</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
