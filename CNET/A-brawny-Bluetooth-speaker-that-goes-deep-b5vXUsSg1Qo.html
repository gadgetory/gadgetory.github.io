and today we're taking a look at
Peachtree audios deep blue this is a
high performance Bluetooth speaker
that's currently selling for $400 from
the outside it's not quite clear what
the appeal of the deep blue is it has a
generic look and neither the black
plastic cabinet or the gray speaker
grille on the front is particularly
attractive on the top there are just
three buttons which isn't quite enough
as the power button is confusingly also
used for bluetooth pairing there's also
no real display on the front except for
a single blinking light so you don't get
much visual feedback when you're
adjusting the volume or base levels
there is an included remote although
most times you'll control the deep blue
from a tablet or a smart phone picking
up the deep blue though gives you an
idea about what it's all about it weighs
over 16 pounds packing a 240 watt
amplifier and five separate drivers
including a 6.5 inch woofer those are
seriously big speakers for a system like
this although the weight means it's
really more of a one-room device rather
than something you'd want to tote from
room to room the deep blue is primarily
a Bluetooth speaker which means it can
wirelessly stream audio from nearly
every smartphone and tablet bluetooth is
also compatible with any app that you
have on your device so it's no problem
streaming from Spotify or Pandora the
only other way to get audio on the
deep-blue is an analogue mini jack port
on the back which is nice for older
devices that don't have bluetooth but
the real attraction of the deep blue is
its sound quality this thing makes some
seriously deep bass for its size thanks
to that six and a half inch woofer I
compared the deep blue to the clips KMC
three and the B&amp;amp;W z2 and neither could
come close to making the same kind of
low-end as the deep blue although the
KMC three was a respectable second the
deep blue really excelled with loud
aggressive music like Black Sabbath and
ac/dc
and it didn't hurt that it's the loudest
system of the bunch either the one
drawback is that the deep blue can of
time sound a little harsh
which you don't get with the KMC 3 or
the z2
so if you're more interested in
background tunes or long listening
sessions this may not be the best pick
for you but it's full range Sonic's make
it sound like a much bigger system than
it really is which most Bluetooth
speakers can't do and that's the main
reason to go for the deep blue it's not
gonna wow you if it's looks and it's not
the easiest to use but if you're looking
for a deceptively big sound from a small
speaker the deep blue is tough to be I'm
Matthew moscovia and this is the
