show about DIY tech and how-to I'm
Donnell Bell and I'm Sharon Vaknin this
week we're traveling with our tech to
near and far away places first starters
we'll show you how to use an app that'll
let you read a restaurant menu in a
foreign language when you're on vacation
you're probably gonna be eating out a
lot I mean that's part of the fun right
trying the local flavor some exotic new
delicacy but when you're looking at a
menu that's printed entirely in a
foreign language it can be a little
daunting
fortunately whether you're an iPhone
user or Android their apps out there
that can help you translate a menu in
seconds all right let's start with the
language that I know the least about
Chinese for that I've got an app called
Wego it's a new app only on iOS a free
version gives you ten translations per
day or you can upgrade to a $6.99
version that gives you unlimited
translations that's what I've got here
let's put it to the test
boot up way go I see a little window
here in the app I need to Center the
Chinese characters now I can use a
little zoom slider here to get the text
just right in the box I can also expand
the box by dragging on it but I'm just
gonna go with one line of text make
things easy on
and right underneath it I should see a
translation slice duck sounds good but
let's see what else is on the menu
we've got pan-fried cuttlefish and
bitter melon and freeze that one now by
hitting the pause button I'm able to see
the translation and I can actually send
this to myself via email I can hit the
share button I can send it to other
people
one option that's not here is the
ability to save it to my camera roll
that would be nice
alright so way go here's what I like
about it the dictionary is built into
the app and it doesn't have to access
the internet in order to do the
translation that's pretty critical that
means if you're in a restaurant that
doesn't have good reception you're still
gonna be able to do the translation on
the downside it's expensive it's $6.99
for the full version the text has to be
really clear in order for the
translation app to work also the
translations aren't spot-on again
something that's pretty common with a
lot of these apps but it gets you in the
ballpark next up I've got an app called
word lands now the great thing about
this app is that a work of both Android
and iOS it's free to download but you're
paying $4.99 per language pack and those
languages don't include Chinese you've
got French German Italian and Spanish
that works for you definitely worth
checking this app out let's see if it
works some magic on this Frenchman
so all I have to do with this one is
hold the camera over the text and watch
it magically translate into the language
that I want but the really cool thing
about this is that it changes the text
and replaces it so you get to see the
translation in the context of the menu
once the translation looks right I'll
hit the pause button and there you go
it's gonna hold that translation and
from there I can save it to my camera
roll and I can also email it so that's
pretty cool feature so here's the good
in the bad with word lens now the
coolest thing about word lens is that it
looks like magic we show this off to
people it's pretty amazing that it can
replace the words right in front of you
with your translation it works with
Android and iOS that's a big upside
downside is $4.99 per language is still
pretty pricey and the translations
aren't the best I don't know if it's
just the many as I was choosing but
there's some pretty hilarious
translations here that I'm sure can't be
accurate or I really don't need to eat
at this restaurant alright finally let's
talk about the best free option out
there Google Translate this is another
one that's available for both iOS and
Android but the Android version has a
big advantage over iOS which is that it
lets you translate pictures you take so
let's give it a shot
I'm going to really throw it a curveball
with a menu written entirely in Greek
let's see what it can do get it nice and
close and get a good focused shot of the
text and then take the picture
I hear something do a little scanning of
the text see if we can pick out the
letters that are in this picture all
right and now it's asked me to use my
finger to highlight the line that I want
translated there's a variety of
appetizers right here that's good
how about this one right here octopus
I'll probably stay away from that one
what about that hand meatballs
sure why not the cool thing is you can
diffuse your finger to go line by line
and figure out what you want translated
that's pretty neat
the other cool thing is when you get
back to the main screen of Google
Translate just kind of have record of
everything that recently translated for
you so I can look at the cucumber salad
the tomato soups the meatballs it's all
there and it's ready for me to reference
whenever I want so here's the good in
the bad with Google Translate good news
it's free even though the version for
iOS isn't as cool as the one for Android
that can take a picture it's free free
is free the other great thing about
Google Translate is the breadth of
languages that support so goes
everything from arabic to zulu you have
amazing language support the bad news is
that iOS users don't get that cool
camera feature he's silly an internet
connection do any of this translation is
you didn't need that with Wego and that
the translations are pretty rough but
really that same complaint can be made
with all these apps
and since we shot that way go is now out
of support for Japanese Oh super helpful
well it's time for a quick break and
when we come back we head to Barcelona
where we're gonna learn about some apps
that will help you make free
international text messages and phone
calls
welcome back remember not so long ago
when it costs a lot of money to send
international text or make phone calls
oh yeah well now you don't have to worry
about all that because there are
smartphone apps that are making it
easier and more affordable
as much as I love being in a foreign
country I'm not a fan of running up my
phone bill when I'm abroad thankfully
there are a couple apps out there that
can help make your travel experience a
bit less expensive Barbara is a free app
that lets you send free text messages
and make free phone calls that is as
long as both you and the person you're
contacting both have the app installed
and have access to either a data
connection or Wi-Fi connection there's
no complicated setup process you don't
have to set up any kind of user account
the app just pulls directly from your
phone's contact list and you're ready to
send which is really really convenient
since you're using the Internet to make
phone calls it won't eat into your voice
minutes and you can call anywhere in the
world and not be charged in the
international or long-distance fees
another app call whatsapp which was
recently bought by Facebook works in
much the same way however it's primarily
for texting and doesn't offer free calls
over Wi-Fi however the company claims it
will offer that future later this year
now what's app is really really popular
with millions of users but I personally
just enjoy using viber more sending text
and photos is fast and reliable and the
call quality is excellent so what are
you guys gonna be doing when you're here
I found the interface to be really easy
to use while offering lots of useful
features like the ability to send voice
messages and even doodles
now since Facebook just bought whatsapp
I am expecting some improvements but I
already know that they're gonna get free
Wi-Fi calls later this year but don't be
surprised if the interface improves as
well bringing it more in line to where
the fiber is today even so they're both
great free apps and our smart choices
for communicating no matter where you
are in the world all right now obviously
if you're using those apps it's good to
have a good strong Wi-Fi or 4G
connection yes and I have used them when
traveling overseas and I have to tell
you they are awesome life saver is cool
well we've all had this happen to us
we've landed in our vacation destination
and have forgotten our cell phone
charger we've got a DIY segment that's
going to show you how to keep that all
tidy make sure you take it all with when
you're traveling it can be challenging
to keep all of your tech accessories
organized and all together one solution
is to use a product like Gritti which
uses elastic bands to keep everything in
place or you can do it yourself it's
easy and affordable you'll need some
kind of hard flat material like foam
board this will be the base of your
organizer so it should be really sturdy
a ruler scissors a stapler
elastic banding you can find this at
craft stores or order it online you'll
need a few yards of that and finally for
a cleaner look you'll see why a hot glue
gun so the first thing you want to do is
cut the foam board down to the size you
want your organizer to be it can be
pocket-sized or it can be larger if you
have a lot of accessories so I'll just
cut mine to 7 inches by 10 inches which
is about the size of the large
tablet now grab your elastic band and
staple it to one side along the edge of
your foam board then turn it around and
stretch it across the board you want it
to be pre pot because remember this is
what's going to hold all of your
accessories in place then just trim it
and repeat the same process all the way
across
halfway there
so we have one side done now we're going
to go this way perpendicular but this
time we're going to thread the elastic
band through these existing bands to
create a sort of net that'll hold
everything together
and we are all done see how easy that
was now at this point your organizer can
be complete but if you want a cleaner
look there's just one final step so I've
got a piece of foamboard the exact same
size and I'm equipped with a hot glue
gun all I need to do now is apply glue
to each corner of my first film board
like that and now it looks much more
polished and clean we'll just give it
about 30 seconds to a minute to settle
the glue is dry and the organizer is
complete now let me show you how you use
it
I've got a little Ethernet to USB cable
headphones second pair of headphones
I've got my charging device and a
wireless mouse I think everything is
tidy organized and the next time you
travel you'll know exactly where
everything is and as a last touch I
picked up this pouch for about 2 bucks
usually it's meant for a tablet but it's
also the perfect size for this organizer
and you're good to go
that's it for this week's show stay
tuned for next time when we get our game
on oh yeah it can be everything from
mobile gaming to tips on how to get your
old games out of the attic and on to
your new TV and if you have any
questions or ideas in the meantime it
hit us up I'm out sharing back and I'm
at Donald we look forward to hearing
from you see you next time
