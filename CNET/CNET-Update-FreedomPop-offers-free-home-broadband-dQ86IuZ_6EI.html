internet service I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your CNET update here's news I
bet you never expected to hear there's a
company now offering free home internet
service freedompop is offering one gig
of 4G speeds for free a month you just
have to pay for the router which costs
$90 if you just used the internet for
light things such as checking email or
Facebook then this is an amazing deal
now if you stream movies you'll need
more data it'll cost $10 a month for 10
gigs or you can pay as you go for $5 a
gigabyte it uses clear wires WiMAX
network so you'll have to be in that
coverage area free Internet service can
really be a game-changer for the
industry just like how Skype changed
traditional voice calling Facebook has
updated new ways to access your privacy
settings there's no new privacy setting
you have to worry about but rather
Facebook is trying to make it easier on
you to find the current options there
are some shortcuts in the tool bar up
top you'll get reminders about who can
see your posts for example if you hide a
photo from your timeline Facebook will
give you a notice that other people can
still see the image in their news feeds
the activity log also changed and
there's a new option you can send a
request to a friend about photos you'd
like them to take down Microsoft Surface
tablet is now sold at Best Buy in
staples before this the only way to buy
the tablet was through a Microsoft
retail store or online there's been no
official word from Microsoft about how
many have bought the surface but last
month CEO Steve Ballmer said that sales
were off to a modest start but surely
having it in big-box retail stores will
help some images have been posted online
of what looks like the new BlackBerry 10
L Series phone its codename London the
images and video look pretty legit it's
got a 4.2 inch touch screen with rounded
off corners and it runs the long-awaited
blackberry 10 software research emotions
that it will release the operating
system on January 30th so maybe that's
when we'll finally get an answer to see
if this is the real deal the photo
sharing service
Flickr just got new life
with an updated iPhone app Yahoo which
owns Flickr has been putting a new focus
around mobile and this is part of that
game plan the new app shows off
individual photos better and improves
how you can browse and comment on images
Android apps are next on the list
that's your tech news update you can
