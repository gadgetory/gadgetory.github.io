gradually not hanging with them they got
the message after a while now BAM you
unfriend him on Facebook in an instance
they can't access your wall see your
embarrassing pictures or read your inane
posts you showed them I'm Brian Cooley
with top five reasons people unfriend
people on Facebook now this list is
drawn largely from research done by
University of Colorado Denver doctoral
student chris simona who surveyed 1,500
Facebook users in 2010 to find out why
they do the dirt of the 21st century
saying goodbye on Facebook number 5 it's
actually nothing you do on Facebook at
all Cibona found that 57% of unfriending
x' happen because of something which
happened in the real world how quick
number four I'm gonna toss out my own
jump ball here I think it's because of
Facebook pull back as we use Facebook
more and more I hear from a lot of
people who are using it less and less
it's because they come to the
intersection of the novelty wearing a
bit thin and they realize how much about
themselves they're exposing and in the
process of taking that back they whittle
down their friends list to well
actual friends number 3 racist or vulgar
posts this is kind of a no-brainer right
we've all got those morons in our crowd
who go there and then there you are with
their mortifying utterances on your wall
where all your enlightened friends can
see you also hang out with losers number
2 posts about politics and religion
social networks do not change one of the
great truths of human relations that is
lay off politics God and gun control if
you want the party to stay polite before
I get to our number one reason people
unfriend people on Facebook
note that unfriend is not hillbilly
English it's a real word in fact it was
word of the year in 2009 as named by the
New Oxford American Dictionary which
said it has both currency and
tensile longevity and it's just a handy
phrase okay the number one reason that
people unfriend people on Facebook is
persistent in nain posts no kidding
farmville updates alone are enough to
inspire genocide please people post
something you think the rest of us at
least might care about not another damn
golden egg for more top fives like this
