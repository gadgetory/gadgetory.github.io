begin I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update it won't be long before
Microsoft has a new leader bloomberg is
reporting that Microsoft's board of
directors are preparing to names satya
nadella as the new chief executive he's
currently in charge of Microsoft's cloud
operating system which powers products
like office 365 Bing SkyDrive Xbox Live
and skype microsoft has been on the hunt
for a new CEO since August when Steve
Ballmer announced his retirement the
perk of amazon prime may get more pricey
amazon announced that it is considering
a price increase in the u.s. to 100 or
120 dollars a year right now prime costs
eighty dollars a year this unique
subscription bundle includes free
two-day shipping as well as unlimited
streaming on the prime instant video
library which is like netflix and kindle
owners get to rent ebooks from the
kindle lending library amazon's chief
financial officer suggested that the
price of prime may need to go up in the
u.s. because shipping and fuel costs
have increased back in october amazon
raised the minimum spending requirement
to $35 for non-prime members to get free
shipping yahoo has reset the passwords
of some of its mail users after an
attempted hack to access email accounts
Yahoo sent out text messages and emails
to those that may have been affected and
it also reset passwords for anyone that
was compromised Yahoo is not saying how
many accounts were attacked consider
this a good time to freshen up any
passwords that also use the same login
as your yahoo account because when
hackers have a key even if they can't
get into yahoo they'll try to see what
other doors that password can unlock
there are 20 million songs available to
stream on demand from Spotify but 4
million of those songs apparently have
never been played not even once but
there's a new service out to change that
it's called for gotta 5 the service will
play these neglected Spotify songs and
then if a song is streamed even
it's removed from the playlist here's a
unique phone accessory we're keeping an
eye on it's called the sense cover by
moshe it brings a flip cover to the
iphone 5 and 5s and it looks very
similar to Samsung's Galaxy s4 flip
cover this lets you view the time
incoming caller ID and other
notifications it has touch sensors to
let you answer calls without opening the
cover and there's a magnetic clasp to
keep the cover folded back when you want
to leave it open the Moshi sense cover
is selling now for $45 in steel black or
brushed titanium designs that your tech
