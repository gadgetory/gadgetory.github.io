is the oz from 40 watt replacement LED
like a 40 watt incandescent it's going
to put out 450 lumens of light but it's
going to do it from a much smaller power
draw just 6 watts that's great that's
the best power draw we've seen from any
40 watt replacement that's come through
our lab and it's also very good in terms
of brightness put out closer to 500
lumens when we tested it out that makes
it much like the 60 watt version of the
bulb a very good and efficient choice
for basic home lighting setups if you
compare the two you'll see that they
look a lot of like they're about the
same size they both have a plastic bulb
there but the one small difference I
kind of like with this 40 watt is that
it has a much smaller heatsink you can
see that white neck around the bottom of
the bowl right above the screw it's a
lot smaller on the 40 watt and that
leaves more room for the bulb itself it
comes down lower and more of the bulb is
actually going to light up when you turn
it on that means you get more downward
light and proportion to all the light
that it's putting out which makes it a
good reading light however if you're
looking for a bulb to use on a dimmer
switch like one of these you're probably
going to want to go with something else
awesomes bulb dims up and down just fine
but at certain points we caught it
flickering and buzzing a little bit not
ideal if you're going to use dimmer
switches in your home for the best
dimmer performance in this category
consider Phillips's 40 watt replacement
just keep in mind it does cost an extra
four bucks per volt oz rooms 40 watt
replacement sells for eight bucks on the
shelf at Lowe's and like the 60 watt
replacement you can pay a dollar more to
get the same bulb with a 5000k color
temperature at daylight hot white that's
nice and I also liked it too comes with
a five-year warranty not quite as good
as the 10-year warranty that you'll get
with the ten-dollar cree 40 watt
replacement but still good thanks for
watching head to cnet com to check out
my full review of this bulb along with
the rest of my LED reviews for seen it
appliances I'm right Chris
