accounts guns drugs assassins if you're
going to dive into the dark web then
you'd better be ready to see some nasty
things down below the underbelly of the
Internet is a haven for criminals but
it's actually very easy for anyone to
access so how does it work and what
exactly is down there let's shed some
light on the dark web
before we visit the murky depths let's
explore the web you know and for that
we've come to the Sydney aquarium
because the Internet is kind of like the
ocean
everything that can be caught on a
search engine like Google is part of the
surface web out in the open easily
accessible to your standard web browser
but there's a vast amount of the
internet that's actually out of reach
from search engines and this is known as
the Deep Web the sites on the Deep Web
are ones that you don't find on the
average Google search things that you
need a special login or software to
access the bigger fish swimming down
here are things like your email inbox
your internet banking medical records
even really mundane things like academic
research on a university Network but go
a little deeper into the Deep Web and
you will find the dark web you can't
even get here with Chrome or Firefox
you'll need a special browser to even
see the content on the dark web the most
popular browser is tor it's a free
download and it's designed to shield the
identity of its users the sites lurking
down here don't even end in com they end
in dot onion and they can only be
accessed through special browsers liked
all be warned if you go exploring down
here you'd better watch where you step
it's not illegal to use tor but start
clicking around and you will quickly
find marketplaces like the now shuttered
Silk Road that sell really illegal stuff
and some of it can be pretty darn
disturbing the payment of choice crypto
currencies like Bitcoin which are
incredibly difficult to track while most
of the dark web is used by criminals
some people argue that it can be really
good for those trying to avoid
surveillance from governments and even
oppressive regimes in fact plenty of
people use browsers like tor just to
stay anonymous on the regular web so you
might think of the Internet as just the
surface web but a lot of what you do
online is actually in the Deep Web and
not everyone down in the dark web is a
shark but for the most part the dark web
is a haven for the worst of the worst so
be careful when you explore down below
there are be monsters</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
