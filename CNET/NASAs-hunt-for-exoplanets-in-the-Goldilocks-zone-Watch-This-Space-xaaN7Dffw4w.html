just like ours orbiting stars in a
different solar system where are they
hiding
can they support life and what exactly
can we move there because we've screwed
up this planet and I want to leave I'm
Claire Riley welcome to watch this space
from the CNET studios in Sydney this is
your weekly guide to everything on earth
you need to know about space and tonight
we're all alone in the universe
or are we well probably but maybe not
that's right we're on the hunt for
exoplanets and we're not going to stop
looking under the giant intergalactic
couch till we found all of them
exoplanets are like regular planets but
they exist outside our solar system
orbiting around their own stars they're
also called extrasolar planets cuz just
like your friend who turns up to every
birthday party in a different lurex
jumpsuit they're just a little bit extra
we've known about exoplanets for decades
and we had our first confirmed discovery
of one in 1995 since then our exoplanet
hunt has been going off like a frog in a
sock
according to NASA we've had more than
3,700 confirmed discoveries of
exoplanets in just a couple of decades
with a further 2,900 potential candidate
planets that are still unconfirmed there
could be a good match but scientists
still haven't swiped right on them yet
in total we've discovered more than
2,800 planetary systems stars that have
their own planets just hanging out
nearby just like the planets in our own
solar system they're all really
different some of them might have rings
like Saturn others could have water some
of them are massive and some are close
in size to earth and then there's
planets like HD 1 8 973 3 B where it
rains glass sideways and which wikipedia
has called a hot Jupiter with poor
prospects for extraterrestrial life
that's right the popular girl at your
Halloween party isn't the only one
trying to be a hot Jupiter this year
and speaking of HD one eight nine seven
three three B let's talk about those
names exoplanet names sound like they're
pools from the world's most boring index
card catalog or from your uncle's Star
Trek fanfic yeah I'm looking at you
dragger so why the weird names well
because if we left it to an Internet
the public would probably try to name
them all Pluto mcpoot o face or mr.
starry pants so the International
Astronomical Union has created a naming
convention to help sort those thousands
of exoplanets out some are named after
their style like 51 pegasi B or the
astronomer that catalogs them like
Gliese 581 named after German astronomer
William Gleason and then there are those
named after the instrument that found
them like noted super earth Kepler 440 B
what's that you've heard of Kepler I
thought you might say that that brings
us to this week's edition of Kepler I
hardly knew it over to you Claire that's
right Claire Kepler is something of a
superstar in the exoplanet hunting game
launched in 2009 and named after 17th
century astronomy bad boy
Johann Kepler the spacecraft's mission
is to find what NASA calls earth analogs
planets similar to our own orbiting a
star like our Sun since blasting off
almost a decade ago Kepler has found
more than 2600 exoplanets and almost
3000 exoplanet candidates so how does it
find them well it looks for dips in a
star's brightness that kind of dimming
could indicate that a planet is passing
between Kepler and the star and that
could be a sign of an orbiting exoplanet
Kepler is equipped with a ninety five
megapixel camera array that's the
largest camera ever launched into space
according to NASA and it's telescope is
so powerful that even from space it
could detect a single porch light
turning off at night back to you in the
studio Claire thanks Claire I think I'll
be leaving my porch lights on tonight
there have been a whole raft of
instruments that have helped us find
exoplanets from telescopes here on earth
to the Hubble telescope and even the new
transiting exoplanet survey satellite or
Tess Tess only began science operations
in July 2018 but Kepler has been in
action for years and it's big focus has
been on finding earth-like planets in
the so-called habitable zone this is the
orbital distance around a star where the
conditions and temperatures are just
right for life it's also known as the
Goldilocks zone the Goldilocks zone is
far enough from the Sun so it's not true
hard but close enough so it's not true
cold the temperature has to be just
right for liquid water to exist on the
surface of the planet and not turn into
terrifying sideways glass rain cut to
b-roll it took about a billion years for
life to appear after earth was formed so
these exoplanets can't be little baby
things that means Goldilocks is gonna
have to grow up a bit before she'll be
able to grow any microscopic bacteria or
algal slims
one day Goldilocks one day either way
Kepler could be the key to finding our
planets long-lost cousin our earth from
another birth if you will but Kepler
might not be around for long the
spacecraft was originally slated to run
out of fuel in 2018 and NASA doesn't
know how much it has left it's been in
and out of hibernation going into sleep
mode to conserve fuel so it can use its
last remaining energy to send that
crucial observational data when Kepler
does die and slip off into the great
beyond our search for exoplanets won't
be over we'll still have tests to help
us find weird and wonderful new worlds
all right that's it for this week's
episode of watch this space if you've
enjoyed the show then be sure to click
the like button on your remote and
subscribe for more space news as it
happens I'm Claire i'li for Senate
goodnight and Godspeed what's wrong with
my voice oh bad kind of dimming nobody
likes me because I'm so far away from
the Sun don't come near us cold planet
this week's edition of Kepler get one up
here nine to five and now for some
science I prepared earlier so Dan you
stick on some little cardboard buttons
and a nice hat and I I went to
university for this</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
