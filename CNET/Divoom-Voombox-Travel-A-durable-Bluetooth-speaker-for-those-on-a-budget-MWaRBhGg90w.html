recognized a wireless bluetooth speaker
that as its name implies is designed to
be easily transportable along with being
shock resistant it's also splash proof
and relatively inexpensive at $49.99 hi
I'm David Connolly and as we head into
the warmer months I'm looking at a bunch
of water-resistant Bluetooth speakers
and the boombox travel seems to be one
of the more durable budget models and
sounds decent for its size and price
this rechargeable battery is ready to
deliver six hours of music listening it
has a built-in speakerphone along with
bluetooth 4.0 which makes it easy to
pair with any Bluetooth enabled device
including smartphones tablets and
laptops and included micro USB charging
cable doubles as an audio input cable
for non bluetooth devices first thing
you'll notice about the speaker is that
it's heavier than it looks and feels
very solid the speaker's available in a
few different trim colors that comes
with this carabiner attached to a pin at
the top which gives it a bit of a
grenade like appearance you can keep the
speaker suspended from that carabiner
but the base perks up when you rest the
speaker on a flat surface the speaker
has two drivers facing opposite
directions and the sound significantly
improves when you have the bottom driver
reflects sound off a surface the speaker
plays loud for its small size and has
more bass than a lot of tiny speakers
out there the sound isn't without its
flaws however and if you do crank the
volume with bass heavy tunes like the
Black Keys fever speaker can end up
vibrating and moving around a bit on
smoother surfaces you'll also get some
distortion that said in terms of sound
you're not going to do too much better
with the speaker this size especially at
this price point more expensive
water-resistant competitors like the
Bravin be our v1 and UE boom offer
better sound but the boom box travel is
small enough to fit in a pocket and
there's something to be said for that
I'm David Carr Noy and that's the boom
boom box travel thanks for watching
