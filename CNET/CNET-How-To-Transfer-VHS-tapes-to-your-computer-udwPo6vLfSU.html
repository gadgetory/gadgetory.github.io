box or two of old VHS tapes gathering
dust in your closet this how-to I'm
going to show you how to archive those
videos onto your computer here's what
you'll need you'll need a VCR with an
audio and video output on the back video
is that yellow connection for audio
you'll see either a white connector for
mono or white and red for stereo a lot
of Cheaper VCRs only have mono but if
we're talking about home movies here it
really shouldn't be a big deal speaking
of which you'll need a VHS tape to
record from and let me be clear that
we're talking about transferring home
videos and not copyrighted content like
movies or TV shows it's against the law
and it really doesn't make any sense
you can probably pick up the DVD use for
a few bucks at this point so don't break
the law or waste your time you also need
a computer it doesn't matter if it's a
Mac or PC just make sure you have some
room on your hard drive an our video
takes up about 750 megabytes of storage
if you want to grab an external hard
drive to offload this stuff it might be
a good idea finally the most critical
component that you're going to need is
an adapter that will connect between
your computer and the VCR this one here
is the elgato video capture runs about
$80 and I chose it because it's both Mac
and PC compatible you just connect these
bits right here to your VCR and you
connect the other end to your computer
install the software and you're ready to
go
the software will walk you through the
process you can name the file you'll
make sure you're connected seeing a
picture and hearing audio and when
you're all set you hit the big red
button to start recording then hit play
on your VCR you're now recording in real
time so if you've got an hour long dance
recital or your garage bands first gig
you'll have to wade through the whole
thing to play through when you're all
done hit the same button to stop
recording and you'll get a chance to
trim off any of the unwanted parts from
the beginning or the end on the last
step you'll see a file path to the
location of the file you just created
along with some extra options for
watching uploading or further editing
that video chances are you're going to
be going through a bunch of these back
to back so hit the again button to start
the process all over with a new tape
that's really all there is to it if
you're feeling fancy you can burn these
files to a DVD or load them onto your
iPad but the main point is that you've
rescued these home movies from a dead
format so that a whole new generation
can be tortured with them check out my
Facebook page for more tips like these

twitter you can find me there too and
