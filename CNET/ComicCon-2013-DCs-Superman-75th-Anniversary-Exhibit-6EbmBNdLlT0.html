comic-con 2013 we're here inside DC
entertainments booth and what a great
way to celebrate comic-con 2013 with the
75th anniversary of Superman we have a
variety of costumes all from the movie
series and the TV series so we're gonna
check it out and talk to some of the
people behind the scenes that made this
all happen now we're surrounded by a lot
of these amazing set pieces from the
Superman films yes um you know Chris
Reeves our original costume is here
right behind us well out of all the
movies kind of which one is your
favorite everyone probably gonna ask you
guys question well I I like this movie a
lot this is my favorite costume just
because Christopher Reeves that is the
one who really put Superman's classic
yeah you know between Ken and actor play
bumbling and Clark Kent yeah this guy
was really funny and he was really
really Superman but I've got to admit
that Man of Steel I think has an
emotional resonance resonance of all the
Superman films that they didn't have now
we have just a lot of these amazing
costumes around us from the Superman
series have you have you tried have you
tried it Rica villas on well you know
what fit I'm actually trying to sneak in
tonight so she don't give it away guys
but uh actually you know I don't think
so I think this was built for him and I
ain't certainly built like him but out
of all these which one kind of stands
out to you the most whether it's
stylistically or if anyone resonates
with you more well you know you know I
have a special spot in my heart for this
one because the fact that it's matching
from the new 52 look that we're doing
right now so I feel like we're really in
sync with what's going on with the
film's with the new looks and styles of
the character but I have to say as I'm
going through the Christopher Reeve
one's pop out of me you can't help it
and I like the dark the dark of Superman
3 Christopher Reeve cast him because it
was just a fun moment in the in Superman
3 when he was playing himself as against
himself as a evil version of Superman
and then you know we were talking about
before but the Smallville Blair costume
it's kind of cool yeah I have to say
that something really neat about that
and I think it was incredibly clever the
way they did that show because one of
the conceits of it was they didn't they
were never going to see him in costume
so the way they created the costume we
captured all the iconography the costume
without actually doing it I think was
wonderful now we have all these great
Superman costumes that we you know you
have to preserve my question for you is
what is the best method
to wash these costumes every talk about
dry cleaning you know to throw it in the
washing machine throw in the washing
machine you don't touch the costume
that's gonna smell like Christopher
Reeves I just got right up into it all
right guys we got to check out some
amazing things here if you here at
comic-con this is one of the places you
have to be for cnet.com i'm brian tong
