the market but not so many short that's
fashion-forward out there
this is tire it's designed to look like
jewelry to fit in with your existing
collection or to be worn on its own so
it is a wearable it has all the sort of
features that you'd be used to including
the step tracking as well as a bunch of
different notifications tire is like
most other wearables in that it can
track step data and also give you
notifications but there is a
mother-of-pearl right here at the top
that changes color depending on the sort
of notifications social keeping me up
you can change the color depending on
whether it's say for example your
babysitter your parents or any other
important numbers so it can flash a
certain color like red or for less
important contacts you can then change
it to another color such as a green or
blue depending on what you like to see
in terms of notifications you can then
set the vibration pattern and intensity
again depending on the type of
notification that you get from so if
it's a calendar invite you can set it to
just two vibrations or if it's a phone
call you can make it vibrate and before
continue
there are a couple of different options
that tire will be available in they all
have leather straps there's also a
gold-plated version and a sterling
silver version available at different
price points the tire starts from 239 US
dollars available for pre-order now or
from spring 2015 it will be in a full
release Lexus Avedis is my name from CES
