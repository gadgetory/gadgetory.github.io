three words reduce reuse and recycle I'm
Bridget Carey this is your CNET update
just when you thought all the hot new
phones and tablets were getting larger
and larger Apple just revealed the new
line of mobile devices for people who
would like things smaller for starters
there's a new iPhone se it has a four
inch screen and aside from the new
colors it's the basic outside design as
the older iPhone 5s but internally it
got an upgrade on parts with processors
that are as powerful as the latest
iPhone 6s model it also has other perks
of the new models including a
fingerprint scanner Apple pay and being
able to summon Syria without touching
the phone the price is even fifty
dollars less than what Apple was
charging for the older 5s the new se
starts at $400 for 16 gigs of storage
which is not much storage pre-orders
begin Thursday March 24th and it'll
arrive a week later on March 31st so why
supe up a smaller model because the
smaller 5s was still very popular not
every customer wants a larger screen or
wants to spend the money on the latest
model when this may be their first
iPhone Apple's also pushing out new
software the iOS 9.3 update is now
rolling out the most notable feature is
night shift it's supposed to help you
sleep better research says looking at
blue light on screens makes it harder to
sleep at night so when the Sun Goes Down
the color on the screen is gonna
automatically change to warmer tones
there's no new Apple watch but Apple is
releasing some new Apple watch bands and
lowering the price to $300 and let's not
forget about the iPad last year Apple
introduced the iPad pro with a focus on
business customers but if 13 inches was
too much for you the new iPad pro
display is smaller at the classic nine
point seven inch size it has a feature
that's not in any other device true tone
display it senses the light in the room
that you're in and it makes the white
background look like it belongs with
your room's lighting Apple also created
several adapters to make it easier for
consumers to see this as a laptop
replacement and Apple is targeting PC
users to update to this you see there
was this awkward at a touch moment in
the presentation where Apple exec
it's shook their heads and laughed at
the sad statistic that there are 600
million pcs in use today that are over
five years old
yeah those rich white privileged
executives just couldn't understand how
people could live with such old devices
so clearly they must need this new iPad
pro which comes in an assortment of
metallic colors and starts at $600
pre-orders begin Thursday but to give
Apple credit the company isn't just
recycling ideas it's also actually
starting a recycling program customers
can recycle devices at Apple stores or
get a prepaid mailing label online to
send in their devices that's your quick
summary but you can get more details at
cnet.com from our studios in New York
