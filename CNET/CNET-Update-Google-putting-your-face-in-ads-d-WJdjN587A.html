Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update google is following the footsteps
of Facebook and is taking Google+
reviews Plus Ones and other endorsements
and using them in display advertisements
google updated its terms of service to
specify that your google+ profile name
and photo may appear in ads on the site
but you can opt out so if you gave a
good rating to a restaurant a product or
business Google may put your review and
face with the ad marketers just love
throwing your face and name in an ad
because as consumers we listen to the
opinions of people we know you can learn
more about this or opt out by going to
Google+ settings and look for shared
endorsements people are also getting
worked up about a privacy change
facebook recently made there was a
setting that prevented people from
finding you if they typed in your name
in the search box Facebook removed it
for most users but for those that had
the no search setting turned on Facebook
will be removing it that means if you're
on Facebook anyone can find you Facebook
is sending out reminders about the
change in the coming weeks it's a little
confusing but just keep in mind to go
through your settings and review what
info is public and what is seen by
friends only in other tech annoyances it

associated with a Windows crash is now
occurring on the new iphone 5s some
iphone owners are writing on apple
