mdr-1a a $300 over year headphone it's
the successor to the mdr-1r which we
liked a lot when we reviewed it a few
years ago that earlier model was known
for being extremely comfortable and the
very similar-looking one a is equally
comfortable if not slightly more so with
slightly different shaped ear cups it's
lightweight for an over your headphone
and the ear pads are very soft the
headphones fit snugly but not too snugly
and should fit a variety of head size as
well in terms of accessories you get two
standard length 1.2 meter cables one of
which has an inline remote and
microphone it's geared towards Android
phones but also works with iPhones a
decent carrying pouch is also included
and sony also sells three optional
higher-end cables for this headphone if
you want to try to eke out even better
sound as far as performance goes the
mdr-1a just sounds right the balance of
bass mid-range and treble is as smooth
as can be the stereo sound stage is
spacious and dynamic range is well
dynamic what we're saying here is that
the mdr-1a is for audiophiles who want
to hear the sound as accurately as
possible so there's no jacked up base or
zippy treble the mdr-1a just tells it
like it is compared to the older mdr-1r
this model sounded clear from the bass
all the way through the trouble vocals
and guitars are brought into sharper
focus over the mdr-1a the differences
aren't huge but they're there
the audio technica ath mr s7 offers even
better clarity but there is a downside
to that if you do have well recorded
music it will come in handy but if you
are listening to pop rock or any other
mainstream music the MDR softer
presentation takes the edge off harsher
recordings which is a good thing which
of these so-called premium over ear
headphones you like better really comes
down to taste we like this sony MDR 1a a
lot and it's well worth considering if
you're looking for a full size headphone
in the 250 to $300 price range
