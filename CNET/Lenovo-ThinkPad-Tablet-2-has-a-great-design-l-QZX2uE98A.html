a look at the Lenovo ThinkPad tablet 2
now this looks like a lot of the other
Windows 8 tablets that we've seen so far
this falls into one of the two main
categories and that is the Intel Atom
tablet the other main thread being the
Intel Core i5 tablet things like the
Microsoft Surface and the Samsung ativ
in the atom side you've got things like
the ThinkPad tablet - you've got the
Acer W 510 you've got the down latitude
10 they're all pretty much the same
they've got an Intel Atom processor
which is sort of an outgrowth of what we
used to see years ago in that boasts a
very low-power processor along with a 64
gig solid state hard drive and 2 gigs of
RAM now that smaller hard drive size
doesn't give you a heck of a lot of
storage space especially after the full
windows 8 install but I think this still
has a big advantage over let's say
Windows RT tablets and that it's
basically got the full version of
Windows 8 on it in a touchscreen that is
very responsive especially in the
Windows 8 UI even though it's on that
atom tablet and as we've seen in some
other atom tablets some apps that are
optimized for the atom experience on
Windows 8 like IE and Netflix really do
work very well on here you don't to
worry about to start a regular slowdown
or some other apps like Chrome or maybe
not quite as optimized yet hopefully
they will be soon now I really like the
design of the ThinkPad tablet - a lot
more so than a lot of the other Windows
8 tablets we've seen it's probably
second only for the Microsoft Surface I
think in terms of overall design I like
that the tablet itself is is very is
very thin it's very light it's got a
nice square it off design they work an
active digitizer right here into the
corner and you can use that on the
screen and they just slide right into
the slot right here and I love this
little keyboard base that's a 100 and I
think a $30 option and it just sits
right in there connects via bluetooth
but you get a variation on that really
excellent ThinkPad keyboard that's
really tough too tough to top and you
can get a nice little leather sleeve
that the whole thing fits into it's like
another 30 bucks now that brings us to
the negative part about all these atom
tablets but this one in particular there
a lot more expensive than you would
expect an atom product to be and really
not that much less expensive than a full
core i5 version of something similar or
a touchscreen Core i5 ultrabook this guy
start to add six hundred and seventy
dollars for that you just get the tablet
once you add the 113 hour keyboard stand
and the $30 case you're looking at about
a little under 850 dollars for the
entire package it's a very nice package
but if you had 850 dollars in your
pocket there are a lot of really great
touchscreen full core i5 Ultrabook style
laptops you can get and maybe if you
invest just a little bit more then
you're looking at a core i5 tablet or
maybe even something like a MacBook Air
