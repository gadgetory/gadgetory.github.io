I'm taking a look at the netatmo welcome
this is a Wi-Fi connected camera that
can recognize your face this thing knows
me it also moves my face from the away
section to the home section and it does
that with any profile you've created so
your spouse your children friends family
you can create profiles for them all and
in theory netatmo is going to recognize
them and keep track about whether they
are home or away the way parts may be a
little bit more foggy it knows your home
because it sees you it knows your way
because it doesn't see you you can send
how long before it thinks you're gone
the default for hours in addition to
facial recognition then that atmo has a
fine list of specs 1080p video
resolution it comes with an 8 gigabyte
SD card for local storage it has a
hundred and thirty degree field of view
and night vision it's gonna take the
camera a little while to get to know you
and while it does if it doesn't know
it's gonna say that it's not gonna guess
wrong and I actually appreciate that I'd
rather go in and say hey no that's my
daughter as opposed to oh you thought
this stranger was my daughter and there
was a problem and you didn't let me know
about it
so it takes the slow careful approach
when it comes to figuring out faces
which I really like the problem is it
takes that slow approach when it comes
to everything including alerts the live
feeds about ten seconds behind and with
the motion alerts by the time I got the
push notification whatever triggered
them headlong ended there are also a
little unreliable and the welcome can be
kind of slow to pick up faces so if
you're pointing this camera at your
front door like you're supposed to if
someone's just walking in the door and
going about their business it might not
recognize it's a person so look this is
a pretty good camera with great ideas
that are almost there
it has me charmed but it falls short in
a few pretty important ways
so for $200 if you're looking for a
security camera piper NV is a better
option if you're looking for a webcam
the nest cam is a better option for more
