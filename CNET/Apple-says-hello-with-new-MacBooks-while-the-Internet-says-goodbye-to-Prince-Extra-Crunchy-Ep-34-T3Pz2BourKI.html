francisco california is the apple byte
extra crunchy podcast with your host
Bryan Tom oh yeah you just amped up
everyone that's listen to this on the
audio podcast their ears was like whoa
yeah yeah let's listen to the show let's
get in here what's up everybody welcome
to the apple byte extra crunchy extra
money it's episode 34 we're doing this
here on this Thursday and right off the
top we first want to acknowledge and
just one of the great musicians of all
time and I when I use the word musician
I think that's an understatement but a
prince oh yeah he's rest in peace I mean
he's he's even more than an artist right
here next level passed away and like it
was just I felt sad I'm still feeling
sad about her sad I've got emotional
about it for a minute you know he's like
part of our childhood Oh without a doubt
and for me I was able to see him in
concert I think three or four years ago
then I have always told everyone the
best concert i've ever been to the
improvisation ons akala t his the flow
it was it was amazing and so we wanted
to take a moment to acknowledge a prince
just at the at the top of the show
because we should and if you don't for
all the you youngins that have no idea
who Prince is or was and will be he's
he's a legend he's led to rarified air
so shout-out to our boy Prince out there
real quick though can i play my favorite
prints on i want to oh yeah I should
have told you what I'm Andhra Julia was
here let's get mine what's here oh yeah
1989 bat dance haha this is during the
parade uh when they play this music
during the street parade right no this
is from the Batman soundtrack that's
what I'm saying right yeah right oh I
don't know if it's during the parade
when the Joker's like just throwing cash
all around it could be it could be I
forget I haven't seen the movie in so
long but I watched this video like three
times today I was like whoa it sounds so
good
here there you go good i'm just gonna
fast forward a little bit yeah you gotta
get ya yeah this is this is this is the
street pray that goes on it has like the
toxic fumes and the in the floats and
everything oh that's right that's right
and he's like you know um so cool I dig
it you get all the stuff all the music
itself so anyways we just want to salute
him and you know just also as a side
note just from a standpoint of we're
here for a tech show people like hey are
you guys gonna talk about tech yeah
we're going to talk about tech but just
from the whole standpoint of digital
distribution iTunes using music freely
for parody incorporated into just this
mish mash up remix world that the
Internet has become Prince wasn't all
about that oh man actually I searched
far and wide to find those two video
clips they're gonna be taken down like
in the Davao I bet I bet cuz it was
really hard to find him and uh you know
a lot of his music is on itunes but I
think that's because of his you know
negotiations with the record deals I
mean it's not necessarily him putting
him on there on the iTunes but the
record companies put him there obviously
and I don't think he was fan of that no
and and also even just there was the
dancing baby video that everyone talked
about that was taken down because which
which song which song was you do
remember was that foot to use a print
song used a prince song that was from
like Ally McBeal yeah yes like that then
it was put it on the internet and other
people were playing with it and they
took it down yeah he was not a fan of
the internet and even like just a couple
months ago November actually last year
he's he said no one's ever made any
money on the internet show me a musician
he's made some money on the internet
he's like and then he said something
like apples doing well though you know
usually he recognizes that's why we're
here about the apple pie and then one
last note i do remember i think it might
have been as as recent as three or four
years ago but he actually released a
physical copy of his album and it was
either put in a magazine or or like a
publication of a newspaper but he made
his CD available that way like he was
still like no so let's go he is old
school yeah so uh recipes Prince recipes
Purple Rain
just a just legendary so that's the news
that happened just today and you'll be
hearing a lot more about it just through
just the new cycle but we're here all
about the apple byte extra crunchy we're
going to transition over to the macbook
Apple dropped it on us an all new
macbook this week this is the revamp or
the update of the macbook 12-inch the
ultra-thin with a USBC port on it apple
just put it on us just like hey here's
it here it is it features skylake
processors which we have anticipated
performance gains anywhere from around
fifteen to eighteen percent performance
gains from a speed standpoint what was
really cool is with the solid state
drive in there they say that right disk
write speeds have bumped up around
eighty to ninety percent that's good so
it's gonna be a lot faster machine in
that way it has a 41.4 watt hour battery
translate that to real life use you're
getting about 10 hour battery life which
is one hour longer than the previous
version some drawbacks though show that
it still has a 480p FaceTime camera so
it's nachi afford a DP FaceTime camera
it's like that how is that that's like a
four years ago okay that's like four or
five years ago and it doesn't have any
other ports which we don't expect some
people complain it doesn't have
Thunderbolt 3 or anything like that but
I'm not really concerned about that
because that laptop was always made to
just have one port and a whole lot of
dongles so can we lobby to get those
here in the office because we transfer a
lot of video files and if we can get
some sped up video file transfer speeds
going they'll be awesome just just wait
because WWDC is a is coming soon and I
know if the fact that they just released
or not leaked but release this macbook
out now and they didn't wait till WWDC
tells me that it's going to really be
all about the macbook pros and we're
going to see some sort of renewed
renewed design because otherwise they
just they could have just thrown that in
there but there's gonna be a lot of
focus on those pros I got I got I've got
to imagine that's what we're going to
see so check them out they start at 12
99 but in a killer deal if you want a
refurbished entry level 12 inch macbook
from the previous generation you can get
that for 9 29
but those go pretty fast once a new
product comes out so I'm just throwing
it out there because if i'll use web
surf bra email tweet do some YouTube
video you honestly don't really need the
latest and greatest you just know this
and you want this super slim form factor
this might work out quite nicely for you
watching these the commercial here just
um it's kind of like the video from the
12-inch yet it's like they're showing
off the display and everything like that
it is not the thinnest laptop on the
market that's that title still goes the
recently announced to HP spectre ah so
but is the one of the only rose gold
laptops on the market okay I I got
issues with this whole rose gold
phenomena because like everyone is
making it like it's a big deal that rose
gold is a thing now samsung samsung
recently said oh hey you can get our
phones and rose gold apples like we're
roseville and they look pink let's be
real they do it just looks pink yeah
it's metal it's metallic pink but they
make it like it's this crazy feature
like come on I have yet to see a rose
gold laptop out of the market if once I
do I'm gonna guarantee that i probably
won't see one in the next two months if
I see one before then and that's not if
you guys send me pictures on Twitter
something that doesn't count I'm talking
about one in the wild other than an
apple store it has to be in someone's
hands working out like a cafe or
something just an update we talked about
WWDC the official dates will be june the
13th through the 17th that came from
Siri pretty much people started asking
Siri when his WWDC it was announced on
Cirie before Apple officially confirmed
it WWDC will be coming there will be the
same kind of ticket lottery process for
you guys to go through its 1599 that's
not fifteen dollars and ninety-nine
cents that is 1599 dollars for your WWDC
tickets but that lottery will be
happening as well so you can expect to
go through that process the other thing
that I do expect us to see here is a we
kind of talked about it but Mako's
Mako's marcos will also appear at WWDC
cool can we try that real quick with
Siri yeah just ask just can you
hold your phone up to your mic Siri win
is WWDC happening you gonna turn your
volume on your face she's thinking for a
long time here the internet is horrible
in this room like looks like KITT from
Knight Rider right now no there you go
DC will be held jun 13 3 jun 17th in san
francisco i can't wait she can't wait
she can't she can't wait neither can I
neither can a lot of people because
they're hoping apple does something like
really cool like they need something
really bad this article coming out from
Fast Company kind of reinforces some of
the things that we've known but gives us
a few more details about Apple secretly
pursuing a real hard push into original
television programming content where is
this kind of the bread crumbs we've
heard about them approaching people like
Bill Simmons even the top gear crew
which reportedly we don't know if this
actually did happen or not has never
really been confirmed those requests
were denied Apple is said to be seeking
deals with triple a list talent to
create a full roster shows they're
really trying to put it themselves on
par with Netflix and Amazon Apple's aim
is to run several major shows at once
kind of like this whole huge rollout
launch my main thing is that Apple could
have done this years ago again they're
behind in this whole content race look a
lot of amazing shows are now have kind
of settled themselves specifically on
the netflix which Stephen still doesn't
use don't have it oh yeah Usher
seriously all the good stuff on netflix
definitely like destination television
it is it is it is and it's on demand
destination right how can you beat that
uh netflix invested over six billion
dollars just on content alone this year
6 billion 6 billion that is streaming
content as well as original programming
Apple is going to have a lot to catch up
in that respect as well so we'll see how
this all shakes out they said at
Sundance Film Festival last year towards
the end of last year very recently
basically Apple had an iTunes lounge at
hosted private invitation only events
with filmmakers producers in talent
their teams have also been traveling to
LA a lot because they're really trying
to secure and get these original
programming ideas yeah right now all we
know programming wise is that they're
to do a dr dre kind of bio series yes
that's supposed to be her AC and
reportedly had like some crazy orgy in
it and then there was like some
documentary about apps like an app show
yes without like app developer thing
yeah just watch Silicon Valley that's
all you gotta watch yeah watch Silicon
Valley that's where it's at you don't
you don't need any of that so we'll see
how that all shakes out but that's what
Apple is doing in your latest iPhone
rumor of the week ming-chi kuo is now
stating that the rumored AMOLED screen
based iphone that is expected to come
around sometime in 2017 will also turn
back the clock and bring us an all-glass
body ah like the ultimate shatter body
yes let's just break on let's just break
every iPhone we see light if you guys
have seen the Samsung Galaxy s7 went to
an all glass body and I think at least
two people I know dropped in the first
week in a Saturday oh my gosh and that
was an iphone what4s thing that was yeah
i was born 4s thing very glass uh they
still held up but i don't know that i
don't know if this is the right
direction to go per se maybe they can
come up with some all new form factor
that'll convince us that it's really
worth it but we will have to wait and
another iphone update Apple has ceded
the second iOS 9.3 point2 beta to
developers why is this important well it
looks like they have restored the night
shift ability in low-power mode yeah in
this version of the bay today because on
the show yeah the sources a show they
hear what what we'd really want so they
fixed it we are the people we represent
your voices here we don't represent
Apple we represent your voices so
allegedly that is in the developer build
we hope to see that in the final bill
this is 9.3 iOS 9.3 point2 beta
developer some app exact was like in bed
going off this is annoying like the same
thing I'm doing like going the battery
life turning on low power mode then go
back then turn he's probably doing the
same thing for like couple months or
like I'm just pulling my hair out
absolutely up
I dropped it on you we know we need a
stinger for that whatever simply throw
that in it's just so bad that we're
gonna come up with something yeah
something that you and I both have Han I
think of rice roni when you say that
absolutely what's the cross every single
tree that is true uh here's some other
kind of sigh side news Apple CEO Tim
Cook has been once again named one of
the 100 most influential people by time
magazine wow it's its annual list Tim
Cook has recognized as a Titan alongside
many others he looks so mean right there
he's a Titan what are you gonna he's
like snarling and he's like why are you
taking my picture it's really the whole
the heaven I have an iPad right here you
can take it with his ipad look you can't
smile if a pictures black and white
that's kind of a rule if there's the
vignette kind of shadowing along the
side and it's a black and white picture
the rule is you cannot smile you have to
look tough can do we see any devices in
this picture that we've never seen
before paper I haven't seen in a long
time wow there's paper yeah that that's
that's a pretty rare one okay um and
then just jumping back if you're an ipad
pro fan like myself jony ive has
designed a one-of-a-kind one-of-a-kind
one of one yellow ipad pro for charity i
actually like this whole color scheme
this is kind of fun it's playful it's
yellow anodized metal so it has it's
really a bright yellow metal on the
backside it comes with any what is it a
french blue leather smart cover I like
this and this is the whole color they
should do right here what are they doing
making this one of one and then the pen
has a Italian calf leather I'm assuming
it's softer that wraps around the actual
apple pencil oh yeah it looks I like the
texture of that so someone someone on
periscope just said eel they just
there's true up in their mouth they
threw up hey you want to get some
voicemails let's go ahead see what we've
done let's go ways as well people's got
to say again i forgot to just remind us
all on the top of the show the number
that you guys can all call is a 1-800
61 62 63 8 we love it your comments your
voice your bad apples name where you're
from get to it and you'll be in our show
like the rest of these people are all
right this is jack from Wisconsin hey
Brian hey Steven this is jack from
Wisconsin absolutely love the show I was
just wondering if you guys are thinking
seeing that WWDC is coming up do you
think that Apple is going to be
releasing a new macbook with Retina
display and do you think we're going to
be seeing major design change in macbook
pro line thanks to keep up the show I
absolutely love it have a good one you
did you hear he absolutely loves the
show absolutely loves it he dropped that
one on us like cattle while we looted
too early in the show MacBook Pros have
definitely got to see a major redesign
at WWDC 100% expecting that we see the
12-inch released early which all points
that that's going to be the rock star of
the show we will see obviously the OS is
tivos iOS and Makos people in the in the
YouTube chat room were like what's macos
I guess they didn't get muscle sweet but
it's mac OS apple is expected to change
the name of mac OS 10 to Makos to align
with iOS and tivos and watch oz I'm
gonna create a character that just uh
does that all day yeah I could be like
tell if they could all be different
characters like Teletubbies okay let's
go next call all right this is a good
one here here we go oh oh my name is it
I want to bait and i'm calling from
great i love your show and I have a
question in the guard to apple iphone
absolutely success um I was wondering
are there any apps for people with
disabilities specifically anyone with
cerebral palsy like myself and does the
apple health app that's included in the
phone work with people that are doing
physical therapy not just exercise and
if it does
how would I tip that up especially since
I have an Apple watch alright so I I did
do some research about this and look I
searched cerebral palsy and other
medical apps on in the App Store and I
didn't find much I really felt like two
or three but mostly most of them were
just for you know just just diagnosed a
tracing yeah diagnosing it there was a
couple exercise apps you know but I
don't think it's really what he's
looking for for like tracking his uh his
you know his exercise and stuff like
that but um I was thinking also maybe
the ipad has some more more robust apps
and it really wasn't much it might you
know the thing about it is really what
most companies have done with Apple they
have their accessibility features which
i'm sure you've dug into more than
enough but anything specific to even the
health app being able to track some of
your movements it's not going to
probably be the most accurate if it's
really looking for a specific type of
stride or gate so we will keep our eyes
open but we wanted to address it just
because a we love that you're a fan of
the show and you're calling all the way
from Kuwait yes um and we'll keep our
eyes on this and if lit this is the best
way a lot of times we have listeners
from around the world if you guys have
any input or ways that you can let us
know about maybe an app that you use or
family member uses this is a great way
to kind of build that community of like
hey maybe try this this may not do
everything for you but this might help
so we throw it out to the apple byte
yeah and then we might makes us do some
research to realism it does too so
thanks for the call all right here is uh
Bernard hello Brian Steven this is
benari coming from the south suburbs of
Chicago Illinois um I have a very quick
yet strange question for you guys um is
ribbon bobbing for a very long time I've
asked this question from different
people and no one has been able to
answer it so I'm go ahead and give you
guys a shot maybe you could help me out
um let's see here why is it
that Apple does not allow you to make
ringtones with your songs that you have
when you're following for example if i
buy a song from itunes you know they
have apps you can download and you can
actually turn the song into a ringtone
but you can't use it or you cannot um
manipulate it into whatever you want to
do with you didn't see you actually
connected to a computer all right let's
stop it there yeah you can stop him
right there yes so you can do this in
itunes yeah you can't do it with your
phone I cannot know and a lot of this
has to do also with performance rights
so there was there was a ruling a long
time ago where if your phone rings and
there's a song playing and there's like
five people around and they all hear the
song it's almost considered a
performance royalty so they kind of put
the kibosh on that stop that from
happening but you can go into itunes and
make some tweaks and make a ringtone
yeah we have i created a veal honestly
this years ago years ago and if you can
even look it up of or you can look on
your own how to make ringtones and
iTunes and the gentleman does address
the fact that yeah I could plug it in
there and it is kind of you'd almost
think it is kind of odd but what Stephen
speaking to about ringtones right Apple
sells the song but Apple does also
sometimes cell ringtones of songs and
they sell them separately yes because of
those performance rights yes so when you
connect your phone if you've purchased
any song there's a way to basically set
the starting time and the ending time of
the segment of the song you want you
make a copy of it you then create an AAC
version of that it's all available in
iTunes to do this and then once you have
that AAC version i think the actual file
is like dot m4v you can then take that
file and drag it into like your
ringtones folder and it'll be available
yeah so there's more details i'm not
going to walk it step by step because
this is an audio podcast figure it out
but that is really essentially what you
do and you can do that with all the
stuff you've purchased I've done it
plenty of times so it is still possible
but you're right just not on your phone
there is no real solution for that
cool hopefully there will be in the next
phone but problem everyone get your
prints ringtone set up right now yeah
everyone's doing that today okay got one
more call hey this is brian from new
orleans and what i would like you all to
help me with we're having this
discussion at around the water cooler at
work and you know are we in the dark
ages for innovation right now we were
talking about kind of some of the big
things that are happening right now
there's VR there's messaging apps and
then it seems like everything else is
just high-resolution screens and
bendable screens and it really just
seems to be engineers tweaking designed
you know we used to be where Apple would
be the big innovator with the iPad or
the iphone and just kind of blow our
minds with something we didn't even
think of but now you can almost predict
what Apple is going to do a year out so
you know in y'all opinion will they ever
come back and get their mojo back or
with another company step up this is a
great question first of all Brian from
another Brian always got appreciate the
name Brian you're right on the money is
the question is innovation I don't want
to say it's in the dark days but how
about this is innovation for apple in
its in the dark days that's what I was
gonna say i'll say innovation across
across the world is i don't all time
high all time hiring why honestly with
apple just seems stagnant yeah you like
you said we can see some of these things
a year ahead of time look this is this
is how I've always kind of seen a
product comes out someone tries it
people don't realize what it is
sometimes the company itself doesn't
realize what it is but it takes off look
at the Amazon echo to me that is a
perfect example of a product that no one
just because they just decided to make
it it wasn't Apple who use their Syria
wasn't Google you use their voice which
has they both you know Google's is one
of the best Cortana even right
Microsoft's Cortana oh yeah but Amazon
made the echo and that's an innovative
product not everyone thinks it's for
them but I'm going to tell you if you
use it you'll be like I see where this
is going
this could potentially this is something
that I'm willing to invest in and will
be something I might use in the future
in the next few years it might not be
ready for you yet but it's the stepping
stone of voice automation voice
interactivity and just getting
comfortable with that idea and that
behavior virtual reality smart cars
autonomous driving is a big thing time
is driving cars drones there's a lot of
the thing is there's a lot of innovation
happening outside of apples wheelhouse
yes that's why it feels like Apple isn't
innovating and so I do have a little
story to sort of here's a story from
Steven Beecham well it's actually from
the road show.com but uh this was posted
today and I saw and I'm like the Apple
car I mean my prediction is keeps coming
hold on coming you're right my or my
2016 prediction just keeps this building
and building I could see a building so
anyway Apple allegedly hires former
Tesla vice president Aston Martin
engineer Chris poor it okay so this is a
big this is a big thing I mean this is
like Apple car ran all over right of
course it does um so I mean go read this
story in the roadshow calm but um yeah
they just made a big higher and he
worked for Tesla he knows some things
about smart cars yep and they'll still
be behind Tesla and 2020 it's like I
just thought that was cool so of course
what's the best way to try to catch up
hire a guy from your competitor dude
yeah and though the competitors way
ahead of you I apple doesn't even have a
frame of a car right now okay let's be
real yeah and the Tesla 3 they have said
it's expected even people that put their
name on the fielder their models might
come around like two thousand and like
19 oh yeah 20 totally it's a ways out so
even if apple announces something it's
not like they're gonna have multi you
know millions tens of millions of units
like they do an iphone this is a car
yeah it's not that easy I don't even
know how even me saying it's not that
easy is probably a gross understatement
of how hard it is well justjust my time
spent at the detroit auto show this year
like i've heard people a lot of people
talking about just designing a car takes
five to seven years
just to like just in the ground up yeah
so you know and then prototyping and
then testing and making sure it's safe
for the road all that stuff so I'm gonna
tell you right now Apple don't make it
look like a Prius with sex here oh don't
you like I've seen some concepts out
there even years ago like five years ago
people are like what could it be like
don't don't do that if you do that
seriously so we went from the guys
question about innovation to like the
Apple car but it's not gonna be an
innovative you know what I mean we don't
know we don't know but it's not
innovative it's already been done and
done well like it Tesla's car has been
done well enough where you can't tell me
something's gonna leapfrog it by 5 10
years yeah Tesla looks cool too so you
now it went once a product gets that
like big jump ahead of everyone else
then everyone else kind of plays
catch-up than everyone else starts
catching up to each other and then it
becomes like very subtle improvements
and no innovation yeah but innovation is
not dead in other areas it's just apples
consumer product space that's where it
said if Apple had come out with the echo
quite honestly that could be everyone
would it would be it would it would have
been an innovative product what I'm
fortunately enough Siri isn't that great
compared to other voice recognition as
well it's got a lot better don't get me
wrong but it's not as good as the others
so there you go all right ladies and
