a look at the new 11 inch Sony Vaio
eseries laptop you may ask yourself what
have happened to 11 inch laptop I used
to see them around all the time the
entrance nowadays you don't see them
around quite as much there is the 11
inch MacBook Air that's still pretty
popular a couple 11 inch gaming laptops
and one or two but these have largely
gone the way of netbooks you don't see
them a lot anymore because people who
need a laptop to travel around with a
lot they've really jumped to those super
thin 13-inch ultrabooks
and Ultrabook style laptops would give
you more screen for about the same
weight or even less than your average 11
inch laptop even though they have
slightly bigger footprints there are
cases where where you want something
that's very small like this so your are
going to go with the 11 inch they can be
very inexpensive this guy starts at 449
they are a little bit on the thick side
this one especially it's thicker than
pretty much all the ultrabooks and
really thin 13-inch laptops that we've
seen recently but you make up for that
with the low price and sony gets that by
using an AMD CPU in the system rather
than let's say an Intel Core i3 or other
sort of low voltage Intel chip and you
do pay a little bit of price in terms of
performance especially when you compare
it to more expensive Intel systems but
for what you're really doing on your
laptop especially your travel laptop
surfing the web sending email going on
Facebook it's actually perfectly fine
you shouldn't get too hung up on that
and as a nice bonus AMD is very obsessed
with graphics since they bought ATI the
graphics company they work a lot of that
technology into their CPUs now so you
can actually play some half-decent games
on this without dropping the frame rates
really too much even though this is a
smaller laptop you get your typical
really nice Sony keyboard it's the flat
island-style keys and the key faces are
actually pretty big the touchpad kind of
gets squeezed down a little bit I call
it a letterbox style where it's much
longer than it is wide and that makes a
little hard to do to finger gestures
like scrolling to get through a long
page you do ever get some ports that the
thinner ultrabooks sometimes have to
leave out for space like a full Ethernet
jack or even a VGA video output which is
something that a lot of the thinner
laptops just can't fit in what you do
get that's even more important that
there's a really nice new design the
sony elan
which also includes a 15-inch laptop
they have kind of this wraparound look I
think it's very modern actually looks a
little bit nicer than some of some of
these more expensive laptops which can
actually look a little generic so if
you're willing to overlook the lower
power AMD processor and just use this as
a travel laptop for web surfing and
email basic stuff like that I think
you're going to find it very usable I'm
Dan Ackerman and that is the sony vaio
