AMOLED smartphone displays has made it
into a finished product and lo it was
named samsung galaxy round I'm Jessica
doll court for CNN and I'm going to tell
you why the round is more than just a
gimmick let's start with a phone shape
there's a pretty subtle curve from edge
to edge which does indeed make it
conform well when you hold it up to your
cheek and stuff it into a pocket but
it's thicker spines and subtle inward
angles also make it a lot more
comfortable to hold for longer periods
of time then say a straight edge phone
like the Galaxy Note 3 this comes in
handy if you're reading playing games or
watching a movie I can definitely hold
it one handed in both landscape and
portrait mode without pummeling the
phone you may ask if the curved surface
effects visibility and typing I found
that it did to store reflections but in
a positive way making them less
distracting my typing however was very
slightly off since the screen looks flat
it actually isn't however it's a pretty
minor adjustment and one that I got used
to relatively quickly now the round
isn't without some gimmicks if you
enable motion control settings you can
tap the side of the phone to skip around
musical tracks but it only works for
tunes I had on my phone not for any
streaming songs also you can press and
hold down the side of the phone for
several seconds to see details like time
and battery levels or you can just go to
the lock screen in the usual way and
find out the same details faster without
chasing your phone around on a flat
surface beyond the bent five-point inch
HD screen samsung did well to keep the
round high-end it has almost all the
same specs as the Galaxy Note 3 android
4.3 with Samsung's TouchWiz interface on
top at 2.3 gigahertz quad-core Qualcomm
Snapdragon 800 processor and a
13-megapixel camera there's no stylus of
course but that's an optional feature
anyhow the rounds biggest problem in my
opinion is that it's limited to South
Korean carriers for now however for
about thirteen hundred dollars you can
get it from us distributor negri
electronics with LG's rival G flex
coming to AT&amp;amp;T Sprint and t-mobile you'd
better believe that samsung will have an
arched phone for the US market soon I'm
