you might be thinking how on earth can
you actually rank these shows and I'll
say I will use Metacritic com
mostly because CBS owns it Metacritic
aggregates reviews and then assigns a
Metascore out of 100 for this list we're
going to rank only shows that are not
cancelled and have a score of course at
number 5 is the path with an average
meta score of 67 over two seasons this
is that show best known as oh that's the
online show with Aaron Paul right yep
it's that one in the path Paul plays a
guy who is breaking free of a cult that
he was once part of number four is
harlots with a meta score of 74 this
show takes place in the 1700s in London
and is about raising daughters in a
brothel I know what you're thinking buy
another one of these shows yeah I know
however there's only one season out
right now with a second coming in 2018
at number 3 is difficult people with an
average meta score of 82 this show stars
Billy Eichner and Julie Klausner Plus
Amy Poehler is one of the executive
producers it kind of reminds me of
you're the worst with characters that
can be kind of unlikable but are really
amusing to watch either way difficult
people is worth watching and number two
is casual with three seasons it's
average meta scores around 84 this
comedy / drama is from the director of
Juno and thank you for smoking so that
should give you an idea of its sense of
humor this show centers around a woman
who's adjusting to life after divorce
and her best friend her brother and that
number one is The Handmaid's Tale with a
score of 90 - this show is excellent
with a great cast and cover some really
really serious subject matters if you're
looking for a happy-go-lucky show run
away from The Handmaid's Tale however if
you want to watch a program about a
dystopian world
you found your show if you're wondering
where the Mindy project fits in it's an
odd case it's a continuation of a
Network show
and only had a Metascore for one of its
two Pulu seasons so we left it off this
list if you're curious season 4 of the
Mindy project got a score of 81 anyway
for more top fives check out the
internet because they're everywhere
oh my as act iron I'll see you online
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
