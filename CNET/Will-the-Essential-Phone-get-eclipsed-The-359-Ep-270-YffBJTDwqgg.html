it's a 359 Morty I'm pickle Rick Morty
in the podcast today Alfred Morty been
Morty in Sderot Morty oh geez really no
I was a really bad impression on my part
and I apologize but I couldn't help
myself I was impressed usual morning
guys what's going on okay I guess I'm
supposed to say good cos Alfred's blind
we're gonna go through our review our
initial review of the essential phone
$700 android-powered phone by the father
of Android we'll get to that first also
the Amazon echo dot free giveaway that
happened for a very short window on
Friday we'll talk a little bit about the
technical error and whether some people
actually did get their echo dots in the
mail for free and last up of course it's
eclipse day hence the ridiculous glasses
I've been wearing these all day and I
haven't seen a single eclipse yet I'm
surprised you were able to dress
yourself appropriately for work then
anyway let's get to the podcast send in
your questions and comments BBG we'll
get to as many as you can all the best
at the end of the show without further
ado let's podcast all right thanks
everybody stick around we'll be back to
join you in the chat in three minutes
and 59 seconds from 3:00 to welcome to
the 359 I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred
Aang and I'm Derek her so we'll the
essential phone get eclipsed you see
what I did there
what Oh cuz there's an eclipse today yes
yes exactly so a little pun so there's a
new phone from Andy Rubin no relation
the father of Android it's $700 CNET's
initial review went up a couple days ago
and it was pretty lukewarm I mean like
the the biggest strong points on this
thing are its body it's titanium that
ceramic body it's got these cool
magnetic connectors on the back for mods
but there were a bunch of cons that were
mentioned about it for instance laggy
camera it's not water resistant there's
also no headphones
I keep mentioning headphone jacks
whenever we talk about phones but I mean
I feel like this phone would have been
incredible if it came out in 2016 but I
you know coming out now in the timing
you know with the note 8 being released
on Wednesday and Apple's new iPhone
coming out at some point in September
and also the pixel to to follow up with
that I feel like it's just really bad
timing on their part and yeah you know -
I hate to reuse your pun but I do feel
like it's gonna be eclipsed I guess by
by all these other phones that have much
more hype behind them they did have a
window of opportunity when they
initially said they were going to
release I think sometime around June or
July they originally were gonna release
in May I thought months ago and it's
been delayed so unfortunately now they
just had to basically come out with
something as quickly as possible before
the note 8 but it's an Android powered
phone just like the no day just like the
Google pixel - I mean like Dara is this
something that you think people are
gonna get excited about well personally
I hadn't heard much about the phone yeah
like a lot of people yeah and so it's
hard to get excited around a phone that
doesn't have a lot of hype around it the
thing is it's like a very like inside
Ori phone like you know it's also only
gonna be like a Sprint exclusive it's
you're really not gonna see this in
stores or anything like that so you
really have to do your homework on
something like this and I feel like
anybody that does their homework like
looking up phones is not gonna get that
excited about this one in general yeah
it's still pretty first gen I would
agree so next up also on Friday for a
very short window of time Amazon was
accidentally doing due to a technical
error giving away echo dots they're
usually $50 they were selling them for
$0 I got one order in and that
unfortunately was cancelled it like
completely disappeared by Saturday but
alfred apparently you actually got you I
got mine it shipped and then they said
it cancelled but then I checked the
tracking order and it was still out
there and then I came home on Sunday and
there wasn't my mailbox you lucky dog
yeah so yeah so if you did get it get it
cancelled oh they did send you a $5
discount or like a promotional code
thing basically saying sorry we thought
we're getting an echo down for free but
here's $5 to make up for it so I have
both that and the free ice right now
they're coming for you Alfred very
watched podcast I did hear from one
reader over the weekend that said
between her and her fiance they got five
free echo dots they just kept putting in
orders and they got all five of them
that's like the kid that like grabs all
the candy out of the bowl I'm like
Halloween which to be fair I also did
but I mean if it's Jeff Bezos is candy
bowl yes I'm gonna tase him all echo
down
definitely also with the time we have
left
obviously it's eclipse they wanted to
get through a couple interesting points
totality in Oregon is gonna start at
1:15 I'm sorry that's eastern time South
Carolina it's gonna hit by 246 eastern
time hopefully you guys have plans for
the Eclipse I know we will are you
excited I'm so excited get your glasses
or you'll go blind and don't buy the
fake ones from Amazon yes they're free
yeah I think it's too late for glasses
at this point you know supposedly
they're sold out everywhere I mean
there's been big runs yeah yeah yeah but
I don't know I'm yeah what are people
doing during my clips I'm sonic Google's
Android Oh a vent which is time to round
the Eclipse to it so I hope you get out
of there quick enough anyway a live
stream in there for it so yeah cool
that's cool anyway if you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred Aang
I'm Derek err thanks for listening and
so what glasses are you guys sporting
here today Eclipse glasses yeah the word
you get them from what wait what do you
equip sir I got him in a clips care
package actually from Vsauce
the YouTube channel Oh No kidding oh
we're gonna we're gonna plug who sent us
a glass youtuber okay
like specifically they're on YouTube
MasterCard sent me my Eclipse glasses so
thank you MasterCard but there's no
there's no brand on it just says
e-classes after all of that I love
mastercards youtube channel great
content so we're here in New York and I
think our alleged time is around what
two thirty to forty five something like
that yeah it's happening around like two
forty rather they're gonna totally know
where we are it's gonna be around
seventy seventy five percent so we will
have to wear the glasses the whole time
that's not nothing that's not nothing
yeah at all so my neighbor is a doctor
and he told me that the reason it's so
dangerous to stare directly at the Sun
during the Eclipse is is that the damage
that happens in your eye is in the
retina basically the image burns into
the back of your eyes and you could
potentially end up seeing like the the
shade shadow of an eclipse for the rest
of your life it gets like seared into
your eye but it's dark enough that the
normal thing that happens where you
can't look at the Sun for very long
because it's hurting your eyes too much
doesn't happen because it's alright and
so you're tricked into burning your eyes
out exactly so my grandfather tried that
on me on you look at the Sun it's great
right so out of curiosity where is
everybody in the chat today are you
going to be trying to catch the Eclipse
and what time does it happen for you and
what methods are you going to try to use
whether it be glasses app or shoe box
shoe box I'm going shoe box oh yeah I
saw a bunch of like tweets and stories
just basically like how to livestream
the Eclipse I'm just why are you doing
that yo just go outside let's go watch
it oh not only that like there are gonna
be a bunch of live streams anyway unlike
CNN and a bunch of people that are
probably have responsibilities that they
can't get away from so there's something
really great have a stream scam email me
all the places that are closing for like
10 minutes because of the Eclipse like I
saw photos of like McDonald's closing
for like 10 minutes during the Eclipse
or like a once-in-a-lifetime event
but I need my Szechuan sauce
there's also places probably that I'm
gonna have I know totality are anywhere
I get it if you're in a place where like
you can't completely see it but I just
feel like it seems like super like lame
if you're just like going to watch it
from like a computer screen or something
just look at photos of Eclipse yeah but
if you can't physically be there some of
us have responsibilities that don't let
us walk away minded by science I
actually don't know Alfred how you're
even talking right now without seeing
but I can speak without how can you talk
if you can't see so apparently there was
an eclipse when we were all a lot
younger not Alfred he was not yet
conceived but wasn't even a twinkle in
his father's eye it wasn't I don't
remember it being this big of a deal but
it was so long ago I thing that
everybody was talking about was like the
shoe box thing and people were like yeah
you can see it or you could not see it
whatever it seems like it turned into
like a really big thing this time but
then again everything is made into a big
plastic but I remember like when
Halley's Comet came and that was really
big thing yeah like it was like in
middle school or something like that
Halley's Comet classes for that I fell
asleep I think before Halley's Comet
yeah you had to wake up at a ridiculous
time yeah I think I missed it probably
no but yeah I don't run that I was alive
I was young he hung if I don't remember
the hype around the first Eclipse he but
maybe I was too young to remember
we got Danny Green he's taking pictures
from Charlotte that's a good spot good
spot totality lucky they traveled down
there yeah yeah I like this comment from
Kemal he says it feels like there's
always a eclipse in the UK is it's
always a bloody cloudy this is really
glad that we got somebody who used the
bloody in an actual sentence that
actually happened we'll try to do it a
little more often
I like bloody cloudy together British
second metal man all right we got to
talk a little bit about the essential
phone I guess a little bit more
Perry William says I like mods looking
forward to seeing what they bring out
for it I have the Moto plays E and love
it okay how's it going to stack up
side-by-side with that then I think it's
a better build you know this is like
titanium ceramic there they're trying to
really show this thing off it's like a
really impressive flagship piece I I
don't think that the Moto Z is that much
cheaper though but that that's really
the big play for them this is also with
the mods like apparently the magnetic
connections are you know it's a nice
solid tight fit so I think people are
really gonna like that when they do try
it out that and you know if Andy Rubin
is you know telling the truth of like
what he's promoting for this it's that
you know he doesn't want this to be like
the iPhone or the Samsung like Galaxy
phones or it's like you get a new one
every year he kind of wants it to be
like a two three-year kind of thing
which was always my problem with mods
where if there's a new phone coming out
every year how who's to say these mods
are compatible if like the next ones
he's hoping for this to be like a phone
that you have for like three four years
then like I'm assuming the mods would
also be you know upgraded as it goes on
yeah definitely I think the thing is is
that as our review mentions and it's
still an initial review but I think this
could probably use another year to bake
ultimately oh I'm sorry I'm alright
she's gonna eat my moon pie brought to
you by moon back into the chat for a
couple more questions about the eclipse
Josh boy 2 asks is it ok to take a
picture with your phone with no solar
filter over the lens ok I know we have
that answer somewhere on CNET I'm sorry
that I'm not prepared to answer that I
take a lot of pictures of the Sun
straight on and it's fine yeah I'd
straight what so basically I saw a video
earlier today but this wasn't the phone
this is like an actual camera lens and
that will like melt like the inside
basically like it you know the whole
like magnifying glass yeah it's
basically that because that's what your
camera lens is all right but that's a
camera that's not a smart phone a smart
phone it's a mirrorless I know really
shooting to the Sun all the time I take
a lot of pictures whatever you're doing
me yeah
you're better off using something
digital rather than traditional mirrored
actual camera camera sorry I'm starring
here like an idiot either way in the
description of the show we're gonna put
some links for other optional ways if
you have any second thoughts or worries
that you're gonna hurt your equipment or
yourself we'll put a bunch of links in
the bottom to help you find a method to
actually get out there and see it and
some some fashion what do you got Ben
james Cipriani has a story on CNET how
to photograph the Eclipse with your
phone I would recommend checking it out
he's got a lot of useful tips there so
thank you very much for the question but
the glasses on top of your phone lines
that is one idea okay it's one of these
at work
DJ night bringing back the old school
style best name we've ever had in the
chat hands down if something will me
that's his name he says it's something
bad gonna happen when the eclipse
happens I heard the lights will go out
and we're not gonna be able to make our
hot food I think yeah I think the
Eclipse goes by Jumanji rules were
shout-out to natty West he's watching
the Eclipse from Trinidad and Tobago all
the way on Turnitin and Tobago you might
be our first listener from there so
Cheers thanks for joining us yeah
definitely and then lastly I'm what I
just kinda want to say like good on
Amazon before we wrap it up for the day
because we are running out of time but
just to circle back one more time
did the Amazon I code out for like
keeping good on their word they sold it
on their word they they they didn't
cancel all of them you're sitting on one
right now but they can't they sent me a
note as saying that it was cancelled the
only reason why I have it is because
they couldn't contact a like USPS and
time to return it but they could
probably have gone through some kind of
weird
legal channel and demanded it back or
whatever that's what I need know like
they ate a lot of curl on this one I
think that's kind of cool
Ben was basically saying like this was
like one of the incidents where like
Amazon's fast efficiency actually like
ended up backfiring on them yes I was
just about to say it exactly for the
people that actually were smart enough
to do single day and same-day shipping
they're the ones that were more likely
to get it because they just went out of
the warehouses too fast for yeah that's
the only reason why I even have it is
because they came too fast for them to
stop yeah I mean I'll take the five
dollar promo credit that's fine I did
hear from one other reader that said he
was on the phone with Amazon for a whole
hour to get a ten dollar promo credit
Wow I don't think it's worth your time
to do that but I will say if you do call
to complain maybe you'll get a somebody
on Twitter that kept tweeting at them
saying like how dare you cancel my order
that was a mistake like you're not
winning this argument I mean there's
nothing wrong with being enough
opportunist yes and taking advantage of
it but I mean that could have gone way
way worse I feel yeah even when it was
happening on Friday we knew it was a
mistake or I had a very strong suspicion
that it was a mistake because you didn't
actually find out that there was a promo
to basically wipe away the entire cost
of the thing until you were ready to
press yes yes very hard yeah it was a
very end of the purchase process so I
think it's cool they're giving the $5 to
you know yeah we messed up here's this
I'll get you something
sucks yeah all right so before we wrap
it up I got one more essential phone
question from Tazz may he says hello
from India which more extensions what
other extensions can be supported on the
essential phone and to my knowledge
right now we just have 360s yeah exactly
right yeah any conversation or
speculation about what still is
forthcoming I hope there's a magnetic
headphone jack so the 360 camera is the
first one that's ready out of the gate
but there are I don't I don't know how
much they're talking about some of the
other ones but the expectation is is
that there
are gonna be more to come the other
thing to look for from essential is I
think it's called the essential home
which is going to be similar to an echo
or a Google home where it's gonna be
kind of like a smart speaker that
resides at your house and helps operate
all your smart home appliances and stuff
like that so look for that I think
sometime later this year or next year
one more shout out to Pamela who's also
from Trinidad and Tobago it's awesome I
love that we have such a great global
audience and then one more to close it
out oh hey no shout out to Eric he says
easy make up an extension that'd be
incredible I would have to buy that
phone yeah I need that I need that in my
life but Stephen Kai asks
today essential phone event in New York
City where is it going to be can we
could that information know there was an
essential phone event in either you're
going to Android that might have been
confusion on this part so but we don't
know of any events coming down the chain
either but either you're talking about
the Android no event oh yeah they're
hosting it during the Eclipse which is
totally cool cuz I want to be working
during a once-in-a-lifetime event it's
like although they're gonna make a quote
yeah so there are no building like
they're announcing the new version that
the name of the new version of the next
version of Android which we're all
expecting to be you it's free I'm pretty
sure it's gonna be Oreo like they're
doing it during the Eclipse
come on but we already know about a lot
of the features that's gonna be
available for Android we've seen it
during Google i/o most of it it's like
improving your battery life cool things
like like with goggles stuff where you
can like scan your Wi-Fi code google
lens yeah no it's good oh wait no yeah
it's based off of cog oh sorry
well yeah just like all the others like
new features that they're adding to it
that we already kind of know about I now
it's just mostly what's the name and
when are we gonna be able to get it cuz
it's only been available in developers
beta for some time now yeah and they're
also this is the first time they're
doing this outside of their headquarters
in Mountain View in California in the
United States
bring us back some snacks yeah
so yeah yeah I'm pretty sure they'll be
Oreo though but I would eat those um
yeah it's either that or they're like
heavily trolling everybody which they I
have seen them doing on Twitter where
one of their senior vice presidents will
have like we're just tweeting all these
other like desserts that start with oats
hmm oatmeal cookie and olive oil cookie
does not roll off the tongue but I guess
that's why I'm saying they're like
trolling everybody else even in the
developers beta when I was available
like it's it boots up with an icon of
like an octopus yeah so yeah they're
really messing with people and I know we
were trying to wrap it up we got a
couple of good questions rolling back in
yeah is there going to be a live stream
of that Android event I am actually
still looking into that because some of
my co-workers wanted to look at that to
instead of the Eclipse
I believe it it should be live stream
but I'm not like a hundred percent sure
on that all right and a couple more wish
lists for the essential phone I said
mods
yeah maniac says what we need is a
wide-angle second camera on the phone
that's not an LG and has a six or eight
gigabyte RAM that just sounds like a
wish list for an entirely new phone more
or less but Erik jumps on that train and
says can we get an echo dot extension
for the essential phone just plop it on
top really want to carry you around then
your pocket pouch it's a voice assistant
on top of your voice assistant I would
do it if I could get an echo because you
don't have to hit the buttery if it was
if it was a free echo dot sure and I'd
be fine with it
imagine if it was portable and you could
just walk around with it all day always
listening with the bunny yeah that will
happen
yeah I put it in like a stick or
something all right
oh no we are out of time we do have to
get going all right bring it on Ben all
right oh the thing is gone fine
assembly episodes and you haven't
memorized what the outgoing script is
let's go blind it's fine
the 359 podcast is available on iTunes
tune in stitcher SoundCloud Feedburner
and google play music and of course it's
on cnet.com the exact
thanks everybody for watching enjoy the
Eclipse later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
