thousand-dollar phones your super
affordable $200 phones and then you've
got a really wide gap in between Huawei
hopes that it's honor view 10 can fit
that middle space nicely for about $500
that puts it in direct competition with
the 1 + 5 t as a good-looking phone with
solid specs that a lot more people can
actually afford it won't have all the
extras you get with the iPhone or its
Samsung Galaxy s8 but you're definitely
getting more than just the basics it all
starts with a six-inch screen resolution
is strong but the display won't be as
sharp as the most premium models like
most phones from Huawei this one comes
with two cameras on the back you get one
20 megapixel lens and a second 16
megapixel camera to enrich those photos
there's some AI software onboard to help
automatically pick settings and of
course portrait mode there's a
front-facing camera for your selfies
this one with a 13 megapixel lens the
honor view 10 has the same octa-core
processor that the very premium Huawei
mate 10 Pro has plus 6 gigabytes of RAM
to back it all up that's a bonus for a
phone that comes in at an affordable
price the catch depending on where you
live the honor view 10 maybe harder to
find in the US for example it will sell
on its own website but not through your
carrier this is a global phone so you'll
be able to buy it in other countries as
well like the UK Germany Italy Spain and
India starting in January</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
