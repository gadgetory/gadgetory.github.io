bad people who I think can do some good
y'all jokers must be crazy Suicide Squad
a group of DC super villains brought
together by a shady government agency to
go on Do or Die emissions to earn time
off triple life sentences something
ridiculous like that I went in expecting
a full kind of Avengers style spectacle
ensemble cast every character is
delightful in their own special way and
I came out pretty darn disappointed it
didn't have a lot working in its favor
to put together a really well paced film
like there was a lot of background to
cover on bringing everyone together
there were so many characters on the
team you've got a bit lost trying to use
them all it tried really hard to hit
those notes and there were a lot of
moments where it came close to doing
that but it just felt kind of messy in
the end absolutely and one of the other
things that really stuck with me on that
was the use of music I mean I felt like
it was a teenager butt dialing Spotify
its greatest hits it was just jumping
into you remember Bohemian Rhapsody I
love that song you remember Dusty
Springfield and Eminem and the white
stripes you like all of those artists
don't you well that was a very similar
thing that they did with the marketing
campaign it's like the most recent half
a dozen trailers were all set to those
really popular songs what was that I
should kill everyone and escape sorry
the voices I'm kidding that's not what
they really said if you can only rely on
using the music that people love and
kind of riding on the shoulders of
champions without actually relying on
the fact that your story is awesome
you're only playing off the
association's that people have with the
music
what do you think of Holly oh mercy okay
so I'm told by all of my fan friends
that she's got this awesome backstory
she's this really troubled woman former
psychiatrist I mean oh that's true that
is very true stuff I got a fun lady in
hot pants who at one point fashions open
a shop window because she just really
wants the handbag inside seriously the
hell's wrong with you people for bad
guys it's what we do I think I did an
audible sigh at that point but I just
felt like that for this really amazing
character who could have been really
dark and light you know funny and
serious I just got a sort of trumped-up
single dimensional sexy girl
and a relationship with the Joker he was
in the movie I didn't feel like you
needed to be there no he was kind of in
there just for the sake of it which was
weird after so much controversy in Jared
Leto's betrayal I thought he was really
good at what he did I thought he was
great in the film I thought he gave a
really strong performance considering
out to follow on from Hitler yes very
much so but it didn't feel like he had
to be there and it was just kind of a
character being pulled out from the
woodwork to make us go oh we love the
Joker just like we love all this music I
had really high hopes for an ensemble
film that could be really fun but
instead we got quite a disjointed
picture that felt like it probably could
have been replaced by a bunch of
trailers being stuck together in the end
it was just too confused and rushed and
I've got to give it to exploding heads
out of 5 yeah look for me I think it's
too ironic haha tattoos out of 5 Suicide
Squad is in cinemas if you do want to
see it though and if you want to check
out our full review you can do that on
