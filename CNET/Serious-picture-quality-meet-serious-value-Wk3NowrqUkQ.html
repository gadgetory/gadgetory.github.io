and in front of me is the JVC D la X 35
B the B stands for black this projector
also is available in white that's a W
this is JVC's least expensive projector
with dila technology it's still $3500
however which means that it's a lot more
expensive than some of the other LCD or
DLP projectors you'll see of course it
does produce a lot better picture
quality as you can tell just by looking
at it is a pretty serious looking
projector there's no external buttons
until you get around to the back panel
JVC controls all the zoom focus and lens
shift via the remote control so that's a
really neat feature this projector also
runs extremely quiet these vents along
the side here control the exhaust and
you really only hear it when you turn
the lamp power up to high which is
something you're not going to do in a
light controlled room in addition those
buttons on the back panel you also find
the projectors ample complement of
inputs that's two HDMI and one component
video input there's also a remote
trigger where you plug in the optional
sync module for 3d glasses
that's an extra 99 bucks the one picture
here is the RF version the nice part
about that sync module it allows the
projector to work with RF glasses that
comply to the full HD 3d standard the
end result is that this projector will
work with the glasses that are a lot
cheaper than JVC's 180 dollar versions
that includes the $20 Samsung's and the
$60 Panasonic so it's a really nice
step-up feature if you want to buy
especially multiple pairs of glasses
with this projector on the downside this
JVC does not include the emitter or any
glasses in the box the X 35 is a good
selection of picture settings although
not quite as much as some of the step-up
JVC's I appreciated the full multi-point
gamma control which actually acts as a
excellent detailed grayscale control
there's a couple adjustments for color
but there isn't a full color management
system this 120 Hertz projector also
includes a smoothing effect you're gonna
want to leave turned off if you
appreciate the true cadence of film when
you brought the JVC into our dark lab
and turned it put it on 120 inch screen
we found the picture quality was superb
this projector produces extremely deep
black levels which is one of the reasons
why it cost so much more than the
entry-level projectors it also has very
accurate color despite those relatively
sparse controls that combination equals
one of the most accurate pictures we've
seen from any projector or a television
and of course you get that additional
bonus of the extra size we
compare this directly to a like price
Sony and we found that their pictures
were very similar it was almost
impossible to tell the difference
between the two after calibration one of
the downsides is JVC though is that it
does have relatively inaccurate picture
settings before calibration so if you're
not going to spend the money for a
professional to come in and mess around
with your picture you're going to get a
more accurate picture with the sony of
course with a projector like this and a
screen setup we do recommend that you
engage the help professional if you
really want to make this projector a
little up to its full potential that's a
quick look at the JVC dla X 35 home
