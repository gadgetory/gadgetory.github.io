standing next to the next smart
refrigerator that we've been able to get
a hands-on look at this is the LG smart
think L FX 3 1 9 9 5 s T and that's
quite a mouthful but it's quite a
refrigerator this is a 30-point seven
total cubic foot refrigerator that's
20.7 and the refrigerator compartment
and ten in the freezer in other words it
is a huge refrigerator that may or may
not fit in your kitchen if you have a
built in system one of the most unique
things that LG has done with this
refrigerator lies in its slim space plus
ice system instead of giving you an
icemaker on the top shelf of your
refrigerator LG promises that they'll
just give you the top shelf for storage
and have housed the icemaker inside the
refrigerator door you might think that
this widget racks with storage space on
the door itself but there is a
compartment to hold dawdles that nests
on the outside of the icemaker I think
than that the interior of the
refrigerator is pretty standard there's
nothing too surprising although they do
offer some very interesting
organizational elements that you may
find useful such as three fruit and
vegetable drawers and a gliding surf
drawer the freezer also has some unique
organizational elements and that it has
two drawers that nest on top of one
another and slide back under the
refrigerator compartment to give you
access to your larger items in the
bottom portion of the freezer
but the real hallmark of this LG smart
think fridge is in its touch screen
which rests above the ice and water
dispenser and offers some really useful
and functional features my favorite part
about the touch screens capabilities are
the fact that it can communicate with
your phone via a smart think app so you
can look up recipes and keep inventory
of your fridge and when you run out of
something or if you want to add those
recipe items to your shopping list you
do it through the grocery app on the
screen and it will send the list to your
phone where you can check it off as you
get each item the screen also has
multiple pages that you can choose from
by swiping left to right the standard
first page is your weather with a
graphic depiction of what the weather is
like outside but if you scan further
over it'll tell you what your energy
usage looks like in the refrigerator
and there's also a page that will allow
you to keep track of every member of
your family's water intake which may or
may not be useful to you as well
there's a photo app that enables you to
either upload photos from an SD card
from your camera or directly from your
iPhone using the smart think app the
calendar and memo apps are pretty
standard you can use your finger as a
stylus to either type or handwrite a
memo and post it to a page next to the
calendar and to use the calendar you
simply put in your Gmail information and
it will access your gmail calendar and
you can add and edit events from the
refrigerator screen itself we'll have a
full review soon where we'll have more
specific information about both the
performance and the features of the
refrigerator but with the LG smart think
