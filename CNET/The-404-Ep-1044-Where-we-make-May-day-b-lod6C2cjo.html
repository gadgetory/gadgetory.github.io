way you would be the choice cared if I'm
you're barely a part of Gina TV they

congratulations to the entire Cena TV
team yeah well deserved I would say it's
the people's voice award okay cool so
it's like the one that the real life
internet citizens vote on right you know
none of this uh you know academy stuff
it's like the real the real meat and
potatoes in the internet address but are
you sorry let me just take my shirt off
hot and
it's very like yeah people don't
understand when the weather changes they
don't like when it goes from winter to
spring to summer they don't adjust the
air conditioning in here yeah it's like
the heater is on right now what's up of
the Heat's on it's just nothing's on and
it's a little hot out today yes just not
adding up well with especially when you
have you know instruments and technical
equipment here that's just belching out
nothing but hot air plus we're playing
Mary but kill in the pre-show this
morning which got me pretty hot got you
all hot and Bobby I sweat going on no
look it's it's it's not you it's me yeah
monster rumbling let's uh let's get to
some of the stories of the day a lot of
people emailing this into us we heard
about it yesterday if you think they
just turned on the air conditioning do
you feel that it's possible yeah it's
possible awesome that'd be great um so
for a little honor you know why uh but
this article actually made is a little
upset too um in nothing in something I
can only label as a stunt certain
gentleman named Paul Miller who writes
for a psych hold the verge is leaving
the internet or claiming that he'll be
leaving the internet for an entire
calendar year right starting today may
first so we won't be able to hear this
because that would technically be the
internet what what now he there's a lot
of technicalities that he's sort of
proposing here but one thing I don't
understand though is he doesn't really
explain why he's doing this okay so this
is not because like he's not making like
he's taking a stand against like the
loss of conversations not like those
Jews at Citi Field who think the
Internet is his evil manifestation he's
just sort of like I you know I don't
need this he said I believe and I will I
will sort of summarize something he said
he said something about how it's like
the sewer system you never ventured down
there it's just the utility yeah okay
you understand you get that applies here
um you know what that like I just don't
think it requires I'm reading this
article and I after I can't get past
like the first paragraph who cares right
just leave
it's like when people go on facebook am
leaving facebook you know like right but
in like a week and now in facebook in
six days every day they'll post like one
day further into it well then I wish you
would just do it and not how you
announce it you know just I agree away
her but you forget but that's the stunt
of it yeah I mean there are busy getting
everything I did I mean I understand
where he's coming from yeah you so youth
we now when you say you understand where
he's coming from what do you mean cuz
cuz it's tough to infer the reason like
I said of why he's doing something like
this um I remember like two weeks ago
there was like this article i think it
was new york times i was talking about
the flight from conversation and blaming
the internet on that and saying that
like you know we kind of lost the art of
self-reflection and like you know
devices have made us demand information
immediately and in large abundance
whereas in conversation you can learn
how to be patient I think that's a penis
on evolution of human communication
right but like you know a lot of people
have ceased to you know like they don't
have the ability to have these
one-on-one conversation without picking
up their phone going on going on the
internet to find I answer to a question
that they've been wondering about I do
believe they're like I I'm want to say
that this guy from the verge Paul Miller
is doing it for that reason maybe to
like don't give don't enhance his like
social don't invent reasons for this guy
I'm assuming cuz he doesn't really say
what it is and that's my problem with
this is that he's not saying why yeah
he's like I don't know how long I'm
gonna be off the internet could be
forever it could be for three hours yeah
the stunt yeah cool stunt and works
Pringle doing how is somebody who works
for an Internet company gonna get off
the internet I mean he's gonna get fired
well he's not he's not gonna work for
the Virgin what is he gonna do he's
quitting no I think he's still gonna
work there he's saying that he's not
even gonna ask other people to google
things for him which is fuck isn't yeah
like I don't I honestly don't think that
his life is gonna be that affected by it
I think the world is gonna happen you're
crazy I think the worst thing that's
gonna happen is that he's gonna get some
foam oh and that's it homo but what the
hell's fo mo is fear of missing out it's
like when you know that has he come up
with this stuff never heard of this
phone I've never heard of phone you
clearly need to spend more time on the
end no I just never heard of that
abbreviation before
Yolo these are all Mario like buy one
get one of her that um formal is like
you when you know that your friends are
having fun doing something that you're
not they're experiencing as well you get
the fear of missing out oh the foaming
an inside joke but i'm saying i use that
he's gonna feel he probably not gonna be
able to go to as many social functions
cuz he's not gonna know about it and
that's how will these awardees all
sounds gonna stop texting also fine stop
texting I'm just saying I don't think
it's gonna last and I don't like the
stun yeah but it's cool because you
won't know because he won't be able to
hear this what's your problem with it I
just said I think it's it's just the
stunt I bet only else with no message I
don't see the issue like my mom doesn't
go on the internet for like two weeks at
a time now and that includes work schism
work for in a company right right I mean
this guy saying it's like a doctor being
like I'm just not gonna perform surgery
for a year yeah just not gonna knock
help people out here I'm seeing a lot of
Playboy's and penthouses in this guy's
future right like a lot of like physical
pornog right right yeah see how you like
the the static picture yes the other
feel that works well others like video
tapes as there are her goodbye some DVDs
but he's not be able to play those those
movies on his playstation is gonna have
to i got old technology why can you play
on this position cuz the Playstations
technically connected to the internet i
would say that You Know Nothings device
what are you talking you don't need you
don't need to be connected to the
Internet to watch a DVD anything that
has an Ethernet port should be banned
from this no cuz he's using his
computers just not going on the internet
yeah anyway could you do it though I
think you any was absolutely not yes you
could not free i mean if it were some
sort of monetary incentive yeah but the
but just for like you know no reason
whatsoever no I could not do it did you
guys watch that uh SNL skit I think when
Daniel Radcliffe was hosting it was like
a YouTube generation skit where they
made up like a mock television show that
would kind of like um it kind of like
made fun of self-promoting teenagers on
YouTube and like how yes you see this
you know and this reminds me of that you
know I'm like making this pseudo
accomplished writer and have to announce
it to the world that's right hey guys
are gonna get off the internet like
you know playback applause just do
something else do something more
important you could not do what's the
long as you could go I could I could go
off the internet for the rest of my life
so full of crap dude i think i could do
you are you are so addicted to the
internet and I'm funny no not sure what
there's no way you could do it I could
quit anytime you sound like a drug
addict what I like I would be selling
freaking alcoholic I could quit anytime
I could probably I would probably have
to get another job right delivering be
Lorraine Currier present delivering
newspapers something right delivering
pizza right there's no way I'm saying
Richard how long do you think you could
how long do you think you could go
without being on the internet well would
I still be working here because I have
to use the internet right exactly so
let's just say for argument's sake this
doesn't involve work and you wouldn't be
on the internet you've only be using the
internet for work nothing maybe a couple
weeks right maybe a month i was gonna
say oh maybe a month yeah dude climb on
telling you okay you get lonely with
that cat after a while nomena cat we're
getting closer be big you know what this
whole feline thing ain't working out for
hours in I'd be talking to the cat no
way you could do it why you couldn't do
it I I could totally do it man like what
what part of my life do you think that I
wouldn't be able to survive with porn
there's plenty of analog porn either i
did it for years I know porn yeah you
know like I would what not be able to
talk to my friends online as much I hate
talking to you idiots I'm just saying
dude yeah I don't think you did it I'll
do you go more than a week I would say
that I would prove it to you right now
but that would just be another stay yeah
exactly no we're not doing it we're not
like we're not stupid down to that level
do it you couldn't hear you're so full
of crap you your eyes are turning brown
I'll quit when I'm older yeah you quit
when you're dead that's about it
facebook is now letting organ donors
tell their friends yeah I mean this is a
feature that's been long clamored by the
Facebook population yeah something that
I've wanted to be doing for a while yes
ladies and gentlemen facebook will now
let you declare that you are yourself an
organ donor mm-hmm you can attach it to
your face
timeline sure Zuckerberg wet on abc's
good morning america i watched the clip
earlier today did you know yes it's
really easy just like click on a new
life event you mean when I'm internet
new look at that yeah I went on the
internet but I didn't have to know you
could have just uh imagined what he said
yeah yeah um uh then ye all you do is
click on like health and wellness you
know like the sub category within life
event yeah then just say that you're an
organ donor that's it it's easy yeah I
don't know are you an organ donor
yourself no I think I am are you thank
you oh yeah when do you designate that
when you get to my surgery okay why is
that I guess yeah i guess that is like
your license to die you know it's okay
you know you now one out of four
thousand right you could die now let's
uh let's see whether or not you're gonna
be an organ donor here of course your
organs are so my lord I guess my organs
are so like filled with candy and soda
already that no one will give the organs
of an eighty-year-old diabetic man yeah
but you I I i if i was you know love you
know knock on wood whatever were
superstitious crap you want to say if
you did happen to die in some sort of
auto wreck sure take my organs i can
then possess my new carrier yeah you
know through my organs I mean it's tough
making do you think that's the only
reason I'm don't write the only reason I
there so that my organs can possess the
the future person in need I mean I want
to say this is a good idea but I can
imagine paramedics having to pull out
their iPhones in an emergency situation
to see if the person they're helping is
actually an organ donor what's on there
like oh my god quick pull up their
Facebook pages guys doesn't have his
driver's license on him you know and
then update their status that they're
dead yeah because dead and we're
harvesting his organs right now it's so
messed up but some reason I mean it kind
of makes sense everyone has a facebook
profile look facebook is turning into
your Fifth Element multipass it really
is so you might as well have your that
sort of information out there too only
accessible by dipping in you get bit by
shark no one has their wallet in their
drivers like no the ocean L look at that
guy up okay yeah there you go man oh man
brave new world in it I know scary it's
organ donor I am can you specify which
organs you want to be donated like
you like on Ike I want to keep my liver
around um I'll prove to the entire world
right now yeah show off your driver's
license number while you're at it it's
right there let me see your picture
Delhi organ donor can you picture what
you want to see my photo yeah this is a
bad photo like bad oh my god Billie Joe
Armstrong seriously i got my trash
caning kids in high school you look like
a punk man i've only will if i were mall
security I'd kick you out of my plaza
it's funny because it's a really into it
snot intimidating of a photo but it's
it's just sort of like look what this
kids probably been on the born on the
wrong side of the railroad show you know
it's bad news why do retro tracks divide
social classes like that I was 17 I
would ask you to buy alcohol you look
like a very you look like a prime
candidate yeah you're that guy yeah yeah
my driver's license I mean I want to see
what are you but mine says organ donor
right at the bottom it's the first thing
they say yeah it's okay here's his
address and yes if he dies he would love
nothing more than to give his organs if
he does he dies if he dies he dies did
you picked up on that let me see your uh
let me see your thing right there you Oh
who's that little little boy right there
that's so weird god I'm so hot all right
you are pretty hot thank you um there's
bummer bummer news about a hulu sooner
or later hulu which is the content
delivery service owned by various
networks and corporations FOX NBC all
have steaks in it soon you will need or
basically Prue need to prove that you
yourself are a cable or satellite TV
subscriber in order to watch the service
now this is a big blow to those who wish
to cut the cord of cable obviously a lot
of people are trying to do that I mean
you know it's not it's not the most the
biggest deal to a lot of people I feel
like the majority of people who do use
hulu hulu low hulo do you subscribe to
cable and just sort of this
complimentary service so i don't think
the right obviously the majority of hulu
users will not be affected by this but
for that small mind
already that does in fact use it as a
means to cut the cord it's kind of a
blow to their to their sort of setup I
feel like they should use the same model
that they're going to do for the
Olympics and I don't know if we actually
talked about this on the show not I
think NBC is going to air Olympic
episodes to subscribers first brand then
distribute it online afterwards so if
you want to watch it there you have to
wait right I think they should do that
instead of requiring it for all hulu
members right like if you get up if
you're a subscriber a cable subscriber
then you'll get hulu TV shows like maybe
a couple days before nonsubscribers do
and that will incentivize people to sign
up yeah but this is different this is
cable subscription this is required it's
almost like it's something I mean am I
the only one that thinks that these
these are rumors still by the way now
it's it's no they uh it I mean it's
pretty uh it says rumor yeah but
everyone option i think it's updated
that it's gonna happen just not in the
immediate future um is it me or or do
these guys just not get it you know what
i mean the whole pull it's like what's
the freakin point of hulu then yeah what
is the point of it if you're not going
to allow people who don't have cable to
watch it what is the point you're still
serving me my ads I'm it's not nothing
has changed yeah you know if they're
gonna force people to subscribe to TV
then they should also to get rid of the
ads right of course and you're gonna
have to do that anyway where's why am I
doing this you know now what I want to
know is juice if you subscribe to it do
you still need to be a cable subscriber
like if you pay that eight dollar a
month fee which is the two million users
strong right now do you um yeah so it's
but I think that's what's unclear right
now is whether or not this mandate will
affect both sides of the fence right but
they just don't get it they just don't
get it the movie industry doesn't get it
the music industry is finally sort of
starting to get it with Spotify and
stuff like that right I feel like major
sort of convinced us of that the other
day people are making money they're
making their money on the spot of lies
and whatnot they're getting their
compensation right but i I just I don't
know how is this that's why people
signed up for
or Hulu in the first place right watch
free TV it's even dozen right away drug
dealers they give you a taste and then
when a time when you come back for more
you scratching your neck a little bit
got the itch yeah then like oh that's
gonna cost you four times what you
thought but this is on principle for you
because you already subscribe to a light
and cabling I own not both I have cable
but I'm just saying and like I said a
lot of people this will not affect a lot
of people have cable already right but I
don't know is like you they just don't
get it the whole point of going on the
internet is is is providing another
avenue for content three content and
what about three like I'm okay that it's
not free and when it's not free i mean
it's supported by Ed right right to me
that's not free right arguable but but
it's not completely ad-free your time
your times money then they're serving us
I don't know you know broadcast
television is free yeah you can get an
antenna and watch you know NBC CBS fox
get commercials the same sort of thing
let the piracy begin it's I mean it's
just nothing will change nothing will
change I mean I don't have cable and I
would definitely not pay for a
subscriber service just to get access to
hulu yeah I don't know it's interesting
topic let us know what you think we'll
take a break when we come back some
calls from the public and a few emails
in the queue for your listening pleasure
be back after this this is the 404 mr
effers the show where we all sing song
what
you
welcome back to the 404 stupid pet
tricks on the 404 what just watch a dog
who is waiting for his owner to return
to a bike yeah to just hop on what part
of the bike would you call that be back
yeah I believe the date of service this
career it's just it didn't look safe
though for the dog this dog right it was
a rear rack there you go that's that's a
technicality yeah you like boxes dog cat
yeah animal whatever you want on there
yeah I wanted to see someone come up and
try to steal the bike what would the dog
do you know like was it just like
bidelman I don't know would you try and
steal a bike that a dog is literally
hugging I mean it wasn't a very scary
dog you got a scary ver no no it's not a
scary dog but I still wouldn't be like
I'm gonna try and steal this bike well
that's why you got bike these guys start
bringing steaks around distract them
rather you throw the steak in front of
them when the dog goes Gilda you watch
too many cartoons that's how it works me
at stake like I'm reaching real like a
raw steak a rubber snake there you go
there you go cuz I do you watch a lot of
cut you do clearly watch too many
cartoons oh it's calls from the public
time time to show the love a jig 6404

New York area for the five borough tour

Syracuse from Wade I'm calling because
I'm coming into town this weekend to do
the five boro bike tour and I want to
see if any chance I might be seeing
Justin out there um I don't know tours
are your kind of thing but it would be
interesting to be able to say hello let
me know when where you're starting if
you're doing it and yes what you do you
doing that no why I'm going to be out of
town this is on right this Sunday
unfortunate do this in a couple years
I've been here I've never had the
opportunity you know this is this is
like when they it's like a 30 something
like 32
mile bike ride and they shut down like
the queensboro bridge and you get to
ride down Broadway ask your dad about I
bet every taxi driver in New York
freaking hates this day the recommended
is not drive it I know but is all of his
employees must hate is is not employ
sexy dress all the guys that get
observing from ya must hey mama out the
fact even though is taxi relations yeah
medallions out to the taxon just like
cards that's great um yeah it's I'm sure
it's it's a hellacious commute or in
town alright weekend I've always wanted
to do it though I heard there's a lot of
drunk people that just get wasted and
write it with everybody it's a huge
crowd 30 miles of drunk cycling does not
sound good now that very it's probably
gonna be hot this weekend too yeah I
want to though but I'm actually gonna be
in LA so I won't i won't be here for
friday's episode and monday's episode ok
friday monday as you're missing three
days day Friday Monday yeah Thursday
Friday all right that's good information
to have let me tell you that no yeah
yeah I'll be I'm gonna be going hey
you're not gonna help me interviewed
James Gunn no you know he was a all
right yeah it's not the now we've talked
about this already you know this no you
know I'm news to me ok alright Thursday
Friday Monday we'll find hope will find
guests to fill in for Justin you okay um
alright next call this is uh talking
about the cava Phi app that mr. major
who was on our show yesterday brought up
a for VAR i just wanted to comment about
a discussion you guys are having of
andrew guarding the apps that were being
developed for spotify and one particular
one I wanted to talk about was the cover
Phi AB now I think that that's cool
concept and I like the idea that you
just wave something in front of your
webcam it recognizes it yeah that's all
cool but I mean really I mean who has a
stack of CDs right next to the computer
ready to just be waived in front of the
webcam so they can get a playlist that's
not where you guys where you leave all
yours I heard from know anything I mean
I just don't see the practicality in
that I'd rather just type it in and get
a play with going that way I mean
personally I don't own any cds
everything's on my computer so i just
wanted to go with you guys thought about
all of it he doesn't get it really well
excuse me that's the cool thing about
cover
bye was that it was developed and push
live within 24 hours yeah okay so there
was zero research and development zero
sort of pre-production that went into
the sort of thing it was it was
comforted finish work done and finished
in the span of 24 hours at hackathon in
Amsterdam right arm the thing is this
guy yeah is not their target demographic
core he already has the cds on his
computer then yeah you wouldn't have a
need well no i think what he's saying is
why my scanning an album art when i can
literally just type in what i want to
listen to right it does make decent
point in that regard it's like why what
why wave it and you know you know it's
not going to be like a 12 handshake it's
gonna be like okay hold still click that
sort of thing these hackathons i think
are more about proof of concept exactly
exactly it's just it's a good idea no
was gonna be buying this yes cover file
nightly Sollers zinc is not buying them
facebook's not by and I'm Spotify is not
buying yeah maybe although maybe by the
people who develop that real quick who
have that up together but thats that's
what is it's more of like an
unbelievable 24-hour accomplishment I
think than anything else are talking
about the Wayne Brady episode sup guys
love the show just watch The Granary
show y'all did man i wish i was watching
it live but man it was hilarious love
the show but anyways I just wanted to
ask what kind of headphones was waiting
Brady using would like to know the name
of the brand and I always want to know
what Jeff was worse let me know what I
owe my headphones are those the one that
you always wear yeah these are um these
are by TDK yeah I don't know the Burt
the model um I believe though there's
those are the TDK st8 hundreds why would
they not have the model number on here
yeah you think they would they not do
that it's like not putting of the name
of the car on a car I don't understand
that we don't actually have a review up
yet yeah Bobby's no that's why you're
testing them right now oh but yeah
they're the team st 800s bike
okay uh did Wayne which ones did Wayne
Brady where it was a bantam yeah those
yeah uh yeah so these are the v-moda
crossfade m-80 s can I use those yeah
you can you go Thanks he said they were

Ferguson to the Late Late spot that's
what this guy's saying do that you'd be
the first Asian lightning have you the
first Asian on CBS oh no there's a guy
on Hawaii five-o degree guy he's
Hawaiian no no he's technically Korean I
think oh but I don't think that counts
for you ya know on a more serious note
ladies and gentlemen every now and then
we get calls from people who are you
know a little bummed out going through
some emotional uh sequences in their
life and you know to be totally as we
had someone club last week say hey I've
been through some tough times for four
really gets me through the day yeah uh
this is a truly touching and emotional
voice mail that we want to share with
you guys better buddy from Canada hey
Jeff Justin too buddy Massimo from
Canada I just finished listening to
Thursday's podcast and the gentleman
talking about you guys helping them
through tough times um believe it or not
it's actually true I'm actually going
through a separation here and it's
actually pretty tough and I mean there's
you don't do anything but for some
reason when i go to iTunes and i'm
downloading the 404 i'm getting excited
you're justin's laughing background and
jeff hearing you like you guys are
really pretty helping me men and like i
said it's some tough stuff going on here
but thanks for doing what you're doing
and i know i'll get through this but
thanks a lot for all what you doing in
that's uh that's unbelievable ow Massimo
that's crazy well we really appreciate
the the voicemail Massimo and obviously
the best of luck to you and you'll get
through all this stuff going on yeah in
your life and I'm sure everything will
work out it's good to hear that we're
pulling for your very kind of
distraction from that guy yeah it's
always our pleasure it's funny is like
you don't do anything yeah we could say
anything because I knew of it but no
that means so much man we really
appreciate hearing that yeah it takes a
big guy to step up and admit that for
sure so we were here give you a hug Oh
we'd be hugging the hell out of you
it'd be kind of awesome all uh some
emails to get to this is from our buddy
rich in Cleveland listening to Andrew
major talking about Spotify apps I
thought why I thought of one that would
qualify as a hydia does that mean anyway
yeah he's like although I'm stone sober
at work he works at a community radio
station he sees a ton of albums every
week what he wants is a Spotify app that
would let him described the album cover
to find music that's kind of interesting
what ya think about so a sort of uh a
description a word description about
what the album looks like because you
can't describe a record that you don't
know who it's by the next best thing is
to is to just do either lyrics or maybe
the the album cover so many albums that
he can visit vividly remember the album
art but have no idea what the band is I
any gives an example dude what was that
album that had the square headed robots
with the bird wings in crayon let me use
a describe if I find that out which
which record is that I have no I is that
master don know is like a bird on one of
the master I've no this is we're headed
robots absolutely not the worst i did
its color than the cover five I don't
think it's a terrible idea I just
personally don't know a lot of album art
covers okay well what I mean I'm only
the seminal albums like obviously like
blue album I can remember yeah uh I i'm
tryna ideally yeah that one would be
easy to describe i'm trying to think of
okay like naked baby in a pool I just
feel like the like that's digital music
has kind of put a minute ago albemarle
yeah album yet but I still think there
are far more although there's much more
of a back catalogue right that could be
described and and and sort of translated
right you know like I said naked baby in
a pool with dollar bill oh never mind
there you go so that would work out you
know it's not tourists idea ever and he
got it stone sober right now go to
Amsterdam get actually stones check it
out and heck hey hack that out yeah uh
this is something I want to bring up
it's a little techy but nevertheless
important Detroit from Alex
a couple weeks back you guys are talking
about how movies are being filmed and it
led to the topic of how we newer tvs
give them this weird look where no
matter what you watch it looks like it
was filmed on a home camera believe he's
talking about the the refresh rate like
the hundred twenty Hertz that sort of
thing uh he remembers me saying that uh
members me saying that he says uh he's
noticed it before and it was never
really apparent until he watched mission
impossible three on DVD uh yeah I know
what you're talking about dude it has to
do with that like it's like the motion
blur it's like the it's a technology
that TVs invent frames where there are
none so Phil movies are film 24 frames
per second uh what this technology does
is it inserts artificial frames to make
it look like there are more frames per
second when you do that it gives films a
very video artificial look and I'm
telling you this is one of those trends
that I just don't understand how it's
taking off it looks ridiculous I was at
somebody's house maybe a half a year ago
and they thought it was the greatest
thing ever and I'm like dude this looks
ridiculous you're you're basically
watching what the director did not
intend right and I that's what I
understand why people defend if Scorsese
or spielberger Christopher Nolan they
want their movies to look like that they
would shoot them to look like that you
are watching artificial knots why do
they have to understand what it has it
makes people think that the the
advertisement it's a gimmick it's a it's
a total gimmick the the claim is that it
looks smoother and yes it does look
smoother your but you are getting
artificial visual information right
you're not you're seeing frames that
aren't there on the source material is
that something you can turn off in this
yeah you could turn that off so I was it
called again um some I forget some
people call it like smoothing it has to
do with the refresh rate okay so it's
like 120 Hertz 240 hertz that whole
thing get that out of here get that out
of here it's not meant for your fragile
little human eyes ah calexico from jose
writes in and says just wanted to get
our take on the avengers movie are you
guys going to watch it I did go across
the border to Mexicali to watch it
yes you can do that sure oh yeah another
question do you know why it opened in
other countries this past Friday and

wanted to be nominated for an Oscar

you say that that it will you spend your
cash on this one or wait till it's out
