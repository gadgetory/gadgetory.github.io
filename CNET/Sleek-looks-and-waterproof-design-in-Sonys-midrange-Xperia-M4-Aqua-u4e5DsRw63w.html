these flagship experience at three
smartphone but don't quite have the
budget to stretch to it then its new
Xperia m4 aqua maybe just the phone for
you
from looks alone it's actually quite
difficult to tell the m4 apart from the
flagship Xperia z3 mostly because it's
got the same glass a front and back it
has the rounded edges which is
incredibly similar to the Xperia z3 and
of course typical Sony features like
this sticking out power button on the
side it is of course completely
waterproof down to a depth of one meter
for up to 30 minutes but thankfully they
haven't needed to cover the charging
ports the software that Sony has popped
on its phone looks much the same as
you'd find on the z3
although the m4 does come with Android
lollipop that's for the latest version
of Google's operating system it's
running on e Qualcomm octa-core
processor which would provide plenty of
power particularly as is backed up by a
hearty two gigabytes of RAM now on the
back of the phone you'll find a 13
megapixel camera which is a step down
from the 20 megapixels you'll find on
the z3 and there's a five megapixel
camera on the front of the phone as well
for those really awesome selfies it has
a 5-inch display which helped make the
phone fairly comfortable to hold and
it's 720p resolution does make icons and
text look fairly sharp interestingly
Sony records at the m4 can get a whole
two days of use out of a single charge
now that is quite a big claim however I
did find on the z3 the battery life was
very good so I do have high hopes of m4s
capabilities here the crucial factor of
course for a mid-range phone is the
price now sony says that the m4 aqua is
going to go on sale for 299 euros now
that converts to about 220 pounds which
is extremely reasonable considering what
this phone has we will see exactly how
much it is though when it goes on sale
later in the spring make sure to keep
your eye on Sina comm /m WC for more of
our coverage from the show floor in
Barcelona
I'm Andrew Hoyle the CNET and this is a
