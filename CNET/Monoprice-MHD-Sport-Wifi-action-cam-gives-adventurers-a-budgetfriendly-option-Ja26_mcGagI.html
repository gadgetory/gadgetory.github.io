while this little camera here produces
great video and has a lot of great
features those who just want a simple
device for capturing YouTube clips might
be better served with this the monoprice
NHD sport Wi-Fi action cam
unlike the competition you just get a
handful of shooting options like movie
capture 1080p or 960 PG at 30 frames per
second or 720p at 60 frames per second
time-lapse videos and it shoots 5
megapixel stills in a burst or one at a
time
also as the name implies it has built-in
Wi-Fi so you can connect to Android or
iOS devices and get a live view for the
camera and use it to view and transfer
recordings for sharing on the go in fact
for the low price of a hundred and fifty
dollars when I tested the camera quite a
bit comes with it you get a waterproof
housing good 260 meters as well as a
vented back for when you're on dry land
a couple of mounts that use a tee slot
for secure attachment as well as a
tripod mount and even a wrist remote for
starting and stopping recordings
monoprice also has several mounts
available as well as an adapter for
gopro mounts video quality is good
nothing you'd want to look too closely
at at large sizes and my cameras seem to
occasionally struggle with exposure
changes but if you're considering the
camera for sharing clips online and
viewing its small sizes out of computer
or mobile device and don't need Pro
results you probably won't be
disappointed I'm Josh Goldman and that's
a quick look at the monoprice MHD sport
Wi-Fi action
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
