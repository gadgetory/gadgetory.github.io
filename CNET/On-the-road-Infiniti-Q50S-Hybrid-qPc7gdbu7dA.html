a sporty sedan and coupe duo that struck
a very loud chord with buyers from a1 to
2013 and here's what's next let's drive
the all-new all tech q50 and its hybrid
escort for now it's easy to spot one of
these guys there's another daring leap
for infinity and if you've seen their o
Rouge show car on the circuit lately
kind of faithful to that overall look
and it lacks some of the pudgy nested a
few of its more recent siblings have now
what makes this an s first of all you've
got bigger disk rotors all around and
bigger calipers clamping on them bigger
wheels 19's instead of 17s little
different face makes it about an inch
longer than an on ass car and inside
you've got sports seats and magnesium
shifter paddles in front of you kind of
a standard gauge layout tach speedo fuel
only give wait you're in a hybrid is
that little swing gauge down that it
tells you if you're recharging on the
left or tapping electric power on the
right star the shows right here in the
center console not one but two screens
both are touch both are also driven by
an infiniti controller knob down here
and both are also accessible by voice
the one down here is the really
impressive one a very iPad like and not
by accident just for destination alone
look how many choices you got there are
eight ways to get where you're going
we're not done yet scroll over and
you've got another five do I really need
13 ways to find my destination we've
seen a lot of these various things
before in the apps panel but not this
before the app garage this is kind of a
little miniature App Store for this
vehicle clock and compass you don't care
about those drive performances
interesting this is going to bring up a
set of driving gauges on three different
panels it'll show you things anywhere
from economy to dynamics it's kind of a
weird hodgepodge but I must say it does
remind me of what happens in the Nissan
GTR where you've got addressable gauges
a virtual instrument panel to accompany
the one in front of you on the sillier
side of course you can pull up Facebook
more useful you have Google online
search in here all of this is through
your tethered phone by the way this is
not one of those cars it has built-in 3G
or 4G
now infinity connection is a series of
online services that are tied in through
your phone with an app called the
Infinity in touch app it gets you things
like pulling in a schedule connected
search you can search and then they have
to something sent a car from a Google
search on another machine a computer
what have you the last thing I want to
show you in this interface is the
Infinity drive mode selector similar to
what Ally's had in their drive mode
select for a while so my personal mode
can have engine and transmission
settings of any of these four I can set
up my steering for heavy standard or
light quick standard or casual response
and active trace control where it uses
braking inside the curve to yaw the car
around the corner and all that ties back
to a drive mode rocker switch here on
the console which runs you through three
modes you've got Sport and you can take
it down to standard and also down to eco
now under audio just about everything
you want is in here AM and FM with HD
Sirius XM still have a disc player in
here they haven't jumped on the trend of
unloading that iPod connectivity as well
nice clean well used interface I think
and of course bluetooth streaming audio
now above this beautiful in touch
controller is some very impressive turn
polishing that's been going on this is
kind of your standard Nissan navigation
map interface but notice they've cleaned
it up it's got much tighter dot
resolution they have finesse to the look
but it still is jarring li out of place
to my eye compared to the instrument
panel and the in touch controller this
is beautiful modern stuff this is last
decade kind of yanked into the present
like we've seen in some honda products
lately you get an awful lot of
duplication do it here with one
interface look at that
or you can do it down here with another
interface and they aren't identical
that's not great UI that's one of the
kinds of distractions that car makers
often forget about
now under the hood we've got a three and
a half litre Nissan v6 but of course
it's hooked up to an electric motor as
well that in this car is not about a
lean green weenie hybrid this is about a
performance hybrid horsepower 328 off
the gas engine plus sixty-seven off the
electric motor at net South o2 360
torque is 269 foot-pounds off the engine
214 off the electric motor but you can't
exactly sum those let's just say it's a
lot four point nine seconds 0 to 64 rear
wheel drive 5.2 if you get all-wheel
drive and that's for a car that way is
almost exactly two tonnes it's not the
lightest car out there 28 34 mpg for
this rear-wheel drive configuration so
notice we're not reaching for
astronomical fuel efficiency mean we
drove a Accord plug-in recently that was
kind of doing near 50 all the time but
that was aimed at a different kind of
driving the only transmission you can
get is a 7-speed conventional sort of
automatic the base car if you will is
rear-wheel drive or you can also option
it to all-wheel drive we recently did a
segment on CNET on cars about electric
power steering but Infiniti is doing
something in this q50 that's kind of
unprecedented look what's happening here
with their direct adaptive steering the
wheel becomes kind of a game controller
telling these electronic control units
here what they should tell the electric
steering rack to do this is
steer-by-wire folks the benefit of this
is you get lightning fast response from
your steering inputs from the wheel and
those front wheels can steer at slightly
different angles which is actually a
good thing they can have their own
little independent take on what you're
telling them to do with your steering
input can lead this amazing handling
improvements now if you're spooked by
the fact this is all done electronically
notice that here in the steering column
there's a clutch and if this electronic
system fails that clutch re-engages
and now you have a traditional
mechanical steering column back in place
so you're back in control of the car now
we see a lot of cars these days that
have lane departure warning and
prevention fairly common stuff but on
this menu in the Infiniti it's right
next to lane departure but it's
different active lane control is like a
subtle cousin of lane departure instead
of yanking you back from drifting
the wrong lane it just keeps you right
in your lane nicely centered he uses
cameras to see if the lanes are bending
slightly it can detect and correct for
wind drift or even if the chatter in the
bad road surface makes the car drift off
of line it's super elegant and it
basically does what you do as you're
driving down the road
what an amazing steering system this
electric steer by wire is uncannily
sharp and precise add to that this
active trace control where it'll drag
the inside brake to kind of yo you in
and it's just an amazingly nimble
biggish car now on the freeway that lane
control technology is also like magic
the first I've driven that is able to
basically exhibit almost human-like
instincts for noodling down the lane
it's it's so subtle that's where the
magic lies a lot of great power in this
vehicle but you do have to coax that I
find when I first hit the throttle
almost a second before I get that boost
of power that's not good one last note
there is a look forward forward
collision technology in this car that
goes a step further it's not just
predicting collision with the car in
front of you it can they say predict and
prevent a collision based on the
behavior of the car in front of the car
in front of you
the downside is I don't have any way to
test or demonstrate it without setting
this car back to infinity on a flatbed
truck so want to take their word for it
but I believe that's also a first okay
you can get into a new q50 for as little
as thirty seven thousand dollars but not
this q findi we've got a hybrid and
we've got an S so we're talking nearly
forty eight thousand dollars page
delivered here's the weird one almost
1500 more for navigation that's right
this car does not come standard with nav
or satellite radio that nav package is
how you get both I'm kind of irked by
that now the big one is the deluxe
technology package five thousand dollars
but I think it's worth it because that's
a huge package of almost all of this
driver assistance and handling
assistance tech that we were so
impressed by so while it's chunky I
don't think it's a ripoff
all in word about 54 to delivered CNET
style that's rear wheel drive all wheel
drives going to add 1800 what infiniti
is done here is push the envelope in two
or three important areas
of driving technology they've wrapped it
up in a really good-looking package and
they've decided to take hybrid the
performance direction not so much the
efficiency direction I want to see them
simplify and refine that infinity in
touch interface too much going on there
and also bring it better in harmony with
the main screen I also think they should
improve throttle response because
there's too much goodness under the hood
of this car to let bad pedal linearity
ruin it gee</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
