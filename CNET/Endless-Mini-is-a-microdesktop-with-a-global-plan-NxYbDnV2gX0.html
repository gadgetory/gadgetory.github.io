computer that works for almost anybody
almost anywhere in the world a long-term
goal not always successfully met this
latest version has a lot going for it
it's called the endless mini it's
essentially a linux-based little plastic
desktop starts at just $79 99 if you
want to add a a wireless antenna and
very importantly it comes pre-loaded
with a lot of content so that it'll work
for you even if you don't have an active
internet connection which is not
something that everybody can take for
granted
it also comes pre-loaded with a lot of
you know every day option might need
there's a word processor built in and a
lot of these apps are a little bit slow
to launch because this is a very very
very low powered Linux based system here
but if you want to do some basic typing
and word processing this should work
just fine you've also got basic music
and video players photo editing app but
what I really like is a lot of the
preloaded built-in content that comes on
the on the hard drive there's a full
encyclopedia on here so you don't have
to go online and pull the information
down from Wikipedia or wherever else you
can just look right here there's also a
virtual school app which gives you
access to Khan Academy videos and a wide
variety of topics they're also built in
things like cooking guides and health
guide so basically just PDFs that are
usually illustrated with an internet
connection were able to surf the web
fairly well get to our favorite cloud
side stream videos on YouTube or music
from SoundCloud for example and for a
$79 computer that's pretty much what
you're looking for it's not really for
me or you there are a lot of other low
cost options like the Intel compute
stick that might be better if you're
looking to spend the least amount
possible for the most possible computer
but there is a big audience out there
that will find a lot to like and a lot
of use out of the endless mini</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
