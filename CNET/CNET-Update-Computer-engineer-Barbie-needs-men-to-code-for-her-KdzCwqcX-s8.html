only she didn't need men to do all her
coding I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET update if you want to
encourage young girls to study science
and math and become computer engineers
you may not want to use a Barbie book
for inspiration the internet is abuzz
right now over a 2010 barbie children's
book titled i can be a computer engineer
you see the problem with the story is
that in the book barbie doesn't know how
to program and instead has two guys
program for her and in the story she
also infects her computer and her
sisters skippers computer with a virus
and she goes to her computer programmer
friends to help recover the files this
blew up online after screen writer
pamela ribbon wrote a hilarious takedown
of the book and now the internet is
doing what the internet does best taking
matters into their own hands and
rewriting the dialogue in light of all
this Mattel has issued a statement about
the book the vice president of global
brand marketing for Barbie said the
portrayal of barbie in this specific
story doesn't reflect the brand's vision
for what barbie stands for we believe
girls should be empowered to understand
that anything is possible and believe
they live in a world without limits we
apologize that this book didn't reflect
that belief all barbie titles moving
forward will be written to inspire girls
imaginations and portray an empowered
barbie character well I'm glad to hear
that if you have your own ideas on how
this book should have been written
there's a site where you can insert your
own text into the book to give girls the
inspiration to protect our cyber world
of tomorrow in the meantime there are a
few other tech stories for all you boys
and girls out there Facebook has created
yet another standalone app but this time
it's just for Facebook groups Facebook
isn't forcing you to download it like it
did with the messenger app if any young
girls grow up to become Facebook
engineers I hope you stop this madness
of unnecessary Facebook apps for
separate functions and in other news
some people are taking advantage of a
new price matching policy at Walmart
and have trick stores into selling
PlayStation 4 game consoles for as low
as $50 this holiday season Walmart is
promising to match amazon's prices but
some grinches out there have cheated and
created bogus Amazon seller accounts
listing ps4's for a fraction of their
$400 price tag
people are now tweeting about getting
away with this cheat I'm sure Walmart
and other stores will Weizen up and
change the policies to avoid the scam
that's your tech news update you can
head to my blog post for links on where
you can write your own feminist hacker
Barbie book and email us with your new
Barbie story from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
