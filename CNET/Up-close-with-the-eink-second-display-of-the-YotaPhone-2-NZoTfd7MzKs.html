at least according to the yotaphone -
it's an Android phone with a 5 inch LCD
display on one side and a touchscreen a
inch display on the other now that might
sound a little bizarre and I'd agree
with you to be honest but the idea isn't
as daft as it might seem at first LCD
screens use a lot of power but as a ink
screen to only use power when it
refreshes what's on the screen they're
much more efficient the rear screen
works a lot like Android it can show
four panels that you can swipe between
each displaying information like the
weather your RSS feeds the time employee
notifications and can also give
shortcuts to apps or your favorite
contacts more useful though is its
ability to mirror the regular Android
interface yotaphone doesn't have a great
selection of its own apps that use the
back screen but by mirroring you can use
the Kindle app for your ebooks or keep a
Google Maps route displayed on the back
for as long as you need without draining
the power it's not suitable for watching
videos or playing games but if you do
spend your commute reading ebooks you'll
almost certainly find it very handy if
you're on your way to an unfamiliar
location with only 2% battery remaining
you can quickly take a screenshot of
your map and put it on the e-ink screen
even when the phone dies completely that
screenshot will still be there you'll
still be able to find your way it's
actually the second generation yotaphone
in this version makes a whole bunch of
improvements over its predecessor its
design is considerably improved and
specs have been given a much-needed
boost - including nippy quad-core
processor a full HD LCD display and an 8
megapixel camera it's price puts it
along smartphone toppdogg's like the
galaxy s5 the iPhone 6 and the Sony
Xperia z3 now doing battle against these
guys is difficult enough even for
established names let alone for an
unknown Russian brand its rear screen
though is a unique feature and while it
won't appeal to everyone it's likely to
find some fans among big books loving
crowd I'm Andrew Hoyle for CNET and this
is the yotaphone 2
