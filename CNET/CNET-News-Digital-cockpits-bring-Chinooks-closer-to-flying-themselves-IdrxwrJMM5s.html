received a highly sophisticated tool new
helicopters the ch-47f Chinooks monitor
navigate and essentially fly themselves
the previous Chinook model the 47 d was
introduced about 30 years ago
technologies changed a bit since then
just take a look at the cockpit which
has gone from using these needle based
instruments to using a slew of computer
displays 17 computers and cockpit
technology called the common avionics
architecture system or Cass turn the
ch-47f into a smart aircraft autopilot
features simplify flight planning we can
sit on the ground on a computer get a
laptop if you will and program in
everything you want the aircraft to do
we take that that digital card plug it
into the cockpit and then upload that
data into the aircraft and tell it what
we want it to do where we want it to go
a ring laser gyroscope enables greater
accuracy it's so sensitive that the
aircraft can register the Earth's
movement when it's rotating it knows
it's doing that it's not accurate which
gives us the ability to hover within one
foot of a coordinate that we receive so
one of our jokes is do you want the
front of the aircraft over your part or
the back of the aircraft over your bed
or over your LZ because you can be that
precise yes with the Cask cockpit
technology the Chinook's can fly in less
than ideal conditions then in addition I
get this information which is our hover
symbology that tells us what we're doing
in a hover how high we are off the
ground where we are in relationship to a
point on the ground I don't have that at
all in a D model
I have no hover reference information at
all other than looking at your window so
in bad weather just landings
snow conditions I can see all this data
right here know exactly where I am the
new Chinooks were designed to reduce
vibrations why is that important a
smoother ride means you can fly longer
without suffering from helicopter
fatigue they put in what's called
monolithic construction which is a new
construction technique on the airframe
beefing it up making it stiffer in all
the key areas what compiled 'its do now
that technology is saving them so much
time focus on their mission in stockton
