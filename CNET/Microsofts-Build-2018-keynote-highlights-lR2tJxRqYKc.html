have enshrined a set of principles that
ensure that we preserve this human right
protect this human right we ensure that
when we use data it is to benefit the
user we ensure that the user is always
in control of their data and its use
it's just like security we're never
going to be done we are going to
continuously commit ourselves to work to
preserve privacy we need to ask
ourselves not only what computers can do
but what computers should do that time
has come we formed an ethics board
inside the company which is a very
diverse group of people who govern the
products we build the projects we engage
in but beyond that we are also investing
in tools because one of the key things
that we have to do is put tools in the
hands of developers Microsoft is
partnering with DJI to bring a sure IOT
edge right to their drones and this is
significant because it means any Azure
developer using Azure machine learning
can develop AI models and deploy them to
their drones
it also means I can take that same AI
model that went to the Qualcomm camera
and deliver it to the DJI drone now this
incredible drone is a DJI m2 10 RTK and
it's capable of running a dirt I Oh T
edge right on board the smaller drone is
a DJI Mavic air and it's perfect for
learning the principles of flight and
for developing and testing your AI
models now it's all well and good to
talk about drones but I bet you'd like
to see me fly one and I would love to
but unfortunately in a room like this
you need a commercial drone pilot
license to do that and they're
incredibly hard to get so for that we're
welcome Francisco from DJI out to the
stage to fly for us come on out now
Francisco Francisco is going to be
flying the DJI Mavic air over the pipes
that you see here which represent the
ones a hundred and fifty feet up on the
roof and the Mavic air is going to be
streaming video back to the laptop here
which is running azure IOT edge as well
as our AI model all packaged up in a
great you WP app and when it sees the
anomaly it'll draw that same yellow
bounding box that you saw with a
qualcomm camera alright let's check it
out
now as you can see we're detecting that
anomaly in real time for the first time
ever were able to stream video back from
that drone to this laptop running IOT
edge and our AI model which was
developed in the cloud
and as I mentioned the M 200 will be
running that right on board great Thank
You Francisco
I'm really thrilled to announce the
preview of project brain wave project
brain wave is a distributed real-time AI
fabric that today is working with FPGAs
from Intel to bring the best-in-class
real-time AI low latency AI capabilities
and inferencing capabilities it has 5x
lower hardware latency than TPU for
real-time AI and this is going to be
available in preview for developers and
we're also going to extend it all the
way to the edge we're working with our
system partners to take FPGA and make it
available wherever asher is available
and we have many customers who have
these high precision and high throughput
needs who are working with us and one
such customer is table and so let's roll
the video to show you how they're using
FPGA for real-time AI already people
tend to think of jabil as a contract
manufacturer we are more than that or a
manufacturing solutions provider we've
been talking with Microsoft about
project brainwave the benefit of the
FPGA is the ability to deploy our
machine learning models at the edge at a
lower cost than GPUs but at a higher
performance capability than CPUs the
early test result from Microsoft has
shown it PJs capable of predicting 550
images the second comparing with the CPU
cluster who is 40 images the second
the potential for project brainwave is
substantial and allowing us to move
forward at scale or machine learning
across table very excited
alexxa add milk to my shopping list I've
added milk to your shopping list Alexa
open Cortana Cortana here how can I help
how's my day I'll take a look I see two
events for today first up at 5:30 p.m.
celebration with Tom at harvest vine and
then at 8 p.m. pick up Maddie from
soccer what can I do for you send an
email to Tom Taylor saying I'll see you
tonight
sure I'll email Tom Taylor I'll see you
tonight ready to send it yes
great I've sent it how can I help I'm
done very cool later I love being able
to talk to both Cortana and Alexa on my
PC let me show you how they helped me
through my day oh I see I have an email
for Megan about dinner tonight at
harvest fine hey Cortana where is
harvest fine harvest 9 is about 2 miles
away at 2700 1 East Madison and Seattle
better get going hey Cortana open Alexa
hi there
this is Alexa how can I help get me a
ride to harvest fine
there is an uberx two minutes away from
your Alexa address should I order it yes
please ok requesting your ride this may
take a few moments would you like to
continue yes
okay you're a bird driver sarah is
arriving look for a Toyota Camry what's
next
turn off the lights please what else can
I help you with what do you think about
Cortana
I like Cortana we both have experience
with light rings although hers is more
of a halo is there anything else
thanks that's it
just a few of the things that Alexa and
Cortana help me do throughout my day
this experience is still in occur in a
limited beta but you can go to this
website to be notified when we go live
today we are incredibly excited to
announce two new mixed reality business
applications Microsoft Remote assist and
Microsoft layout and these are joining
the Microsoft 365 family and available
for public preview starting May 22nd
with Microsoft Remote assist first-line
workers can bring an expert right where
they need them and they can share what
they're seeing this is really important
because often they don't have the help
they need on-site they can collaborate
to solve problems faster using heads-up
hands-free video calling image sharing
and mixed reality annotations and the IT
administrators they can count on secure
access secure communications through
Microsoft teams and then those experts
they don't have to head out into the
field or hop on a plane to solve
problems this really expedites their
troubleshooting and it eliminates a ton
of travel costs
now with Microsoft layout teams can
experience designs at real world context
they can share and edit those designs in
real time and they can make better
decisions faster there are a lot of ways
to design spaces right now but it's so
hard to visualize them in the real world
at size scale and context which means
that decisions end up taking a lot
longer
they should and often costly rework is
needed but with Microsoft layout teams
can make decisions it used to take weeks
or months they can often make them in
just days so you remember those
workflows I was talking about the
beginning so first we're releasing these
two applications against those first two
workflows and soon we'll be cheering
more about how we're going to help with
training and development and product
focused collaboration patiska aerospace
we partner with the world's leading
aerospace companies to simplify their
supply chain management we have a
complex flow of materials in our factory
to keep production running smoothly our
top priority is keeping people safe and
making sure they have access to all the
tools and information they need to make
better decisions quickly Microsoft's
mixed reality tools are helping us get
there as we take on new projects we need
to optimize our workflows with Microsoft
layout we're able to make design changes
in our actual factory space with 3d
holograms once we have an optimized
workflow we use spatial analytics to
help drive quality improvements we're
running 24/7 on most saws so it's
expensive to take one offline
spatial analytics listens to our
machines and helps to tell us the right
time to replace a saw blade balancing
quality with the bottom line
integration with teams and Cortana
allows our workers to make quick in
contacts decisions that speed up
production with Microsoft's mixed
reality tools we're able to work faster
safer and at a higher quality than ever
before
we can't wait to scale this across our
entire organization there's so much
possibility</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
