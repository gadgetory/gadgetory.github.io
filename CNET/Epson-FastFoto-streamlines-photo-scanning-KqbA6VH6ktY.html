family with heaps of printed photos
they've been meaning to turn them into
digital images but they don't have the
technical know-how or just haven't
mustered up the energy to deal with the
tedium of sorting scanning and
organizing them sure they could send
boxes of photos out to a service but
many people are a little too risk-averse
for that so the Epson fast photo FF 640
scanners for them fast photo looks like
a typical sheetfed scanner but it's
specifically designed to handle multiple
photo sizes ranging from two by two to
eight and a half by 120 and a stack of
up to 30 it also has a neat novelty
which is the ability to scan the back of
the photo to capture any notes and it's
pretty fast I clocked it at 1.6 seconds
per photo for four by sixes at 300 dpi
it comes with custom software that's
pretty basic
it lets you batch name the scans which
is nice and perform some automatic
corrections and color restoration
there's also a browser which lets you do
basic cropping and rotation or applied
the same automatic Corrections one nice
touch is being able to insert a creative
date into the photo metadata however for
the sake of simplicity the software is
too limited and it's not smart enough
which means there's still a lot of pre
and post scan sifting and sorting to do
and at least to my eyes the scans and
automatic Corrections aren't great the
corrections increase contrast so you
lose detail and the color restoration is
way too blue plus the scans are really
soft even at 600 dpi and while you can
use it as a regular document scanner
it's still kind of expensive at six
hundred and fifty dollars</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
