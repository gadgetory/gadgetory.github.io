Lego dimensions the game itself works
like Skylanders or Disney infinity place
one of the lego minifigs or vehicles on
the included type ad and the figure
appears is a playable character in the
game we had some hands-on time with this
genius concept and sat down with
producer Doug Hader to talk about what
players can expect something that's
really interesting about the what you
get in the starter pack is the lego toy
pad it is our base reader that reads the
the information that's contained in each
toy tag to bring to life those toys in
the game it's much more than a reader
device it's an interactive reader device
the toy pad integrates on screen
gameplay with old-school LEGO building
players will need to move minifigs
around to solve puzzles and rebuild
vehicles to access new powers swapping
between playing the video game and
playing with Lego bricks is a totally
seamless experience just like kids
make-believe with those bricks in the
real world to create completely mashups
fantasy scenarios we wanted that
experience to happen in this game so
we've removed all the barriers between
the different brands the stages are
enormous the game is packed with Easter
eggs and even with 14 different
franchises already in play Lego promises
even more on the way as we roll out the
game we've got you know in the starter
pack brands like DC Comics Lord of the
Rings lego movie universe all
represented in the starter pack part of
our wave 1 launch and over the next you
know six to nine months we're gonna be
releasing additional waves of content so
you can get Ghost Busters and Midway
arcade and more Doctor Who content more
back to the future content you'll be
able to pick up the Lego dimensions
corset on September 27 for playstation 4
xbox one playstation 3 xbox 360 and wii

article and stay tuned for the full
review on cnet
