buzzer part and now for the gadget of
the week the gadget of the week is the
signe OSN a800 it's this tiny little mp3
player with this great retro design it
almost looks like a calculator and each
button has a dedicated function plus
there's this cool little round screen up
in the corner it comes in a variety of
color trims like black with red or
yellow or this awesome 70s looking blue
and white and you know I mean it does
stuff plays music it cost $250 for one
gigabyte which yeah I know but think of
it as a stand-in for your Porsche see
now that's a midlife crisis you can
afford and now for the news Dell
announced that it will recall 4 million
laptop batteries after several
high-profile cases in which Dell
batteries began smoking and even burst
into flame now the batteries were
actually made by Sony which supplies
laptop batteries to several
manufacturers including Apple Lenovo HP
and presumably Sony weirdly though only
Dell is actively recalling batteries or
even investigating and in fact HP went
so far as to say it's a Dell problem
well sure that's because HP's got that
great new marketing campaign for
business travelers nothing live-ins up a
lonely hotel room like a cozy little
chemical fire
new special effects budget Apple this
week sent cease and desist letters to
two companies trying to stop them from
using the word pod in their names the
company says it's trying to protect the
iPod brand and claims that a laptop case
maker called tight pod and the makers of
a device called profit pod create
confusion among consumers reached for

streamlined external housings that
enclose engines machine guns are fuel
protective coverings that encase the
eggs of some insects and fish the Prince
of Darkness pieces of data proof of
delivery and the Latin root of the word
