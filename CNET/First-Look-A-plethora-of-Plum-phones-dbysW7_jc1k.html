at CTIA 2012 in New Orleans with plum
mobile now you guys might not have heard
of them they're based in America they're
popular in Latin America and they're
trying to expand here in the United
States and here we have their most
recent devices coming out some are
introduced here at CTIA let's take a
look now here we have the calibre 3G
it's the best-selling mid to entry-level
phone from plum it's just a feature
phone so there are basic kind of
applications that you can use like
calculator and calendar and it comes in
three different colors white black and
grey here we have the orbit it's an
Android Gingerbread phone it has a
touchscreen and dual camera and comes in
three colors black white and pink this
is the wicked 3G now it's kind of the
same as the orbit except it also is a
Wi-Fi hotspot it can connect up to five
devices and it's still Android
Gingerbread so don't be fooled with
these kind of funky cute Mac icons here
we have the capacity it's a little
higher and compared to the other ones
that we've seen before it's also a dual
camera it has a bigger LCD screen and it
measures 3.5 inches across here we have
the mic now I know what you're thinking
it kind of looks like a Galaxy Note in
that it has this huge generous 5-inch
screen but it's not associated with it
in any way there's no stylus but there
is a 5 megapixel camera in the back and
it runs on Android Gingerbread it does
also make calls lastly here we have the
debut it looks like a tablet and in some
ways it is it has a 7-inch generous
screen now you can use this to make
phone calls but it would look pretty
funky being held next to your ear
as you can see it was meant to be held
horizontally for media viewing and video
chatting as you can see by the webcam
here on the rear there's a 5 megapixel
camera and the debut comes in both black
and white
now all these phones are available
online at plumb - mobile comm and small
retailers they're all unlocked so you
can choose any care you want and save
for the tablet they all have dual SIM
card
again I'm Lynn from CNET here at CTIA at
Plum Louisville</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
