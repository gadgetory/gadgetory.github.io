CES this year and razor is diving into
the scene to with OS VR this is an
attempt at open-source virtual reality
what does that mean well this
head-mounted display is meant to be
interchangeable and kind of hackable so
people would buy it for 199 dollars
later this year should be able to buy
other parts and pieces and swap out
displays and and other elements as
needed this is compatible with other
forms of virtual reality oculus decays
to kits linux and android so technically
you could run a wire out of this connect
the tool each do my belt box and you
could connect to other other elements as
well this has positional tracking there
are other companies that are going to be
partnering with this down the road and
each individual eyepiece is adjustable
which is something that's not all vr
headsets have and that's kind of nice to
have and there's a 5.5 inch 1080p
display that's in here the promise is
that down the road you could actually
swap out your own parts and maybe if you
find one that's higher res and you want
to spend up or find a way to do it you
could do that there are five screws on
top delighted open it up and razor is
actually allowing you to check out the
parts and the plans online and be able
to 3d print your own parts if you feel
inspired so VR hackers rejoice o SVR is
an attempt to enter that space we'll see
how it goes but there's a lot of you are
at the show and there are a lot of
goggles to put on my face I'm Scott
Stein here with razors o SVR</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
