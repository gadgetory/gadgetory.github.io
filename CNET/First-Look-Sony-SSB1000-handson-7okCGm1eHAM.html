cnet.com and I'm here with a pair of
basic bookshelf speakers these retail
for about $65 online there's a Sony SSB
1000 books shelf speakers these retail
for around $65 or so online the price
seems to fluctuate a little bit but
these are basic bookshelf speakers and
they actually sound pretty decent for
the price they have a decent amount of
base not incredibly well-defined base
but we paired these up with a $25 lip I
amp so you have a pretty good system for
under $100
these do have a 5.25 inch woofer and a
one-inch tweeter there's also a step up
version of this speaker called the
sb3000 that's actually a bigger
bookshelf speaker with three drivers
that actually maybe be the better deal
but these are smaller more compact and
for a lot of people this will make a
nice little desktop system we didn't
compare these with a pair of Dayton
Audio speakers that retail for around
4045 dollars
these have a little bit better build
quality it has a faux wood grain finish
on these the Dayton's looked a little
bit cheaper but the Dayton's did sound a
little bit better they're slightly
bigger speaker with more well defined
bass it's important to note these are
passive speakers so you will have to
hook them up to some sort of amp they do
have plastic spring clip wire connectors
on the back again nothing fancy they do
come with some speaker wire and just
have to hook them up into an amp I'm
David Connelly and those are the sony
SSB 1000 books shelf speakers</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
