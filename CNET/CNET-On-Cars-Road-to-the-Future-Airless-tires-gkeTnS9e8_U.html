latest concept of an air free tire my
tire like a wheel assembly first of all
notice the large diameter hub so they
can create these veins of thermoplastic
at the length or height that they want
them to be they've got some give in them
as you can see they're they're pretty
stiff felt on the other side is another
set of these vanes bent the other way
and this they say is key and different
from a lot of other designs because the
tires got two ways of supporting the
vehicles weight as it goes over terrain
of course you can't get a flat of course
you can't get a blowout but again like
we said that doesn't happen that often
so the other benefits here would be what
extremely stiff in cornering I mean this
doesn't have any give going that
direction as you can imagine very little
you don't have a sidewall squash as
you're working through corners it might
even be unnerving how stiff it is and
then notice this the tread is actually
the part you replace the wheel unless
you damage it doesn't get replaced all
you do is basically recap it with
another piece of trip making it very
environmentally friendly you're just
replacing this strip of thin tread
rubber Michelin's tuile also uses a thin
outer tread layer then an array of long
spokes to give the compliance needed to
create a good contact patch then a more
dense matrix of spokes closer to the hub
and that creates an energy absorbing
device between the car and the road
bright X as its energy return wheel is
designed to take the impacts of the road
and instead of transferring all of that
to the suspension to deal with turns it
into a bit of torque to aid the cars
forward progress or the opposite flow
during braking and resilient
technologies is focused on airless tires
for military applications or a flat from
strand soldiers in a bad place
their design uses a honeycomb of polymer
veins and they say 30% of those can be
blown or shot out the tire will still
function adequately and find the airless
tired thing fascinating because of the
low maintenance extreme durability and
it's got a nice kind of environmental
footprint we throw away a lot of tires
that we have to find something to do
with and this would erase most of that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
