with the connected by TCP wireless LED
lighting kit and this is a new smart
home option for your lighting needs that
offers three LED light bulbs a smart hub
for control those bulbs and also our
mote control so you can physically press
a button and dim them or turn them on or
off now let's talk about the bulbs here
for a second these are pretty decent in
terms of their brightness they put out
800 lumens which is fairly comparable to
a 60 watt incandescent bulb a lot of CFL
and LED bulbs will say that there's 60
watt replacements but they won't put out
that much light they'll put out six
hundred lumens or six fifty and that's
close but not quite right 800 lumens
that's a good number so these are nice
bright bulbs so how does this bulb
compared to other bulbs like it well
let's take a look here we've got the TCP
bulb on the left and then we've got in
the middle here the Philips hue bulb now
the Philips hue is a little dimmer it's
600 lumens you can see a slight
difference in the bright and it's not
too terribly noticeable but it's there
and then over here on the right we've
got the Insteon LED bulb and that's 591
lumens it's the dimmest of the three but
it's still a very good bulb the three of
them are very comparable and they're
comparable in price so if you're looking
at your smart home lighting options
consider all three of them once you set
these bulbs up and plug the hub into
your router you'll be able to download
the free TCP app for your Android or iOS
device using that app you'll be able to
control the bulbs from your phone or
your tablet and that includes dimming
them automating them so if you want them
to turn on in the morning and turn off
at night whatever you need you can set
that up and it's a great app it works
well it's very intuitive I liked it and
it's a rugged light too if you drop this
thing it'll bounce before it breaks this
kit will cost you one hundred and sixty
nine dollars and then if you want to buy
additional bulbs for your system they'll
cost thirty bucks each that's a little
high for my taste because think about
the philips hue bulbs change color and
are also compatible with IFFT and the
revolve hub and a lot of third-party
apps that kit has three bulbs in a hub
that cost $1.99 that's just $30 more and
I think that's a lot more functionality
for the extra price so I'd probably go
with Philips hue instead of this kit if
I was spending that much
if you want a simple smart home lighting
solution these bulbs work well the app
is good the system is easy to set up so
it's not a bad option but for me
personally I think you kind of kind of
go a philips hue if you're spending
above one hundred and fifty dollars it's
just thirty dollars more and you can do
a lot more with those bulbs so i say go
with that but it's still a quality kit
so take a look at it for seeing that I'm
right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
