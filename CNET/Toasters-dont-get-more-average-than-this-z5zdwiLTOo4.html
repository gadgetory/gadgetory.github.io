review of the Hamilton Beach classic
chrome to slice toaster wait come back
don't stop the video don't go anywhere I
know I know the toaster just hold on
don't stop the video just yet give this
thing a chance it might not be the most
high-tech thing you're gonna see on CNN
today but i bet you eat toast more often
than you think and that makes toasters
relevant this one does a good job an
average job i would say it never wow me
but it never disappointed me and it
looks okay doing it it's got this shiny
build it's a little shiny for my taste I
would want it quite so reflective I like
more of a brushed metal look I do think
that the classic look gets a bit
undercut by these buttons on the side if
you take a look it's got this kind of
cheap plastic look the font isn't great
the lights look really dated it looks
more like something from the 80s and I
don't know it just doesn't look great in
my opinion the bottom line is that this
is just an average toaster and that's
really all you can expect from it at
thirty bucks that said the design of it
isn't the greatest and there are other
toasters that cost about the same in my
opinion look a lot better so I say shop
around find one that fits your aesthetic
a little better than this one and go
with that you can also consider
splurging on a higher end unit if i had
to pick i'd go with the cuisinart cpt
440 that's a 100-dollar model that looks
very nice did a great job in our
performance test has a cool lever lyst
build but again 100 bucks that's a lot
to spend on a toaster I couldn't blame
you one bit if you didn't want to so if
you are in that camp feel free to go the
cheaper unit I'd probably go with one
other than this thanks for watching you
can check out my full review of the
hamilton beach classic chrome 2-slice
toaster at cnet com along with the rest
of my small appliance reviews for seen
that appliances I'm right Chris
