we generally mean it's smaller than a
standard tower desktop somehow designed
to fit into a typical living room or
entertainment center and it has some
special features that make it especially
useful for multimedia tasks the new HP
pavilion wave is a compact triangular pc
covered in a grey woven fabric it
reminds me of a bookshelf speaker just
modern enough to fit in anywhere and its
design conveys its abilities while this
is a standard Windows 10 desktop in many
ways it's almost more of a speaker than
a computer like the Amazon echo which it
vaguely resembles the central mass is
largely taken up with a single top
firing speaker designed for 360 degrees
sound a parabolic reflector at the very
top pushes the sound out and Walt won't
replace a big pair of powered bookshelf
speakers or your home entertainment
surround sound system it's pretty hefty
sounding for a small form factor desktop
especially as most desktops don't even
have built-in speakers at all inside
you'll find current gen Intel Core I
series processors up to 2 terabytes of
storage and even optional AMD graphics
for video editing and maybe a little
light gaming + HP says it'll drive to 4k
monitors at once</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
