and tablets are evolving into
multifunctional devices so we're taking
two lifelong rivals and throwing them
into the ring it's a prize five foot out
between Apple's iPad pro and Microsoft
Surface pro for our judges for this
fight our senior editor Dan the man
Ackerman senior editor Scott primetime
Stein and you know who can't go wrong
Tom we'll take all three judges blind
scores and average them out to the
nearest tenth of a point the final prize
five score will be an average of all
rounds using the same system let's get
ready to rumble round one is design no
surprises here iPad pro brings the same
classic ipad design with its smooth
corners and edges and a 12-point 9 inch
display bringing a 264 pixel per inch
density it's literally a bigger iPad the
surface pro design improves with a
larger twelve point three inch screen at
a 267 PPI density it still has its
signature adjustable kickstand and its
sharp corners and edges bring a more
industrial feel to the design I is in
the beauty of the beholder and our
judges give the edge to the iPad with a
four and the surface pro gets a three
point eight next round is user interface
and navigation iOS is still extremely
easy to use but just because it's great
on a phone doesn't mean it's as good on
a big screen split-screen multitasking
while watching a video clip is the most
an iPad has ever done but iOS needs more
if Apple wants us to truly replace your
laptop Windows 10 was made to work with
the surface pro 4 it's seamless when
you're in desktop mode and a quick
switch turns it into tablet mode both
work nicely but it's better for desktop
style work compared to tablet apps
because it doesn't have nearly as many
apps the surface pro takes this round 2
with the 4 and the iPad pro gets a 3.3
so after averaging two rounds Microsoft
takes the lead
surrounded speaker Apple Vegas asset has
always been the App Store and it's no
different with the iPad pro the App
Store is really huge for this device it
also has a side connector that has big
potential for future uses for now it's
just for the smart Keyboard case that's
an awkward origami exercise to fold out
and fold up the pencils arguably the
best in the market for its accuracy when
it comes down to finite drawing and
writing and pressure sensitivity for
broader strokes but will we see true Pro
apps for digital artists that take 100%
advantage of the pencil that remains to
be seen now the surface pro 4 brings a
USB 3.0 port a mini display port and a
micro SD card slot the iPad pro has none
of these it's type pad is superior in
every way from the feel of its typing to
its trackpad the surface pen is great
and even though it's not as finite as
the Apple pencil it's killer eraser
feature will just make anyone jealous
plus it magnetically attaches to the
surface magnets baby
Microsoft takes this round with a 4.2
and the iPad pro gets a 3.7 next round
is multi functionality these tablets try
to be everything but the iPad works best
for someone who wants a really big iPad
for content consumption or digital
artists and media creatives it's all
about the pencil but where again are the
killer apps that will make it worth the
price of admission
plus you'll still have to buy that
pencil separately now its keyboard cover
is limited and trust me I tried using it
to replace my laptop I really tried but
for what I do it didn't even last 20
minutes now the surface Pro's pen is no
chump and it does a lot but the rock
star here is the type pad case it's
really the standard that other tablets
should emulate we know it lacks Apple's
robust apps and you'll miss them if
you're used to them but I tried using
this as my primary computer and I was
able to do about 80% of all my work
comfortably this is truly a device that
can replace your laptop if you want it
to and I can't say the same for the iPad
pro the surface pro 4 gets a perfect 5
and the iPad pro gets a 4 softer
averaging 4 rounds Microsoft's lead
grows round 5 is perform
the iPad outperforms surfaces
significantly when you compare the a9x
processor to an entry-level m3 based
processor but the results change in
favor of the surface when you use its
Core i5 processor now in everyday use
you really can't feel much of a
difference but when it comes to battery
life the surface pro 4 falls well behind
with around 6 and a half hours of
battery life the iPad pro is easily
getting 10 plus hours battery life is
always important and the iPad takes us
around with the floor and the surface
gets a 328 the final round that decides
it all is value now the surface pro with
128 gigs of storage starts at 899 the
type pad case is 129 and the surface pen
is bundled with the surface now you can
configure these machines differently and
the surface can even be customized to
rival premium pcs the iPad pro can get
as expensive as a premium laptop but
still doesn't deliver enough to match
that price and bottom line the surface
is just the better value the surface pro
gets a 4 and the iPad gets a 3 so after
battle where the iPad took the lead in
round 1 the surface pro 4 established
its lead that it never let go and the
surface takes this battle 4 point 1 to 3
point 7 and is your prize fight winner
many of these fights come down to your
ecosystem but in this case it's the
promise of the Apple pencil for artists
versus the multifunctional use of the
surface pro 4 that separates these two
from each other I'm Brian Tong thanks
for watching and we'll catch you all
next time for another prizefight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
