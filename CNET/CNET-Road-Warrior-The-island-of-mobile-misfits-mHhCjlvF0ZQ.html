and welcome to Road Warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go the island of misfit
gadgets today we have a brittle little
mp3 player eh not so all weather camera
and a hybrid sports car let's start with
a comfy little bluetooth headset done
Nicoli has the genom and x 6000 on the
back here is the very nice and flexible
earbud as well as the ear hook that can
be adjusted on either side we found the
buttons really easy to press a little
small but that's ok the airboat was very
nice and comfortable in the ear and ear
hook was also very comfortable around
the year as well it's really good sound
quality Nicole said the noise
cancellation works particularly well
even on busy city streets now on to the
misfit Island the olympus stylus 760 is
an all-weather camera but all-weather
apparently doesn't include floods it is
important to note that while this camera
is all whether it is not waterproof
don't expect to go swimming with this
and have it still work when you're done
if you really want to dunk your camera
you should spend a bit extra on the
olympus stylus 770 SW this is just
weather resistant clearly not as durable
that's not to say it isn't a fine 7
megapixel camera in dry weather next up
Donald Bell has a nano-sized mp3 player
called the MPI ofy 800 be careful with
that thing Donald so a flash door here
for external flash memory cards flash
door just broke off as I suspected when
I was reviewing this there's other
little plastic parts on this that I was
worried about breaking too and I
mentioned this in my review this is a
little USB door on the side here which
is just barely tethered on to the side
of the device otherwise though it's
actually a pretty solid player the
important thing is it plays music well
that is the important thing is it
finally a hot rod with good gas mileage
Brian Cooley has the Honda sports hybrid
from Geneva the small hybrid sports
concept or s HSC not a real sexy name
but kind of a sexy car from Honda it
uses their existing IMA hybrid
technology but man what a different
looks
40 low-slung 20 inch wheels a floating
glass rear view panel and video cameras
for rear view mirrors if you couldn't
guess by looking that design came from
Honda's european-style shop in Germany
that's it for this edition of road
warrior I'm Tom Merritt check back next
time for more gadgets to keep you armed
and dangerously productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
