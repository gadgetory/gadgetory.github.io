welcome to google issues for all the
Google goodness that we can pack inside
of a show each week and yes we'll talk a
little bit about Samsung and Apple later
in the show but first we know there have
been rumors for almost the past two
years plus that Amazon would be
releasing the smartphone of their own
and boy genius report has finally
obtained a new image of Amazon
smartphone that reveals its full design
for the first time now this might look
similar to the design of an iphone or a
nexus phone or something in between but
rumors have pointed to this phone
featuring a unique glasses-free 3d
interface that uses for front-facing
cameras one on each corner that you can
see from these prototype images that
will facilitate a 3d effect tracking the
user space and eyes in relationship to
the phone's display now the phone will
also take advantage of this as much as
possible using the effects in special
lock screen wallpapers icons the user
interface and even in their Maps
application we're also expecting Amazon
to have its own brand wireless plan
tentatively called prime data that will
reportedly use AT&amp;amp;T as the carrier but
give users exclusive free access to
Amazon content now the phone is expected
to be coming later this summer with some
reports claiming we'll see it as early
as June alright the battle between
Samsung and Apple round two is finally
over and a verdict was reached rewarding
Apple 119 point six million dollars in
damages now that's significantly less
than the two billion dollars they were
seeking claiming samsung infringed on
their patents now the jury did find that
samsung infringed on apples slide to
unlock feature and a few others like
transforming text like an email address
into an actionable link real exciting
stuff now the court also ruled that
Apple had infringed on some of Samsung's
own property and awarded the Korean
giant 158 thousand dollars in damages
the Cupertino fruit guys were found
guilty of infringing on a samsung patent
that deals with according and storing
digital images and audio again very
stuff so after you subtract lawyer fees
and gas money to drive to court this
ongoing legal battle has really become a
complete waste of time for everyone all
right in google news google has updated
their google search app for android to
remember where you parked your car super
helpful now Google now cards remain
loaded if you lose your internet
connection some malls are now gaining in
dorm app directory so I can find the
nearest auntie annie's almond pretzel
that thing is good and if you have done
a previous search for a product online
Google will show you a now card that
tells you if a store nearby carries any
of those recent products you search for
creepy and cool at the same time unless
for some reason a man thong shows up
it's a very nice all right website tear
down calm has finally dismantled a pair
of google glass to do a breakdown of the
cost of the components packed inside of
it and according to their findings the
parts inside of glasses total value
comes to seventy nine dollars and
seventy-eight cents that's just a
difference of one thousand four hundred
twenty dollars and 22 cents of its
retail price if you even get an
invitation to buy one come on Google
don't be evil now a Google spokesperson
called it completely wrong but didn't
elaborate on the cost breakdown in sure
the teardown isn't factored in the rd to
build this but had a rough estimate of
just under 80 bucks couldn't you get it
down to maybe a thousand dollars for new
explorers now if you have a pair right
now it might feel like you got ripped
off a little or a lot but it's also a
great indicator that they'll be able to
offer a more affordable version down the
road if and when they come to the
mainstream market and the boobs also
announced a few updates the glass
backing up your photos and videos can
take up a lot of bandwidth and now you
have the option for it to backup only
over Wi-Fi or with your current data
connection you can now clear all your
photos and videos in one swipe to free
up storage and if you receive a phone
call the audio will stay routed to your
phone and not go through glass also
google shopping is expanding after a
successful pilot in San Francisco over
the past year west los angeles and
manhattan
now part of Google Shopping Express
program for same-day delivery from local
stores like target walgreens whole foods
and more and then some quick phone news
evelyn's has posted a picture of the new
lineup of ACC one mini twos in all
metallic colors a little easier to hold
with the same design and most of the
same features ewa leagues also posted
that the full-size acc One m8 will be
shipping in red blue and pink it's
possible that each color corresponds to
the different carriers verizon is red
AT&amp;amp;T is blue and t-mobile is pink and
sprint announced their own Harman Kardon
exclusive version of the m8 that refines
the phone's audio output and guys and
gals do you remember that pokemons april
fool's game google through into their
Maps app well according to multiple
sources Google is sending out a reward
that's a physical item for people who
found and capture all 151 Pokemon
they've told respondents that it will
take four to six weeks to receive their
award and a valuable lesson can really
be learned from this do something
completely worthless and meaningless in
your life and one day it might be
rewarded alright guys that's going to do
for this week email us at Google licious

see you guys next week for some more of
that Google isha's delicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
