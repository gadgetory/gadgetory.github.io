Siri I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
cnet update the 2015 consumer
electronics show continues on in Las
Vegas and one of the major themes of the
show surrounds the next generation of
smart home products we're seeing the
very first devices to use apple's home
kit platform which means you can talk to
siri to control home appliances one
gadget to do that is the idevices switch
you just plug it into an outlet then
control the power to whatever gadget you
plug into the switch also working with
siri is the schlage sense lock it's a
deadbolt Bluetooth lock that senses when
your phone is near but it also has a
keypad it's due out this summer and it
could cost in the ballpark of 200 or 300
dollars the idea is that when you have
several products all working with
Apple's home kit you'll be able to just
tell Siri a single phrase that will
trigger several gadgets at once to lock
up the house and turn off the lights
there are more products that talk to
Google's nest devices like the nest
smart thermostat for example when a
smartlock knows your home were away it
could change the thermostat
automatically we're also seeing new
hybrids cameras are merging with lights
the single snap includes a small camera
on the light along with a speaker and a
microphone so when someone approaches
your home the light goes on and you can
see a video feed of who's at the door it
also has facial recognition software the
Chamberlain notify bundles a light bulb
camera and doorbell together it's easy
to install because the light bulb also
powers the camera from the light socket
the doorbell part needs a battery and it
talks to your home Wi-Fi network no
details yet on pricing Chamberlain also
has a smart garage door opener called
the mic you for 130 dollars which will
also work with Apple Siri the parrot h2o
plant sensor can keep your plants
hydrated for you it monitors moisture
levels fertilizer sunlight and
temperature near your plant you just
hook up a water bottle on top and you
can even water it for you this year
washing machines are stealing a little
bit of the tension at CES believe it or
not Samsung's active wash puts a sink on
the top
but the main washing machine bin so you
can pretreat or hand wash delicates LG
took it a step further and put a washing
machine in a washing machine the LG twin
wash system lets you do two loads at the
same time with a smaller washer drawer
on the bottom for your dainty's the
drums don't share water and if you don't
want the whole system the smaller bottom
washer can actually be bought separately
and it'll attach to a few other models
there's loads more news see what I did
there and you can keep up with the
latest at CES cnet com where you can
