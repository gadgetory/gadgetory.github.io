stretchered sure but how do you make it
more fun well add augmented reality
Kolya brie has come out with a
toothbrush for kids it's called the
magic and the whole thing that makes it
magic is an app that makes it fun to
brush your teeth and turn into game let
me explain what you have to do is sync
the phone to your face and make sure it
can sense that you had the toothbrush in
your hand
and you have to brush brush brush away
all of the bad guys on the screen and
turns into a game and get points you can
unlock filters and you have to then go
through all these different lands like
bathroom the jungle and space naturally
this is for kids who are around six
years old and the toothbrush itself
isn't smart it doesn't have any special
sensors in it but it's designed in a way
that the app can read it so you're a
normal everyday toothbrush won't work
even if you want to play a game sorry
you have this special toothbrush
Kolhapuri says is coming out later maybe
September price range could be somewhere
under $30 or not announcing that just
yet at CES with a Dyson had smart cheap
brushes ones with sensors that can
attract more things this is your kids
they don't want to make it so high-tech
if anything parents can see alright what
are my kids doing when they're brushing
their teeth how long and they brush
their teeth and my turn into a game
maybe they'll actually brush their teeth
instead
although here the show floor I'm not
actually brushing my teeth obviously I'm
not sticking this in my mouth I don't
know whose mouth is better so I guess
you could fake it but hopefully a kid
needs a little bit more of an incentive
to brush maybe the school helps him do
it although for 30 bucks a pop I don't
think I want to keep buying these things
hopefully after you know 6 months they
get the point and maybe can brush
without the game holder will also be
selling something where you can attach
it to the mirror so that way when you
want to play the game and you take mom
and dad's phones you can suction cup it
to the mirror and hopefully it won't
fall in and get wet that would also be
for seeing that at CES 2018 I'm Bridget
