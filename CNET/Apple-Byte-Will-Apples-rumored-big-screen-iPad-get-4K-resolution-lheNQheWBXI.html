welcome to the apple buy for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
after all the holiday shopping and Cyber
Monday so let's get to it and it's
another acquisition for Apple this week
after the Wall Street Journal reports
Apple paid more than 200 million dollars
for Topsy a social analytics company
that holds a number of search related
patents that could be implemented
directly into apple's own products like
the itunes store or App Store now Topsy
is able to mine data with its search
tools from services like Twitter so it
could also be plugged in with Apple apps
to offer suggestions that are more
relevant to what's trending as well like
WCW which stands for women's crush
Wednesday and i'm sad i actually had to
look that up alright rumors keep on
rolling with the twelve point nine inch
ipad after chinese website pad news
reports Apple is testing five different
versions of the big screen iPad they
report that Apple may launch a version
with a 2k resolution in the first half
of 2014 which is pretty much the current
resolution of the current full-size iPad
then pad new says they will debut a 4k
Ultra HD resolution model a couple
months later even if Apple has never
really done anything like that before
with any of its product lines so take
that story however you want now the
iphone 5c may not be its top-selling
phone and reports say the 5s is selling
two to three times more but according to
research firm Kantar Worldpanel ComTech
try saying that five times really fast
almost half of iphone 5c buyers switch
from competitor brands particularly
samsung and LG compared to eighty
percent of 5s owners who upgraded from a
previous iphone model and in more iphone
news tech writer michael andrews shared
photos of what he claims is the
prototype version of the iphone 5c
styled case for the iphone 5s now this
design has openings on the top and
bottom unlike the fully covered 5c case
and the arrangement of the dots is
different as well there's no
confirmation if Apple is planning to
actually release this Crocs looking case
for the 5s n unfortunately it hasn't
been confirmed if they're jibbitz shoe
charms are compatible with it because uh
honestly I collect those alright
shifting gears let's check out our app
of the week this week the app to get has
to be quiz up this is really a fun
trivia game with over 250 different
topics it has a real slick interface and
let's be honest that background music
totally chills me out now you can play
against your friends and really
frustrate them yeah you suck boy oh damn
it and the best part of this app it's
free and forget about games like draw
something that nobody plays anymore quiz
up is where it's at and also I beat
Shawna Mendiola on math easy like
kindergarten math that's right although
she beat me at Tech so yeah go get the
app and check out quiz up and if you
challenge me I will totally kick your
butt all right to the quick bites Honda
is integrating the iphone with our 2014
honda civic touchscreen that mirrors
apps from your smartphone to the display
and in-car audio system it's not a
full-blown implementation of iOS in the
car but it's one of the first steps now
the system will also be arriving with
the new 2015 Honda Fit next spring and
support for some Android features will
come next year we've also talked about
ibeacons and how they can be used in
retail stores well a new startup called
exact editions is now allowing newsstand
publication samples to appear on I
devices when they are near specific
places now the ibeacon talks to the
iDevice when it's nearby and a magazine
publication appears in your newsstand
app for you to read but then goes away
once you leave X proximity now it's a
cool idea and Major League Baseball is
also planning to use ibeacons to enhance
the experience at ballparks as well and
if you're tired of the same old iPad
cases check out this one from belkin
with their new lego ipad mini case for
59 bucks now the back side comes with
the Lego grid and all its studs and
allows you to get creative or honestly
have your kids never give you back your
iPad again because the playing games on
it and then they're building Lego
castles in yeah actually this is not a
good idea alright guys I'm kidding this
really cool they also make them for the
iphone 5 and 5s but you really may never
see your iPad Mini ever again alright
that's going to do for this we show send
me your life questions to the Apple by
to cnet com or tweet me a brian Tong and
offer you the best advice possible i'm
brian Tong thanks for watching we'll see
you guys
all next time for another bite of the
Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
