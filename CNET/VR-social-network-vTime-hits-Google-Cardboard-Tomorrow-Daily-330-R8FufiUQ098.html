welcome to tomorrow daily the best week
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley sceva
Jeff kanata is up at GDC checking out
all the latest in video games so for now
let's hit the headlines Sony is
generating a lot of buzz at South by
Southwest in Austin right now after
unveiling some of its future lab the
future lab R&amp;amp;D division was announced
earlier this month and now we're
starting to see glimpses of projects
from the high tech think-tank one
project nicknamed n is described as a
hands-free UI that can deliver audio
information like music and other sounds
through a device worn around the neck
another prototype interactive table top
is a projector that transforms a surface
into a fully interactive experience
there aren't plans to bring these
specific projects to a retail market but
there's a high likelihood we'll see
these types of technology integrated
into future Sony products ok everybody
start warning your friends and family
that you're scared is going to get
addicted to VR because now there's a
social network in virtual reality V time
launched its alpha build last November
for headsets like oculus rift and the
Samsung gear VR but now it's officially
available for the cheapest VR headset
around Google cardboard you'll be able
to make a virtual avatar and chat in
random locations with up to three of
your virtual friends V time has over
10,000 users already and will expand its
service to every VR platform including
PlayStation VR by the end of this year
all I'm saying is maybe read Snow Crash
before you get really into this idea
it's just a suggestion ok so since Jeff
isn't here I get to pick which story we
talked about on Thursday so I'm gonna go
with virtual reality social networks
because this seems like a really
dangerous but also exciting idea and it
might not be quite as amazing as we make
it out to be in our heads when we first
think about it if you guys want to get
in on the conversation use the hashtag
Haiti D on Twitter and if we like your
tweets will include them on the show on
Thursday which is our long episode all
right guys let's check out our phone
talker for the day
our phone tiger for the day today is
Andrew who took this amazing photo with
his iPhone 5s he says hi guys my name is
Andrew I know I've been sending these
photos repeatedly but it's because I
just need some love these pictures were
taken on my iPhone 5s in Pickens South
Carolina at Table Rock Park while
enjoying a hike on the trails I really

see the new episodes every day when we
watch your shows in class thank you guys
