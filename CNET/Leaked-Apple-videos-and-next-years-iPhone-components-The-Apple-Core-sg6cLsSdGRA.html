glass and the other components we're
expecting to see in 2019 iPhones let's
get this apple core started another leak
and this time it's Apple's own repair
videos for the iPhone 10 and MacBooks
that appeared briefly on YouTube or the
world to see according to motherboard
the videos were originally posted on
Twitter but when that account was
suspended they were uploaded to YouTube
by user Armin Hadji and then taken down
within 24 hours of that so now his page
looks like this safe to say someone
didn't want them seen how do we know
this is actually Apple's videos and not
just some guy posing as Carlos from
Apple you may ask well we don't really
but according to motherboard the repair
tools used in this video are proprietary
to Apple they also show how well
third-party repair shops like iFixit
have been able to reverse engineer
repairs for Apple products like the
iPhone 10 and MacBooks shown in this
video
Apple has long pushed in-house repairs
for all its products making it
increasingly difficult for users to fix
their own devices even applying software
patches to keep third-party repair shops
out Apple is also notoriously secretive
about its suppliers and when it comes to
the glass on the iPhone 10 the only
thing the company was able to tell us
was that it's the strongest glass ever
made in an iphone this glass is the most
durable ever in a smartphone which turns
out is not all that strong and a repair
could cost up to $500 so here's hoping
that the new iPhones are covered in
Gorilla Glass 6 Corning just announced
its sixth generation Gorilla Glass which
is supposed to survive repeated drops
from pocket height unto rough surfaces
they say 15 times but I wasn't able to
test it so that's TBD now we couldn't
get a straight answer from Corning
either as to which phones will have this
glass but the company did say we can
expect to see it in devices before the
end of the
so iPhone 10 plus iPhone 9 we will never
know because nobody will ever tell us
but beyond this year's iPhones we may
see the return of the matte black option
in 2019 iPhones corny has already
developed a matte glass option that
would make the unsightly fingerprints
that decorate the screens on a lot of
our phones a lot harder to see and that
larger screen on the rumored Apple watch
series for may be much less reflective
corny also showed us this new DX plus
composite glass for wearables which
would make glass less reflective and
prevents scratching Apple also has a
history of using Sony cameras on its
iPhones which is why Sony's newest 48
megapixel image sensor is a very big
deal in the smartphone world it's got
the highest megapixel count and the most
compact pixel size of any camera of its
kind according to Sony just look at the
scary amount of detail in this image of
the cruiseliner
this means digital zoom would get that
much better now as we know higher
megapixel count does not always
translate into better photos especially
for low-light but Sony has factored this
into their sensors and added better
low-light capabilities as well the
better sensor plus Apple's own image
processing software could make for a
killer camera in the next iPhones though
we probably will have to wait until 2019
iPhones to see this become a reality and
the final potential supplier we'll be
looking at is Qualcomm sure the company
has been in multiple legal battles with
Apple over patent licenses among other
things but that may not stop Apple from
having to use them for yet another one
of their parts a 5g antenna module small
enough to fit into a phone the promise
of an ultra-fast 5g network has been
looming over the tech world for a few
years now but up until now no one had
been able to make an antenna small
enough to fit into a smart phone and
good enough to transmit over long ranges
seriously it was just a year ago that
Qualcomm's own 5g antenna module was
so big it had to be wheeled around in
its own cart in comes the Cutie mo5 two
millimeter wave antenna module it's the
size of penny and the long side fall
combs Snapdragon X 55 G could make
download time up to 100 times faster
that means your full season of Game of
Thrones in seconds now the chip is said
to be coming to hot spots by the end of
this year and in 2019 smartphones
whether that means iPhones is TBD given
the strained relationship but the bigger
issue here would be if they will have
the network to support it with less than
two months from the official iOS 12
release we are still discovering new
features and this time it relates to the
home pod according to a private beta
release first reported by French site I
generation Apple Smart speaker could be
getting call support and multiple timers
features users have been waiting for
since its launch now just to clarify
Apple has a public beta a developer's
beta and now a private beta according to
the 95 Mac report the private beta is
only released to Apple corporate and
some retail employees which means we may
not actually see this update in the
official iOS 12 launch but when we do
Siri on the home pod could be able to
make calls and read your voicemails or
partake in group FaceTime audio calls
the only way to do this currently is to
initiate the call on your iPhone and
then have to switch audio output the
home pod would also be able to find your
iPhone and have multiple timers going at
the same time for things like cooking
anything beyond a hard-boiled a stronger
glass 48 megapixel camera or 5g
connectivity which of these three
features do you most want to see in the
next iPhone leave your comment below or
