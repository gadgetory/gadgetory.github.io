ever used
it's immaculately designed and that 34
inches wide it's huge
unfortunately I can't say the same great
things about the screen quality it's not
the best monitor out there but I'm
definitely going to be bummed when I
have to send it back to Samsung the 34e
790 is a mammoth sized monitor with the
subtle curve it's got some organ Amma
creatures so you can easily adjust it
for maximum comfort and it's slim stand
is fashionably sleek the curve might
sound like a gimmick but I liked it
the design as well as the effect on the
viewing experience are subtle since the
edges of the monitor curled towards you
the outskirts of the screen are more
visible in your periphery it's not a
huge difference but it makes using the
ultra wide screen feel less overwhelming
on any given workday my screen is packed
to the brim with content I usually have
at least two browser windows up with
many tabs open of course and depending
on my mood and procrastination level
I'll probably also have the Spotify app
Twitter and another window playing a
video on the screen to having everything
on one screen is just easier to manage
it works great for my everyday workflow
but for watching movies and playing
games its underwhelming the colors on
the screen leaned heavy on the blues and
there's a lot of light leaked on the
edges dark Gray's also get crushed
meaning details and dark scenes aren't
very visible another downside is that
this monitor comes with a high price
right now you can find it for around
$600
if you're looking to play games or watch
a lot of movies I suggest holding off
for a model with a better screen if
quality isn't a big concern the killer
design and wide work-friendly dimensions
make the monitor worth the splurge if
you can afford it for more details check
out the full review i'm Xiomara blanco
and this is been a first look at the
Samsung 34 II 790
