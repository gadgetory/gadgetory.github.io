a traditional laptop they boot instantly
they're always up to date and they can
be had for as little as 200 bucks but if
you're reluctant to make the jump
because you're so used to getting around
and multitasking on your MacBook or PC
laptop here are some simple tips that
will make the transition easier first
let's talk about the trackpad you like
the multitask with all your fancy
schmancy gestures well I got your
gestures right here a two finger tap
works as a right-click three fingers
swipe side-to-side works to scroll
between open tabs and a three finger
swipe up reveals all the currently open
windows so that you can juggle between
them quickly next let's talk about your
shelf for your tray or your dock or
whatever you want to call this thing
down here at the bottom give this thing
a two finger tap and you'll see options
for moving the shelf to the left or
right side of the screen you also see an
option for automatically hiding the
shelf when you don't need it if you alt
click or two finger click on the app
icon you'll be given the option of
pinning or unpinning the app to your
tray this also works if you go into the
app folder and alt click an icon now by
default most of these google apps will
open as a new tab within the Chrome
browser but if you're more of a window
juggler than a tab shuffler and alt
click on an app icon will also give you
a number of options for how to open the
app open as window is the third option
and gives the whole thing a more
conventional laptop feel now one final
tip whether you're working with a tab or
a window if you slam the thing into the
far right or left of the screen and let
it go it will snap into a split screen
mode or split pane mode hold it there
for an extra second and it'll snap into
a quarter pane pull the window back into
the center and it will inflate back to
normal size so there you go some simple
tips make your Chromebook behave more
like a conventional laptop to learn more
