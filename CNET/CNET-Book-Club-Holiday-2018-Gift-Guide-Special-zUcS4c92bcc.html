Ackerman I'm Scot Stein and we've talked
to a lot of serious authors about
serious books over the last year and a
half Walter Mosley a Jaron Lane hey Jeff
and Amir yep but we thought it'd be fun
for the holiday season to show you some
fun books you can get his gifts that are
actual physical books but just don't
work as ebooks not available as ebooks
these are books from our own collection
this is stuff like I got two big
bookshelves put into my living room and
these are some of these I've had for
years some of them I just bought and
they're ones that I don't want to Kindle
a lot of times they're constructed to be
read because they have different
typefaces they do a lot of like they
they literally put things into the book
physically there's some things you just
can't recreate even simple illustrations
don't read well on the Kindle it doesn't
have a good way to resolve it yeah it's
not a good way to go in fact you know if
you see a visual book that's on a kindle
sale you'll see if you download one that
usually every the layout gets messed up
so fYI forgiving that as a gift to
someone so go with the physical book
keep the Kindle for the pure text yeah
now I'm gonna start off we're gonna show
off some books here this is one I got
very recently as I'm pretty excited
about this is art and Arcania it's a big
visual history of Dungeons and Dragons
and it really goes all the way back in
time and has a lot of really fantastic
art like early advertisements and things
like that from the game and gives you a
lot of backstory about Gary Gygax and
how it was created and eventually it
goes into things I think I remember for
when I was a kid that goes great like
dungeon master guides illustrations and
things like that and a little flashback
oh yeah it's just flash back after
flashback and if you grew up in any of
this stuff you will remember this oh
look at these books and ads and things
like that a lot about metal mean if it
ain't metal miniatures Scott no we're
killing them nope never did although it
was very I was very interested in them
but I was the abstract board game and
sleight of hand magic person that sort
of like I danced around them but I'm now
getting into Dungeons and Dragons see we
I had the map tiles and had a little
figure that would paint them they wrote
me to lead back then yeah so you know
like piei pewter II yeah I know I just
3d print them anyways this is 50 bucks
and and
that he seen it on sale yeah so this
this thing too with a lot of these
physical books like check out see if
they're on sale a lot of places you can
get them on deals especially this time
of year discounting a lot of these books
that just looked a bunch of them yeah
like it a lot of plate a lot of book
stores are offering like 10 20 percent
discount so like you know forget list
price like a lot of times you can get
some discount I'm gonna give you a
little a little fun fact about this
number one the intro is written by Jove
banjy loz the actor who's like the
werewolf on True Blood and you see a lot
bunch of other things and one of the
three co-authors is Sam Witwer who's an
actor who was in a couple of Star Wars
games yeah and also in the American
version of that vampire and werewolf and
ghost lived together show the neighbor
which escapes me being human why that he
was the vampire in the American version
of being human and he is a co-author on
this Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons book that's like
fast and that's unusual but yeah that's
like a great coffee table book and
speaking of D&amp;amp;D and then we'll get our
D&amp;amp;D out of the system I've you know my
kid who is who's 10 has been getting
interested in Dungeons and Dragons and I
never played Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons growing
up more than like an hour and I suddenly
became interested the Dungeon Master's
they are it is the addition now I've
seen this on sale a lot over Black
Friday Cyber Monday and even now so shop
around to see if you it's like list
price $50 but you can get it for less
than that and it's awesome I mean I got
this The Player's Guide and the Monster
Manual we're just still would not change
the name of those since I was a kid have
now retired from the game in the sixth
grade that's the same books that we had
the covers we did ahead mister manual
because I loved the idea of all these
monsters in a book and I had fiend folio
and I had Monster Manual too but but now
I just got the monster manual there are
other books too but the layouts
fantastic if you're interested in
learning about the lore and it also kind
of doubles as a coffee table at the
coffee table art book yeah if you're not
and this is a little more list heavy but
there's definitely a lot of really cool
illustrations really during the game
you're probably using an app yes we
talked about that a lot of people use
apps but I still like the idea poring
over a book keeping it on a on a shelf
and it's got a really nice feel so
anyway I treated myself to that and I've
I got more of those coming for my kid he
doesn't know yet knife knife all right
Scott
gonna give you now one that is new to me
but you apparently knew about ahead of
time I know it I read it it's like my
Mexican finish I believe by Denmark
Danielewski and it is apparently a cult
favourite from the early 2000s I think
and even though it looks like a regular
book inside there's a ton of interesting
typography there's all sorts of like
writing in the margins there's like
weird weird page layouts there's two
sets of footnotes written in different
fonts so you can tell which person is
writing the footnotes to this because
it's about a person writing about a
person who wrote about another person
who wrote about like a cult movie that
no one can find about some other guy who
discovered like a hallway in his house
that doesn't seem to structurally belong
in the house and that's only the most
top level of it it's just a weird
nightmarish dreamscape it's very David
Lynch in I had a copy of House of Leaves
years ago and one of my many moves I got
rid of it because I thought I would
never read it now I want to read it
again and we have to brining another
copy but the actual color graphs in here
of things yeah it's a really something
we never work on a Kindle it's not
available as an e-book yeah I actually
had to go to the Strand to get this copy
which cost me $18 I was a fool for
getting rid of my it might be my copy
for all I know you might might have
picked up the cop property of Scott
asked all right yeah I left a little
mark by margin I'll tell you I've really
just started this and I am just blown
away by it just the first you know
chapter or two very unsettling if you
like kind of weird fiction with with
slightly supernatural but you don't
really know what's going on over toads
house of leads and mark Z Danielewski
also has started releasing this series
of books he has like based on all 26
letters of the alphabet so there are
these massive again visual tomes with
all sorts of puzzle e-text and I think
that I bought on a Kindle and was very
disappointed that I bought it on a
camera but it was on Kindle sale so it
was like $1.99 and I I took a leap onto
it but if you're also interested that
that's out there to buy that author so
I'll pick this up this is a book that I
picked up when I was interested in game
design and game theory there's a newer
version than this one but Raph Koster
who's a really claimed thinker game
designer worked on Ultima Online this is
theory of fun for game design what's
really cool about this book is not only
is it about the basic theory of games
and theories of fun but half of it is
text and half of it is a comic and so
every page you kind of getting two
parallel stories as you it's not like a
comic book but they're comic like
illustrations to tell a parallel tale to
what's going on in the text here so
something like this is really meant to
give you ideas as you flip through it
think about it I started showing it to
my kids and I think it's fun because you
can you kind of think outside the box
with with gaming and it's just a really
fun read it kind of almost reminds me of
what another great book that I didn't
bring in is the understanding comics
geology F by Scott MacLeod shows a great
remains amazing he has that making
comics reinventing comics this has
almost a feel of that anybody in the
industry to appreciate it exactly five
books they just tell you good visual
storytelling that will help you in a lot
of fields yeah you're getting sort of
like a fundamental understanding of
maybe the cognitive elements of what
makes gaming fun so great book and
there's a newer version than this you
get a newer edition getting the new
cover yeah so you know what makes it's
got loot boxes lots and lots of loot
boxes give some loot boxes for the
holidays okay here's over here here's a
crazy one I've wanted to get this has
this cool vintage look it's called
ship of thesis and it is by JJ Abrams at
an author named Doug doors but it looks
like inside the slipcover you know an
old book that you would get from the
library it's that's a little library tag
on it here on the side and there's a
story in the book but there are
basically two people who have taken this
book out of the library and they keep
writing each other notes in the margins
of the book and they also like insert
little postcards and little flyers so
this is all part of the book obviously
you can never do this look as a whole
letter in here a handwritten letter you
have to read it's there there's much
more text outside of the story than
inside of newspaper clipping the pages
are perfectly yellow door and they just
have a great aging to them it looks very
authentic so you so you basically have
the story of the book and then this
other story that's happening in the
background I have not gotten very far in
this but someday I will get back to it
but it's a
fantastic-looking book and it would look
great anywhere it is I think I said I
was out for like 20 bucks get used to it
when it came out it was like 40 and
almost reminds me of the egg it gives me
a feel of the Griffin and Sabina books
those books that I that had little
letters that you would open and it was
this ah yeah Nick Banta that's what yeah
a number I can't believe I remember that
in a number of books that were like that
with all the puzzles and Nick Banta also
talking about a used book to pick up and
this puzzle book called the Egyptian
jukebox and I've got on my shelf which
is a great visual puzzle book
I didn't bring visual puzzle books but I
brought other types of books I'm looking
for a good visual puzzle book that needs
to be made in 2019 this I'm just going
to write to Simon Stalin hag so I missed
a like a big been a a book superstar
lately I think a lot of people Jeff
Bakalar turned me on to his art and his
work he has had two other books third
one came out now called the electric
state I think she got all of them but
the electric state what's cool is it
these books not only are they they they
gorgeous they explore these dystopic
Swedish worlds that take place in the
past but feel like the future so this is
like an alternate 90s where there's been
some a puck apocalyptic cataclysmic a
virtual reality game that people were
playing there's a lot of ruins there's a
lot of mystery these incredible
paintings along with the storyline you
just flip through it like an incredible
art book I mean it's definitely on the
more mature side but I think anyone
would enjoy it
the paintings are amazing again it's not
like this at all but it kind of reminds
me of Dinah topia in the sense that
there's this like unfolding amazing
story that's told through art his other
two books are great this is a purely art
book you would only ever want to get
this in physical form no regrets
purchase I just again I feel like these
books I don't always read all the way
through I like to flip through them if
you have them you can go back to yeah
you get ideas and you become very
inspired but I love the I love the ruins
in this book nice nice
like that yeah I'm going to show you one
now Scott that's brand-new in fact it's
a it's a show that we all know would
love stranger things and they've done a
book like about the show but in an
eighty style so it
like a weathered old book it's got that
plastic cover on it like you would get
at the library or from school it's got a
little used bookstore price tag on it
that says it's in fair condition this
was a used book Oh like randomly even a
note on the autorap saying don't panic
the book is supposed to look like this
and inside look it's got some water
stains on the inside it's really like
really nicely aged and there's a lot of
really great art inside besides the
usual behind-the-scenes stuff and
obviously you can't get that on a Kindle
yeah and it's it's really a good mix of
like about the people who made the show
about the actors who were on the show
behind the scenes stuff little paw up
pages from you know biographies and and
all kinds of stuff like this so I
thought this was really well done and if
you're a fan of the show it's certainly
a good pickup and I think this was Ison
on Amazon for sixteen dollars down from
the usual thirty-six okay so so good
good call there book that I did not
bring in but but I would also recommend
them at my books I didn't bring because
it's gigantic the meta podcast within
the break look up this book is it's the
best weird giant art book you could ever
get and it's been around for years it
got released a couple of years ago codex
Seraphin II oh yes it is
why did you bring that is because it's
gigantic because it wouldn't even fit in
my backpack
it's a is expensive I think it's like
$80 it's just as beautiful as Mallika
Tasha and type book where and the the
pages are well textured it's written in
gibberish or a supposedly Gervais or
maybe it's another language it was it
was created as this spin-off of the
Voynich manuscript maybe like it like a
commentary on it it's a very bizarre
surreal pictures of people doing all
sorts of things alien evolving stuff it
just feels like a text that got
downloaded out of another dimension but
that's a great one speaking of other
dimensions Jeff Vandermeer our friend
our friend Jeff who you know his books
are fantastic he has a book which you
have to get in physical form you can
also get an individual but get it in
physical it's one of the best writing
books out there for anyone who wants to
think about writing or dream of other
worlds called Wonder book this is the
previous edition that I bought he has a
new edition yeah
without these 60 pages of new stuff
first of all it's fantastically laid out
and you know all sorts of really cool
maps and interesting flowcharts and
visuals and inspiring paintings weird
ads and things but it's a book on on
writing and creating and he has it feels
like dozens of cameos from famous
authors Neil Gaiman Zinn here Charles
you Lev Grossman george RR martin ursula
kala look in it's incredible Karen Lord
so Kim Stanley I'm just gonna keep on
but anyway they all have thoughts about
writing so it's like not just him it's
like a greatest hits of other people
thinking so it's just a it's a great
book on a lot of levels and it doesn't
even cost that much I think was like $20
mm-hmm so feels it's very hitting the
new version of this to my to my wishlist
cuz I have a copy of this oh you don't
know you have to get yes this is I kind
of want to get the new version even
though I have this version and because I
think it's I think it's wonderful so
it's on and of course Jeff Vandermeer
was our very first book club guess he
was our very first and now and then you
know annihilation and mourn and all that
other stuff so he's he's got another one
coming out so fantastic yeah speaking of
cool books here was a book about cool
books by another cool author who also
writes cool books the author is Grady
Hendrix and he's got another new book
out called we sold our souls but this is
his nonfiction work paperbacks from hell
and it is a study of 1970s and 80s pulp
paperbacks horror fiction things like
that and you will find all of these
fantastic book covers in here and he
talks about them and the origins of them
and the different weird authors some of
whom you know we're never seen again
some of whom went on to become very
famous and it's just once again you have
to see these these book covers in in
real time because they are just
fantastic like here's all the knockoffs
of like Rosemary's Baby with everyone's
got a demon baby the only demon baby
books man want you out there that's
pretty great and all the you know let's
see what the screaming all the screaming
people that I
and I remember that these are about
these are the religious horror books
Legion Dark Angel unholy communion so
those are all collected and this is this
is really really fun to flip through if
you like kitschy 70s 80s book culture
and they don't make book covers like
this anymore like I still go to the
Strand but I will look through the
paperback the old paperback rack and try
to find cool stuff just to have it
because it looks so awesome and Grady
Hendrix also wrote this other book that
just came out a fiction book called we
sold our souls about a rock band that
apparently sells its soul to the devil
in exchange for success and and it's
it's it's a good creepy music tinge
thriller well maybe because of that and
and everyone getting into this they need
to make more books of covers like that
oh yes I was gonna it's bound to happen
stranger things and all that stuff that
retro style now everything well Kindle
books don't have covers really just like
we lost album art by going to digital
music we've lost book cover art by going
to Kindles what kills me is one of the
digital book cover art suddenly changes
oh right like it all wasn't over it
looks different and it throws me off so
I'm gonna go to a topic that I've also
been really obsessed with after virtual
reality which is immersive theater now
you may not be aware of what immersive
theater is or maybe you are which is the
you know
site-specific transformative things have
you seen Sleep No More if you've seen
then she fell in New York things that
are defy explanation
and and often will expand beyond normal
spaces well this group called as I got
deeper into the immersive theater world
sort of collecting some books this group
called Odyssey works has been exploring
a very particular type of experience
which they call like a immersive
experiences for one completely crazy
almost like the game handcrafted things
that just happen to one person where
everything around them changes they know
they're part of it but it's more
artistic and these worlds and so this
group Odyssey works you can't experience
those things really because they cost a
crazy amount and they usually don't
happen that many people but they decided
to create this really cool art book
published by Princeton Architectural
press
that is discusses their methods and
their art and has an interview with Rick
by Rick moody who I think experienced
one of these so it's again crazy charts
interesting story individuals talking
about the art what it means to create
their immersion it's a book that you'd
want to flip through and think about
your life thing with a path typography
and the color of the text which again
you can't do on a Kindle exactly so it
is it's fascinating if you want to think
about art differently if you want to
think about what if you're interesting
VR if you're interested in things like
future tech and you want to think about
what it means to create something that's
immersive or AR this might be a really
cool book to pick up or pick up for
someone who's into that nice nice now
for someone who's into more traditional
visual storytelling like I don't know
Star Wars there's this new book called
creatures and aliens and I'm showing it
to you for two reasons one my
seven-year-old was fascinated with this
because it's not just a standard you
know photo book of stuff it's actually
again has all this almost 3d stuff in it
where yes it has all these you can look
through all these like drawings you
could pull stuff out of like concept
drawings of different characters ibaka
there's more Chewbacca and there's a lot
of like little flip things that open up
so it's like a oh look there's there's
Peter Mayhew and there's two notes in
theatre made before and now now you have
and so it's a really heater making oh
this is great this little mini book
inside of a walk sketches and it's like
several pages just like this so it's a
book it's several books within a book
and it's that same playful sort of you
know let's shove a bunch of stuff
outside of here and and look at early
concept drawings of jar jar where they
all he didn't get Benny better
duck-billed yeah yeah it looks like it
looks like it so I thought this was
really cool this is the this is new $29
creatures and aliens and I really love
that they've done more than just the
standard art book have all these little
pull ups and extras and that's gotta
have a bonus for you this is the book
that I mentioned to you briefly I don't
know if I've shown it today Katie you
have this book I want my spaghetti yes I
am very envious about giraffes on
horseback salad which is a graphic novel
that
recreates the lost script that Salvador
Dali wrote for the Marx Brothers it was
actually never even a full script
pediatr treatment and maybe a few pages
bananas and and and some guy went around
and tracked down as much information as
he could about this never made movie and
finally got you know all the treatments
and everything and basically wrote a
script around it and he and he got that
guy Tim Heidecker who does yeah yeah
he's fantastic
oh well it's him and Eric yeah yeah and
he's done a bunch of other stuff since
then so I see it was part of the writing
team on this basically had a team who
would write like Marx Brothers style
gangs and jokes to follow along the
storyline and then somebody Illustrated
it and it has a lot of background about
about the book itself and how it came
together but it's a really cool like
funny abstract graphic novel now the
catch is I have a copy right here it
doesn't come out until March of 2019 ah
but why how did I get it
why is this right now you know what it's
got I'll tell you from experience that's
the book industry and I think I turned
in my book and it definitely did not
come out until almost exactly one year
later yeah so that's what happens but I
got this at New York comic-con so if you
go to a convention or a book convention
or anything the company quirk books is
already out there selling this so may
not be able to retail store but if
you're doing any kind of convention or
anything I'm sure they will be happy to
sell you a copy of the full retail price
say new york-based it can I knock on
their door I don't know that's a good
question
and I find can I know what I've got a
card from somebody over there all no to
get me for my for my birthday right and
and and it's super trippy it's not like
a standard jokey Marx Brothers movie
it's much more it's much more out there
because it's South Korea Dali but they
call it the strangest movie never made
anybody hate a premium for them you've
got a great selection here of actual
real world physical book gifts you can
get for people I think I think anyone
who collects real books would love would
love any one of these and we're gonna
put all the links to them on the article
associated with this video so you can
just go through there and click on them
all add them to your collections this
has been super fun I've been thinking
about this for a long time yes ever
finally did this we should do more of
these basically what's on our
bookshelves because the stuff keeps
growing but this is really cool
awesome awesome all right well anyway
I'm Scott and that scene at book club
for this year
see you in 2019 bye now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
