we are reviewing fridges at cnet
appliances and this is the samsung rh 25
h 5 6 11 s are better known as Samsung's
food showcase refrigerator now twenty
one hundred dollars this is the less
expensive of samsung to food showcase
side-by-side models this model is much
more simple looking much more basic you
get the usual handles you'll open the
food showcase door by squeezing this
handle here that opens up the front
panel of the door but not the entire
door itself giving you access to those
indoor shelves i'm not sure that i need
my fridge to have a door in a door
you're still opening a door and grabbing
what you want but if you do want to door
in a door fridge it's a good model
there's nothing inside of that door
that's blocking you off from the inner
door shelves like you find in similar LG
models that we've tested and nothing on
the inside either it's very simple the
shelves are right there you just reach
in and grab it from either side I like
that design a lot so it doesn't look
nearly as good as that more expensive
food showcase fridge but it's actually a
much better performer take a look at
this heat map this is the fridge running
at its default setting of 37 degrees and
what I love about this result is despite
all the orange hot spots there in the
door you have nothing but blue in the
main body of the fridge every single
section there is below 40 degrees and
that's a very good result that's very
uncommon for side-by-sides usually side
by side refrigerators struggle a bit
with temperature consistency because of
that tall vertical of narrow design
inside the fridge it's pretty basic as
features go that's not uncommon for side
by side fridges because they're just not
a lot of room to stuff extra stuff in
there but you do get spill proof shelves
kind of a shallow spill proof guard
there more leak proof than spill proof
it's still nice to have all in all I
like this side by side fridge quite a
bit the performance is key for me it's
just a very solid performer much more so
than the average side by side and at a
price of twenty one hundred dollars
you're not paying quite as much for the
upgrade to that door and adore
functionality so if you want to showcase
I think this model probably makes the
most sense for the full story take a
gander at my full review on cnet com and
follow me on twitter if you have any
fridge questions you want to feel my way
for seeing that I'm right Chris
