there are a few things that you'll
definitely want to consider but let's
get the big one out of the way first
and that's megapixels this number really
doesn't matter for most of us unless
you're a professional and you know that
you need that extra resolution for
things like cropping or enlargement if
you're number one criteria is photo
quality then you probably want to go for
a camera with a bigger sensor so that's
something like an aps-c or full-frame
but the thing is with the biggest sensor
is that you're generally going to be
getting a bigger camera as a result
now this brings us to the type of camera
that you're looking at that's either a
fixed lens camera and interchangeable
lens camera sometimes known as
mirrorless or a DSLR
so fix lens cameras are either pointed
shoots or bridge cameras those ones that
have lenses with really long zooms now
the advantage is to cover that same
focal length with a DSLR or
interchangeable lens camera you'd have
to spend a lot of money with multiple
lenses but a bridge camera you just have
that one lens but the downside obviously
is once you outgrow that focal length
and you outgrow the camera you can't
change the lens out so you have to
upgrade altogether option number two is
an interchangeable lens camera or
mirrorless camera obviously you can swap
out the lens as you need so you can have
different configurations depending on
what you want to shoot plus a lot of
mirrorless cameras often have optical
and Censorship stabilization so you can
get a really steady shot option number
three is a DSLR these generally have
really good battery life and you have
the option of using older lenses from
film cameras without the need for an
adapter and you have the flexibility of
changing out the lens as you need so say
for example you decide that you really
like taking a lot of low-light photos
you can then invest in a lens that has a
faster maximum aperture also consider
video if you're looking to shoot casual
clips then you'll probably want to be
looking for a camera with a fast and
responsive autofocus system but if you
want to get a little bit more serious
you should consider 4k recording look
for changeable frame rate options as
well as an option like a touchscreen so
you could do something cool like tap the
screen to pull focus
as something really important to do is
to try the camera before you buy it I
can't recommend this highly enough maybe
the camera will be too big and heavy and
then you won't want to use it it's just
going to live at home or maybe the menu
options are confusing and it will stop
you from advancing further with that
camera these are things that are totally
subjective and you're only going to know
when you have the camera in your hands</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
