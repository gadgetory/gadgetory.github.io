with a thermostat a motion sensor to
door and window sensors to smart plugs
and four LED lights these ZigBee devices
communicate with a router tethered hub
which then translates everything over
Wi-Fi setup was ridiculously simple
download the hive app on your phone
select install devices and follow the
instructions to get everything up and
running although I configured 10 devices
and a hub each product connected to the
app in seconds the thermostat was the
lone exception since it required some
basic electrical work after everything's
installed you can create rules or
actions so you receive alerts whenever
the sensors detect motion or notice the
doors open hive is also compatible with
Amazon Alexa speakers the Google home
and if if you want to use voice commands
to control your devices or setup
advanced automations with the if this
than that service i've worked
consistently well for me from start to
finish I like the layout of the app and
found it easy to navigate but there's
one thing about hive I really don't
understand rather than paying for these
devices outright you're actually locked
into a monthly contract that lasts for
two years the standard kit costs
twenty-five dollars per month so you're
ultimately paying six hundred dollars
over two years and even more if you
continue to use high for longer than
that and weirdly you aren't getting
professional monitoring or any other
fancy services for that monthly fee so
while I like hives functionality I'm
totally stumped by its pricing plan and
have a hard time recommending it as a
result</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
