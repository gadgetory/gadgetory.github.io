technology touches turns to gold with
the possible exception of Groupon but
the auto industry's had a rather uneven
relationship with the latest tech I'm
Brian Cooley with the top five car tech
flops that were actually just ahead of
their time
number five hidden headlights I put
these down at number five because they
did have a good run
what would my 67 cougar be without them
but they're the mark of a dated car
today as automakers instead have moved
on to sleek high-tech headlight clusters
built into the body and they're all too
happy to avoid the complication and cost
of anything that pops up via a motor and
a hinge in this electronic era number
four digital instrument panels oh yeah
these first flourished in the late 70s
are pretty much gone by the 90s
horrid looking digit displays that were
hard to read expensive to repair and
look like something you made from a kit
a slew of Lincoln's caddies and even
aston martins mistook this look for
luxury today it's descended the LCD
panel is taking over number three break
by wire rankings a pretty basic thing in
a car you like it to work consistently
but Mercedes sensotronic system didn't
always do that it replaced the actual
pumping of hydraulic fluid connected to
the pedal with a digital sensor in the
pedal that told a computer how to apply
the brakes except when it kind of didn't
Mercedes killed the system after four
years of freaking people out today
though electro hydraulic braking is once
again common as part of stability
control and lane departure technology
number two cylinder management Cadillacs
v8 6:4 engine could drop down from eight
to six or even four cylinders for better
fuel economy cool except it was 1981 and
the technology was a mess of vintage
electronics and mechanical parts that
moved engine things around on the fly
resulting in a car that bucked and
surged all the way back to the dealer
today cylinder deactivation is back and
smooth thanks to more sophisticated
electronic
and fuel injection but the number one
flop in recent car Tech history his BMWs
iDrive when the first generation of this
knob and screen interface debuted in the
early 2000s it was infuriating the
screen layout was just clunky and it can
only be navigated by this knob with
silly haptic feedback and almost no
helper buttons around it it made you beg
for a touchscreen and it was the most
universally hated car tech that I can
recall but look who's laughing now as
almost every car has some kind of
similar human machine interface and BMWs
current I drive it's one of the best to
stay on top of all the new car tech
future flops and otherwise go to see net
on cars.com i'm brian coulis thanks for
