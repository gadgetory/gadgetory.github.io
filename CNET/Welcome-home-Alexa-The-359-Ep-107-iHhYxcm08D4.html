I ever keep track of this stuff Joe and
I welcome to another episode of the 359
podcast thanks for joining us this
morning our hosts are Ben Fox Rubin and
Alfred A and good morning guys hey thank
you very much for that very nice and
warm welcome we've got a couple things
we're gonna go over today we're actually
going to try to get through four stories
in four minutes discussing amazon
Twitter and the NFL Pandora and Lincoln
White Sea Link NYC is my favorite story
of the day guys I'm excited for this one
well you have to stick around to the end
to actually check out that one so well
it's only four minutes anyway so not too
much time as always send in your
questions we're going to get to them
after the podcast and we'll try to
answer as many of them as possible
obviously we're happy to answer any
questions that you have specific to
technology whatever but it's always
helpful to focus on the main subjects at
hand so particularly with Amazon we're
going to be talking about their smart
home efforts with the echo dot and the
echo smart home speaker and then also be
really interested in here what some of
you guys have to say about Twitter and
the NFL they have a big deal with that
so without further ado let's get this
thing rolling alright audio to speed and
here we go in three two welcome to the
359 where we talk about the top tech
news of the day plus whatever crap we
want to throw in I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm
Alfred Aang okay so first up it looks
like Amazon is planning to take over the
smart home with fifty dollar pieces of
electronics it introduced a new echo dot
that it came out with yesterday and it
also revealed last week plans to add
it's voice assistant Alexa to its fifty
dollar fire tablet so Alfred do you plan
on buying these things in six packs
which they're both available in I
actually was considering getting the six
pack only so that I you know that's
Christmas shopping that's done already
you know that's a Alexa that's a amazon
dot
keep one for free for myself so you have
like an echo already I don't when I
really want one and fifty dollars to me
is like the perfect price mark for ya
for that I bought an echo speaker during
prime day so it was like 130 bucks I was
waiting for it to go on sale usually
it's like a hundred and eighty and I was
like okay great whatever no problem and
then when the doc came out yesterday I
was like all right 50 bucks i got fifty
bucks to throw at this thing so i don't
know maybe i'll put it in the living
room i don't know i have to figure that
out but do you think that this is a
smart move on Amazon's part to actually
provide stuff this cheaply I mean like
are people going to hesitate and be like
50 bucks how could how good could it be
four fifty dollars well yeah I actually
think fifty dollars is the perfect price
mark I think it's not too expensive and
I don't think it's that cheap that
people would be skeptical of it I was
its amazon I mean like I put their name
on the product so that does help too
yeah and their return policy is amazing
so even if you hate it well which I
doubt you will I mean it's a great
product for at that price and if you
hate it you can just return it extremely
easily onto the website I also think
that the dot is probably a better
product considering that you can plug it
into speakers that you already own
that's jump a double that's true let's
see if they take over the smart home
with that thing next twitter is making a
stab at relevance by live streaming NFL
games the first game will stream tonight
with the help of a new twitter app for
streaming boxes however do you think
this is going to work you think people
are gonna flood Twitter like they've
always wanted I think Twitter is really
banking on this only because you know
they're the platform for live sports as
it is already everyone who wants is like
a second screen yeah everyone who wants
to talk about games are is on Twitter
talking but I don't know if they'll be
watching it though is the thing on
Twitter um because you're right it is a
second screen experience if anything I
tonight is the Super Bowl for the
Twitter can for Twitter yeah I mean even
though it's you know Jets against the
bills who would never make a super bowl
hey I think this is a very important
game for Twitter and it's hard to see
you know where people will go on so
apparently yahoo screamed a game last
season and
was it went horribly for them and it was
very very low watch low viewership so
it's a low bar that was set there and
hopefully Twitter will be able to do
better than that I think I they
definitely will because people are on
Twitter already like I said it's a
platform for you know live news sports
football is huge on Twitter it
essentially just takes over that social
network whenever a game is on so also we
wanted to get to Pandora today unveiled
Pandora plus it's a five dollar monthly
subscription plan that lets you do extra
things like skip songs replay tracks
without any additional commercials is
this something that you could get into
absolutely for five dollars it's half
the price of both of the leading you
know leading products as it is you know
with Apple music and Spotify and you
know I think people have been spoiled
when it comes to streaming music as it
is where its oh I have to listen to this
ad but I mean if you put on the radio at
any point it's just it's ads everywhere
yeah i'm looking forward to it either
way we're out of time but we want to
talk about link NYC anyway link NYC New
York's big bold public Wi-Fi project has
this weird snag Alfred what is it this
is again like I said my favorite story
of the day um so they have these tablets
on it that you know people used to be
able to browse the the internet on and
now blink NYC has taken that feature
away because there's too many people
watching porn on it yes a bunch of jerks
I've ruined it for everyone I stole your
line which um you know to me I that
seemed inedible inevitable if you know
if there's internet there will be porn
that's just yes go to a public library I
most certainly will not leave that
advice all right we're at a time we're
going to go to the post show if you want
to hear more about these stories or you
want to read more about these stories
check us out on cnet on Ben Fox Rubin
I'm Alfred Aang thanks for listening and
delving into the comments we have a
really good one read up front with Alexa
and I haven't even considered this yet
but do they work in the car so Alexa
amazon has started
to Ford so there is discussion about
adding a LexA into the car it makes a
lot of sense to potentially include a
voice assistant into the car because
when you think about it having a voice
assistant out in the street or in a
restaurant or you know even in this you
know kind of small enclosure you can
really find how it would be really
annoying really really quickly to just
start talking to your phone but not
actually talking to the people around
you however semi-private situations like
the home or the car make a lot of a
sense for voice assistance so that is
another place that you should expect to
see Alexa in the coming days in the
future what if you set up like a
personal hotspot and just drove around
with a doctor's well right now there's
that sounds like a good idea i'd like to
see if that's possible there's a
third-party product i actually wrote
about this one yesterday it's called the
onyx which is kind of like a Star Trek
communicator would you clip on to you
clip it onto your clothes or just
anything on you like a bag and you press
on it to talk to like your friends and
family but it's getting Alexa
integration within the fourth quarter
this year so I mean they really they
released a promotional video about it
yesterday talking about how you know
you'll be able to talk to Alexa from
your car we're just anywhere in general
right but there will be further
integration particularly with ford cars
going forward so i guess in the meantime
yeah you could get the Onyx also so you
could walk around with alexa all the
time if you don't have a girlfriend I
did see one of the saddest things in
that promotional video though where the
guy was like stuck in traffic and he
plays rock paper scissors with Alexa oh
gods no that would never do that or if
you do don't tell people afterwards uh
doesn't Roger use Alexa at home I do you
use I'm okay yeah yeah I asked her what
the weather is Michael in the chat says
anytime he's seen it in action it's
janky it needs to be really quiet or
else it doesn't really understand you i
have not had that experience no I yell
at Alexa across the apartment and she
can still hear me even when she's
playing music issues playing music
really loudly then I do have to like go
into the kitchen and actually tell her
like hey turn it down or turn off or
ever but I found Alexa and the Google
assistant on my smartphone to be way way
better than Apple Siri Apple Siri I
found to be SuperDuper janky compared to
Alexa amazon Alexa the annoying
overpriced daughter you never wanted is
that a comment are you just talking
that's that's me that Alexa turn it down
right yeah absolutely but you will
probably be hearing a lot more about
Alexa in the future as Amazon tries to
integrate it into like literally
anything that I can get its hands on so
and it's actually interesting with the
fire tablet the idea would be that
you're walking around with the tablet in
your house and you're basically using it
like like like a smart home hub or
something like that you would press the
home button and say you know turn on the
lights or turn this thing off turn that
thing on whatever which is another way
of utilizing Alexa whether it's through
the tablet or through a smart speaker
Michael asks with google voice ai and
its large platforms do you think any
other personal assistants stand a chance
once google home comes out it's an
extremely good question obviously we
have to see google home my primary
concern with google home is that when
they presented it to the market they
promised a whole lot they had actually
said that you'd be able to potentially
on day one as far as I could tell have
natural two-way conversation with the
Google home and the Google assistant
that is extremely hard to do and as far
as I can tell it's not really how where
we are with the technology even with
google so there is a possibility that
they have set themselves up to over
promise coming out of the gate but the
commenter is right that google home
presents a significant challenge for
amazon it'll be a beast yeah absolutely
and that's why amazon came out with the
echo dot at such a low price they want
to try to seed the market before the
google home comes out for sure so yeah
good question we've talked a lot about
cord cutting on this show like a lot a
lot and I'm a strong proponent of it so
this whole NFL Twitter thing is a huge
deal being a cash
football fan from Buffalo go bills mmm
there are saves aid the super bowl I
just don't think that I ever wanted yeah
three years in a row I get it I get it
no I'm not in denial but this is cool
I'm kind of looking forward to this
because I did watch the yahoo stream
last year and it was I think a lot of
the failure was a timing thing mmm Oh
like what time it actually played
because they were playing in London so
was early mm-hmm on a weekend like
really early so I got up and made a ton
of breakfast and watch the game and for
what it's worth like the stream worked
fine am but in general I've had a shady
past with the Yahoo app and I watched it
on my xbox so I I will say this about
Twitter I don't know what the futures of
it are going to be for as far as a live
stream goes I don't know if it's just
gonna be a straight watch but I mean if
it wants to win this it should give
Twitter users you know kind of a feature
of they can make a live Jeff of it or
they can take a screenshot of it and
yeah as they're watching it which is
problematic for the NFL because they're
so protective over their content but it
still gets out Twitter either way I mean
that that's the same if they want to
build this platform they're gonna have
to be able to build it with social
chatter but that is what they're hoping
to do ya I you know now that we're
talking about it I might end up watching
this thing on Twitter tonight just
because I'm curious to see how it would
actually play out and if there were an
Eagles game because I'm an Eagles fan I
would have I usually using my smartphone
as the second screen too I don't know
complain about any number of eagles
issues you'll get to another year you'll
get to see Rex Ryan's glorious sweater
vests okay I look forward to it I feel
like I'm not doing anything else anyway
sure I'll watch I'll watch your NFL game
Twitter oh here's a thought what about
360 or VR video for football yeah I
think that's probably coming down then a
night ability yeah I mean that makes
perfect sense and i think it's just as
you said an inevitability that's
probably going to happen with twitter
being involved i think maybe that makes
it even more possible so yeah we'll see
what ends up happening with that so as
far as actually streaming it on Twitter
exactly how does that work you have to
look for a specific tweet are you just
basically going to Twitter
probably going to be publicized
everywhere I think they have a URL that
you can go to but it's also they have
the app on several streaming boxes like
the Amazon fire TV Xbox one help me out
here I mean I'm looking the other one I
mean it is on those platforms but I mean
the majority of twitter users users are
on mobile either way so I'm looking
forward to seeing what the mobile
experience is going to be like I don't
know how you're planning on watching it
but I mean with its usual again it's
usually a second screen experience but
now it being the first screen I'm
interested to see how that work you know
people on the train watching people you
know you know instead of you know
speaking with their friends and families
at like a dinner or something just
watching it on their phones yeah looking
forward to it chromecast yeah it
actually does not have chromecast uh not
natively but if you just brought it upon
a browser thank you probably yeah yeah
yeah that I'm into I would probably
watch it on TV as opposed to on my phone
like if I have the option it is football
so you are used to seeing it on a bigger
screen it we come so far with technology
we have giant everyone's got a giant TV
giant tvs are affordable now picture
quality is through the roof we got right
on the apex of 4k and it's like let's
put football here right and it's been
like the driving force behind like home
entertainment the only reason people
hang on the cable they're like screw it
right here yeah i'm sure people will
watch it on mobile as you said I mean
like maybe you're not around a
television or whatever so to me it could
be interesting too is that if Twitter
actually has any sort of success with
this it would be pretty cool to see more
games because oftentimes the Eagles
aren't playing in this market because
they'll get bounced by a jets or a
giants game so if it is playing on
Twitter then there's an enormous reason
for me to go to Twitter to actually see
it because I wouldn't be able to get it
otherwise so maybe they have a chance
with this one Alexander you are my
soulmate can Alexa order a pizza yet
yeah of course oh my god that came like
a couple months ago day one yeah that
was you can order it with Domino's I
think you have to do like some initial
setup because you can't really have a
back-and-forth conversation that well
with Alexa quite yet it's not like Alexa
order me a pizza okay do you want a
cheese or pepperoni I think you have to
preload like this is the type of pizza
that I'm getting
the place yeah it's specifically from
dominos they're the only ones that they
have like an app or feature they call
them skills specifically through Alexa I
haven't done it yet so I don't know
exactly how it works but knowing how
Alexa works I don't think that there's a
ton of option ality quite yet when
you're talking to her directly it's more
do this she's not conversational yet no
not generally I mean like in small ways
she can be like she has like small games
that you can play where you can do a
little bit more back and forth but in
general there's still a ways to go to do
more conversational stuff which again
that's why it's interesting that Google
presented to Google home as something
that can do much more natural
conversation so one more time back to
twitter what do you think the next
logical step is going to be what what
are the next live events we're going to
see them start to showcase after
football award shows yeah great
conversation point right that means I
pretty much think yes what's the water
cooler thing let's put it on Twitter
award shows makes a ton of sense because
that's another one of those second
screen experiences people like jump on
Twitter and say oh I can't believe this
person won that award or you know that
was a long time coming whatever so I
don't know what the rights are with
those things though so it might be very
difficult for them to snag awards show
yeah I would argue that most likely
presidential speeches and just political
events political Twitter's a very big
presence mm-hmm and just the idea that
you know and then the advantage of that
is essentially they're free you know you
know there's no copyright to it and you
can you know white house briefing or
anything like that you can just if you
set up a camera if you set up into the
feed you can kind of just be able to
stream that I mean they kind of did that
with a few debates before oh they did
yeah no I totally miss those I do i do
like i said before though i do think the
key though is not just offering a stream
but you know offering social integration
with it where you know I could take a
screenshot I can take a video clip from
a specific moment which they do already
with snappy TV but that's a service
provided to most media companies and not
the average Twitter user mm-hmm so I
mean if anything I think that's the key
route to go
yeah I think what's also interesting is
is that they vary directly decided not
to do scripted because they're more
interested in live stuff as opposed to
like scripted sitcoms or whatever stuff
that you could probably use a DVR for so
I think they know what their places in
the market or at least they're trying to
figure that out and it's more what's the
present as opposed to something
something that I could get to some time
later like you're not going to be
watching old family guy episodes on
Twitter anytime soon yeah but I mean
like Facebook has faced with live or on
YouTube right now we use live stream
Twitter's finally kind of late to the
game but that's a big get for them yeah
and I'm just imagining this right now
it's a guy who reads your comments
politico yikes yeah asking for a fight
yeah yeah but like you know they won
engagement and even if it's ugly I mean
like they've proven that more times than
most other social mediums so the problem
for them is is that a lot of these
rights are expensive and is it really
going to help them become more relevant
I mean they grow so much slower than
Facebook and so it's it's possible that
this is just a way for them to like sink
a lot of money into this experiment and
it doesn't actually work i mean like
twitter is not doing well so it's
important to pay close attention of that
and who's next in line after Twitter
Apple what as far as like live-streaming
event stuff like that Apple's been
looking into television for a long time
there are rumors around that allied
amazon is another one that's being
considered so i think all these guys are
looking at it as a way to you know build
their audience I'm gonna go with twitch
TV on this one I know they've got live
stuff already but the thing is most of
it is eSports they experimented with you
no more news kind of content before they
did it with the Republican National
Convention and the Democratic National
Convention and they did pretty decently
on that so I mean if they get into you
know actual sports I think it'd be a
good play hmm if they have the audience
yeah pun intended yeah for sure that's
probably a good place to leave it off we
got to go go back to work yeah
let's call it all right if you liked
what you saw heard check us out on cnet
com podcast is also on itunes google
play feedburner soundcloud and tune in
radio all right we'll be back on monday
so thanks very much for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
