it is episode 211 of the 359 podcast my
name is bvg and happy dyngus day to my
fellow pollocks buffalony ins and green
pointers out there in the house today we
have our good friends Joe nice oldman
and Roger Cheng and what are we talking
about today is Sunday I suppose I throw
this of me or am I supposed to do no no
it's a boy if your dingus day boys
polish boy store water and girls and hit
them with willows right to express
their lives all sounds like it's just on
the cusp of being dirty but it's not
it's will it's a cultural heritage
all right I it's like completely going
over my head right now second that's
cool are we talking about Facebook's
developer conference f8 and no that's
not fast and furious aid or fate of the
Furious sorry that's tomorrow fela sorry
Facebook developer conference is
tomorrow marks like birds can be
speaking so we're keen to hear what he
has to say given the last year of
controversy we'll also talk about the
the new season of Silicon Valley which
premieres this coming Sunday I don't
know about you guys but I'm a big fan
yeah our own sharp tip can get to go to
the premiere last week and was able to
pick out some of the best bits from a
panel discussion that they all had
either lastly we couldn't go through a
show that talking for the Star Wars
trailer because my geek I have to talk
about star you're not alone there we go
so as always if you have any questions
about any topics or anything else at
this point lead up the comments section
Brian will pick up the best and we'll
answer it in three minutes and 59
seconds from precisely 32 welcome to the
359 when we talk about the top tech news
of the day and all the crap we want to
throw in I'm Roger J and I'm Joanie
salzman Facebook is set to hold its f8
developer conference tomorrow and what
we want to know is what Mark Zuckerberg
is going to say it's been a year of
controversy of fake news grisly murders
broadcast on the network as well as its
supposed influence on the presidential
election so zech sort of has to address
this controversy right well I don't know
that'll be an interesting thing to see
he had that opus that he posted yep
however many thousands of thousands of
words it was and so
maybe that was him kind of clearing the
pipe so that he can just you know kind
of do demos of silly little VR things
right yeah stuff yeah but I think that
it would be really meaningful if he does
step up and address it when he has that
platform because I think it's something
that people have been disappointed that
he doesn't do run a more proactive basis
when he has to actually like show his
face not in like a Facebook post that's
pruned and polished and right actually
kind of off somewhat off the cuff on
stage yeah in real life as opposed to a
yet polished blog post right yeah I
don't know what we'll see like in terms
of the other stuff and obviously you
cover VR a lot or you what are you
hoping or wine to see from facebook in
terms of VR for VR um that's a really
good question i think that what is
really interesting that VR hasn't moved
into are some of the things that they
teased last time which is bring social
elements into it absolutely and so it'll
be interesting to see if how quickly
oculus is actually going to make good on
being able to deliver that thing because
I haven't delivered on any of that stuff
right since the last time and I think
the last August conference they showed
off some of the chat features yeah like
you said incorporate some of those
social elements into the VR experience
we haven't seen any of that now so be
yeah it'd be nice if they actually dress
it is a two day conference so if they
don't do it day one there might be a
chance that they address it on on day
two all right next up the new season
Silicon Valley premieres on Sunday but
our own shower tip caen got a chance to
attend the premiere and hear from the
cast big news more women and supposedly
more sex on the show I want is to say
any sex right right right that doesn't
involve a horse it is very interesting
to me if you read through a char story
and I had a chance to edit it um you
know even though there was discussion of
having more women involved a panel
discussion was actually still dominated
by all the male casas right interesting
so we'll see it I think they're gonna
bring in you you new talent in terms of
female actors they're gonna have more
regular roles there so it's been aside
from Amanda Cruz who plays Monica right
uh you know it's been
of their has a really real consists of
female presence right so i think that
from Shara's reporting there's going to
be three coders that are female on the
new on the new venture yep that the Pied
Piper dudes are going to be venturing
into dudes are going to be venturing
into so that gives the opportunity to
have their be kind of more characters
that women rather than one
representative of them just a woman it
does remind me a bit of big bang theory
when that show started was just thinking
it was just penny and a bunch of dudes
and now it's sort of like this weird
even mix so maybe they're slowly
evolving that way to can't balance
things out no I don't know I lastly the
new Star Wars last Jedi trailer dropped
last week I'm blown away but that's not
surprised because I'm a giant geek and I
love Star Wars I think Star Wars but
would you think Joan as a more objective
view right things what did you think I
thought it was um effective and that I'm
definitely gonna go see it yeah um
because i think you know we talked about
this before like it plays on every
single like synapse that fires having
chemicals in your brain yes it like
builds the crescendo it has like that
dramatic i mean it has everything that
you could want right if you already are
among the like bazillion of people i
care yeah Star Wars which is basically
everybody on the planet because it's
like the most successful franchise ever
and how many times did you guys watch
the trailer I watched it twice because i
watch the second right now i'm at i
think i'm at five times six alright so
bvg you have a salt beat all right for
these stories and more tricks on Cena
I'm Roger Cheng Jody salzman thanks for
listening so I think the first and
foremost let's put a conversation piece
into the chat if anyone's had any
particularly negative experiences with
Facebook regarding let's say fake news
or or trolling or anything like that
yeah being in a bubble that's not a
bubble yeah we'd love to hear from you
in the chat to kind of get this
conversation a little more depth beyond
what Zuckerberg had to say and starting
first and foremost Lance in the chat
says will they ever get a handle
the political overload hmm I mean that's
more importantly will your friends ever
get a handle on the political overload
uh it's such an interesting question
because they feel like that they kind of
need that that cycle that the rhetoric
all that stuff it helps feed the beast
of facebook uh in terms of getting you
to like stay on there all the time yeah
yeah I don't know as well I'm Shem I'm
hoping they do address it in some way
but you know like Jones said like Mark
has already talked about this in his
giant manifesto so we'll see how deeply
they get into it I don't know yeah it's
kind of like a tension between is Mark
Zuckerberg gonna play by his normal
rules and not talk about it at all right
or is he gonna like cuz the thing that's
the criticism is that he avoids talking
about these issues yeah and so it's kind
of like will this be an opportunity for
him to break from that track record and
kind of have maiya culpa in public yep
I'm in front of people I personally
think there's just got to be a lot of
action called action for the users to
actively start filtering like it it's
all about self education you know it's
it's the it's the player not the game
and in my personal opinion very very
personal opinion I mean if I see
something I really argue against and I
can you know see like blogspot com I can
pretty much filter that out right um
it's it's a you know we were taught in
in school to cite your resources right
yeah you got to maintain that but you
know what that doesn't happened for most
people they just sort of see what they
see the headline they don't see their
sources like that that's sort of the
issue right anyone can post anything on
facebook and it can go viral and most
people like most people don't check
their sources that's ultimately it right
I think that you've got a good point
that there needs to be more education of
people about what to trust online and
how you learn how to trust yes what's
right I don't trust the guy out on the
corner on the soapbox scream right
bullhorn right I think that there's
definitely merit to like the fact that
everybody that culturally we all things
have just changed so fast culturally
kids in school the people that teach
them everybody needs to have a better
grasp on how to
interact with society mmm through the
internet and on the internet but also
like effing Facebook is friggin huge
like you can solve these problems like
if there are problems friggin solve them
you know like you have you say you have
the smartest brains in the world so
prove it yeah they posting we're all
coasting at this point they're coasting
on it's like well we're still getting
clicks we're still getting money we're
coasting on well this is my comfort zone
and I don't have to do anything else
this makes me feel good I mean that's
yeah that's a good point to it for the
user I mean we'd naturally gravitate
towards something like horses our
beliefs or so if we like no I'm
youtubers they just let go and watch
something they hate so they can comment
on it pray right hate watching is a tone
phenomenon but yeah like you said
Facebook's got algorithms that basically
gear the site towards what you want to
see right exactly yeah and there is
something but potentially innocent about
that like yeah I want to see more Star
Wars stuff in my feed but right that's
not really up to me one hundred percent
now is it and that's the other algorithm
gets yeah you'd buy your surrounding
audience by your surrounding community
that's true but also facebook makes it
difficult for you to have that kind of
control over what you see yeah like it's
very hard for you to like I really like
to have a linear um a linear feed like
the Twitter style just everything that
in the order chronological the way that
comes it's really hard to like just tell
Facebook just give it to me the time
that is posted yeah you can only do it
for like you have to like do it on the
web you have to it only lasts for 24
hours then it resets back to their
algorithm because um they make it hard
for them not to have they make it hard
for you to have the control that they
want yeah you think maybe that inclusion
of the algorithm is really what kind of
set it on that kind of downhill trend
getting away from the the current the
chronological I don't know if it's
getting away from that if that's aI
don't know if like algorithm is wrong
it's just it's it's based on this
premise that there's somebody that's
deciding what the algorithm there's a
small set of people that are deciding
what algorithm is and those people
usually aren't people who are trained to
think about consequences like murders
being lives right yeah or you know
that's not what they're there to deliver
so it's not their job to figure that out
but when you're as big as Facebook and
these things are happening you need to
hire people to figure out how to not
have that sort of conflict with great
power comes great responsibility true
extraordinaire Lee true it's true
they've got a lot of power a lot of
power oh yeah well we got a few people
in the chat who want to talk about VR
and AR yasiel our buddy awwww through VR
how can this be used for social
networking now we talked about dating
right yeah yeah yeah there's jiading or
our intern Sam rugs actually got on a VR
date yeah the idea that you can you can
meet and interact with someone you know
across the country in in a similar
location he may not be next to each
other physically but in that virtual
world you are nice to each other you you
know she said she mentioned actually the
VR host that had that simulated date
with her like kind of styled up next to
her virtually and she even thought was a
little creepy and I thought was kind of
an interesting like that that would go
through a brain like oh this you're
standing too yeah you're too little lulu
closer debating my personal you can be
like a thousand miles in virtual space
exactly uh which i mean i think that
that's a good example that social
element just i think the example that
was a displayed last year the oculus
conference was that it could sort to
chat right vr chat with your wife you
could bring in VR elements into this
space that you you're sharing with her
um yeah I mean I think there's there's
tons opportunities there that i think
would actually make vr more of a thing
that we'd want yeah everyday experience
one of the big criticisms of VR
warranted or not is that it's an
isolated experience yes so that yeah
yeah takes some of that away although
just kind of like drop all these images
from like sci-fi movies of just people
sitting yeah like the matrix obviously
is yeah obvious lawnmower man yeah you
just everyone is sitting in this little
room with their little goggles I'm
thinking of wall-e of all the fat people
drinking there's yeah well you're gonna
discreet yeah let's put a call back out
to the chat what's your VR wish list for
social networks I got one personally
yeah be kind of cool to resurrect
obsolete experiences for example ah as
much as I love netflix there's a piece
of me that misses going to blockbuster
what if there was essentially Ali Ansari
rowdy denial you walk in the aisles
looking for something to watch and then
there's some annoying kid behind the
counter who keeps telling you how great
the matrix reloaded it uh yeah I'm old
enough to remember that spending
countless hours with my friends walking
through the aisles like above this movie
now sucks there's something that was
kind of funny i like i used to kill
hours just wandering and yams out
absolutely before the internet was a
thing right especially block where
they'd have like 50 copies of the latest
crappy blockbuster Brian like
incorporate IMDb so you pick up the box
off the shelf and like the full spread
comes up in the rotten tomatoes rating
comes someone's probably working on this
see they've listen to this podcast yeah
idea niche audience of bvg have to
address I'm not market of the Ox saying
that blockbuster should come back it's
still antiquated experience but it would
be kind of fun to relive generally yeah
aces group is asking what is Facebook's
plan for AI well I know um that they use
AI a lot in what the things that I know
about Facebook an AI right now in terms
of the network they use it a lot in like
photo tagging they want to do use it a
lot of accessibility do you know of
other I mean they mentioned also he's
mentioned using AI to thwart terrorism
procurement especially on Facebook worth
a lotta stuff kind of happens mean is
that more than just keyword filtering
though I imagine yeah like basically
looking at I guess discussions or
keywords and kind of putting it all
together sure um I mean that's it was a
very kind of like stated broad topic
goal for the facebook i don't know how
it actually would work in practice but I
mean they definitely bought that up
there are different applications for you
I so that's definitely an interesting
application I feel like that would be
extraordinarily difficult to does it be
continually usurped they would outsmart
the AI yes uh it depends right appends
on how deep they go if they're actually
carrying into your chats into your posts
like but then we come up to the
conversation of privacy yes yeah which
has always been a dicey one for facebook
yeah yeah go figure so yeah alright
we've got enough through the heavy we're
running out of time
let's talk about stone sneak out oh yeah
all right Roger you're okay so we've got
two different perspectives on this not
the Jones a hater but Jones not a hater
at all I'm just more that Joan did not
come or a rational observer who
phenomenon I love Star Wars watch this
kid I'm gonna see the movies you can
look at it fairly objectively yes yes we
can no more adaptive yeah yeah totally
it's a really good teaser it is we're
just saying like it's really good
because it doesn't give away anything
but I don't really know much about the
story we know that the characters are
coming back no kidding right and that's
a really we know we know uh Luke's gonna
train ray right like that's yeah but
that was pretty obviously it's not gonna
be like really outta here will he cuz of
Jedi must end yeah but Willy yeah Willy
and how William the Jedi so I mean
that's why it makes a great teacher like
you know nothing that's going on as
opposed to the spider-man trailer we're
just like okay I already seen it we know
that we know the movie deal thanks guys
i have a few speculative concepts i want
to just kind of put out there ooh first
and foremost i think that this will in
fact be the end of the dark and the
light side which is a good social
political reflection on modern
philosophies about how we become such a
great society there's no more like
blatant evil blame good sure there's
still other points out there but we've
become so much more amalgam asst is that
a word yeah I like the idea that it's
great cuz it that's one thing that was
bothered me what the whole dark and
light side was like if you're on the
light side like you can't do anything
you can't get married like you have to
you're basically you're a priest right
there taking all these vows of
everything and seem kind of weird to me
like how did well if you've been
watching Star Wars rebels and even
earlier on and clone wars it started
introduced this idea through the
character of asoka where she's like I'm
tired of this you're both wrong oh when
I land in the middle they've introduced
an important concept right rebels that
predates a new hope where that is become
an increasingly popular concept and how
that you know even throughout the entire
hex ology so far that that has been like
this is the old ways you know right the
light and the dark well that would make
sense because the at the end of the
return Jedi right or really actually I'm
sorry go back to the prequels as much as
people hate that the idea of like
bringing balance to the force and we
knew it wasn't Anakin ultimately it's
luke and so if Lucas bring balance more
snow it's still technically Anakin
million came back that was the whole
point well now furthermore I want to
expand on that idea what if I select the
idea that brain balance of the forest
means it's not dark and light like it's
dark and light kind of coexisting in one
person exactly and I think we're going
to attic you know it that only happened
for Anakin for like five seconds of any
that was still hey what's the word I'm
looking for not resolution I guess it
was kind of resolution anyways I think
we're gonna get a reevaluation and find
out that in fact the important playing
parties are not just the Skywalker's but
also the Kenobi's because i really
really really believe that Ray is a
Kenobi and we're good i know that it was
always an important part to have its
Skywalker and Kenobi bring balance to
the force and that's going to be our new
duet we're going to see kylo come back
Ray's going to bring them back and
they're going to take down Snoke and
then there's going to be no more
political or but I don't know a wiping
of the politicizing of force-users just
just my personal thoughts as I go in you
know overexcited I do analyzing I do
ultimately hope that whatever happens
that they do shake things up a bit cuz
like I love for soybeans when I first
watched it and even watched it again but
then like as I thought about more and
more over time like this is really just
our same thing mix which is also fine
it's fine but like the right now yeah
you kind of want things to be shaken up
a bit right give me some fresh give me
something yeah yeah I feel like as the
objective like observer I'm kind of like
I want the force to just be light and
dark cuz then it's a perfect cookie bite
like but look at where we come as people
who have grown up on Star Wars yeah I've
been attracted to the simplification and
as it's grown up with us I wanted to
complex we will not be more mature soap
opera we develop and grow with us yeah
although it's looking modern a
philosophy that said I mean ultimately
these movies are still being made for
kids we'll see if if they go there may
be made for a broad audience boos kids
which makes it easier if you're just
like light dark I am lights and toys
you're bad i'm going
you and do a new toy new vehicles here
here's an interesting theory from don't
worry ray turns to the dark side and
kylo and Luke have to fight her oh oh
I'll be badass that would be shaking
things up I don't know if they go that
far I bet we'll at least get like an
alternative universe comic were they oh
yeah they've already done justice for DC
there was the kind of but there was a
star wars series a couple of decade or
so ago called infinities where Leia was
the chosen one uh it was an interesting
concept look him up those are good books
it's completely non-canonical but once
again you impressed me with your
cyclopedia knowledge of all deep cuts
yeah nothing better to do d because all
right that's probably a good place and
it yeah let's go watch the trailer again
alright if you liked anything you saw or
heard here check us on cnet our podcasts
also available on itunes stitcher
SoundCloud feedburner and google play
music see y'all tomorrow bye bye
