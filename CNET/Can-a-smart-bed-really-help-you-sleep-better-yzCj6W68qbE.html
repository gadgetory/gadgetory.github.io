to spend over a month testing out the it
bed by Sleep Number a 1099 dollar
queen-size mattress with smart tech
built into it is that I've gotten to
sleep on a mattress that's significantly
more comfortable than the lumpy old
mattress I had at home before it also
has built-in sensors that track your
breathing rate and your heart rate every
single night so when you wake up it has
all sorts of information they're ready
for you it gives you a daily a weekly
and a monthly report of your overall
averages as well so you can track trends
and see just how well you've been
sleeping the thing I love about that is
that it lets you see long-term how you
can improve your sleep but there are a
couple of things I don't love about this
mattress for starters almost 1,100 bucks
is a time to spend on a smart mattress
so I would expect that it would have a
little more smart tech that would give
it the edge to make it worth spending
that much money the problem is that I
didn't quite encounter that with Sleep
Number the smarts with the third party
integrations they promise so I set up a
nest thermostat a wide thing scale a
couple of fit bits they didn't integrate
the way that I hoped they would they
pull in a lot of data but the problem is
so far those integrations aren't
actually telling me a lot and that's
something I would love to see in the
future so even though I like this bed I
think it's super comfortable I'm not
sure the value is quite there or that
the smarts are quite there just yet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
