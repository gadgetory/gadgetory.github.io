ID hidden security feature Apple's
iPhone 10 drops touch ID in favor of a
3d face scanning technology Apple calls
face ID almost immediately people had
concerns about how it could be defeated
by other people could someone just point
your own phone at you and be able to
unlock the device a developer by the
name of Keith crumble wrote an email
about his concerns and sent it directly
to Craig federighi
Apple's senior VP of software
engineering to criminal surprise
federighi replied Crimbo posted the
email exchange on twitter crumble asked
if the iphone 10 would require a
passcode more often than touch ID does
referencing the moment during Apple's
presentation wear face ID did not work
as planned for the Apple senior VP
federighi replied saying being locked
out of face ID requires several
interactions by other people where they
woke up your phone he says in his
day-to-day experiences this has not been
a problem then there's a security
question posed by tremble what will
prevent a thief from taking my phone
point to get in my face and running
Betty Reedy explained if you don't stare
at the phone it won't unlock he also
mentioned if you grip the buttons on
both sides of the phone when you hand
over the device face ID will be
temporarily disabled there is no mention
as to how long this lockout less during
Apple's presentation there was no
information about this feature either
the Apple iPhone 10 is not due out until
November 3rd expect a lot more
information about face ID to trickle out
since this is a relatively big change
for all the coverage check out some calm
Amaya's act iron I'll see you online</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
