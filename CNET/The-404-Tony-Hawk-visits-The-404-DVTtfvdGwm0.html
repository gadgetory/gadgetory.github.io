expect from this game it's there's a bit
of a misconception that it's sort of
just like a 3d reboot um but it's more
than that it's sort of like a
culmination of those first two games
it's it's the best of our first two
games um all in you know with the new
hardware we can't ever had to redo
everything right engine and with the
graphics and so you know i guess the
misconception is someone we just uh
president it really was a much bigger
project than that and also because we
wanted to be that much better you know
don't want to just be something that
looks a little cleaner right um but i
think the thing that people are asking
about most is beyond you know which
levels are going to be in it um is music
and so we put half of the original
soundtrack in and half new stuff and
I've actually heard people say like oh
it's got to have all the neutral we in
in the interest of evolving sure serious
yeah we got to put some new stuff ends
of course you know I want this to live
on and this is it's only going to be
downloadable so it's only going to be on
xbox live and there's a playstation
store yeah PSN yeah um and so yeah PS
now we're getting so I want to be able
to do stuff later on new levels you know
levels that have them in any game right
downloadable content stuff like that so
let us so obviously the warehouse level
that's got to be awesome I mean without
that I mean God it's just admit I spent
so much time doing that playing that
game is that I don't think about it
that's warehouse that's the first level
on the first game that game was only on
ps1 yeah so you know we're two consoles
from there now for sure like two leaps
and technology generation put them up
it's just funny how we thought I mean it
was true but for the ps1 and for the for
our game especially people like the
graphics are amazing yeah and when you
put those side by side which we just did
at the game developers conference you
know here's here's the first game right
here's the new one it's just ridiculous
it's it's it's it's like bittersweet
it's like Oh what it's like you're
watching a super 8 projector on a wall
yeah exactly is
are going to be a multiplayer element
that's something that didn't exist when
the first game yes came out so yeah is
there an online yeah part of this yes
yes 55 game modes okay I'm from see I
feel like you can't appreciate how
important this series is especially for
this guy because I'm like the resident
gamer and this guy is the resident
everything else but and video game just
literally I hate a venom for me still so
many years of my life but so my game is
common ground it transcends it
transcends that casual gamer sort of uh
barrier so many good days and bad days
were punctuated by how many secret tapes
i got unlock all right Tony Hawk
dictated the rest of your wheezes I know
not that poses a challenge secret tapes
mm-hmm we're not ones last time you saw
videotape oh my god what is it like I'm
drive or something kids are gonna kill
you say we updated it so okay you don't
want to tell us so good i raise unlock
he's like now I'm not gonna get anything
