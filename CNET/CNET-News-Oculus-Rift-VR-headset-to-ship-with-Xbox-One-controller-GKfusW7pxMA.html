announce that we're gonna include a
wireless Xbox one controller and adapter
in the oculus rift the Xbox one
controller is designed by one of the top
teams in gaming to tell you more I'd
like to welcome Phil Spencer head of
Xbox hello everyone I'm Phil Spencer
head of Xbox and I'm excited to be here
to announce a partnership between
Microsoft and a leader in virtual
reality oculus the opportunity for us to
bring our wireless controller the one
that we've spent so many years refining
to every oculus user at launch is
incredibly exciting for us and we think
unlocks the potential for game
developers everywhere and Microsoft were
incredibly focused on making Windows a
great operating system for gamers and
with Windows 10 partnering with oculus
to make it the very best aukerman
operating system for oculus rift we
believe we will unlock the potential for
millions of developers everywhere to
create incredible virtual reality
experiences the rift will natively work
with Windows 10 to make it easy to set
up jump in and have incredible VR
experiences from day one and we all know
that virtual reality experiences require
the highest performance framerate
latency and with DirectX 12 working with
oculus to ensure that those experiences
are exactly the kind of experiences that
you will expect in the gamers will
expect we believe we'll be able to
create state-of-the-art virtual reality
experiences on the oculus rift on top of
Windows
another key area of focus for us that we
talked about back in January was the
ability to stream Xbox one games to
Windows 10 devices meaning it was really
important that we're able to bring the
greatness of Xbox Xbox Live and all of
the games that people have created to
PCs and tablets everywhere I'm really
proud to announce that that steam
streaming capability will be available
for oculus rift people will be able to
stream their Xbox one games grey Doc's
box
Xbox one games like Halo 4 it's a sunset
overdrive to the oculus rift using the
controller that they know and love
something we've spent a lot of time
perfecting and the ability to work with
the team in oculus to create a virtual
cinema where Xbox one games will show up
I think really pays off the value of
people's investment in their games and
obviously their investment in oculus</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
