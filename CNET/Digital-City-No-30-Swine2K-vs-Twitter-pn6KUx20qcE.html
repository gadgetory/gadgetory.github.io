talking for us to hear you now we're all
gonna be we're all gonna be on our best
behavior day where are you going you're
like running away Hey look we're playing
around the cameras here trying to figure
out how these work we're so divided
tutoring ourselves because no one will
show us though being technologically
minded being technologically minded guys
I think we'll be able to kind of figure
this that what do you think so far can
you watch little monitor behind me what
do you see um could you see right now
and you in it and yes and there's a
Joseph and wait wait wait have special
surprise for you guys what I want you

I'm going to try to hit the buttons of
the people who are talking so I can you
know kind of keep that person I was like
say something watch I'll show you how it
works say something just and she saw
videos but there you are up on the
screen yeah isn't magical Julie thing
yes I see all right excellent I'm gonna
go to the wide shot there is that there
we all are so besides messing around
with this kind of stuff and having a
Scott sign here seen its newest th
newest editor welcome everyone well
welcome to me yes well everyone say
hello to me hey hi excellent and we're
glad to be here and we're just gonna
jump right in because this is kind of a
short show we don't we try to keep it
under like 25 minutes or so so it's kind
of like sitcom sitcom length almost
mm-hmm I think the big topic is what i
like to call the swine 2k swine is
divine and that is my version of the y2k
meets the swine flu I'm trying to
practice um finger aerobics heer ranjha
taken eating all the buttons on the
different cameras think someone else is
gonna have to eventually take this over
well thanks got what you see on the
screen in front of you I see firefox 3
okay so you don't see this after the
second owner is it was up on that
monitor last week like for instance hit
hit on your number this will be
fascinating for anybody came to this I
want you to hit the number one on the
number keyboard at the top and see what
happens it's not open it's not right so
we're controlling it from over here and
that's fine hmm swine 2k are you guys
afraid you're gonna die you're not gonna
die what's going on here if I die I die
what can I do are you going to avoid are
you gonna avoid people who like coughing
stuff or sneeze on a on the street or in
the trains what can you do I mean your
call me be like yo take that in
between cars well they're telling people
to stay home Joe Biden said don't get on
the the subway if you think somebody
around you is got the swine flu board
you might have is that your way of
telling me and Julie we have lost
tomorrow huh if only only if you
actually do have the swine flu you have
to get a test comes back positive you're
cool if not there's gonna be
consequences well i'm going to have
allergies right I'm gonna miss time to
go get tested so he didn't mention buses
you just mentioned Subway's so if you
took a bus buses did he was it an
accident that he forgot to mention buses
or was it the ventilation of a bus only
buses run outside so the air has a
chance to kind of blow the swine flu
away doesn't like it doesn't like
sunlight it doesn't like Sen like I was
on a bus today and I saw a man wearing a
little surgical mask the business suit
wasn't Michael jackal teacher wasn't a
little woman he was a seemed to be a
Japanese businessman which is common in
Tokyo if you have an illness yeah that
you would protect others from your
illness so I don't know I meant that he
had the swine flu probably not but it
was terrifying because the night before
we had been watching Ernie Anastos and
the you know local news discussing
casually the way it had been going out
of hand well people are using obviously
reason why were talking about this
people using technology to battle the
swine flu yeah one way they're doing it
is a google map they have they have a
pandemic map of where outbreaks have
been reported by the World Health
Organization the wh 0 there's a big
google map you can you can keep a look
you can keep track of it there they'll
have like let's say they have purple i
think purple arrows mean there's a
confirmed case like pink arrows mean
there's a probable case
and red ones means somebody's dead now I
haven't seen anybody dead but let's see
they're all in their own California
there's a lot of Mexico and let's look
at the Northeast a couple kind of in the
Northeast to hear wait I'm gonna hold
this up actually look at that slices up
but the third is although if Joseph
actually oh no wait Scott if you call
the map up on your screen I think I can
cut to that would that be exciting where
was he dress is in that google doc which
he had open on allergy had open yeah my
phone well we can have you guys there an
iphone app is there is there a special i
dont ask y luna hey you know what I'm
I'm gonna go program that right now is
ninety-nine cents ice wine wine ice wine
I should buy ice wine all right well I
swore yeah which is also delicious I
said I said well I made them fermented
apples ice wine no yeah I swine the
switch is not like I spear I see which
was a brief late 90s trend where they
would freeze beer sweep off the crystals
that formed on the top and then they'll
view the beer you just love you anyway
there is a nice wine like a it's
delicious yeah like a barley wine is
another form yeah yeah like an apple
wine mm-hmm delicioso very sweet unlike
the illness yeah anyway besides besides
my my fictional iphone app what was I
gonna call it ice well I don't know
there's actually a website now called
spline fighter dot-com I check that out
before it's a little web browser game
for for fighting you take your needle
and you stick pigs with them and cure
them really because they all have the
because they all have the swine flu to
eliminate our aggression afraid it's a
glitter spray should be able to get the
link right there in Joseph's have you
play swine fighter yet no I can't say
that I haven't had much time to game
lately cuz you're too busy yeah it's
probably a flash game it's not that yeah
really go for it now seriously I'm
actually testing a key drive right now
well somewhat let's see oh there you go
Scott yesterday we go go do a swine oh
yeah just go to swine fighter calm i'm
watching your screen right there okay
then i slowly google it might be the
voting on the episode ever but once we
get goods is it everything one city
center
everything I think it'll be a lot
smoother okay so nicely growing pains
swine fighter com yeah yeah and the
virus is getting out of control so let's
kill it now and swine flips Wi-Fi to the
swine flu game they can see over your
shoulder your computer screen so I'll
know when you got there we go it's
intimidating the bashment arrest in
there we go yes oh wow okay look like
Simon Colbert is that Stephen Colbert in
disguise I think so oh my gosh should be
some sort of viral there should be some
kind of viral whatever is not funny
that's funny that does not not funny you
see this jason i think this this is not
i feel like this one those apps is good
and with merriment skull the terrified
man serious epidemic right no I say
we're making fun of it it's like a
problem my dad's a doctor and he said
last night he doesn't feel at this point
that but it never reach level 5 before
so it's pretty it's pretty terrifying
it's like it was that much late
seventies with the with the people in
the underground bunker trying to solve
the trying to cure the space disease I
don't know michael crichton book anyone
andromeda strain and drive day there you
go you know what actually get man can i
can i actually directly quote my dad or
paraphrase what he said of course can we
call him can we have him on well he said
he said there's nothing to worry about
or it'll happen so fast that everybody's
gonna die and that's the way it is 10pm
eyes like thanks the Strand it kind of
seemed strand like it does I mean not
that strike you to his friends books
understand what about what about the
others i have all those books it's like
that movie I'm outbreak yeah kind of
like that but that was based on what the
hot zone right ya the monkey be right
the stand was like super flu so Stephen
King may have predicted this Stephen
King priests age the super Lulu as much
as this dude Craig side he had to
predict something one in a hundred
eighty like you know what the columns
are not coming to life the prom queens
don't have psychic powers but the flu
it's okay Peter was not a good
prediction meteor I come true yet
Oh for me it was creepy yeah oh yeah
yeah wait wait wait wait is this
something going on here's Julia texting
someone I don't know is that Julie I
know I'm gonna cut to the Jilly cam
we're gonna find out oh oh I wasn't
texting anybody was
reading a text difference hello you're
not gonna respond + + + + + no one heard
right oh my phone thank you very much
cuz i have it on my break my other
people mind silent and if you can text i
could text too i got a text you right
now I just see I said no text i was
reading attacks i knew i was really nice
shine that's right he was just using
skype which is using ice wine to figure
out where he should hide to avoid the
swine flu so we've what we've
established here what we've established
here is there are two ways primarily to
use technology which is our topic here
to help us with the swine flu one track
it on the google maps so you know we're
not to go or to just play swine fighter
which is there go still up on the screen
how many did you get what youre square
there i can't read um 0 wait no i did
better before it's 40 level 3 and gets a
plan it's getting addictive not
tremendously what's more it's just that
boring in here it's cuz i'm afraid of
accessing the other app that actually
tells me the spread of swine flu I'd
rather play this and live in denial
wasn't it won't confirmed death toll
from swine flu in in the States uh there
might have been the young Mexican Boing
in Queens yeah 15 months old the 23
months old damn yeah yeah think they
really need to move this monitor behind
me over here so I can actually see which
cameras that we forget I was gonna keep
it on long shot now it reminds me of
sliver slip up there with all the morrow
yeah they're in Sedona somebody Baldwin
one of the Baldwin that's right and
they're all monitors are being under
surveillance I keep turning and I feel
like my head is I'm never looking at
myself in the right angle I'm checking
out these is just adjusting they're
looking at himself it was actually
looking at the camera you had it on
Julie sipping her water I meant to put
on you but again two and three or first
that's kind of weird alright and that's
why men's game we don't wanna panic
everybody instead too late I found
another very disturbing notice waiting
for me yesterday when I went home it was
a paper notice taped to my front door
and it read I need a truck lights get
like a flashlight none of my fish there
was a nose escape to the front door and
it said in fact if I had my snowing on
my phone with a but it's that time
warner will be upgrading the service in
your building today to expect outages
between 10am
and for ya well luckily you're here
luckily I'm here so I don't have to live
with a cable outage but I figure about
braiding who knows what that means and
it certainly did not look like any kind
of official notice it was like somebody
typed it out on their computer there's
no time water logo on it it's just like
here it is taped up and and and then
then it said there will be outages and
then somebody wrote in May so it said
there may be outages well I mean now
weird maybe the guy ran out and forgot
the free online they wiped up an adopted
typed it up in the truck because my
service has been terrible lately we've
discussed the lack of good cable and
internet options here in New York
specifically Time Warner's pretty much
all your your only game if you're in a
lot of the city well you give verizon
dsl maybe not ok but are you gonna get
your a TV from that dude ish did you
love before life oh yeah barb has he
gone off grid oh that's right oh my god
I talked about this yeah second bomb off
the grid the time warner cable but not
time warner broadband and it's like a
long-term relationship i think so
instead of the triple play that they
advertised in this single single play
what's that spanish music style me the
song that takes Latin people back ten
years that's right that's right horrible
yeah it's like 23 comer what I came back
87 to the eye reggaeton style song right
yeah it sort of guys on the beach and
he's like a sort of reggaeton but it's
not but it's about because it's a
commercial yeah guys like wearing like a
lobster is embarrassing nursing lettin
people everywhere thank you very much we
got to find that how can i find that now
you to be no no def no I feel if we play
that before though they're like several
now you don't we did it but you don't
have to play and we will not I mean the
girls that the girls look I but listen
it's like the fun that commercials yeah
you're right it is that's that's
horrible too who is that from Zephyr
Eisen oh that's great daddy talk baby
that's the golden boy yep long I own
gets that um well yeah I'm just I'm just
broadband now we use a uhf antenna to
pull over the over-the-air HD mm-hmm and
then i hook up my macbook with a little
converter which is send me annoying but
then
can in the end watch stuff from hulu or
boxy when boxy is working with all the
feeds and hook up itunes so we're like
uh I'm sorry this drugs us too if you go
to play got at least let me see it
there's like clockwork orange I don't
want to hear let me see it at least not
beethoven's nine my people are gonna
come here yeah come on d gente move yeah
we ate your people it's not it's not as
bad without the video video video makes
it eight don't make you see the guy
dressed up like you see the guy just
like the Loch Ness monster let's get
dude in the background stabbing his tail
over and over again like a fake sword
I'd like to get the lobster after Don
like hiding in the sand well one thing's
for sure you'll never forget the phone
number you're right about Iver I've
already forgotten it oh please really
yeah that's your thing I'm not gonna eat
something larissa I'm not going to say
if I know because I'm not giving you
advertising exactly high 55 XYZ em okay
so when did you got at the concentrate
on hitting the camera buttons at the
same time when did you decide to get rid
of actual cable service and just keep
the internet well we had a kid so I'm in
the baby boat too and we thought we'd
save some money we don't even have time
to watch TV and my wife said to me why
don't we do it and then everybody says
you don't time to watch TV but Joseph
you up lending time to watch TV nav art
and watch it when he goes to bed ok ok
and of course the games you fit in the
game as well right unfortunately I have
to DVR those and I tell people don't
call me when they see a spectacular play
because I'm a little behind ok ok we
know what you're right we do if I'm
watch TV we usually wind up watching the
reality shows I don't want to watch so
we sort of get trapped in I love money
flavor of love rock of love watch oh
yeah that one's good what the hell is up
with that tanisha told me that's an
Oscar De La Hoya's nice is that so ooh
that's Oscar De La Hoya's nice oh no I
think she's on a different show i've
heard that didn't I first yesterday
before like that's tasty yeah ever I
don't know whatever
chick is one of our own show whatever
moving on but yeah so I got it I got a
new macbook on the fall and when I
realized that you know it handles it
fine and i bought the converter to you
know DVI up to hdmi that you know it
plays a fine the streams and finds i
said let's do the experiment it sounded
appealing as opposed to upsetting no
would you call time warner and you said
yeah so we called them get rid of the
cable and i'm keeping the internet yeah
so we downgraded first to just a basic
package then i had to return the cable
box do they try to talk you out of it
they wanted to know what i was doing and
they were actually okay because i think
you know I actually think now with the
recession a lot many people are cutting
off completely I bet the fact that I was
still keeping half of it they probably
felt was it was a that was a win a
Pyrrhic victory yeah they're like you
know what we're getting this guy for
some money plus my account which is
earthlink which is setting 2099 on a
promotional goes up to 50 in about a
month and and then who knows what in the
future and that if they unleash more
damage so metered a metered broadband
yeah it's upsetting cuz I left off I had
to go downtown to drop off the box which
was annoying it's like big Brazil like
waiting waiting room like DMV is
actually one there's actually a Time
Warner office right by here on
twenty-third Street it's actually very
nice that's the one I went to but it
just you take a number they call your
number it's great it was not bad it was
fast it was a bit like DMV it was weird
just like actually they didn't give me
any hard time they said it's fine and
and so I was excited to watch everything
uh you know without having to plug in
the cable but then first box he's been
having problems linking you know the ABC
kind of holdouts connectivity weaken
their links on it the hulu feeds weird
and then hulu started pulling content
and now it's cycling so i was watching
it so always sunny in philadelphia and
now i am trapped in the middle of season
three because they don't have any more
than five episodes yeah but you said got
netflix i guess you got yeah you do
netflix I mcneff content isn't a whole
library I get lazy about ordering the
discs yeah but who's really good in
fling.com as a lot of stuff in our own
our very own tv.com is very good also
that's a lot of stuff so so far um has
been going on this has now been a month
oh it's new it's very new we're gonna
have to keep track of this the most
annoying thing is angling I'm back to
antenna angling
because i bought this about this one
model a target and get the over the air
sick nigga diversity get over here HD
yeah okay and it looks great never sir
guy i have been cable HD it is expressed
exactly its but i have a friend who's a
die-hard into that convinced me to do it
but you have to contribute over-the-air
HD like survival is that's an a-line
people he lives in anyway so he's like a
grizzly adams what do they call those
guys the the militia people you know
they're very the very you know of the
earth types and they aren't over the air
stuff zactly most people don't even know
it's funny how many people when you talk
to them don't know that you can still
get TV over the air that's HD I've had a
lot of people say to me wait I don't
understand I thought they stopped that
and because it got totally confused with
with the whole message about intended TV
going down and that you had to buy your
converter box so I'm just saying it's
out there we have to get the you I mean
amazingly a lot of people but what are
you laughing yes we can mr. cackling
like I feel like I feel like I'm saying
something wrong room dorky god are you
fine he doesn't only cancelled over here
last week anyway it's secret lab okay
thing is though it's on a roof babbling
go what did I do now it's not all about
now that's it's not all about but
there's no fuzzy HDTV watching over the
air it's either honor its off so you go
from total blackness to a perfect
picture so you do have to like turn it
five degrees or hold it or maybe just be
in a better neighborhood where they're
less buildings yeah TV are you watching
the thumb i'm watching i have a 32-inch
720p mm-hmm samsung's from 2006 so now
when you're not the greatest but samsung
samsung watching your favorite them does
it ever black out in the middle of a
game or anything like that yeah you know
well i'm a Jets fan and so i figure i
can watch on the broadcast on CBS but it
does it fuzz's up sometimes you get the
digitization suddenly hiccup when i'm
watching lost that happen I'm getting
really nervous about when that when that
happens I think we have to sort of I I
might go back I don't know I told you
the wife doesn't know this but I'm verse
for the NFL season I can't afford that I
told you what to do i got that you put a
slingbox in your in your in-laws aussie
or your parents that I need you damn you
sling to it now wait I'll point out that
yo your kid
you're in the entertainment technology
industry right it's a tax write-off I
know I'm just saying but we're still

always the body i'm just get some nice
chunk a jewel in there the most
dangerous dangerous part well that's
about it for today well y'all this kid
Todd is that fro to go I would have gone
so ABO to go visit my son Joseph manages
to to blow out the microphones by
shouting right next remember if you're
gonna shout what do you do you lean back
lean bed torture but listen there now we
have the camera you can watch this now
I'm gonna talk softly and everybody
allowed if I going back here and I'm
gonna come in again you see is its it
it's effective all right now you have
the camera we want you to raise your
hand when you want to speak back chiller
and all right I have one final joke on I
have one final uh thought to express you
guys and that is there are two things
like deep thoughts there is no kizu deep
caused by the attraction of productivity
in the Western world
those two things are Twitter and World
of Warcraft someone is now combine these
two going into a widget Twitter graph
that's right no no no I've writing about
this today on crave our gadget blog at
grave cnet com and you know they're like
in Game browsers and in-game widget
engines like steam is kind of like that
and xfire this is one that's called what
does the called is called play expert
and I guess you can get a web browser in
game and stuff and it works with world
of warcraft but also works with that you
know other games also it's just like an
overlay that sits over whatever pc game
you're playing so now they have a
twitter app for it so you can just pop
open your twitter account and start
twittering like you know lawl just saw
giant Goblin oh he killed me you know or
whatever in a world of warcraft people
say i've actually know if you see Garth
Lord don't fight him he'll kill you
three kills he's 19 I less sherrod I did
any of that but I'm sure it's vaguely
role playing really good morning Ozzy
Osbourne did the freaking world of
warcraft comercios oh yeah yeah I'm here
playing world of warcraft raise your
hand I did the the free the free the
trial crap oh you did yeah so what's
like a nerdy message you would you were
Twitter from there I wouldn't because I
didn't stay on long enough for I
couldn't do it our boys out west play um
Norman Eric play watch the dome said he
officially quit but Eric these Beasley
you know what people say they quit and
then I come back well I don't no Sam
don't max out his character yeah I think
she's maxed out his character and that's
why they keep raising the level cap just
like they're doing in fallout 3 actually
they're raising the level cap from 20 to
30 even though that's a single-player
role-playing game not a multiplayer one
but that's gonna be the new patch called
Broken Steel I'm not May fifth I believe
dad's gonna be pissed but dumb and Eric
are my boys out west inside cnet labs
yeah lovely people Yakima plug I could
get a plug yes inside to see the lab
listen to my boys dorm an e that's right
that's right Oh shouldn't be play like a
promo for some other show how do I do
that yeah you wouldn't know because you
never did it I know because it's a grid
here Julie shows ok show me show me tell
me where they are yeah the promos are
not in our folder just getting a decent
exposure all right I'll play that folder
that sounds great if chromos we have our
own promo actually i'll have to uh but
