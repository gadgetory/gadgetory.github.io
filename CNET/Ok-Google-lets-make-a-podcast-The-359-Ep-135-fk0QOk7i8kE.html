yeah yeah it just went over to my head I
already forgot at time for episode 135
of the 359 podcast good morning good
morning up to today we have two special
guests today we have Connie gooey Elmo
who was our editor-in-chief of cnet news
so thank you very much I think this is
your first time on the podcast is that
right that is right all right so thank
you very much for being here and Connie
you got a chance to test out the google
home so that's why we're having you here
today and as always and we're also going
to be talking about Facebook's earnings
and voter selfies which I'm sure is a
very important thing for everybody going
into november eighth as always send in
your questions and comments will get to
them at the end of the show and let's
get started alright start the recording
in three two ok Google beatbox if you
want a freestyle my friend has you
covered welcome to the 359 where we talk
about the top tech news of the day plus
whatever crap we want to talk about I'm
Ben Fox Rubin and i'm here today with
editor-in-chief of cnet news carnegie
elmo and it's a google assistant Connie
thanks for coming behind my pleasure ok
Google stop so reviews are out for the
Google homesmart speaker which becomes
available tomorrow the speaker can
answer personalized questions by
integrating with your google calendar
and google maps but our reviewer andrew
gap part said that it's still clearly
second banana to amazon's rival smart
speaker which is the amazon echo Connie
what did you think of this device you
got to try it out so I agree with our
reviewer not because a google home
doesn't have a lot of potential it
absolutely does but amazon has a two
year head start so the amount of things
that you can do with their device versus
Google home it's just there's no
comparison 3,000 skills or applications
that it works with an integrated that's
the echo the echo all the number of
devices that work with it google is
starting out with four including the
nest thermostat I think the most
interesting thing for me
about Google home it's when we talked to
send our pj back at Google i/o few
months ago when he introduced this
device that the Google home assistant
was not developed by the nest labs
Google home was actually done by google
the search team right because they don't
look at this as a home assistant they
look at assistant which is the part of
this that talks to you as the
fundamental AI tech that's going to
drive everything google doesn't is going
to move you from the text bar to just
basically being integrated into your
entire life which i think is a really
interesting concept the thing that I
also liked about the Google home is that
it's very pretty it's smaller than the
echo and I certainly like the idea that
there's more competition in this market
so the way that these assistants also
work is that they're constantly updated
from the cloud so you can definitely
expect these to get better as time goes
on and Google is certainly hoping the
fact that they come in seven different
finishes and colors we don't know how
much this cost that will be announced
tomorrow the space unit of one hundred
twenty nine dollars and then you get the
optional cover pic i think or maybe you
get to pick your cover when you order it
we'll see yeah but they're coming out
tomorrow so check them out and yeah 130
bucks which compared to the echo which
starts at well the the original is 180
right next Facebook's latest quarterly
report show that the social network is
raking it in profits tripled to two
point three eight billion dollars I had
no idea me wasting my time on social
media was so valuable well it's not just
that they are raking it in that was a
really good earnings report for them but
it's that it's the third or fourth in a
row where they've topped estimates and
the big driver of their success is not
just mobile which is where they're
putting a lot of effort getting people
to use facebook on mobile devices but
how much video now is going into face
yeah exactly Mark Zuckerberg talked a
lot about that yesterday he said the
video is going to be a primary form of
sharing going into the future I don't
really know if that's true I think
people are using their cameras a lot
more especially with Instagram however
maybe video is going to be much more
critical I think that's good for
facebook it increases engagement but I
don't know what do you think about that
well I think that you have to think
about who's you
Facebook and different age groups right
people were looking at snapchat at the
beginning and saying what why would you
do that and that's a ton of video
totally facebook is copying a lot of the
features that snapchat have brought to
the market so certain people are very
comfortable using video and it they just
don't give it a second thought yeah yeah
that's those are very very good points
last with the what little time we have
left a judge upheld a century old law
that bans voters taking selfies with
their ballots that's in California
apparently these laws were started to
prevent vote buying and coercion and
there are about 18 states that have
these laws kind of do you think that
they're a little outdated by now though
the laws are outdated but as you
mentioned before we started this podcast
training people who work at the voting
polls to uphold that and try to build
tech into the process takes a lot of
time especially when you're dealing with
50 individual states managing polling
places well we'll see if we get to do
selfies in 2020 in the meantime it's
still illegal so if you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
cnet I'm Ben Fox Rubin I'm conakry Elmo
thanks for listening thanks we should
play with Google some more well first we
need to acknowledge there's some weird
stalker guy in the chat named Roger he
says that when lucky knows you let me
see ok Google who's Roger Cheng
according to wikipedia Roger Cheng is a
computer enthusiasts and American
television personality best known for
his time as a segment producer in his
appearances on tech tips call for help
in the screen savers uh is that our
Roger Cheng I don't think so I think
Roger tank has a doppelganger I I think
that sounds like I'm much more important
and impressive Roger Chang than the one
that we know that's okay I'm gonna go
there thanks for listening Roger by the
way here's a another that is so not
right there is a good question in the
chat what are the languages does Google
support well right now we know it's
being released in the US and they
haven't really talked about beyond that
what I talked to a bunch of Google
executives just earlier this week you
know this is very beginning Google home
so if you're buying this and you're one
of the first people congratulations you
on the cutting edge you're a risk-taker
they are going to look at using
different voices right now there's a
woman's voice that is the voice of
assistant and they're going to look at
accents they are going to bring it to
different markets but they're testing
all of that right now so don't have a
lot of details yet I know we've spoken
about this on the show before to that it
took quite some time for the Amazon echo
to even reach the UK because if you ask
certain things like how do you spell
color it's different whether it's in the
US or the UK so there's a lot of effort
that goes into that kind of thing and
that's that's still the same language
yeah just different advantage for Google
is that I have Google now Google
assistant was born of Google now Google
now has been in use so if you look at
where Google now and the languages that
are available that's a good guideline
for you we should do some more more
tests uh ok Google what's the weather
going to be like this afternoon in New
York this afternoon it's predicted to be
70 in cloudy that doesn't sound like
November to me you can also have fun
with it ok Google tell us a fun fact
according to cleaning building services
New York ink fun facts about New York
City known by many nicknames including
the Empire State and the Big Apple New
York City is one of the most important
places in the world as one of the
largest and most diverse cities New York
is home to many famous and talented
people like Roger Cheng how is this a
fight i don't know if that really
constituted a fun fact it's a very
famous rip that wasn't your weather
might have yeah oh it's lert it's
starting to learn it's hurting quick let
me go oh god well we can try one more ok
Google tell us a fun fact sorry I'm not
sure how to help let me try this ok so
my daughter loves when the echo sings
she literally sings happy birthday it's
the only thing that she actually sings
so let's see if the Google assistant
will do the same thing ok Google sing
happy birthday happy birthday to you
happy birthday to you
oh happy birthday to the most amazing
person in a universe I'm frosty birthday
that's not bad lovely she's got good
time so that you heard it first here
yeah wait can we get sued for that don't
they and their copyright on the birthday
song I would love I would love if we
were to get sued over having the Google
assistant sing us happy birthday on a
podcast that would be a real pinnacle
for her career um what was the price on
this again 130 bucks 130 think that I
come down soon or it'sit's actually as
far as I'm concerned that so that's a
pretty reasonable price considering that
the the original echo starts at or the
top price is 180 dollars so the
difference is 50 bucks you can get the
echo dot which is just the top of the
speaker it's this little hockey puck
shaped thing and I would probably
recommend that if you haven't tried any
of these before because the echo dot is
fifty dollars and it is probably going
to go on sale for even less and seeing
it gave the dot a five star review yes
and it is I have the echo and the echo
dot in my house and yeah I use them a
lot mostly to ask about the weather I'm
interested to see where this will be in
about six months if it really does like
an accelerated catch up compared to the
echo and yeah we already kind of brushed
off poor Siri well as with all online
services this isn't actually the product
Google home we are the product everyone
using hit is the beta tester for google
and figuring out what questions people
want to ask what kinds of things they
want to know so they need uptick among
users using google assistant which also
is built into the pixel phones those
have just started coming out so they're
not very many users so they need users
to test an assistant amazon has done a
fantastic job with partnerships they've
partnered with all these different smart
home makers and andrew gebhard our
reviewer mentioned this that google
still has a lot of work to do as far as
getting a lot more partners involved so
i would expect a lot of that to happen
over the
next six months as well sorry yeah uh ok
Google remind me to buy milk later sorry
I can't set reminders yet Oh probably
cuz we have an attached it's anyone's
calendar yet potentially yeah I mean she
knew she knew what you were talking
about that's right good yeah them have
the the banks to go ok Google what's the
closest star to earth according to sky
and telescope the Sun is the closest
star to our day about night I guess I
was kind of a trick wasn't it neighbor I
wasn't tori is actually a triple stars
stars bound together by gravity Alpha
Centauri a and B are too bright closely
orbiting stars with a distant dim
companion Proxima Centauri we hope
you're all learning something today it
was a thorough answer bob says it's an
NSA covert spying tool it's entirely
possible very possible well we should
mention an important thing about the
home and that is it's synced to one user
account so anybody coming into your home
and having access to your Google home
would also have access to whatever you
synced to write like we're counting your
calendar or read my email so it is in
your home so hopefully you are not
inviting people that you don't want into
your home but you know inadvertently if
you have I don't know a house cleaner or
babysitter or some or somebody who just
wants to mess with you one of your
friends they do have access to
everything that you've opened up to go
home to totally a good point because the
rumored Apple rival echo is there at
least testing out the idea of having a
camera on that device so it will
actually recognize different people when
it comes when they come in I don't like
that yeah well a lot of people might not
like that and it's a continuation that
like we're going to give you more
services but at the same time you're
going to give up you know smaller you
know little pieces of your privacy along
the leg and so it's it's helpful that
there would be multiple accounts that
could be very easily and seamlessly
found using this device but I don't know
how much people actually want to
amra looking at them in their kitchen
well I think it speaks to the point that
people understand that having that open
mic into your digital life hmm I mean
you're giving that access right now to
Google which is already problematic for
some people yeah how much are they
listening what are they listening to
what's going to happen it's a subject
that I know amazon has been touching
about when i have written about the echo
it is an always listening speaker but
they want to make sure that you know
that it's always listening for the wake
word which is alexa or amazon depending
on that and i think google is probably
just as sensitive about it because they
know that people don't want a hot mic
around them at all times that being said
like I say Alexa sometimes and just
whatever like I'm talking about the
device and she picks up and starts
listening I'm not actually talking to
her so she's like a jealous girlfriend
exactly well that she's more like one of
my kids she's like fourth kid where I
say like you know I really don't like it
when Alexa does this or whatever so it
would be interesting if if Google got
possessive if you mentioned Alexa around
and it got mad wait who's that ok Google
whose Alexa sorry I'm not sure how to
help with that it's very diplomatic
every day yeah yes that is very
different here's here's our rabbit hole
we we shouldn't go down but I'm going to
ok Google explains a string theory
string theory a cosmological theory
based on the existence of cosmic strays
oh I thought that was all that was very
yeah it was efficient I think I think
that's one of the big benefits of this
device by the way that it's connected to
google search Google's been doing search
for 20 years and it's going to be able
to answer those questions in many ways
much more effectively than the echo that
being said our people are really going
to be like pinging this thing for trivia
questions all the time no so maybe it's
the weather and yeah yeah maybe kids
want to use it for homework sheets
that's that's like what their sizzle
reel showed that like I did was using it
for homework yeah but I can see people
sitting around the dinner table and what
was the name of that movie
now you can just ask you don't have to
pull out your smartphone which is so
annoying oh the joys of First World
Computing ok Google what was Christopher
Walken's last movie Christopher Walken's
movies include the deer hunter pulp
fiction and 59 others alright not
precise but the right words and a giver
partial credit for that one yeah yeah
alright that's pretty fun cool no wait I
have another one oh ok ok Google what's
the airspeed velocity of an unladen
swallow I depth to know if it was in
african or european swallow oh wow all
right that was pretty cool got some nice
little easter eggs there that make it
worth your 130 bucks um all right let's
cool do we have any other questions ok
Google what are the lyrics to smash
mouth all star sorry I don't know she's
got a bit of a delay on her a little bit
as opposed to I I think they've done a
really good job with the echo where it
doesn't seem as delayed with time that's
going to change I'm sure bata me wonders
if that's anything at fault with the
Wi-Fi network in here and we are asking
fairly complex questions right ok Google
who is Siri Siri is Apple's intelligent
assistant she's very well that's such an
Alexa oh my god so you know serious but
you don't know who alexis I get it
that's fine that's fine all right but
serious rude yeah maybe a little bit
maybe that was that was a diplomatic way
of google saying witty he said she was
witty so all right maybe that's a good
place to wrap it up for the day I would
say so ok google play us out all right
playing Adele on Spotify oh come on you
can do it now since this is a great song
by Adele okay
359 is available on iTunes tune in
stitcher SoundCloud feedburner google
