like a big douchebag on one of these
things but it's really a lot of fun to
ride I was getting some weird looks but
it's fun I don't care what people think
you've probably seen the moto bag make
its rounds on the internet lately it's a
carry-on size piece of luggage that
doubles as a writable
electric scooter and yes it looks
ridiculous if you're like me you're
thinking really what is wrong with these
people
that was until I actually rode a
prototype around the Flatiron Building
in New York it's kind of Awesome it has
way more pickup than you think it can go
around eight miles on a single charge
and has two speeds for indoor and
outdoor so the idea spawned from
something we can all identify with the
mind-numbing monotony of aimlessly
wandering around airports the Moto Bag
is built for air travel it complies with
FAA and TSA size regulations all right
so check it out you can actually put
this on the overhead bins in airplanes
and this is not too bad this one's about
25 pounds but the the final version will
be 19 so yeah
you pop this up and that's it and you're
all set even the battery it runs on is a
proof for air travel it easily converts
from a pole style piece of luggage to a
rideable scooter in seconds
it even has foot pegs so I was shown how
to use this and set it up and was off
and running in no time turning with the
moto bag is a little weird at first you
have to lean and use the handlebar brake
together but it didn't take me long to
get comfortable and it has enough room
to likely get you through a long weekend
if you pack smartly there's also a side
slot for thinner things like a laptop
85% of the bag is actually devoted just
to storage the battery uses new
technology that will get you 80% power
after just 15 minutes of charging but a
full capacity charge will take up to 90
minutes we were also told that the
battery won't catch on fire like we've
seen with some of those shoddy
hoverboards ok the price the motor bag
goes for $1000 on the company's
IndieGoGo
but we'll retail for around 1500 when
it's all said and done now that's really
expensive for luggage but this thing is
one of those luxury toys that will
definitely resonate with a certain type
of consumer plus it's probably awesome
for tailgating too</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
