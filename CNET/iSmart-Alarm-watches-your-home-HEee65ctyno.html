2013 taking a first look at the ice
smart alarm home alarm system what
you're looking at here is basically a
DIY home alarm system you buy the
components and place them around your
house the kit comes with two contacts
sensors for doors and windows letting
you know when a door has been open it
comes with a motion detector and a 350
degree camera so from your iPhone when
you're away from home you can go ahead
and access that camera but not only can
you see what it's see you can also
control where it goes so just like that
I can move it around with my finger it
goes 350 degrees and it'll go up and
down so you can keep an eye on
everything while you're out and about if
your house has been broken into this guy
will sound off and you'll also receive
an SMS to your phone letting you know
that your house has been compromised and
you shouldn't go home and using the
iphone app you can arm and disarm your
alarm while you're away as well as use a
panic button last of all the system also
comes with two of these keychain remote
control so that if you don't have a
smartphone like a kid you can still
control the system eventually you'll
also be able to buy extra components so
if you want an extra camera or an extra
motion sensor you'll be able to purchase
those all apart what the company is
trying to emphasize about this system is
that it's DIY and then you only have a
one time fee of two hundred and fifty
dollars for all of these components so
no monthly fees no contracts if you want
this entire system it will cost you two
hundred and fifty dollars but you take
out the camera it's only 80 and you can
expect to see the system come out in
april for cnet com I'm sharing backing
from CES 2013</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
