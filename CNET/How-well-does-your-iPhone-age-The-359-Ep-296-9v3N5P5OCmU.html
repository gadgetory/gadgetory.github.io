had to double-check because I am very
tired after spending the entire weekend
at New York Comic Con my name is bebe G
and it's time for episode 296 of the 359
podcast brought to you by alfred and
roger who is gonna be a national sponsor
there for a second yeah no we're not bad
yeah I didn't go to comic-con either but
I am also tired so good yeah I was there
it was awesome it was it was mostly
awesome
a lot of time on your feet and it's a
lot of time to feed we'll be talking a
little comic-con actually but first
we'll talk about how well your iPhone
ages and a study that has some
surprising results on the whole
conspiracy theory of planned
obsolescence it's not a conspiracy
theory I don't know and then lastly
we'll talk about getting disconnected
deal detox we'll just talk a little bit
about that as always if you have any
questions about these topics live them
in the comment section Brian will pick
out the best and we will get to them in
three minutes and 59 seconds from 3:00
to welcome to the 359 I'm Roger chan I'm
Alfred hang so we've all heard those
conspiracy theories about planned
obsolescence your iPhone hits a two-year
mark and all of a sudden it doesn't seem
to work as well so guess it's time for
an upgrade right well a study from
future mark shows that older iPhone
units actually performed pretty
consistently throughout the years
especially thanks to software updates
that surprise you or you each cup to go
let's let's disregard to the study for a
quick second here that's just when you
use your old phones after two years do
you get that feeling that it's like it
slowed down its bogged down or anything
like that yeah I do be actually more
more so less what the performance more
the battery yeah my point is I think
there's a reason why people have had
this theory like independently and not
you know some article comes out and
everyone just feels that way but it's
interesting that this research came out
and basically saying it's kind of like a
placebo effect where you just feel like
it's much slower the battery's like much
well you know you see a new iPhone that
looks all nice and you and scheisse they
talk about how fast is it it is also
your phone doesn't see
as passengers it is very interesting
that these you know all like these
theories of you know my phone is like
much slower and Apple Apple plan for
this always happens around when new
phones come out oh yeah absolutely
I've had my phone for about like two
years now it's a 5s and it actually yeah
it's run pretty well from the day that I
bought it but to be fair I also like I'm
very low maintenance on my phone like I
delete like most photos after I take
them I'd like to eat a lot of files I
there's that element where people don't
update their software they also overload
with tons of photos and videos and apps
they don't delete unused apps or hogs up
so there is that element where you know
you're you're you're wearing down your
phone yourself and so there's that extra
yeah I'd be interested in what benchmark
that future marks did with you know
their study like did they load it up
with a bunch of apps like overtime or
anything like that or they just left it
as is for two years straight to the CPU
of the GPU but for all the details just
definitely check it out and see that
next up we wanted to talk a little bit
about New York Comic Con I had the
pleasure of attending and so did Brian I
got my fill of sort of awesome
cosplayers panels cool celebrity
sightings Brian I want to throw it out
to you our producer what was your
favorite moment or your favorite bit
about comic-con this weekend I as I get
older spend less and less time on the
floor and have started to enjoy more and
more the panel's because they had comfy
chairs at the devas and personally I had
a really great experience at the the the
Judge Dredd panel which was called super
copper satire go figure it was satire
but the one thing I took away from that
was a really clever quote from some of
the writers of the current IDW run that
said oh people wonder is is is Judge
Dredd homosexual or heterosexual because
who cares right and they said oh well
he's neither he's lhamo sexual and that
made my entire weekend right but he's
never had a relationship through like
Judge Dredd just killed what was the
best cosplay you saw will have to I
didn't see a person but I saw a tweet
from from been on someone who came as
the jab
Center itself that is that the New York
Convention Center building was that glad
I guess it's very meta and fortunately I
think he made it into the show floor but
blesses our awesome
there are a ton of stranger things that
the demo gorian I saw tons of
interpretations including one coming out
of the floor which is creepy but I
thought that person just was gonna see
the comic did he like dig into the
ground or he or she was just laying on
she was sitting on the ground but the
costume was kind of designed so when she
sat it looked like it was kind of like
it was kind of awesome kind of freaky
actually the cosplayers are usually
pretty impressive yeah all right
comic-con related we saw the Justice
League trailer drop last night or
yesterday and then we're expecting a new
trailer from Star Wars coming in today
in fact today is the first day you can
pre-order your tickets to watch Star
Wars if you're planning for December
15th already so lastly we want to check
out a feature from our own Ian sure
about how to properly disconnect
yourself the idea of digital t-talk
saying after you you started your
article yeah there's an interesting
piece from The Guardian actually about
the Facebook engineer that created the
like button talking about what a monster
he's created and how he's been unable to
you know he has to like put on parental
controls on his own phone to like get
away from Facebook and all this stuff so
this whole digital detox article you
know kind of takes a look at something
like that where it's how do you get
yourself from away from the the
addictions of like social media checking
your notifications that everything like
all the time so I was actually on a
cruise ship two weeks ago where I was
disconnected for large stretches of time
I was mostly okay except I was really
annoyed I couldn't find the USC store
but aside from that aside from the early
panic I'm not having that connection and
not having that access I kind of got
over it yeah it's act like you don't
need to go to like a camper like some
off-site place to get rid of it though I
feel like just have some a little
self-control people a little
self-control goes a long way alright for
more of these stories check us out on
CNN I'm Roger Cheng I'm alfred Aang
thanks for listening
Alfred have you ever been to any of the
comic-con sir I have not Connie no in
your uh no I have never been to
comic-con nothing okay so if if we were
to drag you next year would you cosplay
as um I actually have a set of like
costumes I've been putting in rotation
for Halloween's that I'm like I'm ASA
Kaleem aid three really good costumes
like I'm never gonna need a new costume
again that's because I would just rotate
every three years so I have a very
thorough Mega Man costume a very
thorough Ness costume from Super
earthbound and Super Smash Brothers and
speed racer costume okay
solid selection so I rotate between
those three but I'm not using any of
those this year for Halloween just
because I'm trying to be a little bit
more creative what are you gonna be I'm
the the millennial killer like all the
industries that Millennials are killing
that's that's I'm the millennial Grim
Reaper there's no killing Applebee's and
and homeownership did Millennials kill
homeownership or they just stayed why
are Millennials buying homes because
they can't afford yeah yeah they're not
killing it they're just picking that's
the whole joke it's like yeah maybe like
you know these industries aren't
surviving because they're bad all right
what what questions do we got I'm still
digging but before we go any further I
needed to send a quick shout-out a lot
to a friend who found me on the New York
comic-con floor yo Billy York Francisco
you made my day that was so fun that you
caught me we got to catch up say hi take
a selfie so uh that was really great
laughter yo he's a celebrity is in the
chat right now I don't know I don't know
the chats right that's fine no no that's
awesome that that he actually recognized
you yeah weird I've never happened
before that's not a mess dude that's
happened to me once not because the
podcast just cuz I've seen it and it was
started we exchanged pleasantries and
then he said cute kid and then it got
like awkward well that's just awkward
silence and they have you on Facebook or
something do tweet photo no no he was I
was with like him kid and they're like
it got kinda has a different direction
like if your kid wasn't there that no
that would be really weird you're right
no no no he was there fortunately yeah
like your wife be cuter beautiful just
like so what do you live
I want to take some questions yeah let's
do it
as always Danny Green's got a really
good yeah Danny why buy a house when you
have to upgrade it in a couple of years
when a better one comes out oh that's
right
planned obsolesce house just feels a
little creaky that's why you don't get a
smart Club is that working too well now
it's time for an upgrade I could easily
see that happening with my home's where
you have to like 301 it's all aluminum
yeah I talked to it I talked to a
security expert last week I'm like I'm
Wednesday talking about you know all the
dangers with like IOT stuff and you talk
about if I buy like an old dumb doorbell
I can have that doorbell for like 30 40
years and I will never have to care
about if I get like a smart doorbell
like that's something I have to look at
like every month like yeah updates yeah
it's so there are things that you don't
new sounds or just Rob Paulsen a point
that's fresh in my memory from comic-con
so I'm just gonna roll thanks we got
another good one here hold on yeah so we
talked about specifically how iPhones
age right but let's think about this we
Danny points at the house we talked
about planned obsolescence in general
yeah Chris Gonzalez is oh how well do
Samsung phones aged how well do any of
them age besides the 3310 cuz that stuff
though record I mean I don't want to
just like list only Samsung phones I
would say like this like all Android
phones and my argument is like not that
well yeah there's no way also because
they don't get software updates that's
the latest problem
I feel like battery life is definitely
an issue I mean I I don't know if I just
got a bum phone but my Samsung Galaxy s6
edge worked perfectly well for about six
months and then also the battery life
just it could yeah I feel like that
always happened you know like every year
Samsung comes out with phone I think
this is the best top-of-the-line phone
in the world it's so much work of a
battery so much and then like a year
later it's like what what phone are you
even talking about I remembered that
when the s5 came out and everyone's like
this phone's incredible and it was
forgotten in like a year well less than
a year really yeah yeah yeah and then
when you look at during during the pixel
2 event from Google when they were
saying this is gonna get
security updates first this is gonna get
all the Android update honors from
Google because it's our phone for the
next two years
like what like two years that's that's
well to be fair I think I mean pixels
tend to get updates even beyond two
years I mean yeah but I'm saying like
that's not like a really good like
forecast right you know like you could
like my flight I forgot what your the
the 5s came out but like I'm on iOS 11
on my 5s right now oh wow yeah okay all
right and that's definitely more than
two years so there you go and I mean I
think the software update issue is a big
one especially if you're not buying a
pixel if you're not buying you're buying
a carrier phone in particular especially
a low-budget one those things don't get
updated very often so yeah all right
next to the line for the questions is
Josh Boyd ah I feel like this isn't a
question as much as just an interesting
thought I feel like people that think
their phone is outdated because they
download the phones and feel that the
phone itself is slowed down by Apple
when it's actually them that's slowing
the phone down so as you said the
accountability you leave crap on there
you don't delete all apps that was the
point that I was trying to make no I
just I think Josh strongly agrees with
you on that but I mean I guess I guess
the argument is how robust is your phone
for like you know all these apps and
stuff that you download for later
because what's the argument here like
don't download things on your phone and
like bog it down like that I mean I
would but I would say like don't
download a million apps and then like
complain that they don't never use like
no use clean out your phone take out
apps you don't use if you're if you're
constantly hitting the storage limit
your phone that's gonna affect
performance - yeah my phone my phone's
pretty fast and like constantly delete
things yeah that's the thing like I
think it's there is the some of the onus
is on you right now maintain your phone
to make sure it does run but what about
the battery argument though about that
stuff right yeah that is a tougher one I
think battery load batteries are just
gonna drain that's just physics you
can't fight that so I mean there's
always replacing your battery I know a
lot of the older a lot of the Android
phones a lot older phones you can swap
them up pretty easily
can't throw an iPhone though you have to
pay to swap it out this early I actually
tried to swap out a battery on my one of
my older Samsung phones if you
ago and like I ordered like some like oh
yeah don't do that
yeah that's a bad idea yeah I'm sure you
all saw the report of a Samsung phone
exploding last week Samsung you know
basically said the person was using a
third-party battery and that is the risk
you run when you use like a non approved
batter my concern about SARS how that
how do they even know that though like
did they contact the person was affected
yeah all right I've only got a couple
minutes left because I know you got to
run to a meeting right yeah yeah let's
take a question from new friend Jackie
touch I enjoyed my Note 3 for nearly
five years and only just now the battery
is giving up on me good thing it can be
replaced I did recently purchase a new
Note 8 which battery cannot be replaced
it was that a dumb move don't move on
your part for Samsung's part I mean look
it's for your perspective it's not dumb
move that's kudos to you for keeping a
new 3 for that long any phone for yeah
that is definite time to upgrade and I
think the note 8 is an excellent upgrade
the reality is I mean all the high-end
phones nowadays are under like lock and
key they're all sealed up you can't get
a you can't get a new better easily so
yeah I used to can't you can't blame
really anyone at this point cuz that's
sort of where the industry is gone yeah
software out of that argument we talked
about the planned obsolescence by as far
as like getting that much of your
money's worth out of hardware that is
impressive
yeah yeah I mean I also I used to think
that the whole like not being or replace
the battery thing was a deal breaker
because I had replaced batteries on my
laptops like all the time
but then it got to the point where I was
thinking I could do that I used to buy
new batteries and just put them in so I
didn't have to deal with you know like
bad batteries all right and then I got
to a point where well I'm only doing
this like every like three years and by
that time I'll have gotten a new phone
anyway so right what is the point of me
like just buying the battery straight
off because the phone itself is bad like
at that point so I don't think it was a
dumb move to get the get like a
completely new phone after five years no
and for sounds like for Samsung it's not
a dumb move that they went to this
because that's just sort of where
everything is going yeah I just like
this comment from Josh Buddha again he
says every two years I deep-clean my
phone
I think that's a really that's smart
fantastic approach I think that would be
a kind of an interesting topic for us to
cover one day if it was ever like a slow
news cycle we should go over like how
some good processes for actually
cleaning your phone out yeah yeah
without having to do a full-on hard read
I don't I don't do like a spring
cleaning kind of thing I kind of just
like every now that I just go through
yeah it's like everybody does this to a
little it's like when you walk around
your house and you just like fine like a
sock laying around so let's get rid of
that like I don't do like dedicate like
a specific period of time I just like go
through it oh this is garbage maybe
that's not a bad habit to get into
yeah all right unfortunately we are at
it we got a run sorry we start a little
bit late we gotta end a little early
we'll try to do better tomorrow
you liked anything you always tried to
do better whenever I should that's our
motto I know we try all right if you
liked anything you saw or heard here
