most Americans have today and what does
it mean to be a hundred times faster
well if you were in a car that moved a
hundred times faster than another car
and both cars left from Kansas City
going to New York the car going faster
would be there in New York before the
other car left Missouri you remember
when people actually went to the store
to buy software you remember that wasn't
that long ago in fact so much
information started coming to the
internet that you needed even you needed
a service to help you search through all
that was a joke you're supposed to learn
webmail became practical online video
services like Netflix and YouTube but
just couldn't exist before were invented
and spread like wildfire and thanks to
Wi-Fi home networking help share access
across all your devices computers
laptops tablets smart phones televisions
but you know what is the chart patrich
showed indicated things have stagnated a
decade and a half later your speed
hasn't changed all that much the access
network hasn't kept up with the rest of
the internet and it's great that things
have gotten a little faster but we can
do better you know what we can do a lot
better</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
