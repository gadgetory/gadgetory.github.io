where we uncover the hottest app so you
don't have to I'm Sharon Vaknin and
today I've got three Android apps that
will save you a ton of money on just
about anything first up is the deal map
this super convenient app uses your
phone's GPS to find all the nearby daily
deals it grabs deals from sites like
gold star home run and restaurants com
so that you can view all of them at the
same time view a list of all the deals
see a map or search by category instead
once you find a deal you want click it
to get the details the fine print and
the option to purchase it not only will
this app save you a lot of cash on your
next dinner or outing but it will also
help you clear your inbox of daily
e-mails from each one of these daily
deal sites the deal map will save you a
lot of money on services but not
products you might buy at a store or
online like a book so how do you get the
best deals on these items check out
google shopper while you're walking the
aisles of a store pick up a product and
casually grab your phone and use shopper
to scan the barcode you'll get a list of
prices from other retailers and customer
reviews of the product those are things
a salesperson definitely can't give you
or if you're shopping online or sitting
around and a product comes to mind tap
speak and say the name of the item you
want don't sweat the small stuff shopper
will recognize the product and give you
a list of prices and reviews and finally
lots of internet geeks like myself can't
live without our online discounts there
are lots of websites that gather all the
web specials but one of my favorites for
discounts on electronics is slick deals
and of course there's an app for that
slickdeals RSS feeds gives you a simple
but clear list of all the deals being
posted on the website open the app to
view the deals or add the handy widget
to a home screen for a quick view of the
latest posts dealnews which is similar
to slickdeals also has an android app
that is definitely worth checking out if
you know of any android apps that i
missed send me a link on twitter and
watch out for more awesome apps on the
next episode of top that up for cnet i'm
