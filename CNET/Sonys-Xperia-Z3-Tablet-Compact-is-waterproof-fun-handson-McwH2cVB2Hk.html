taking a look at the Sony Xperia z3
tablet compact now a mouthful of a name
aside the compact part of that title
refers to the fact that this tablet is
eight inches which is quite a bit
smaller than the current said to 10-inch
tablet now of course being a smaller
tablet does mean is much more portable
to carry around you can actually use in
one hand and it will actually slip into
your pocket if you push hard enough now
physically you can see quite a lot of
family resemblance between the z3 tablet
compact and the Z 3 phone you can see
they've both got this white front with a
metallic edging on the back of the z3
tablet compact though it's been
rubberized rather than glass it is still
completely waterproof however you can
take it in 1.5 meters of water for up to
30 minutes so reading in the bath or
watching Netflix in the shower is
absolutely fine now interestingly Sony
has given the 8-inch display a full HD
that's 1920 by 1080 pixel resolution
which on paper comes short of the iPad
minis Retina display or indeed Samsung's
Galaxy Tab s it is at least very very
bright and it seems to have good colors
though so side by side you might not be
able to tell much difference inside it's
running on a 2.5 gigahertz Qualcomm
quad-core processor which seemed to make
everything extremely Swift you're also
able to use this tablet as a second
screen for your PlayStation 4 now if
you're on the same home Wi-Fi network
you can actually connect it to your
PlayStation and play actual ps4 titles
using this as your screen the tablet is
running the latest Android 4.4.4 kitkat
software around the back you'll find an
8 megapixel camera that is a step down
from the 20 point seven megapixel camera
you'll find on the Zed free phone but
given that it's a tablet you're probably
less likely to really want to carry it
around and use it as a camera unless
you're a bit of a fool now the tablet
certainly looks nice and the
waterproofing will help keep it safe
from spilled drinks it's a shame that
Sony hasn't gone for a slightly higher
screen resolution on this but hopefully
it will pair it with a more affordable
price tag although sony has yet to
officially announce how much it will
cost but we'll find out more when it go
on sale towards the end of the year I'm
Andrew Hoyle 50 net and this is a Sony
Xperia z3 tablet compact</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
