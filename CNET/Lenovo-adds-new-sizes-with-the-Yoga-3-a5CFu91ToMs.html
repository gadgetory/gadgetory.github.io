the latest additions to Lenovo yoga
family this is the yoga 3 not to be
confused with the yoga free pro I've
actually got a yoga 3 pro right here and
that was a super thin system using
intel's core and that had this very
watch band style hybrid hinge in the non
pro version of the yoga 3 which
obviously cost a little less we saw a
very traditional a two point of
articulation yoga hint you're just like
the kind you've seen on previous
generations of yoga's this time for the
three we have an 11 inch model that also
moves to the core m and that's great for
systems like this that are fanless very
thin very light is a very efficient ship
and of course like other yoga's
clamshell laptop mode you can fold it
back you know like a kiosk you can flip
around to a table tent if you really
want and then obviously the tablet mode
is the other big mode and if hear the
keyboard and touchpad are deactivated so
you're not accidentally you know
clicking on them while you have it in
tablet mode the real new one here is
this guy it's the 14 inch model for the
yoga to you had a 13-inch this is the
yoga 3 14 and this guy uses Intel's new
5th generation of core ID chips also
known as broadwell and some next
generation nvidia graphics and of course
like the 11 inch touchscreen and folds
into all the different possible
configurations and the hinge has been
tweaked just a tiny bit to be a little
bit smoother when you open and close it
and also so it just goes completely flat
like this in case you wanna lay it down
on a table these two guys have both
going to be available in march in the US
for 799 and 979 i'm dan ackerman with
the new lenovo yoga 3
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
