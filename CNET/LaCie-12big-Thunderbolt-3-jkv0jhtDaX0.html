system formula C for professional now
just look at the size here you know that
this is a serious storage system this is
the first I've seen for consumer that
comes with 12 hard drive on the inside
that's right you can have up to 120
terabyte of storage space and this
particular one here come with a terabyte
hard drive so it offer 1968 back that's
crazy capacity and by the way the system
uses Seagate Enterprise nass hard drives
which are supposed to be very fast now
you can remove this drive very easily in
case you want to replace them in fact
it's kept to easy and there's no way to
lock them in place to prevent an
accidental pull out which is dangerous
when the system is in operation also the
system is very heavy and is quite tall
so make sure you do not topple it on
anything or anyone and by the way this
is the power and status indicator when
it's blue everything is going well
now you can come by all this drive here
in all different red configuration you
can think of like red 0 raid 1 raid 5 6
10 and 50 the system is pre-configured
in red 5 we can switch the rate very
fast using Lasserre software you can
also either software to more to the
system and perform other tasks such as
upgrading the firmware now this one is
the very first Thunderbolt 3 system I've
ever tested and it comes with two and a
both three put on the back here and that
means you can daisy chain another
hundred three device to this one like a
module or another storage device you
also have a USB 3.1 type C port here to
host a purple Drive like this one now in
testing with Thunderbolt 3 the system
which threw me fast with a sustained
real copy speed up some 1,400 megabyte
per second that means you can transfer
the whole DVD with AB content in less
than three seconds that's crazy fast so
basically this is an ultimate storage
system for professional if you can
afford it because it's very expensive
it starts at sixty four hundred dollars
for 48 ter by now if you want something
similar but more for both there is this
six big kind of all three
system right here is basically half of
the 12 ik half the amount of drive so
half capacity also have the physical
size and half the price starting at
$3,200 for 2014 back a few things remain
the same though now the six big system
here share the same feature the same
setting the same software as the 12 big
and it's performance is very similar
it's a tad slower that's said why the
sig Vidya is meant to be a lesser
product actually five better because it
has great balance of cost performance
and design and that means in most cases
the sig Vicky will give you very similar
if not the same experience as that of
the 12 ik but as much less of a cost
most importantly the size of the blue
ball remains the same and for many of
you out there I know that's all that
matters and that's because I'm don't
know and these are the sick big and 12 a
big fan of own sort system formula see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
