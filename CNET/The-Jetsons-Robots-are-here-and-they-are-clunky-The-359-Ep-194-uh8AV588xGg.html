fifteenth episode 194 of the 359 podcast
and apparently nobody listens to me when
I say hey the mics are going hot I
listened well I was wondering when it
was gonna happen that did this symbol I
missed that Oh anyway I was listening
that's it that's apparently not no I was
listening I didn't see this I said all
right everybody good we have a packed
show today we're gonna be talking about
zito the robot yes cargo robot Bridger
had a chance to check it out we'll get
her impressions from her uh we were also
talking about yahoo hack revelations of
who was involved with the second biggest
hack not the not the big one was it you
it wasn't me here we go spoiler it
wasn't me and then we'll lastly debate
the merits of a matrix reboot do we want
one I as says yes I say no we'll see
pretty words my mouth spend the whole
time of just doing that like Trinity
pose yeah not the karate kid you doing
we actually ran out of budget for money
for that special effects Oh what time
here moving in the chair all right so uh
I gotta wrangle you guys it let's uh
let's do that let's do the podcast will
be back in three minutes 59 seconds I've
you have any questions leave in the
comments section and Brian will get to
them all right here we go set the
recording in three two
welcome to the 359 where we talked about
top tech news of the day don't have a
crap you want to throw him I'm Roger
Cheng I'm I as the wolf actor and with
us is special guest Bridget Carey what
up guys yeah she got she got to hang out
with cheetah the robot robots Gina is a
personal cargo robot able to carry 40
pounds of stuff inside it's two-foot
tall orb shaped body yeah it's kind of
like the size of a bb8 sort of kind of
is it really but not as friendly and
also it's not like you know not as cute
well well well it's it's cute for a
robot that has no face no arms and
doesn't talk to you but okay alright
well look so it we're used to at this
point robot vacuum cleaners rumbas is
this something that we're actually gonna
realistically use on regular basis have
robot helpers follow us around and carry
our stuff well it it it's the
technologies out there what they see it
as right now first they're gonna go to
the business side of things may be a
nurse in a hospital is gonna be having
one of these follow her or him around to
be able to have their supplies what if
you went to a hospital or a hotel and
and you know so different kind of
business enterprise things and then
they'll going to put it out in two years
to consumers like us maybe grandma and
grandpa needs some help at home Oh
carrying groceries home you know if they
live near by the store or maybe you want
to carry your heavy textbooks to class
or maybe you just want a cooler for your
tailgate to be following you everywhere
you go not a question God that would be
us you're walking around the streets of
New York with this thing and this is
very low there's no flag or anything
where people running into this or not
okay people were going between me and
the robot see now to describe it but
basically it kind of trails you and I
had to wear this this belt yeah it
looked like a stormtrooper it was like a
spaceman fanny pack yeah it wasn't sexy
but that's because this is a prototype
they say later on he won't have
something so huge you might just clip it
on you but I had cameras around me it
had its own cameras and it's merging all
that together to know where I'm going to
not run into me I turn a corner it knows
it turned a corner and a small walks
between us it's not going to run into
somebody so it's pretty smart in that
sense that said people were like what is
that and and they're like it's a car
girl robot okay
what's new york people would accept that
right like it's just weird so yeah sure
uh and it's got a fingerprint sensor but
like what stops people from just running
off with this right right okay so um
this is to back up a second it's made by
the same company that makes Vespa
scooters so they're thinking this in the
same way you would think of you know
having a scooter parked outside the
grocery store they want to have it so
you'll have the parked out there alarms
will go off if someone tries to mess
with it it's going to be about 50 pounds
it's a little cumbersome you know but if
someone does try to roll away with it
you know there's a fingerprint scan a
scanner to lock it that doesn't mean you
can't still bust into it it's just like
you could still probably still scooter
if you really wanted to so it's that
kind of mindset where it's cumbersome
they have alarms but you know I guess
anything's possible if it wants really
steal it all right well next up the
Justice Department is ready to hand out
indictments for the 2014 hack of Yahoo
that left 500 million accounts exposed
turns out Russian criminals and spies
were involved I as thoughts well there's
no extradition deal with Russia so you
can blame anybody you did it it doesn't
matter if they either found guilty
they're not coming over unless they're
crazy but why they were going to go on
vacation to America while we're under
these charges well I mean look that said
yahoo did hint at that these were
state-sponsored attacks we finally get
confirmation i'll use from the Justice
Department allegedly is relegated you
that that Russia was involved with this
and just keep in mind this this is
unrelated to the other attack that Yahoo
suffered that lost a billion account so
that was the world's largest arese
largest attack this is history second
largest attack all right lastly are you
ready for a matrix reboot warner
brothers are looking to reboot the
sci-fi classic with Michael B Jordan of
Creed Fame supposedly lined up as the
next neo and next star is this too soon
it's a huge rumor by the way it's not
confirmed yet right police say they say
it's in development but it's very early
days just keep in mind there is no
script just like there is no spoon so
don't usually how the shoot movies know
it is anyways right well when it comes
to this kind of thing they might want to
take this through you know it may be
reloading the matrix was an
inevitability all right I got a
pocketful these I can just keep them
coming all rights more of these stories
check us out on cnet I'm Roger Cheng a
Maya sector and I'm Richard Gary thanks
for listening
and the matrix really really really
really me really you should have heard
my script today I just kept going with
it was great I even had a cookie i ate
at the end and I just wide with the
reboots do we know it's gonna be a movie
series again they don't we don't know if
it's remaking or this in the universe or
I have made that point that since it's a
really computer program that a reboot
can literally funny could actually
literally be just a reboot a--they but
the enneagram but the universe might
remain with the promise that like if
people wanted to be out that can be out
said the architect to the Oracle on the
bench no you got me I I watched big we
yet read it just now again cuz it's like
yeah it's been years well I remember I
watched that third movie I just thrown
on my back I've watched it from the
floor and I'm like this is awful why is
this getting worse like I've had a lot
of pain imitating worse of my watching
the third matrix well I mean that's I
mean I'm actually I'm fine with them
rebooting boats the second two movies if
they just kept that first one intact cuz
I'm like I'm a big fan of the original
first ones good the fish was great and
you know then and then it just becomes
this Hollywood overblow universe
creating mess with the first or the next
two movies so but they want to reboot
those that's fine there hold it I mean
Michael B Jordan is an incredible actor
I'd be curious to see where you would
play catteries actually that would be
awesome when I know he's up like you and
just actually plank it's a movie about
the making of the matrix yeah starring
Michael B Jordan as canario like I can
act he can't believe this man whoa uh
any questions from the maybe it's a
young morphine no no nothing nothing yet
yeah Oracle that's what he is mmm when
were they gonna take this though like
they're gonna like spin it into some
kind of I don't know I'm just interested
to see what their ain't cuz you know in
99 right that's when the first one came
99 it was all
about like we're right into the new
Internet age and kind of not the new
Internet age but it was really stunned
to become more prominent idea that
things were connected still is still a
novel idea and now we're way past that
well you don't need to have it set here
it's their world in the computers and
maybe in that world isn't this world
yeah that was already done two and it
was called reboots okay yeah I guess I
don't know I mean that maybe it has been
too long but the animatrix was was good
i don't want to see it remade at all i'd
rather just see it be a side story they
can't remake something I cuz i would if
they were to make another matrix movie i
wouldn't mind if they expanded the
universe that would be fine to me but
yeah rebooting it yeah they did I mean
they did the what was it the was at a
prequel or something was gonna live the
last fun of the Osiris or something that
was that part of the animatrix and all
that yeah yes that was like I think that
was like the long video in the animatrix
series kinda like six or something we
were talking the video game with Jada
Pinkett Smith I mean that was a side
story in you know adding to them what
wasn't in the movie like yeah there's a
lot to be done on coming with that you
don't need to you know spoon feed us neo
all over and don't bring back Colonel
Sanders I'm still curious about landline
phone for what it's worth he was still
my favorite part of that third movie
really just not saying wait what how was
your favorite part at their movie that's
not an insult well what's even in dunno
he was the last there's like a hundred
Smith's oh you have to have Smith agents
man I mean that Ben baller the mr.
Anderson that that's like an autonomous
thought that like it's a hive mind you
know that that will always exist the
agent smith character will always exist
yeah sure but i don't think that you go
we things coming back after feelings
would be really bad like tie ends like
oh there's a mess on alexa device and
that's how you get into the matrix or
like how are they gonna i could just
imagine that world was so green and and
bear in 99 this thing of all the
corporate sponsorship of your samsung
phone versus though they did have nokia
phones and I mean there's everyone had a
nokia phone true at the time yeah then
it's gonna be a samsung phone it'll
inevitably be it they'll wear snapchat
spectacle
that's how we watch you instead of the
sunglasses that server some regular so
that's how they connect with each other
now it's spectacles oh my god give me a
hard line not gonna need a hardliner
