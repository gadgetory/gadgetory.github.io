term horizon that you're particularly
excited about we were a company that was
recently acquired by yahoo where what we
had done was basically looked at
consumers and what they were doing which
was engaging with devices while they
were watching TV and we found a really
simple way to connect them for us I
think the biggest shift that we're
seeing and and and you're right and
saying the acceleration is actually
happening and a lot of us are going to
be talking about what it means to be a
post-pc era and what that really entails
from a consumer behavior I think we look
at that and say all of these additional
waves that people are engaging with
their devices while they're watching
television is one of the most
interesting behaviors that is going to
come and for us you know simply put it's
about interests and Beyond interest it's
about how do I expose those connections
in real time so I think you know
obviously Facebook has done an enormous
job with exposing people social graphs
and connecting people I think we believe
that interests actually dominate at
certain points so it's funny you know
well if you observe what's happening
around consumers especially I mean I can
talk about from our application
experience people are willing to have a
conversation because they're both
engaged in the same thing we're both
watching Game of Thrones that's enough
for me and I'm interested in you and I'm
willing to connect with you and chat
with you and have a discussion with you
around that even though I don't
necessarily know you and so I think what
we're what we're going to see in the
next six to eight months is more and
more of that type of real-time networks
real-time connectivity and frankly a
different form of consumer engagement
around devices and if you're I guess for
all simply put if you're not thinking
about how that experience translates
into a device you're missing what what
consumers are doing it's a very
different set of consumer interactions
it's not like what we've seen in the
past from you know kind of a two-handed
text input typing
experience it is a very different
experience a very lightweight experience
and it's a very connected and sort of
simple experience</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
