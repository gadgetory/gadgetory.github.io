camera we've given the pc eyes and ears
letting it interact with you more
naturally so let's use an example that's
a practical example and many of us
experience every day let's let's talk to
our cook Chuck here and have him show us
how real sense applies here hey Brian
how's it going good Jack how's it going
going great but you showed the realsense
camera and they're just amazing things
with pictures but it's capable of so
much more in fact it can probably help
you in places you never even thought of
like the kitchen that's yep I agree so I
found a great mouth-watering recipe for
wings on the Food Network website so i
brought my laptop i want to show you
well that looks like my daughter's
laptop half the time yes yeah this is
what happens when you bring your laptop
into the kitchen and use it with yucky
fingers right up so real sense can take
care of that full thing for you let me
show you so I have a clip of this recipe
to make wings so using my voice I'm
gonna start that clip play video so this
seems pretty simple I take my spices
throw them all into the bull mix them up
here cooking's really not that hard no
it's not see I picked my chicken add it
to the bowl add my spices I can mix this
all up here now really don't need this
beauty when I think it got this hartnett
part down so stop video so you can see
got my chicken it's all marinated here
you got the dry rub growing I really
want to see what's the next step in the
recipe yeah so using the realsense
camera I can prevent that see I was able
to bring that recipe right in right and
if I wonder scroll to the end I simply
make that gesture and lets me scroll
there we go get to the end I can see
some more stuff have to do see the sauce
after make next but you know what so
before I make that sauce let's go back
to that clip so let's get rid of the
recipe and since our camera sees that
left and right end depth I can actually
start the clip with just the gesture
there we go they will started I can go
to the rest of the sauce I can stop it
simple gesture let's Bend just
marinating this up and getting hungry
it's all I put it on the grill right now
there we go only one thing left open
timer start timer we are 50 minutes away
from chicken wing heaven I can't wait
Jack I'd shake your hand but I I'll pass</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
