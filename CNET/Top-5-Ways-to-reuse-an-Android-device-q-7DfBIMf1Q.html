just sitting somewhere collecting dust
let's count down the top 5 ways to
breathe new life into that old Android
at number 5 a dedicated media player
exercising with your main phone can
sometimes be stressful you wouldn't want
to break your phone while you're trying
to get fit so why not use your older
phone as a media player as an aside you
can also install the jawbone up app to
make your phone a fitness tracker when
you're running around at number four a
remote control your old Android could be
the brain of a whole new world you could
use your phone to drive tons of video to
a chromecast some Android phones like
the HTC One and a samsung galaxy s4 have
built-in IR blasters so if you want to
control your home theater you can do
that directly some home theatre
components like TVs and receivers have
apps they'll let you control them over
your network if you've got smart home
gadgets you can load that phone up with
widgets to control your lights - at
number three a security camera there's
no need to spend a bunch of money for a
dedicated nest cam if you've got an old
phone sitting around you can pick up the
four dollar app called IP webcam it'll
use your camera to do the rest you might
also want to pick up a dock so you can
mount the phone in the right spot at
number two make it your assistant if
you've seen the Amazon echo and thought
hey that'd be cool to have but I don't
know if it's worth the price you can use
an old Android like an assistant to make
sure your Android is always listening to
you open the Google Search app then
click settings choose voice then ok
Google detection make sure you can
access the voice feature from any screen
now when the device is sitting around
you can say okay Google what's the
weather or okay Google play the killers
on Spotify also you can load up your
home screen with widgets to get all
kinds of info at a glance I asked you
guys would you use your older devices
for here's what you had to say Nelson D
says he uses his as a clock and for his
chromecast Amanda says her old razor is
a media streamer for her exercise room
Daniel says he uses old Android phones
with flash browsers at work to control
3d laser scanners great ideas thanks
everyone onto number one at number one
you can save the world with an Android
device first download the app buuck this
app can connect your phone to a large
network of other computers around the
world
together all these machines can act in
concert to become a supercomputer you
can use your spare processing power to
help biomedical research understand
asteroids do environmental research or
any number of other things
by default the app only runs when your
device is plugged into a charger and
when the screen is off so it's not
messing with your phone experience for
