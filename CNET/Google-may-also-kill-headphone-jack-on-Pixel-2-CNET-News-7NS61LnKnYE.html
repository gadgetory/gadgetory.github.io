thrilled with this rumor Google is
reportedly not including a headphone
jack on its upcoming pixel 2 smartphone
this report comes from 9 to 5 Google
which says it obtained an internal
Google document that presents the
removal of the headphone jack as matter
of fact now it is just one source so
don't take it as gospel yet but it is
not far-fetched since Apple did remove
the headphone jack on its latest iPhones
so folks couldn't use their older
headphones unless they had a dongle
adapter accessory plugged in or just
made the leap to wireless Bluetooth
headphones Google's current pixel foam
does have a USB type-c port for power
and some companies aren't starting to
make headphones that connect directly
into USB type-c ports so this could be
the start of a new trend now it is
possible Google's just testing multiple
prototypes of phones maybe some with the
standard headphone jack and some without
it's a bit too early to tell
we know Google is making a pixel to
phone google's hardware chief was quoted
last week by the blog android pitt and
confirm google is working on one this
year that will come with a premium price
tag but we do not know if it's gonna be
released in October
like it was last year I'm Bridget Carey
