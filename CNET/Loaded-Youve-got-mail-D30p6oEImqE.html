Morris and it's time to get loaded
Facebook will have an announcement later
today that has something to do with
messaging we speculate that it will be
an improved mail client which means that
maybe I'll actually check my facebook
mail the announcement happens later this
afternoon we'll bring you the news
tomorrow speaking of mail AOL revamped
its version of webmail the new mail was
called Project Phoenix and it won't
fully roll out to users until next year
some highlights include a quick bar at
the top for sending short email instant
message and text messages there's also
tabbed viewing for your messages and you
can feed in mail from other accounts
such as gmail and hotmail the sony dash
now supports Hulu Plus this means that
you can watch a lot more shows on the
device making it a lot more useful than
it ever really was the dash is a counter
top computer with a 7-inch touchscreen
it previously was only really useful to
listen to music or watch video and photo
with slideshows now you can actually get
some good TV on there so it's worth
considering it costs 199 dollars Netflix
is coming to Android devices meaning
android phone users can stream movies
from their netflix account but not
really only certain android phones will
be able to use this netflix app
apparently it's difficult to allow this
universally on android so as a platform
they had to do it phone by phone iphone
and windows phone 7 devices do not have
this problem the app works universally
on those platforms and Google Earth has
new photo layers that have panoramic
photos contributed by users of the site
360 cities net these are high res
panoramic photos marked in Google Earth
with a red square icon it gives you
360-degree views of destinations like
the Eiffel Tower or the blue mosque
those are your headlines for today I
will see you tomorrow I'm Natali Morris
for cnet com and yes you heard correctly
I did st. moritz you can read about the
name change if you're interested at
Natali Morris com nevertheless you just</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
