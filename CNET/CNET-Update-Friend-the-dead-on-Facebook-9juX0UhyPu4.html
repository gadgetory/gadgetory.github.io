facebook I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your cnet update when you die your
Facebook page can live on in the care of
a family member or friend facebook now
that you assign one person to be in
charge of your Facebook page after you
die Facebook calls it a legacy contact
and this air to your page has very
limited powers they cannot post on your
behalf so you won't have someone's
sending status updates posing as you
from beyond the grave however this
legacy contact can put some text above
your profile such as a special message
or a memorial service announcement they
can change your main profile photo and
cover photo and this one's a bit strange
they can also accept pending friend
requests so if you weren't friends with
someone before hey maybe you could be
friends in the afterlife this person
does not have the power to delete any
photos or change any captions or delete
any posts even messages people write on
your page after you're gone can't be
touched a benefit to having a legacy
contact is that the person can download
an archive of your photos posts and
profile information that was shared on
Facebook but they cannot see private
messages until now Facebook would just
freeze an account of someone who has
died and blocked that person from being
used in advertisements or other
notifications you also don't want other
people getting reminders to wish you a
happy birthday for that to stop someone
does need to notify Facebook about your
death you can also request Facebook to
delete your account after you're gone
this is actually an important issue
these days you need to think about who
gets access to your digital data google
does something similar if you've been an
active on your Google accounts for a
specified amount of time you can grant
someone access to your data like what's
in your picasa web albums your youtube
account and gmail you just can't send
emails from their account anymore it's a
good conversation to have with a loved
one I mean it's Valentine's Day coming
up you're sitting there together with a
nice glass of wine it's easy to just
break the ice and say honey I love you
so much will you be my inactive Account
Manager or you know you could just keep
a password book and give it to someone
in your will and speaking of love yes
I'm going to transition to a happier
topic best buy has launched
own wedding registry by April will start
to see wedding registry kiosks in stores
encouraging couples to adorn their new
home together with flat panel TVs iPads
end as thermostats and if you get gifts
that you want to resell Facebook added
new tools to sell your stuff on the
social network there are many groups on
the network where people in
neighborhoods post up for sale but
Facebook created a special post just for
selling and that includes a price a
pickup and delivery location and you
mark when it's sold it doesn't have a
way to pay through Facebook but you know
that's going to be the next step that's
your tech news update and there's always
more at cnet com from our studios in New
York I'm Bridget Carey</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
