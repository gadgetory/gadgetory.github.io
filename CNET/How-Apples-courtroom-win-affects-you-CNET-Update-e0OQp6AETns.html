courtroom win can impact you I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update Apple
may have won its patent case against
Samsung and courtly Friday but the
battle between the two biggest
smartphone makers is not over yet the
jury in San Jose California found
Samsung products infringed on Apple's
patents like rounded edges and
pinch-to-zoom interface and they said
Samsung should pay more than a billion
dollars in damages next up the judge has
to decide if she wants to change the
award amount Samsung is expected to
appeal and Apple will likely ask for an
injunction to ban the selling of Samsung
products that violate its patents the
hearing to discuss all that will be
September 20th the jury found 25
smartphones and tablets violated patents
but you know it was on the list the
galaxy s3 which is Samsung's flagship
smartphone right now and the new Galaxy
Note 10.1 tablet seems to also be in the
clear consumers won't feel too much in
effect if the hottest products are still
in stores but if Samsung has to pay
those damages that's a billion dollars
it won't be spending on innovation or
Samsung could raise its prices over time
to help pay off that penalty fee if
there's no appeal this victory would
give Apple more ammunition to go after
other companies and the marketplace will
have to invest more and being different
be no is totally in the clear
