oldest internet bank shuts its doors and
how much would you pay for the sound of
music find out next in the queue
what is going on I'm rich demuro with
Cena TV at the outpost in New York City
here to help you make it through another
tech day let's get you started with your
must click moment car vs razor to it
seems a giant phone fell from its add
post and cut right through a very fancy
car in a Russian parking lot several
pictures showing a badly damaged
Mercedes thankfully the slick scene
seems to be an ad campaign whipped up by
Motorola marketing Wizards smart guys
when the web first came on the scene it
threaten the livelihood of all kinds of
businesses pet stores bookstores
journalists of course we all saw that
come crashing down but recently another
web one point a pioneer shut its doors
net bank ushered in the promise of
simpler banking and better returns but
now its customers are left scratching
their heads as the bank shut down its
doors over the weekend with no warning
104,000 former net bank customers had
their accounts safely transferred to ING
Direct now this does open up a big
opportunity for Fisher so watch out for
those emails moving through the queue a
new study shows that America's business
elite can't get enough media it seems
CEOs and senior execs are keeping busy
by consuming in the c-suite they love
magazines journals the internet digital
and satellite TV even though as peons
rely on the net for much of our smarts
top business leaders still turn to the
printed page as a basis for information
oh yeah the typical American business
leader 51 mail makes 408 thousand
dollars a year and is worth 1.7 mil not
bad time for the site Voigt really is a
breakthrough for cheap communications
problem is it can be complicated for the
masses now jaja hopes to simplify it
with buttons they may click to calling a
cinch just sign up for an account then
create a button to add to your profile
blog or web page your phone number stays
hidden and you can set the time and days
you'll take calls you can also block
certain numbers to help you limit costs
now calls are free to the people
clicking your button they can even
connect using their regular phone but
the button owners currently pay two
point eight cents a minute for landline
to landline calls calls between jajja
users are free the band Radiohead
selling their latest album with a unique
twist fans pay what they feel the
digital download is
earth we took the topic to the streets
of NYC a penny twenty bucks if your
favorite artist offered their music
online for download with no strings
attached how much would you pay I would
probably get $15 $20 thirty dollars in
the night that I was supporting so I was
trying too much like 10 hours people
should pay at least 15 bucks twelve
bucks minimum i'll probably donate three
or four cuz on that poor okay honestly I
probably won't pay anything I'll
download for free but I'll tell people
to donate a couple of dollars maybe for
some lousy I have a feeling when push
comes to shove that number is going to
be a little closer to zero I'm rich
demuro with Cena TV have a great day see
you later</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
