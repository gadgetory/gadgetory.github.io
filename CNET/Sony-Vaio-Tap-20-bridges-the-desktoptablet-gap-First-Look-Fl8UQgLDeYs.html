with the Sony Vaio
tap 20 all-in-one desktop so this system
might be the most unique in the entire
slate of Windows 8 launch PCs what's
interesting about it is that while it's
a 20-inch on one that has a fairly
modest set of components it actually
also has a battery what that means is
that you can take this system and move
it around anywhere in your house and it
really kind of straddles the line
between desktop and tablet for its core
specs it's a 20 inch display with a 1600
by 900 resolution it comes with a core
i5 low voltage CPU as well as 4 gigs of
RAM and a 750 gigabyte hard drive it has
onboard Intel graphics so it's not
really much of a gaming desktop and it
actually only has a fairly limited set
of ports you get a couple USB threes
some audio jacks an SD card slot as well
as standard Ethernet and power that's
about it
sorry home entertainment hub fans it
does not have an HDMI input which is
kind of a drag we also found in our
testing that the system will last for
about three and a half hours on battery
that's certainly long enough to watch
most movies so with those specs and for
$9.99 this might seem like an overpriced
desktop but the battery really gives it
some unique flexibility you pick it up
pretty easily close up the stand and
take it pretty much wherever you can lay
it down flat on a surface or you can
take it and move it into say a bedroom a
den or somewhere sort of out of the way
to use it as a full screen computer for
watching movies or browsing the web
whatever you want to do one so for movie
watching it has no optical drive so
you're stuck with either an external
optical if you want to kind of clutter
it up or whatever you can get from the
web or it's on your hard drive and as I
said with gaming you can play newer
titles with lower image quality settings
but I wouldn't expect to play everything
for general day-to-day computing though
you can do pretty much anything you want
in the system as long as you steer clear
of higher-end multimedia editing it also
has some unique networking capabilities
that it has Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.0 and NFC
support so system definitely is not for
everybody I can certainly see an
argument that a laptop or a tablet can
do pretty much anything this thing can
for lower price and it's easier to move
around still the fact that this brings a
nice large display and a battery powered
PC makes it kind of compelling for a
certain niche so our merch Brown this is
the sony vaio tap 20</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
