car's engine wants to rotate in a fairly
narrow range of rpms but your car's
wheels want to rotate over a much wider
range so the transmission sits between
them and makes peace matching up their
different rotational needs the most
common transmission today is a
traditional automatic it's a hydraulic
fluid filled thing that shifts like it
sounds
it's very hydraulic it takes into
account engine rpm vehicle speed
accelerator position and engine load and
whatever the various computers around
the car demanding of it and selects a
gear to parts in particular the
hydraulic valve body and the hydraulic
torque converter give the automatic its
traditional smooth but often flabby
driving field
hence the rather derisive name that
enthusiasts and purists have given the
automatic that of course would be slush
box yes get away with Mirko Matic almost
defies description it's so silky smooth
you're scarcely aware of what's
happening but their convenience made
them the hero of the industry in the US
well over 90 percent of new cars shipped
with one now automatics used to have
just three speeds then after the 1979
energy crisis a fourth gear became
common as a fuel saving overdrive Mirko
Matic goes into overdrive cruising
affect you soar along smoothly quietly
and without effort overdrive is any gear
with an input-output ratio lower than
one to one that allows the engine to run
at low rpms while the car is cruising at
a high speed today five and six speeds
are common with eight and nine speeds at
the cutting edge so if more gears are
better why not an infinite number
enter the CVT continuously variable
transmission instead of a specific
number of gears or ratios it uses
variable pulleys to create almost any
ratio as the pulleys change diameter
on-the-fly they're turning a steel drive
belt between them and that Brokers the
RPM between the engine and the wheels on
a continuum instead of via big jumps
between gears conventional automatics
hunt for the right here going up the
hill jumping between third and fourth
and you really need to be in say three
and a half
well because CVT chooses from a much
wider range of ratios it can nail that
in-between spot and hold it as you make
a steady smooth climb to the top but
knock-on CBTs is that they have tended
to feel even more slippery and vague
than a traditional automatic and can't
handle the output of the most powerful
engines but both traditional automatics
and CBTs have made big strides in
responsiveness and today automatics
typically deliver the best 0 to 60 times
and the best mpg at once but purists
don't care for them there's nothing like
a manual a manual transmission has
typically five six or maybe seven speeds
a clutch and a shift lever now manual
transmissions have not changed much
the 50s to be honest and all that makes
it work is a clutch pedal down there a
gearshift lever here and all those gears
I mentioned are arrayed on a couple of
shafts inside the gearbox you make all
the decisions using the clutch to
momentarily break the connection between
engine and driveline long enough to grab
the next gear without grinding
everything diseases the benefit of them
is simple they're direct they're really
robust and they let you pick exactly the
gear you want at exactly the moment you
want it and hold it for as long as you
want it they are completely personal in
terms of driving but they're really an
anachronism today manuals are pretty
rare these days found typically on very
bass cars or very cheap ones but the
manual transmission is having a
resurgence of sorts thanks to this guy
this is a dual clutch automated manual
transmission or a DCT here in this Audi
rs5 it looks like basically an automatic
and that shift Gatewood fuya but beyond
the lever it's a very different animal a
computer and some servos are in charge
of operating not just one but two
clutches and moving the gears around
it's called a dual clutch because it
actually has two clutches allowing one
to keep hammering power through the
current gear while the other clutch
decouples and selects the next gear on a
different internal shaft it's like
having two manual transmissions in one
box that hand off to each other the gear
changes are so quick that the driver
does not notice the transfer of torque
into the other sub transmission during
an upshift the result are lightning-fast
shifts and 200-proof power delivery
from high-end Porsches to hot Mitsu's
and now everything Ferrari makes the
dual clutch is the intersection of
purism and tech the bottom line is you
get the precision and the direct power
connection a manual transmission with
really fast shifts but also the
convenience of drop it in drive
technology and just two pedals to deal
with choose a transmission with these
factors in month your driving style
automatics and CB T's win on convenience
hands down dual clutch gearboxes can
give you their convenience with a
manuals responsiveness but had a cost
and a manual transmission is great if
you really like driving know how to
drive one and miss things like the Cold
War and Ed Sullivan mpg transmission
joys can make a big difference in a
car's fuel economy compared the mpg of
each transmission offered in a new car
you're looking at KAUST automatics tend
to cost a little over a thousand dollars
when optional dual clutch gearboxes can
be two to three times then and
serviceability automatics and CBTs are
often maintenance-free sealed units
these days manuals will need occasional
clutch replacement but they're highly
repairable
