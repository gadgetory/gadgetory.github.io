and right now we're taking a first look
at the Sony Xperia ZL this unlocked
smartphone is quite well appointed and
for the steep 7 59 99 unsubsidized price
sony is charging for it well it better
be the first thing you'll notice about
the Xperia ZL is its large 5 inch LCD
screen not only is the screen bright it
boasts a full HD resolution of 1920 x
1080 pixels to and displays vibrant
colors one thing I noticed off the bat
though is if you stray from viewing the
screen directly head on image quality
deteriorates quickly by contrast the HTC
One which features a slightly smaller
4.7 inch LCD display has the same
resolution brightness but much wider
viewing angles despite its large display
however the Xperia ZL is sleek at just
0.4 inch thick the phone is thin with
stylish ly dark good looks under the
Xperia Z l's display is a slick
notification light that looks like some
sort of robotic i winking at me from the
future well maybe that's just me it also
changes color depending on the alert the
light is calling attention to next to
that is Z Elle's front-facing
2-megapixel camera which is an odd
choice typically phone makers position
the cams above not below the screen
there are no capacitive buttons here
either you have to tap the screen to
fire up virtual keys for basic android
controls on the phones right edge are
the Xperia Z l's only fiscal controls
placed here are a thin volume rocker a
dedicated camera key plus a prominent
circular power button sitting in between
them the left side holds a microUSB port
while up top you'll find a 3.5
millimeter headphone jack sony throws in
a set of earbuds that are nicer than the
usual throwaway models bundled with
phones a little door cover slots for
micro SD and SIM cards the battery
however is embedded the cl's backside is
textured plastic and not the more
premium glass material Sony uses in the
Xperia Z another difference between the
Xperia ZL and the Xperia Z is that the
ZL isn't water or dust
resistance internal components are the
same as the Xperia Z though under the
hood is a 1.5 gigahertz quad-core
Qualcomm Snapdragon s4 pro processor 2
gigabytes of ram and 16 gigabytes of
internal storage not too shabby that
Hardware powers the Android 4.2 jelly
bean OS and Sony's special you I that's
grafted over it that means you get all
the power and flexibility of modern
Android native support for Google
services including the enhanced search
capabilities of google now sony has
infused the ZL with its own special
sauce two highlights are a handy weather
widget and a nice remote control app to
use the phone as a second clicker for
TVs and AV receivers the experience 13
megapixel camera has a ton of feature
settings and shooting modes to as an
unlocked gsm handset the xperia ZL
connects to tmobile and ATT SGA am
networks in the US plus supports 4g LTE
bands 12 45 and 17 i'm brian bennett for
cnet.com and this has been a first look
at the Sony Xperia ZL</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
