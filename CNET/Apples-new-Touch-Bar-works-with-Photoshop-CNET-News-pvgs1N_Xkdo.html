Photoshop are made for each other this
new addition of the touch bar really
combines with the keyboard and this new
giant trackpad to create this incredibly
natural expressive and powerful new way
of working with Photoshop let me see if
I can show you what I mean
all right I have up here on the screen
this amazing image of a woman climbing
terseness cave in Greece but what is
this cave we're not in Greece what if it
were here now to pull this off I'm going
to need to cut the cave out of Greece
and the tool for cutting things out in
Photoshop is called select and mask and
normally it's in a menu or a sub tool
but with the touch bar it's right here
at my fingertips now you can see the
touch bar has changed to show me only
the controls I need for this task you
can see how with my right hand I'm
mousing and selecting and with my left
hand I'm adjusting the size of the brush
it's a really fun and natural way of
working let me see if I can get her legs
there I'm going to switch over to my
refinement tool and again I can just
resize while I work totally this two
hand way of working it's really fun I
know if you guys can tell how much fun
I'm having all right all right here we
go all right let's see how I did all
right that's not bad for 10 seconds and
that whole time my two hands were really
working in concert and my eyes were up
and on my image really makes a lot of
sense it's really a good way of working
okay so this is great this is definitely
not Greece but I'd like to see more
drastic of a change and adding content
to an already open document can be a lot
of mousing but not with the touch bar
I'll just top that select a sunset put
that right there and we'll move that
under and see how that looks all right
we're getting somewhere I like this but
it's kind of yellow and so I'd like to
add more color and to do that I'm going
to need to do some brushing but first
I'm going to go into my touch bar and
when I choose my favorites and then I'm
going to add a new layer and then I'm
going to go into full screen now full
screens amazing as was just said this is
great I have no panels I have no menus
and I
and 100% focus on my image</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
