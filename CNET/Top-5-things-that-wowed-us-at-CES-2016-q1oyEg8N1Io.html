drone in there it's not just
professional wrestling anymore there's
also another company to introduce what
people are describing as a drone you can

Villar and AR it was all over CES in
lots of different forms oculus rift was
one of the things it's got a price it's

little slice in the circle so you can
look around in VR plus I tried out an
augmented reality chatted experience

porn moving on at number 2 is the Amazon
invasion so many companies announced
integration with Amazon's answer to Siri
Alexa the biggest partnership is with

turn on the lights in your home and the
number one thing that wowed us at CES

fridge with a 21 inch touchscreen it
even has cameras inside to let you know

awesome it Samsung introducing some
wearable tech that you would actually
want to wear check out the smart suit it
actually has an NFC button that can do
things like unlock your phone or
