I'm Brian Tom and this is the price
fight you've been all waiting for
between two of the heaviest hitting
Android phones it's a prize five punch
out between the HTC One m8 and the
Samsung Galaxy s5 our judges for this
fight are senior editor Jessica
pineapple dole court associate editor
Lynn ooh la la la and you-know-who
reeling a big home will take all three
judges scores and average them out to
the nearest tenth each round the final
prize fight score will be an average of
all rounds through the same system let's
get it started
round one is design the HTC One m8 sexy
aluminum body makes me want to do things
that we're not allowed to show you it's
arguably the sexiest five inch phone
we've ever seen with its slightly higher
441 pixels per inch density a slightly
brighter display and it's learned from
its predecessor with curved corners and
smooth edges that just don't quit this
is one of the best built Android phones
you'll ever see now on a quick glance
the galaxy s5 might look pretty similar
to the s4 but it brings a larger 5.1
inch screen with a 432 pixel per inch
density and a slightly more rectangular
shape
it still feels plastic and that's not a
knock against it it's simple backside
isn't as slippery as the m8 and it's
lighter in weight but it doesn't come
close to the premium feel and
construction that ACC brings ATC's
design ciampi beat and it takes us
the perfect vibe and the s5 gets a for
next round is uber interface and
controls both phones run Android 4.4.2
kitkat out of the box and bring their
own unique feel and features on top of
it ACC sense 6.0 UI is their cleanest to
date bringing a flatter and simpler user
interface that's straightforward it's my
favorite flavor of Android and it's
blinkfeed feature for up-to-date
information gets better with more
customization now Samsung's TouchWiz
interface has also clean up its act from
the past but when your phone that can do
everything it can make it tricky to keep
things simple it has a new flatter look
for icons the UI is still just as
customizable it also brings my magazine
which is their own version of blinkfeed
with customizable content but it just
isn't as clean as HCC's here just look
at these two home screens this one
typically comes down to personal
preference but our judges give the atc
of four point seven and Samsung get the
cool go after averaging two rounds the
ACC one leads big four point nine to
four next rounded people both phones
come with 16 to 32 gigs of storage and a
micro SD card slot that supports up to
128 gigs of additional space HTC has
made it a point to bring something
unique to the table with its new motion
launch gestures from the home screen or
picking up the phone to answer it
directly when it rings and yes Samsung
has that too it's boom sound stereo
speakers are still a feature favorite of
mine for any phone and it doesn't lack
anything major
but then you look at Samsung's Galaxy s5
and it stays true to its past as the
phone that I call the feature freak of
nature there may be non-essential
features like the heart rate monitor on
the back but it's the first ever on a
phone and it's s health app is also
legitimate there's a fingerprint scanner
for security but it's not always an easy
swipe multi windows are still Samsung's
thing and they started the whole motion
gestures control in fact they were the
first Jedi phone the s5 is using low
energy Bluetooth and micro USB 3.0 while
the m8 is using standard Bluetooth 4.0
and micro USB 2.0 plus the s5 has a
super fast charging mode if you use
their charger cable this one's no
contest the s5 gets a perfect 5 and the
m8 gets a 4 next round is web browsing a
multi meter web browsing on both of
these displays is a treat with their
large screens and both screens handle HD
quality movies just fine now both phones
have access to the Google Play Store and
you'll still find the occasional new app
on iTunes first but all the major ones
are here and their library of multimedia
content is robust now the biggest
distinguishing feature between these two
phones are their cameras ACC brings
their dual 4 megapixel ultra pixel
cameras it shoots 1080p video at 60
frames per second with a super clean
interface to switch between modes and
you focus is their standout feature that
allows you to choose what part of the
picture is in focus after you've taken
it that's sick
now the s5 really brings a superior 16
megapixel camera that also shoots 4k
video at 30 frames per second and 1080p
video at 60 frames per second and brings
a lot of filters and features that don't
make it the simplest interface now the
results speak for themselves in our
photo comparisons and the s5 just brings
more vibrant colors that are natural and
that's something that even you focus
can't change the galaxy s5 takes
4.7 and the m8 gets a 3.7 dr. Avenue
four rounds we're tied at four point
four points apiece the final round at
the stein middle performance both phones
are snapping performers bringing
Qualcomm squad core Snapdragon 801
chipsets with the g5 clocking in at a
higher 2.5 gigahertz compared to the m8
2.3 both phones bring two gigs of ram
but the fact is megahertz just doesn't
tell the whole story
after matching these two beasts up in
our performance tests now in our 3d mark
unlimited test that tests graphics
performance the ACC 1 edged out the
galaxy s5 across multiple tests and then
in the GFX benchmark test the m8 edged
out the s5 in almost every test again
but by a small margin
now all this means is that these are
top-tier performing phones when it came
down to see Nats battery video drain
test the ACC One m8 lasted nine hours
and 52 minutes compared to the galaxy s5
that squeezed out 15 hours and 18
minutes of juice that's flat-out
impressive now each phone has a power
saving mode but that disables a lot of
the normal functionality and our judges
all agree the s5 gets a perfect 5 and
the m8 gets a 4 so let's average out all
5 rounds
ACC took a strong lead early but Samsung
then just flexed its muscle in the last
three rounds taking this slobberknocker
4.5 the fourth
and is your prize fight winner both of
these phones are truly the cream of the
Android crop you know I personally
prefer the HTC One m8 but ultimately the
choice is always up to you
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching I
will catch you guys next time for
another prize fight don't be</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
