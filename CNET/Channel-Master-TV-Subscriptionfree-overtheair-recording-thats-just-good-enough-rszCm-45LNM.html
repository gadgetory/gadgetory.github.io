over and over again from cord cutters I
just want a basic DVR that records free
over-the-air TV without any subscription
fees it's always seem like a product
that should exist but the options have
been underwhelming and that's exactly
the niche that channel masters new DVR
plus is looking to fill hey I'm Matthew
Muscovy ak from C net and the $250 DVR
plus is one of the only over-the-air
DVRs on the market that truly doesn't
have a subscription fee it has a super
thin design at just an inch and a half
tall but it's also wide and deep giving
it a unique pancake-like shape it's just
thick enough to accommodate its ports on
the back which include an antenna input
HDMI output Ethernet port two USB ports
and an IR extender port there's also an
included remote which is decent but
there's a lot of room for improvement
the playback buttons that you use the
most are all small and they're scrunch
at the bottom making it difficult to
navigate by feel setting up the DVR Plus
doesn't take long but the catch is that
you're going to have to supply a lot of
your own accessories to take full
advantage of all the DVR plusses
features you'll need an antenna to
receive over-the-air TV signals and a
USB hard drive to save your recordings
the DVR plus also likes built-in Wi-Fi
so if you don't have a thern ette in
your living room you may have to shell
out for channel masters $40.00 USB Wi-Fi
dongle
once you've assembled and set up all
your gear you can fire up the DVR plus
and watch some TV if you have good
reception in your area you should be
able to tune in to all the major
networks like CBS NBC Fox and ABC Plus
PBS and a few local stations too there's
also support for Vudu streaming video
service which gives you pay per view
access to movies and TV shows that you
can't get over the air the channel
master user interface is basic but it
should look familiar to anyone that's
used at cable box and that's actually a
big plus as many of the new over-the-air
recording solutions like tableau or
Aereo lack a traditional on-screen
interface which can make them a little
clunkier to use for true
channel TV watching if you have the DVR
plus connected online it will also
receive Rove ease program guide data for
free which is really nice since Ravi's
data displays any show airing within 14
days the DVR plus has dual tuner
functionality which music and record two
shows at once or you can watch live TV
while recording another program
recording a program is simple and you
can also tell the DVR plus to record
every episode of your favorite show
although you can't tell it to only
record new episodes so you're probably
going to end up with a lot of repeats
you don't want to watch for the most
part image quality on the DVR plus is
excellent although in a few rare
occasions I did see some playback
glitches on recording programs which
ends up being a minor annoyance but
overall the DVR plus hits most of the
major points cord cutters have been
looking for including the big one it
reliably records over-the-air TV without
any monthly fees I wish it was a little
cheaper and with more streaming services
and it had more refined recording
options but if you're a cord cutter
whose primary goal is to save money and
you can live with the imperfections it's
hard to beat the channel master DVR plus
I'm Matthew moscovia and this is the
channel master DVR plus
