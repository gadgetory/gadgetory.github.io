single web service you use is a pain and
using the same password on multiple
sites is a really really really bad idea
Amaya's Akhtar and today I'll be showing
you how to use LastPass to manage your
passwords
LastPass is a password manager that
works on desktops laptops and mobile
devices to get started get to your
laptop and visit LastPass calm download
the LastPass extension that applies to
you
LastPass will automatically detect if
you're on Windows Mac or Linux and offer
you a recommended download link in our
case this is a Mac and LastPass is
offering up a universal Mac os10
installer that will install the LastPass
password manager on pretty much whatever
browser you have on your machine
download that file then open the
Installer in the Installer you can
create your LastPass account before you
create your account you want to make
sure you have a really really strong
password for LastPass since this will
manage all your other passwords
everywhere this password should be super
secure now what makes a password super
secure there are a lot of factors but as
a rule of thumb
make sure you haven't used this password
with any other service avoid using
dictionary words and avoid the most
common passwords such as 1 2 3 4 5 6 or
password definitely have over 8
characters in your password and include
a mix of uppercase letters lowercase
letters numbers and special characters
once you've figured out that awesome
password don't forget it after that's
all set LastPass starts doing its job
now when you sign up for services or log
on to different pages like Twitter or
Amazon or your bank you can have
LastPass generate passwords for you
LastPass will automatically save that
information and autofill it if you want
if you use multiple computers you can
always go to LastPass comm and enter
your email address and super secure
password to get access to your vault of
usernames and passwords you can access
the web version on your mobile device
but LastPass is a lot easier to use if
you use the LastPass app for your phone
or tablet the apps available for iOS
Android Windows Phone and Blackberry
however while the app is free it only
works if you pay for a LastPass premium
which costs $12 per year the LastPass
app lets you sign into sites using a
built in browser there are a number of
alternatives out there including one
password which gives the user more
control and it doesn't have subscription
fees normally you'll have to
50 dollars for a desktop app and the
mobile app for iOS is about 18 dollars
currently at the time of this recording
those prices are slashed in half now
those are one-time fees instead of a
subscription
there's also keepass it's an open-source
alternative probably best suited to
power users so there you have it how to
use a password manager on Maya's akhtar
