company's $700 enthusiasts compacts you
know the one without the viewfinder but
it just can't keep up when it comes to
speed
given that the g7x mark 2 is
fundamentally the same camera I'll be
lit with some important enhancements
it's not surprising that I like the mark
2 as well the performance is noticeably
better although it still lags in some
ways I'm Laurie Brennan and this is the
canon powershot g7x mark to welcome
changes include a grip a switch on the
front to silence the otherwise clicky
control ring and a selfie friendly flip
up display that can also tilt down it
inherits picture styles canons image
controls from higher-end models
including the new fine detail mode that
helps a little doesn't help as much as
it does on the ATD though there's now
Wi-Fi and NFC and the Canon Connect app
works pretty well and it offers a
reasonable set of remote shooting and
downloading controls still not the go-to
camera for tons of features or filters
though
photo quality is a little better overall
as well especially in low-light keeping
up with other one-inch sensor compacts
like Sony's rx 100 series its biggest
hold up is when it needs to process
images such as taking a couple of
consecutive non burst shots or to do HDR
however it does start up a little faster
than the big-name competitors and it's
fast enough for slowish action such as
the occasional kid pet or jump shot</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
