been busy I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNN update Priceline announced it
will buy travel website kayak for about
1.8 billion dollars the deal is expected
to close by March kayak will be
operating independently from priceline
and current management will remain to
run the website kayak lets users compare
pricing for hotels flights and other
travel services and it processes more
than 100 million user queries each month
the site just went public in July
several people have reported a defect in
Microsoft Surface touch cover where it
rips at the seam near the tablet
connection point a couple of users on
Microsoft Surface forum reported the
problem and said Microsoft gave him a
replacement cover with no hassle the
flaw could be limited cnet users have
written comments saying they had no
problems yet with their covers but then
again it's only been out for two weeks
in other news Verizon just announced it
plans to roll out 4G LTE to all its
coverage areas in the US by the middle
next year that's six months earlier than
previously scheduled gamefly the netflix
for video games has officially launched
its pc game service for all subscribers
customers now have access to unlimited
pc play for hundreds of downloadable
windows games including top titles like
fallout and Assassin's Creed
even if you don't subscribe to gamefly
right now you can download Bioshock for
free of course they hope that lures you
into the service Evernote has updated
its app for iphone and ipad owners
there's a new layout that gives one top
access to find the note you need AT&amp;amp;T
has been criticized for limiting use of
apple's facetime video chat to give you
some background when iOS 6 came out it
let users facetime over a cellular
connection instead of just Wi-Fi but
18-team blocked it for everyone except
customers that use the new shared data
plan ATT was worried that if everyone
was video chatting freely it would put a
strain on the network but now AT&amp;amp;T
announced that over the next couple of
months it will open up cellular FaceTime
to customers with a tiered data plan
using 4g LTE so you're out of luck if
you were grandfathered in with an
unlimited data plan which is what many
early iPhone users have and tiered data
plan customers with the older iphone 4
or iphone 4s also still can't facetime
freely that's your tech news update for
today you can find links to all of
