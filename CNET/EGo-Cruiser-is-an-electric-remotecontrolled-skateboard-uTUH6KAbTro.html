just too much physical effort
here's something that fixes that though
is the unique ego Cruiser an electric
skateboard so this thing is
battery-powered you drive it using this
remote you push this lever forward to
accelerate and pull it back to hit the
brake what's interesting about the brake
is that it's regenerative braking that
means that when you hit the brake you'll
actually charge up the skateboard
battery ever so slightly it takes three
hours to charge completely and on a full
charge it can go 80 miles at the speed
limit is 13 miles per hour
although I'm certainly not brave enough
to go that fast if you take a look
underneath you can see this long stretch
here that's mostly battery and the
battery is flexible too so if you're
jumping around on top of the board it
won't just snap in half it's one wheel
drive and this thing can handle a
maximum incline of 10 degrees there are
a couple of really nice design touches
here for example this whole thing's
waterproof so you can ride it through
puddles without having to worry and on
the bottom there's a USB port for
charging up your phone as if that's not
enough the remote has a flashlight on it
and if you download an app you can
actually control the sink using your
smartphone although then you do risk
dropping it as you're whizzing along the
pavement I'm not very good but it's
still a lot of fun to drive and the
braking actually is quite gentle you
don't fly off the front of this thing as
soon as you hit the brakes it's going to
cost $700 when it comes out available
online and that's all from me I'm the
Westway for CNET's here at CES 2014
