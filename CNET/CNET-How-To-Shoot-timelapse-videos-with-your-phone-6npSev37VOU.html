before the most common example is a
gorgeous sunset that's been sped up to
go from light to dark in just minutes
capturing scenes like this used to take
a lot of money and time and special
equipment but I'm going to show you how
to get professional quality results
using just your smartphone now the app
I'm using today is called lapse it pro
it's available in both iOS and Android
and there are a lot of options out there
but most of these tips can be applied to
the competing apps now first a few
things about choosing the right scene
time-lapse photography doesn't lend
itself well to every situation even
though the results look quick these
things take time to make 10 to 15
minutes minimum because of that make
sure you're in a location where you can
relax for a while or be able to leave
your phone unattended windows work well
maybe the patio of your hotel room if
you're on vacation and when you're
picking a scene make sure you're
capturing something that there will be
some action in even if it's subtle waves
on the beach trees in the wind cars on
the road people walking by that sort of
thing now when it comes to setting up
your camera the most important thing is
to make sure your phone isn't going to
wobble around since that's going to
break the spell of the video
unfortunately with today's thin
smartphones is nearly impossible to rest
these on a table and prop them up on
their own seeing that Sharon Profis has
a great video from making your own
tripod mount for your smartphone but if
you want something quick and cheap try a
binder clip or two by placing one of
these on each side of your phone it
makes it much easier to prop up or even
hang up on a nail all right now I'm
almost ready to record but before I do
there are a few settings worth checking
out tap the settings menu on the home
screen and the first thing you'll see
our capture settings by default lapse
that will take a picture every two
seconds which is great for shorter
videos 15 minutes turns into about 18
seconds but for longer stretches say
capturing hours or entire days it makes
sense to raise this closer to a frame a
minute you can also make use of the
schedule function to start recording at
a later time you can use this in
conjunction with limit mode to
automatically stop your recording now a
few other tweaks you can make you can
set the video quality of the 1080p if
you want the best quality just know
that's going to
up more space also disable the
promotional ending unless you feel like
giving laps at a free ad in every one of
your videos now once you're ready to
shoot you'll see a separate settings
menu on the capture screen this will
give you options for locking down the
focus and white balance and exposure you
can play with these if you really know
what you're doing but I got the best
results just leaving these alone on
continuous automatic control when you're
already you're going to set this thing
down make sure it's steady hit the
capture button and then just find
something to do for the next 15 minutes
now when you're all done capturing your
time-lapse wake up the phone and hit the
stop button then turn your phone into
portrait view and you'll see a number of
options for editing your video adding
effects music and exporting the final
product use the trim button to edit out
the shaky parts from the beginning and
end when you're probably handling the
phone and then in the info panel you can
rotate the video you can make it square
you can lay a time stamp over it and
when you're ready to make the final
render tap the render button check the
box for copy to camera roll and give
your movie a name then hit render after
a minute you should have a new video
added to your camera roll which you can
upload to YouTube or share however you
like for more tips like this including
