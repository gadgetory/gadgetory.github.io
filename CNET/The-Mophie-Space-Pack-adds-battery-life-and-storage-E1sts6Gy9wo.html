and you're an iPhone user there are
probably two limitations in your life
that you feel you'd like to do better on
battery life and storage and that's
where one of the more interesting
accessories that I've ever seen comes
into play the Mophie space pack which is
going to be available this March and
what it does is it combines a battery
pack case with 16 or 32 gigabytes of
storage right in there and what that
means is that it can access that storage
but it can also act as basically a flash
drive where you can drag things on and
off put any files on there and then
check them out on your phone sounds like
a dream come true right well one thing
the price is high it's $150 or 180 for
the 16 or 32 gig models $150 for an
iPhone case it better be damn good well
Mophie has a history of making some
really good battery pack cases for the
iPhone and the 1700 milliamp battery
pack in here matches the juice pack err
you can check battery level by pressing
this button at the bottom and that
button also launches the space pack
memory storage inside the space app now
it can't play every file that I put on
to it via the app that Mophie includes
the space app but it can play a lot of
them you can play music files that are
not DRM --d you can put video files on
there so far I've had success with MOV
and mp4 avi files did not play but avi
files often have difficulties on a lot
of formats and you can also put on Word
documents PDFs and you can also open
them in apps in iOS 7 so that's pretty
neat or share them with people and if
you don't have anything on there that
can play on an iPhone like I said you
could actually put files Exe is whatever
you want onto this and then just plug it
in like you would a regular USB Drive
the space pack comes in white or black
stay tuned for a full review once I've
lived with this for a week or so and
taking it on a trip
I'm Scott Stein and CNET and this is
movie space pack</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
