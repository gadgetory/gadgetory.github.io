known for attracting the tech crowd and
Caterina Mirabelli has seen it all from
behind the bar when it was a whole boom
of the Google calm and a lot of employee
cash out their shares had a lot of kids
coming here retiring and celebrating
they will come here and just you know
ordered from me the best champagne
bottles and the best bottles and just
trying to like honey from these just get
all the girls around them and for
singles on the prowl for a tech
millionaire it takes more than just luck
to strike gold a lot of girls will ask
me if you know any young successful
gentlemen that is single please and
Trudeau said I got more requests for
phone number that for wine and guys play
the same game they're definitely guys
out there who've made it and and no
that's attractive and use that to me
women Yuliya smirnova is a single woman
who has her own strategy for finding a
man there is a perfect market and
exchange of you know Beauty you know
status and money
there is nothing it's a free country you
can get whoever you want and what you
want ultimately people still looking for
love people are looking for someone who
feels who makes you feel special
Amy Anderson the founder of Lynx a
high-end Silicon Valley dating service
tries to spark those connections she
also advises clients on who to avoid you
go to any of the upscale hotels in the
Silicon Valley on any given night and
kind of spot a woman dressed a certain
way let's just say maybe approaching the
older guy and if she asks him about his
you know financial portfolio or his
other residences he should run for the
hills but Rick a Google exec and member
of links isn't worried that his wallet
is what is attracting women
I think gold-digging is less of an issue
in San Francisco as it would be in New
York or LA I think that the people with
money out here tend to be entrepreneurs
and self-made tech executives to for a
certain extent and they're pretty
grounded individuals as for the
competition from rich Facebook employees
this Bachelor doesn't bat an eye let's
face it like you know guys in tech are
really good at math and science but that
doesn't mean that we know anything about
Street and so even if there are a bunch
of new millionaires III don't think
that's going to you know radically
change the dating pool in San Francisco
