2014 we're taking a look at tableau it's
a new DVR system for recording
over-the-air video so as you might
already know if you plug an antenna into
your TV you can already get loads of
great HD programming but you're slightly
limited in the way that you can control
and and how you watch that stuff and
that's where tableau comes in because it
gives you the power to record those
over-the-air broadcasts so this is the
tableau box that plugs into your antenna
which receives the over-the-air
broadcasts and then the tableau all the
stuff from there is sent to a set-top
box so this will work with Apple TV Roku
and it should work with Smart TVs as
well when you download the tableau app
which is available on iOS Android and in
browser you'll be able to see and plan
all your recordings so if you want to
shed your something you just find the
program tap record it seems pretty
simple and very cool you share Julie
over-the-air programs to be recorded
using the tableau app when you plug in a
hard drive to the tableau box that's
where those programs get stored the app
basically serves as a kind of
sophisticated TV remote control so you
can see what's coming up set it to
record or you can play it back on your
phone tablet or computer so the
interface seems pretty slick and I think
this could be a really good way of
organizing and capturing some of the
great stuff that arrives free
over-the-air to your TV I'm Luke
