think is the CEOs role in maintaining
that kind of power broker status and you
know Adam you can take a cheap shop at
someone on the list if you'd like you
can go for it well just shouldn't say
that but tell us about Tim Cook and what
you think about him is the Apple expert
sure he's obviously the only non founder
on the list it's a it's a profound
deficiency a weakness at Apple that
their founder isn't on this list right
now so I've said that I think Tim Cook
will be a caretaker CEO until they until
Apple find somebody who is more like
Steve Jobs not another Steve Jobs with
someone with more of his characteristics
because Cook has very few of his
characteristics having said that I think
cook could be the caretaker for as long
as a decade which is the length of his
his options package currently do you
think that's a good good one do you
think it one of his most important goals
must be to keep the management team that
he has right yeah so I think that among
he has many many fine qualities among
them as he's a culture keeper if Steve
Jobs defined the culture of Apple tim
cook believes in the culture of Apple
and people believe in him they believe
that he loves apple that he will do
what's right for Apple he's an
unemotional person compared with jobs
he's highly intelligent highly competent
undoubtedly knows exactly what he's not
good at which is a it's a it's a humble
characteristic that a lot of people in
general don't have I think and will he
be able to keep the management team
together that's his that's one of his
top goals that management team has been
at Apple for every person on the team
with the exception of the new retail
chief will be joining shortly has been
at Apple at least since 2000 so the
really key question and they work as
hard as they can to keep us from finding
out the answer to this is who's the next
level down and how are they you've known
marked for probably five years at
Facebook what do you admire about him I
think he is probably so he
he's very admired for all kinds of
things i think he is under rated as a
CEO he is I forget how old he is now but
he's extremely 727 I did some statistics
here as disco elephants a car or average
age is 41 that's a very big deal he can
rent his own car but on think about what
there was a time when he when he
couldn't you saying when he was at
facebook after God for something to rent
a car at the good road so you can rent a
car yay but know what he's really done
is if you look back in the last eight
years he has assembled probably one of
the most magical teams in Silicon Valley
and you know to do that when you were in
your early 20s never had a job right
like never understood like never talk to
CFO never met anyone like Cheryl and and
he's upgraded right over the years and i
think that the ability as a young
gentleman who has no business experience
to find these people attract them
upgrade them if you need them to be
upgraded and like do that in an orderly
and organized and and and powerful
fashion is something that people just
under appreciate about him and he's at
that age i mean like having cheryl and
the CFO whose outstanding all lined up
is pretty impressive so you knew Larry
before he was CEO we hung out and I
think it's interesting to when you look
at this market to your point about the
importance of having a founders of CEO
because this chart is a little bit
misleading in that of course it was our
smit that was you know the CEO that
brought the company and really helped
the company grow over a ten-year period
and then Larry came up with the adult
supervision things I never learned you
don't like that I kind of like that cuz
I was in a few meetings it was pretty
yeah you decided that actively well what
tone how does Larry help set a culture
he was obviously there at the beginning
when Sir Ian Larry started the business
Eric wasn't around what about the
culture of google it you know is
reflected in Larry's personality I think
there's a couple of things
just of course the engineering driven
culture is is really important and I
also think that I'm just being able to
prioritize there was there was one
incident every Friday we had tgif so
everyone in the company was invited and
the founders were there and they would
ask questions you could ask anything he
wanted there was a big decision made and
that was to eliminate the gummy bears
from the cafeteria so someone did ask
about you know to the founders what
happened to the gummy bears and I
thought Larry's answer was great he's
like you know if that's our biggest
problem then we're in good shape so i
think that's on the part of the culture
it's just like you know having the right
tone being able to prioritize where the
gummy bears belong in the overall
strategy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
