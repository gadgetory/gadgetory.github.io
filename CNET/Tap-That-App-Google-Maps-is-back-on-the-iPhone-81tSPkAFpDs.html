I'm Jason Parker and this is the show we
check out the hottest apps in the mobile
space Google Maps is finally back on the
iPhone with a complete interface
redesign turn-by-turn directions with
Voice Street View and Google's mapping
accuracy it's the best navigation app
available on the device with this
version you get a search field at the
top to search for locations or addresses
the main map window and front and center
as you would expect and a tab in the
lower right that slides out so you can
choose layers here you can toggle
traffic public transit and satellite
views and you have a link to the Google
Earth app for 3d views and other
features you'll notice this is a
completely different design than the
version from iOS 5 and I think it looks
great one of the features people have
understandably missed from the old
Google Maps is Street View and
fortunately it's back in this version
just perform a search then swipe up from
the bottom and hit the Street View
button to get a look at your destination
in full swipeable 3d back on the search
results screen you can call save to
favorites or share the location but you
also can scroll down for reviews from
other people who have been there when
you want directions to your location
just tap the car icon in the lower right
on this screen Google Maps lists out
various routes you can take and
estimates your time of arrival even with
traffic you also have the old buttons at
the top to switch between directions by
car
public transit or walking directions
from here you can tap a route to see it
on the map or touch the bar at the
bottom to see directions listed out for
you but perhaps the most long-awaited
feature for Google Maps on the iPhone is
turn-by-turn directions with voice once
your address is entered all you have to
do is hit the start button in the lower
right with turn-by-turn Google Maps
switches into a sort of 3d view and
continues to give you directions as you
travel to your destination there's also
a button in the lower right where you
can go back to the step by step list or
mute the voice guidance last but not
least the latest version of Google Maps
lets you enter search terms to find
things around you just enter what you
want like burger for example and Google
Maps shows you nearby locations to get
hamburgers just like any other
destination
you can tap the car button in the
lower-right and you'll get directions to
your next unhealthy meal google maps is
free and available now at the app store
it's important to note it is iPhone only
on the iPad it doesn't look as good
obviously but it will get you there
either way if you want the power of
Google Maps back on your iPhone I
definitely recommend you tap this out
today
that's it for today's show but if you
have any suggestions send them to tap
that app at cnet.com I'm Jason Parker
