next big thing status seem quite as much
like magic or quite as unlikely as this
one depending on your point of view
here's a small example of how automakers
move at a pace more like electronics
using technologies like this 3d printer
to rapid prototype ideas today not next
week let me show you something now that
3d printer that we have here in the ERL
made this whole this machine was made
ready to go this wasn't assembled later
same goes for this chain it came out
this way that's amazing 3d printing
isn't just for the super geeks and
people making components for cars you
can use it to make everyday objects like
an iphone case this head deposits this
plastic material down here this print
surface prints up layer by layer until
you get a solid object at the end of it
so once you have the plan and load in
the software it tells a printer to print
out plastic in a series of layers
building gradually up until you get a
finished solid object this extruder head
moves here along the x-axis as well as
the z axis and then this build plate
moves up and down for the y-axis so it's
great about the replicator in particular
is that it can print the tutor from
color so it can either do that at the
same time making one object comprised in
two different colors or it can print say
one object and white one object in black
or can do those at the same time
depending on the file and the layout and
the very software settings yes we knew
that 3d printers had arrived two years
ago at the Consumer Electronics Show
when suddenly the printers were all at
or below two thousand dollars some quite
a bit below and the makers of them were
abandoning this idea that we were all
going to go out and learn CAD software
instead envisioning a sharing and buying
market of pre-done design files bottom
line is we are more a nation of buyers
than makers that's not a condemnation
it's just reality after a busy day week
or month of commuting working parenting
shopping and dealing with all your
connected life few of us have the time
or the inclination to come home and
design the perfect soup ladle let alone
produce the thing a great design is a
talent anyway it's more than just a
piece of hardware and software i watch
instead for 3d
printing to grow big in four areas above
the average consumer but well below the
large corporations who basically have
already discovered and embraced it first
prototyping this is where products can
leave the realm of a paper presentation
a PowerPoint of verbal discussion and
move to being tangible that's a big jump
that seems trivial but it's not early
prototypes could make the difference
between dying on the design page and
making it into early production second
is low volume products that are almost
personal in their low volume imagine
something as simple as a smart phone
case that is printed out that fits the
contours of your hand on up to a crown
ready at the dentist the same day not a
week later to a prosthetic that is
perhaps created during a medical
procedure for a perfect fit for the
patient from the very beginning third
simple software i mean so simple that
it's almost like expression more than
technology operation look at autodesk's
1 2 3 d catch object capture software
for example or see what the folks behind
the meta smart glasses are envisioning
where you would just use augmented
reality to shape your envisioned product
in space and then hand that design to
the printer forth more materials moving
from today's mono color plastics to
multicolored plastics metals and even
biological materials from the DNA level
all the way the printing synthetic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
