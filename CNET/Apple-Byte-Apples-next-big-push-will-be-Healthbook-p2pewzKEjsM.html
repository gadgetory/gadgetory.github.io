to the apple buy for everything good bad
inside the world of Apple let's get to
the show and there's more news about iOS
8 from nine to five Mac with the new
report showing off recreations of
screenshots from Apple's new health book
app that is the next area they're hoping
to reinvent in iOS 8 now it takes cues
from Apple's passbook app and the
internal versions of health book are
able to track several different health
and fitness data points like heart rate
hydration blood sugar sleep respiratory
rate and others that can be arranged by
the user now when you look at these
mock-ups it just can't be a phone that
gathers all this data thanks to the m7
chip steps miles walked and caloric data
can be tracked by the phone but things
like blood hydration and respiratory
stuff has to come from another source
like a wearable device not that one yeah
something more like this alright 9to5
mac also reports more possible iOS 8
tweets including a change to the
Notification Center to only include
today's events and notifications view
because honestly how many of you
actually even look at all three tabs
better interact communication yes that's
actually a word now we're apps can share
data like a third party photo editing
app being able to push content more
easily through Facebook or Instagram
there's also the potential that the
messages app will auto-delete a message
thread after a month or a year so that
it frees up more storage space and you
wouldn't believe how useful that could
be their sources also say game center
could just go away and be found inside
the actual games using the service and
car play which will initially only work
over a lightning table in iOS 7 is
testing versions in iOS 8 that will work
over Wi-Fi now sometimes what is old is
new again because every fad comes back
right well except for scrunchies but
apple recently reintroduced the 4th gen
ipad with only a 16gb model for 399
replacing the aging ipad 2 in a move
they should have done when the ipad air
was announced but really the most
pathetic part apple's press release
describing it as their most affordable
9.7 inch ipad with improved cameras and
enhanced performance over
the ipad 2 uh duh and that's a bad apple
but uh better late than never I guess
and in another lame duck move Apple
brings their least popular phone the
iphone 5c with an even smaller capacity
of eight gigs to only five markets
including the UK France Germany
Australia and China and it still costs
about 712 US dollars well the 16gb model
costs seven hundred and seventy nine
dollars now I'm not gonna say anything
because some of you Apple biters are
really sensitive when I keep it real
toss them out the big egg so I'm not
gonna say a thing except for bad apple
ah sorry guys couldn't help it and if
you do anything this year do not buy an
eight gig iphone 5c but before we go you
know um let's reflect on the iPad we
lost
microsoft making a cameo on the alpha
bite this week the long-rumored
microsoft office will officially launch
for the ipad on marks the 27th according
to the verge microsoft launched a
version for the iphone last year that
requires an office 365 subscription and
the ipad version will require the same
thing and you know what you can always
trust someone on twitter to post an
alleged screenshot of the software as
well and microsoft also recently
released its through digital notebook
app called one note on the mac app store
that can share info between platforms
and their iOS version of the app as well
now the app also allows for
collaboration like sharing notebooks and
real-time editing okay guys a lot of you
been asking me lately what does apples
product release cycle look like this
year you want to buy something but
you're not sure so I figured it would be
a good time to kind of give you a little
breakdown of what we foresee now this is
not a guarantee at all but based on past
trends and what we know today so my
first hunch based on reports Apple's
first new product release in 2014 should
be there Apple TV sometime in April not
March but April and it looks like it
will definitely be there set-top box and
not a TV TV well then my gut tells me
they'll use WWDC in June to set up the
announcement of iOS 8 and the new iPhone
6 along with the iWatch or the iWatch
will have its own event shortly after
that now the reason being is that iOS 8
is going to have a lot of data hooks
with some kind of wearable that we
talked about earlier and they can't just
talk about it and then ignore that
wearable the other factor is that this I
watch them a jigger thing is also going
to be dependent on the phone to exchange
data so the timing of all these
announcements for all three will be
relatively close together within a month
of each other but the actual launch
dates we separate you know to extend
that height now rumors say pegatron is
starting iphone 6 production earlier
than normal so I'm leaning towards an
earlier iphone 6 launch this year with
the iWatch to follow shortly after it
also macbook refreshes you guys ask
about that typically happen right before
the back-to-school season around the
July timeframe even though they were
late in 2013 and I'm leaning also
towards imax performance upgrades in sep
timber now iPads finally came out in
late October right before the holidays
in 2013 so expect that to be its time
slot for the foreseeable future and
again you guys this is just a rough
prediction if I'm wrong please remind me
at the end of the year and i'll let you
do my job all right let's get to our
giveaway thanks to my friends at design
by humans and their kick butt t-shirts
we're giving away five shirts to you the
Apple biters all you guys have to do is

week's show it's just that easy and
email me at the apple byte at cnet com

whole wide world next week plus we're
