Geneva Auto Show taking a look and what
I think is my favorite car of the show
the Koenigsegg bridge era now the
Koenigsegg is a small Swedish automaker
known for making really fast supercars
they actually call the mega cars and
this road era I think is the prettiest
one they've made what's that their cars
are like race cars for the road this one
actually looks a little more comfortable
than those other cars
it's got unique styling I think it got a
poles from the 1960s with these twin
humps behind the cabin it's a two seater
and there's a lot of lightweight
materials that go into it the body's
made of carbon fibre and Kevlar they
also use these carbon fiber wheels that
really bring the weight down it's got a
removable top so you can get some Sun
while you're driving and also has a big
wing on the back that deploys at speed
but the really unique thing about this
car is it's a gasoline-electric hybrid
and it puts out about 1500 horsepower
it's got a five liter v8 engine with
twin turbos that's good for 1,100
horsepower and it also has three
electric motors one of the drive shaft
one on each rear wheel and that gives
you torque vectoring as well it's going
to help the handling this is really one
amazing looking car and should be a
really amazing performing car as well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
