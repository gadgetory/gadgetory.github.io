Jason owl I'm Natali del Conte I'm
Hollywood and I'm Tom Merritt welcome to
buzz out loud seen its podcast of
indeterminate length episode 1033 our
first of two episodes today because we
have a couple of special guests with us
today as we have promoted federal CTO
Aneesh Chopra is joining us thank you
very much sir my pleasure thanks for
having me I appreciate you coming on the
show appreciate you sending us little
well wishes for a thousandth episode and
I know you have a busy schedule and so
we really appreciated you coming in and
taking some questions from us and the
audience yes sir also joining us from
craigslist Craig Newmark hey glad to be
here this is an issue show though I'm
just here is a kind of a camp follower
that's it we are we are very happy to
welcome you to buzz out loud like I said
we've got a bunch of questions so let's
get into it I'm gonna start with my own
which is just kind of the general
question your exact title as I
understand it is associate director for
technology of Science and Technology
Policy but they call you the federal CTO
and we have the federal CIO we have the
FCC we have the cyber czar who just
stepped down yesterday where do you fit
yeah all of this new technology focused
policy well thank you for asking the
question my title is actually more
complicated than that I'm actually
assistant to the president and chief
technology officer and associate
director the reason why that's relevant
is that the president had made it very
clear when he campaigned and as he
transitioned into the governing that we
as a nation need to harness the power
and potential of technology and
innovation across a wide range of
disciplines on healthcare on education
on our energy strategy so my role is to
provide both advice to the president on
how best to take advantage of the
capabilities but also to make sure that
we are incorporating near term
strategies inside the government that
will move the ball forward how do we
bring emerging capabilities into
Washington more thoughtfully and then
how closely do you work with federal CIO
Vivek Kundra on this and where you guys
differ well the vac is largely
responsible for the IT governance the
federal government spends nearly seventy
six billion dollars on IT and we have
within the Office of Management and
Budget a clear
for running that more effectively and
efficiently the vague is responsible for
making sure that we make the right
policy decisions on the consumption of
technology inside the government we work
together in what we're referring to as
our management c-suite we have a chief
Performance Officer we have a chief
technology officer a chief information
officer the three of us are essentially
working together to demonstrate how we
can make government more effective
incorporating new technologies running
what we do better and assigning
long-term outcomes goals so that we can
measure performance now with the cybers
are stepping down yesterday how are we
going to go about filling that role what
is the government looking for can you
comment a little bit about that I bill
me begin by saying Melissa Hathaway has
been a phenomenal resource to the
federal administration she's been
terrific on a personal level I'm sad to
see her stepping down but she's been
working 24 by 7 for the last several
months and I'm very supportive of
whatever she chose to do the president
has made this a top priority and
administration in May he announced that
significant strategy in this regard we
built in the White House essentially
three teams that will focus on this
issue a coordinator that makes sure that
we're getting the right policies done at
the long-term level but then to have two
other aspects of it I'm responsible for
our engagement with the private sector
namely around our critical
infrastructure banking energy healthcare
my colleague Vivek Kundra is responsible
for the use of principles of
cybersecurity in the federal government
itself so we as a team continue to move
forward it's unfortunate Melissa will
step down but we will hopefully have
named a new coordinator in the
not-too-distant future the work is
continuing to get done there are
operational issues as well as strategic
issues that will continue forward with
the team in her absence so where does
that put you in line for the presidency
Obama and then by to Jim Pelosi and then
where are you in this oh no where near
we are simply advisers to make sure that
we've got the right information to make
the best decision to the country all
right good to know all right let's move
on to the broadband infrastructure
because i know that's a hot topic Molly
you've got the question yeah i was just
up from a policy perspective obviously
i'm sure you can't tell us that you're
going forward with this but do you do
you feel and are their discussions about
at this point the digital divide and
whether internet access particularly
broadband internet access should be
a utility should be something that every
American needs in order to stay
competitive and is entitled to and is
that something that that the government
would consider you know regulating and
take it over well let me begin by saying
the president's been absolutely clear
that that broadband access for all
Americans is critical to our global
competitiveness I will be thoughtful and
saying that the regulatory question is
really one that the Congress is tasked
to the FCC which is essentially an
independent body we work very closely
with chairman Genachowski is a dear
friend and we are tasked together in
developing a national broadband plan
that is due in February of 2010 that is
led by chairman Genachowski and we are
contributing in a thoughtful way
following the rules that are set out
I'll make this observation there are my
focus in this area is that there's
essentially two themes that emerged one
is innovation in the supply that is how
do we bring lower-cost capabilities so
that all Americans can afford broadband
but there's also an equal interest if
not more so in my front my front on
driving innovation in the applications
space so the more we deliver better
applications that demonstrate value to
the American people I think the faster
we're going to see the closing of the
digital divide just take example cell
phone penetration has we have more cell
phones in this country per household
than washing machines so we're seeing a
 you know if the applications are
there and of you stand there going to be
adopted what what share of the global
Internet traffic is YouTube one
application what is it three to five
percent of the network traffic so if we
if we if we focus our efforts on
balancing driving more innovative
applications as well as bringing down
the cost of the supply we hope we can
make an impact well I got a phone that
has lots of great applications on it but
I can't use it half the time because I
have the access that that's just just
one carrier so you know and now yeah I
was that was going to be my following
basically do you feel like that access
is there that that access to internet to
internet that access to internet access
kill me well great is available to
people the way that it should be in that
they're you know you said you interface
with the private sector do you like that
competition is happening so that people
have the right options I I must say this
we are in a very interesting time pre
iPhone the average smartphone was still
majority voice traffic
I think it was something like seventy
percent of the traffic on them on the
smart phones were still voice iphone is
majority data and so we're starting to
see the cellphone market essentially as
a connectivity play to the Internet
where we thought about that years back
when when carriers invested in data
networks but now we're actually seeing
it it is in that context that we
celebrate chairman Genachowski 'he's
work recently to actually ask the
questions in that example of the recent
actions in apple with respect to their
their work with google voice these are
questions that need to be asked and we
celebrate the fact that we're doing it
our commitment to ensuring access to the
internet is not limited to the wired
world versus the wireless it's about the
broader question of how does one get
connected and I think if you look at
continued innovation you know everything
in the home is going to be connected to
the Internet my new TV that I bought
thanks to the cnet how-to videos has a
connection so is that an Internet access
to a device and how does it allow for
competition these are great questions
we're going to be grappling with and one
of the things we talked about on buzz
out loud a lot is the fact that the
United States has consistently ranked
low as far as broadband penetration
broadband access what what can we do do
we know what we can do yet to boost that
up to get us up there in the top five
where people are not frustrated all the
time oh my internet went out or I don't
have enough bandwidth all that sort of
thing well the first question is does
this nation have a broadband strategy
all the other countries in the world
that are serious about this issue have
and we should have done this years ago
so I applaud the Congress obviously the
president's been calling for this we
will buy februari 2010 have a framework
that allows us to get into this question
unless focused on the benchmarking of
broadband penetration because you might
we might quibble about the per capita
designation and whether that's an
accurate way of measuring widespread
adoption and I'm more interested in are
we using the technology to deliver value
to society is it helpful to us in our
personal lives is that advancing our
healthcare agenda our educational
strategy and so forth I'm focused on the
verb as much as I am the noun which is
do we in fact have someone buying a
particular connection the verb part is
what occupying my time to what end are
we using that
and are there policy barriers that we
need to get out of the way to drive more
usage that's the focus it seems like
standardization is such a barrier to
policy right now and it seems like the
EU has their act together in terms of
standing standardizing especially the
mobile market all the way down to just
standardized chargers where are we I you
guys that was listed your episode about
the Japanese chargers that that was
maybe a month ago yeah charger haha come
on all the cards that I have a battle
are something listen I I from my vantage
point in terms of the role that I play
engaging on standards is clearly one of
the leverage points to make an impact up
there there's obviously a desire to
continue the the innovation the spirit
of innovation in this country to drive a
private usage but my where appropriate
we will try to bring people together and
collaborate in the adoption of of
standards we're doing this in healthcare
IT we're doing this in the energy grid
we want to continue to push you raise
the right questions natalie uh it's one
that's been on a personal level baffling
why are we having a tough time but
there's thoughtful reasons as to where
we are and how we got here the National
Broadband Plan by the FCC will help us
get real deep on that that issue okay
well you mentioned healthcare let's move
on to our next question we have coming
from dr. Carl he wants to know about
your previous mentioning of health IT is
a top priority he says as a doctor the
effective rolling out of the cohesive
EMR system is something we have all been
keeping an eye on as the utter lack of
cohesion even within hospitals is
readily apparent to that effect do you
plan on supporting the distribution of a
single EMR system countrywide if so
would you recommend the current VA lis
system or would you support a private
efforts such as Google's with such
integration be mandatory or voluntary if
mandated what kind of timeline seems
feasible so we'll leave it at that cuz
that's like six questions everyone what
a powerful policy of our by the way
electronic medical record yes yes but
that let me begin by saying this we have
a more fundamental challenge in our
healthcare system that is we reward the
sickness and the response to sickness
and the president's been absolutely
clear that we need to focus our policy
priorities are on prevention and
wellness
this is an important question before we
get into the purpose of health IT
because again if you think about the
noun versus the verb analogy we have
nouns you can go to the store buy some
software and show me a receipt and says
see I bought something but to what end
am I using it today most physicians and
hospitals use technology to improve
billing to be very frank they're not in
scented to use it to communicate with
patients to keep them healthy how many
physicians get paid today by keeping you
healthy with an e visit this is not part
of our policy framework so it's obvious
therefore there hasn't been as much
product innovation to support the market
because the market doesn't really know
what it wants the technology to do the
president's been so clear we will shift
the focus to wellness and prevention
through health reform that if we're
successful in that vision I'm confident
there will be a widespread activity on
innovation for new products and better
products because that's what people are
going to want if Eve is 'it's are part
of our strategy going forward and other
related examples you're going to see
people saying how can I proactively text
message you to make sure that you're if
you're a pregnant mom and we're worried
about the infant mortality rate in this
country we might text message you more
frequently to make sure you're doing the
right things to keep your child in the
womb healthy that's a different world
today and so that's what I'm hoping for
driving product innovation around the
health care outcomes goals that our
presidents been so clear about and then
are you the person that has to deal with
the weather hippo will allow a doctor
now to text messages or you can email
about those things there's a huge I mean
it seems like there's a huge policy
barrier to communication this now that
you know I've literally had
conversations with my with some doctors
about how I want to email with them yeah
and they say HIPAA prevents me yes from
a Latin from ever emailing you anything
and you know I mean I think there's some
pretty so big policy challenges you have
to overcome before you can even get to
take this is precisely why the Congress
and the president have set up a health
IT policy committee I have the honor of
serving on the standards body but that
addresses this issue and embedding
security and privacy principles which
really are the byproduct of why we had
the HIPAA legislation the first eyes are
key to getting this right we're going to
be engaging on this issue between now
and the fall there's a term you may not
be as aware of but the two words that
are going to
drive healthcare IT moving forward or
meaningful use what that means is that
the Congress is set aside billions of
dollars to help physicians adopt
technology if they become meaningful
users of the technology to improve
healthcare so the debate right now is
when we regulate the definition of
Meaningful Use will security and privacy
provisions be incorporated and if so how
that is a regulatory review process will
comment on that as that process unfolds
this fall and into the winter all right
let's move on to something that probably
is a little more in the FCC's bailiwick
but here you are Ken Whisenhunt to ask
you this well I understand the FCC is
currently investigating wireless open
access and handset exclusivity and that
it may not be appropriate to comment on
these investigations my question mr.
Chopra is how does the Obama
administration view net neutrality with
regard to the mobile product and service
space in general and you believe that it
is the role of government agencies such
as the FCC and FTC to regulate mobile
application stores like the App Store to
ensure equal footing for developers and
promote consumer choice uh let me take
the second question first I go to the
first I do not envision the federal
government regulating uh the App Store
it is not a network carrier and we want
you to bring google voice back into the
apps having said that i don't think
that's uh no appreciate the sentiment
but the broader question is a very
thoughtful one the president has been
absolutely clear that in this country we
have benefited greatly from the openness
of the Internet in fact when we
announced our cybersecurity strategy the
president said that we have benefited
greatly and that our efforts to protect
the nation's private networks will be
driven by more collaboration and less
government control and ownership so
we've been very clear on these
principles in fact the funding
announcement that went out on our
broadband stimulus grants have embedded
these principles in how people apply for
the grants that is that there should be
non-discrimination principles as well as
interconnection features so we've been
very clear in the in the past on these
issues whether it's wireless or wireline
I said to you earlier the point is the
outcome connection to the Internet and
so I would presume as we unfold our
frame
work for these issues that whether it's
wireless or wireline we will basically
think of the internet as a tool however
you access it and ensure that our
principles of openness and innovation
will continue as core foundations moving
forward do you think that the best way
for us to get a good open end-to-end
internet is is through some legislation
or through fostering competition you
know it's a great question and I know
that the congressional folks can have
constantly engaged on this in fact a
bill recently was dropped on the same
issue my focus is on the here and the
now which is how do we spur through
collaboration the kind of innovation
we're looking for and again if we
there's some basic building blocks of
innovation right having a secure and
smart network infrastructure is critical
to achieving our goals in banking and
health care you name it so I'm working
very closely with the private sector to
see how we might work together in fact a
week after the president called on our
cybersecurity framework i joined Melissa
who just made the announcement we
visited New York City and met with 20 or
so of the most senior researchers in the
banking sectors IT together we could
collaborate on cybersecurity and it'll
be supportive of the network carriers
that is working together to find find
solutions this doesn't always have to be
through legislation or through
regulatory frameworks we could get there
if we work hard on it plus I just want
to have more choices I mean that that's
that's the biggest thing how do we
arrive at that where I'm not stuck
between well it's either cable or dsl
and that's all I got or worse I'm in the
middle of nowhere and it's dial-up
period yeah you know or maybe some
terrible kind of satellite broadband
thing I tell you this is one of the key
reasons why the question of unserved and
underserved has been the thrust of our
modest investments in the broadband
infrastructure today having come from
Virginia we most certainly saw the
impact on our rural communities I would
argue that if you live in rural America
today access to broadband is not if not
number one is number two on your
priority set to be competitive in the
global marketplace all right speaking of
technology and connectivity I have a
question about education and this is a
good one for you since you pioneered the
Virginia e-text
what is the real picture and this
actually comes from me not from a viewer
what's the real picture in terms of
public education and technologies and do
most schools have technology that will
actually prepare them for the workforce
because for most people connectivity is
still sort of a matter of convenience
but for students connectivity is
imperative for their chances at upward
mobility so how much do you work with
the educational system very closely had
the honor of testifying in Congress on
the future of learning my main theme was
that we have to think of the educational
space the way Congress it on health care
which is it's about the meaningful use
of technology I must tell you how
disappointing it is when I go to visit a
school that's adopted a laptop per child
program but then turns off every feature
of the machine that would be useful for
them in the real world because of
concerns so the the challenge for us
natalie is that we have investments in
technology in fact the president has an
economic stimulus plan 650 million
dollars in funding to support the
adoption of Technology in our in our
schools the jet the challenges are we
doing him for the right reasons into
pursuing the right ends I am working
very closely with the president's team
in education and most specifically Jim
Shelton who runs the office of
innovation to coordinate a plan for
education technology moving forward and
more importantly to experiment you know
a lot of what I do and we're going to
engage on in this first half of this
discussion has been really about kind of
policy goals but I keep myself at night
worrying about the other half of the
equation what do I deliver in 30 days 60
days 90 days so not everything requires
a law or a policy change we can deliver
and demonstrate value in here in the now
and it is that spirit that is pushing me
to think of questions like education
technology what what does the fall look
like when god forbid h1n1 returns in a
manner that puts children out of school
for an extended period of time we're
actively engaged on the question what is
the alternative and how does technology
play a role to make sure that we get
those kids still continued to learn
there's a continuity of learning plan if
you will we're focused on these issues
because we have to and that doesn't wait
for new laws and policy and are you
are you literally in a position to send
guidance to America's schools and say
like look the way you're managing
technology operations at these schools
is absolutely ludicrous and you're
keeping kids act logical dark ages
because it I mean the emails that we get
from from kids in school today are just
ridiculous they may as well be using the
same sort of word processor terminals
that i was using because they like you
said they have been so the machinery
itself the functionality has been so
crippled that you know kids are getting
kicked out of school for taking a USB
stick from one computer to the next you
know it's uh can you just email them
yeah that and not not so much but but
but we are we Jim Shelton I did speak at
the education technologies conference
just a few weeks back and we hit home
this message you know we have to be
respectful of our federalism our system
of federalism which is that schools are
largely governed by local districts they
make the decisions states play a role
and the feds do a little bit in terms of
funding in the No Child Left Behind
provision so working in that ecosystem
and finding the right leverage points to
engage obviously key part we're in the
middle of the national education
technology plan effort these issues are
going to come right up moving on to
social networking and of course cyber
security which were sort of dancing
around what is the what is the
administration's guidance on balancing
this question comes from cyber man 375
my cyber man what is the
administration's guidance on balancing
the emerging capabilities of social
networking and the security constraints
um you seem to be easy such as banning
the use of peer-to-peer file sharing and
government computers others such as
restricting the use of Twitter would
remove what is becoming an important
tool for policy makers to communicate
directly to people so given that using
Twitter Facebook and and the like put
some security and operational readiness
concepts concerns into non government
hands how seriously can the government
afford to move services into depending
on social networking as a major form of
communication about the role of a CTO
and the CIO we collaborate on how we
bring emerging technologies into
government itself I mean I must say one
of the more frustrating aspects of
visiting in Washington when I when I
took the role was just to see how
limited we are in the use of technology
in our personal professional lives
meaning my bandwidth was extraordinarily
I had better bandwidth
my iphone to be very frank even though
you struggle that right here uh well
tells you how sad it was in Washington
it's getting a little bit better but uh
the reason there is anxiety is that
there's not a lot of upside for folks
who adopt these technologies today Craig
Craig has been a real champion to
inspire the web managers in Washington
they don't get a lot of attaboys and at
a girls for adopting these technologies
if they have one incident that that
jeopardizes one of our policy goals the
downside way out outsize is the upside
our job is to provide a safe place for
the agencies to adopt these technologies
so we're not ready to announce it yet
but you can rest assured that the CIO
and I are working closely at
provisioning secure access to these web
two point O capability so that they can
be thoughtfully used and be respectful
of our true restrictions on on security
well I guess the other question to that
end is do you see them as as truly
useful I mean on the one hand they're
wonderful tools for communication for
real-time communication on the other
hand you know they're havens for trolls
and script kiddies I mean is it like do
you think that you will get to the point
that some celebrities have gotten to
Twitter where you say you know what we
don't this isn't worth our time actually
and that's what the US Marines just
decided this week that they've put a
one-year ban on any social networking
any marine you know it's a fascinating
question again noun verb the noun is
whether or not you open up a Twitter
account ok in and of itself doesn't
really do anything it's nice to do it's
not a nut must do but if you think about
the verb I'm going to tell you one story
again in the spirit of delivering value
in the here and the now the president on
jun 25th announced that myself the CIO
and our chief Performance Officer are
partnering with the Citizenship and
Immigration Service why in 90 days we're
going to turn that agency around and
make it more customer friendly for the
first time we will allow you like Burger
King to have an information update on
your application your way would you like
a text message alert would you like an
email would you like to visit online and
be able to check where you are in the
queue and then to benchmark how long you
have to wait in that queue against
others in the same category
and then to demonstrate how one field
office compares to the other this is a
sea change in thinking in 90 days with
no incremental budget we're going to
turn on a more citizen facing capability
using emerging I mean text messaging you
might think of as yesterday but from our
standpoint Wow do you how many people
are scared waiting when they apply for
for immigration not knowing what to do
they call their congressmen to ask on
their behalf they hire lawyers to just
ask basic questions to have us be public
and available in that information it's
using the technology in a verb to
demonstrate meaningful value against a
policy objective a final question
because we know you've got to get out of
here you've got a busy day ahead of you
Kevin Dupuis on Twitter asked with the
huge deficit why doesn't the federal
government switch to proven open-source
tech lyk soos or red hat instead of
windows the big fat question I defer to
the chief information officer who
regulates our 76 billion dollars in
spend of which they told him about it
that you were like hey there's all the
servants are stuck I'll make one one one
small comment about open source and I'll
move on as a policy priority for me I
care much more about the principles of
open collaboration and the sharing of
intellectual property as we build value
so what does that mean if I'm buying a
house and I want to develop a mortgage
calculator to help me figure out what to
do you might as a neighbor of mine build
one on excel but you'll share it with me
I don't care if Excel is the proprietary
platform upon which you wrote that
intellectual property I care that you
shared the mortgage calculator too
little in government is shared
intellectual property from agency A to B
and that's my policy priority that can
be embracing the spirit of open
collaboration on a proprietary stack
like Oracle or Microsoft but it could
also be introducing open source you
could use openoffice to share your
markup haha you know any of that but I
will I appreciate the sentiment but that
open collaboration and sharing of
intellectual property in advance of
public policies a priority for me Craig
we haven't let you get a word in
edgewise do you do you want to throw out
something ask a question before we close
it Hanley rapido pretty much what I just
do is bear witness there's a lot of good
people in Washington doing a lot of good
work right now
and hardly anyone knows about it we now
have leadership which is committed to
serving the public well there's a lot of
line workers and web and related
technology who are ready to go and oddly
enough they're actually getting stuff
done already and you know the best thing
I can do is bear witness to it well
thanks very much for coming along anish
thank you so much for totally when I
asked my digital voting question don't
go please this is my one big question
that I want is will we ever be able to
vote reliably and securely online you
know there are there are committees
right now looking at that question and
I've been asked to be engaged on the
issue so I will I will dig deeper but
the use of technology to improve our
voting experience we did in Virginia we
partnered with the Pew Charitable Trust
in Google through the voting information
project to make accessible the
