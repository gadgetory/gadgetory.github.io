a first look preview at the canon g1x
mark - now canon has had one previous
attempt at the large sensor g series
advanced compact camera it's a bit of a
mouthful but this one is the mark ii and
it follows up on the previous g1 ex that
came out a couple of years ago the body
design is totally different unlike the
large very tall G Series g1 ex that came
before this one is much more shaped like
a traditional compact camera obviously a
little bit bigger as you can see it fits
in my hand but it's still quite hefty
and definitely nice and pleasing to hold
now depending on what market you're in
around the world you'll either get the
option of an included external grip to
make this configuration a little bit
chunkier and easier to hold or you're
just going to have the standard grip
configuration like so around the lens
are two rings the one at the front is
just a standard manual focus ring and it
moves smoothly and freely you can also
use expanded focus on the back of the
screen to see more precisely what you're
focusing on the one at the back however
is much more interesting this is a
full-on aperture ring it moves in one
third stops so it clicks really nicely
between each of your stops and it can
also double when you're in manual
exposure mode as your shutter exposure
ring so you just need to press the
exposure compensation button on the back
of the g1 x mark - and then it flicks
between either parameter if you're in
manual exposure mode at the back use a
giant LCD screen and also now totally
flips up 180 degrees now even though the
market for the g1 X Mark - I'm pretty
sure it's not the selfie crowd it's
still pretty useful to have nonetheless
and it can also tilt back and pivot on a
hinge like so which is really useful for
some covert street photography if that's
your particular style it's nice and
bright high resolution 1.04 million dots
it's also a touchscreen so you can get
up close and personal with your images
there's a pop-up flash included - at the
top on the mode dial is a bunch of
custom modes there's also a dedicated
movie mode full PASM exposure control
full automatic mode scene modes I could
go on but you can find out more about
those particular
over on CNET also the new thing about
the g1x mark 2 is NFC and Wi-Fi
connectivity so if you want to pair it
with an Android phone really quickly
it's very simple although you can go to
the straight Wi-Fi manual setup if
you're on another operating system one
nice thing about the g1 X is if you're
shooting say for example in raw and JPEG
mode and you want to delete a particular
shot you've just taken the menu will
actually give you the option to delete
just the JPEG just the raw or both the
raw and JPEG which is a really nice
touch when it comes to video recording
it's pretty standard on the g1 X Mark 2
it's 1080 30 papes there is no external
microphone input unfortunately so you
have to make do with the onboard mic and
there is no optical viewfinder now this
was a big selling point of the g1 X now
as you move to the g1 X Mark - it's an
electronic viewfinder which is a
separate extra purchase however I'm
pretty sure if you're the target market
for this camera you're definitely going
to want to buy that extra electronic
viewfinder this is being a hands-on
first look at the canon g1x mark - make
sure to stay tuned to see net for the
full review pretty shortly I'm Lexie
