carrier we are we hold in this world of
reality we believe everybody every
verizon every AT&amp;amp;T customer should cheat
on their carrier and enjoy every minute
of it so what we've done is partnering
with Apple which we're very proud of
anybody can for seven days get a fully
loaded iphone 5s with an unlimited data
plan and you can test drive our network
and then simply return it to a store and
it is zero cost no down payment and
it'll be fantastic to see and by the way
very importantly we also found out that
an unbelievable low percentage of
Americans actually know that t-mobile
carries the iphone so if you want to
test drive an iphone 5s this is here for
you as well and the way it works is
pretty simple I was I thought to myself
let me make a slide the layout the
process that people should follow so
that people will get this at the press
conference and then I made the slide and
I thought to myself well I don't really
think that was it was probably necessary
but it works like this you go to tmobile
com you order your phone what we're
going to do is get your name and address
so we can ship it to you it comes in
about two days we're going to take your
credit card number we're not going to
charge you all we're going to do is make
sure the shipping address matches the
billing address and we're going to make
sure the credit card number is good you
pay nothing there's no deposit there's
no payment we send you an iPhone 5s or
whatever is the latest and greatest
iPhone and then you take it for a spin
bang on our network for a week have a
ball take it for a seven night stand
cheat on your carrier and then bring it
back that's it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
