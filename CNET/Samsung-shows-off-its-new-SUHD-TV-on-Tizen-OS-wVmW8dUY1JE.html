of s UHD this new era starts without
groundbreaking 88 inch Jay s 9500
Samsung's first su HDTV
this is s UHD it takes picture quality
to a whole new level with Samsung's
latest display technology and the SU HD
remastering engine the SU HD display is
made from Samsung's proprietary nano
crystal semiconductors they are tiny
energy efficient and transmit different
colors of light depending on their size
this delivers the highest color purity
and light efficiency available today our
su HD is also two-and-a-half times
brighter than conventional TVs and has
deeper blacks which deliver unrivaled
contrast its spectacular color
technology gives viewers 64 times the
color expression of conventional TVs and
twice the color adjustment points for
the most accurate color display an su HD
displays the finest details not only for
native 4k Ultra HD content but for any
video source we achieve this unrivaled
quality through a combination of
innovative hardware and ground wiping
software that's why s UHD will help
Hollywood make their movies look as
great in your home as on the big screen
now the TV experience starts with
picture quality but design is a big part
of it our su HD TVs are no exception we
are taking our cues from contemporary
art and architecture and when you look
at our s UHD TVs you'll see many modern
and minimalist touches let's start with
the new bezel which adds even more depth
to the curved screen the arrival of the
curved screen makes design important for
all of the TV
so Samsung ensures your curve TV looks
stylish from any angle so let me turn
over the stage to Samsung's executive
vice president for service business mr.
wanjin Lee so here's the news from this
year all Samsung Smart TVs including our
su HDTV will be powered by the Tizen
operating system Tizen is based on web
standards which means it's faster and
easier to use and users can enjoy more
of the content they love Tizen is also
the backbone of our 2015 Smart TV hub
we've upgraded the first screen menu
which really simplifies the Smart TV
experience whether you control your TV
with the remote voice or gestures and
our new Smart TV is great for modern
homes because Samsung Quick Connect
Instant links up devices to your TV
let's say you're watching a movie on
your Galaxy phone during the commute
home at the press of a button you can
continue watching on your Smart TV and
the Smart TV offers easy and seamless
navigation across videos games and the
web giving you more choices than ever on
the TV screen
we know consumers are using a tablet or
mobile device when viewing TV with many
searching for information related to
what they're watching we are now
bringing the second screen experience to
the main screen so when you're watching
football or basketball Samsung Sports
live gives you near real-time stats
about the team and the players so you
won't have to miss a single play Samsung
Smart TV offers total entertainment of
course including games we have a broad
range of games from casual to advanced
new in our lineup PlayStation now allows
you to stream blockbuster games without
a console and with milk video arriving
on our Smart TVs even more premium
content is coming it's just another
example of how we are confusing
technology content and services to offer
our consumers great and compelling
experiences</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
