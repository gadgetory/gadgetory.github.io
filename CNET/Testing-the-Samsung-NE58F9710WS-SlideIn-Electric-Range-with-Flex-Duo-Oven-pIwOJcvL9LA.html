today we're going to be taking a closer
look at the Samsung any five eight f 9 7
1 0 WS electric range with Flex duo this
range retails for twenty two ninety nine
which is expensive given that you can go
to your local Home Depot or Lowe's and
buy a basic electric range for just
under four hundred dollars but Samsung
is definitely swinging for the fences
with this one and targeting more of a
luxury market slide and ranges are
relatively new to the category and
they're designed to fit flush against
and on top of your countertop so that
this cooktop sits and looks integrated
with your counters and your cabinets
given that it's a slide in the control
panel migrates from the back of the
appliance to the front this brings us to
what I think is perhaps one of the most
elegant features about this range which
is this really gorgeous touchscreen
samsung has given you all of the options
that you need without any superfluous
buttons cluttering up the interface this
is a glass ceramic cooktop it's black in
color it's got a really sleek appearance
and Samsung's loaded it with a lot of
features that going back to that
original price point may prove to give
you some of that bang for your buck that
you're looking for for instance it's got
two smaller burners that join together
to form a bridge bridges are becoming
increasingly more popular but they're
not the norm by any means another nice
feature that we're seeing more of that
Samsung has placed on this cooktop is
this triple burner they give you options
to use a small pan a medium pan or a
large pot but where Samsung really hits
it out of the park is with the Flex duo
technology inside the oven what Samsung
has done to make this space truly
functional and compete with other brands
who are moving into putting double ovens
in a range is to give you this really
clever flex duo divider with the divider
in place the range turns the single
large cavity oven into to individually
operated ovens to test the Flex duo we
wanted to cook foods that required two
different cooking temperatures in each
cavity to assess how well the oven did
at keeping those temperatures separate
without leaking
heat from the top to the bottom or vice
versa we baked cookies in the top oven
at 350 degrees and we baked a cast-iron
French bread in the bottom oven at 450
degrees I'm happy to report that with
the Flex duo divider in place this
Samsung range performed exactly as we
would have hoped and baked cookies that
were good as good as I've had in any
other oven and the bread turned out
really well
I attribute a lot of this success to the
fact that Samsung has given you to
convection fans in this oven so that
when the oven is being used without the
divider as just a single cavity you're
getting all the benefits of convection
but they also don't sacrifice that when
you want to use the divider giving you
two individual convection ovens Samsung
is definitely swinging for the fences
with this range but if the specs speak
to you and you really like the look of
this oven as well as its great
performance in all of our tests it might
be worth the money thanks for watching
