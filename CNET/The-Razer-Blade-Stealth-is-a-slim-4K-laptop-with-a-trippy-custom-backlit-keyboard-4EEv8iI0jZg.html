a lot like a gaming laptop it's got a
cool backlit keyboard it's from Razer a
company that makes gaming PCs and gaming
PC accessories but it's actually a 12.5
inch super thin super light ultra
portable you'd kind of compare to 13
inch laptops like the MacBook Air the
Dell XPS 13 or the Lenovo yoga 900 it's
even a better value than any of those
let me explain
let's say you want to get the most
laptop possible while spending that
magical price of 999 dollars for that
much you could get a 13-inch MacBook Air
you get a Dell XPS 13 or you can get the
base model razor blade stealth and these
two guys you get an Intel Core i5 CPU
over here you're actually going to get a
low voltage core i7 four gigs of ram 128
of storage over here a little bit more 8
128 over here you get the same 8 128 so
that's pretty good screen resolution
that's actually a big deal 1440 by 900
here kind of low we're go full HD 1920
by 1080 here over here 2560 by 1440 and
of course you can pay more and get that
4k upgrade as well and not a touchscreen
not a touchscreen over here every model
is a touchscreen and of course the most
fun thing about it is that cool backlit
chroma keyboard you can set it to just
cycle through the spectrum one color at
a time in a very subtle way like this if
you want something that's a little more
interactive there's a preset called
ripple and every key that you press
gives you a little explosion coming out
for the key or if you want to just show
off what the keyboard can do just turn
on wave and sit back for a while
watch people's eyes glaze over the
version I'm holding right here is
actually the step up model it's $13.99
for that you get the 4k display and 256
gigs of storage and it plays 4k video
just fine it's not a gaming machine but
you can do some very basic gaming on it
if you're interested in gaming this guy
actually has a sister device a companion
piece called the Razer core that's
supposedly going to come out later this
year it's a standalone box that you put
your own graphics card into connects via
USB C and turns this from an ultrabook
into an ultrabook style
a machine but you're going to have to
wait for that and buy that separately</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
