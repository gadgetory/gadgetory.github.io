want to ruin the whole bottle or even
thinks they have a fully automatic
solution and this is it the Corbett
model 11th department claims that you
can take out as much wine out of any
bottle without damaging the taste of the
wine in that bottle
here's how this thing actually works you
take the device we put it on top of a
bottle of wine then you plunge in a
needle that goes through the cork
without damaging the cork actually then
you just simply pour pour as much as you
want and then drink up these capsules
contain argon which is pushed into the
bottle as you're a foreign which means
air is not getting in contact with that
wife taking pushed out by that gas these
capsules cost about 8 bucks apiece
removing the device is pretty simple
just pull up the top and it's all set
company says because corks are elastic
what's going to happen is the cork is
going to reseal and it won't have wine
it tastes funny what device isn't
complete without bluetooth and you know
this device has bluetooth because the
app lets you know because there's an app
lets you know how much gas is left in
the capsule also you have the ability to
pair your wine to your mood so if you
wanted Mexican food and stranger things
here's a suggestion for your wine the
Corvin model 11 because it's fully
automatic plus nine hundred and ninety
nine dollars and
85 cents it shifts in September Maya's
actor and this has been the core of in
model 11</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
