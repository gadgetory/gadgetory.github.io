soundbar the beam at an event in San
Francisco and based on the features
alone it could be the company's best AV
product yet the biggest draw card is the
integrated voice assistant which
features Amazon Alexa and the promise of
Google assistant later Cerner says it
has improved the microphone array from
the company's earlier one speaker like
that product the beam can operate
exactly like an echo and let you operate
your music or movies with voice alone a
speaker is airplay - compatible which
means you can group it with a home pod
for multi room music and you can even
ask Siri using your phone to play music
on the beam the product is about half
the size of the play bar at 25 inches
wide but offers similar technologies
including three audio channels with the
center and beamforming for bouncing
sound off your walls as there's no
subwoofer the speaker offers a series of
passive radiators in order to boost bass
response the solos also includes an HDMI
port which is a first for the company
but if you have a TV with an optical
port there will be an optical to HDMI
adapter in the box the speak all support
Dolby Digital decoding but sadly not
Atmos as there's no up firing speakers
if you want to expand the system you can
also add a pair of son√≠s ones for
example as rears and the subwoofer if
you want more bass I had to listen to
the Sonos beam and found it offers the
same super wide sound to the play bass
and play bar dialogue in particular
sounded super crisp
however as you'd expect from the small
size of the unit it wasn't a lot of bass
the sunnahs pin will be available
worldwide on July 17 the $399 $399
Australian with support for more
standards than before in addition to
multiple voice assistance the Silas Beam
could be the smart sound bar to beat for
the money</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
