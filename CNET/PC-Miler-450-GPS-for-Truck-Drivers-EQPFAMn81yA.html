good deal of time on the road every week
testing the latest cars GPS devices and
in-car gadgets but you know who puts us
a shame when it comes to Ross seat time
truckers isn't it about time somebody
designed some car Tech specifically for
these masters of the road enter the PC
miler navigator 450 GPS for truck
drivers the PC miler looks like your
average consumer GPS device it's got a
4.3 inch touchscreen a mini USB
connection for charging and an SD card
slot for loading data and maps going a
step further this unit also features a
headphone jack and the TMC antenna input
for an external traffic receiver there
is also an input for the included
magnetic external GPS antenna that
increases positioning accuracy when the
units mounted in a compromised position
of course there's also the internal GPS
antenna if you don't want to fool around
with rudder and the cable for this guy
powering up the PC Milo reveals that
this is no typical in-car navigator
running a version of the co-pilot
eight navigation software that's
specific to trucks the PC miler has a
host of features that make it useful to
big rig drivers users can input the
height length width weight and weight
per axle of their truck to receive truck
specific routings users can also save
multiple routing profiles to hold these
presets for later retrieval presumably
after inputting this data the PC miler
won't try to send you under low
overpasses or across bridges that won't
support your payloads weight the unit
also features state mileage logs which
is quite useful for independent
operators for billing purposes the
co-pilot software is very flexible with
routing presets for automobiles
motorcycles bicycles and RVs as well as
walking directions so you can even use
the PC miler outside of your truck
however there are a few things that we
don't really like about it from a thumb
or standpoint the copilot software can
be a bit too complex and tricky to use
one adjust the volume good luck finding
that on your first attempt the hardware
also suffers from a tricky car cradle
that makes it difficult to adjust
and tricky to connect the external GPS
antenna so do the advantages of the
truck specific hardware and software
outweigh our nitpicks about the
interface and cradle designs
check out the full review at cnet.com to
find out I'm Antoine Goodwin this has
been your first look at the PC miler 450
GPF force runners</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
