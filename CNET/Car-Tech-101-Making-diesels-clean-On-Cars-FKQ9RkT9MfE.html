noticeably filthy automotive diesel
engines went in for a big makeover over
the last couple of decades the common
rail injection is a form of fuel
injection that can spritz diesel into
the cylinders at very high psi and very
precisely controlled bursts that kind of
control of the amount of fuel and how
often it sprays into the cylinder
combined with turbo charging
revolutionize both the power output and
co2 emissions coming out of diesel
engines starting in the late 90s around
2006 ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel became
the norm in the UK Europe and us it
reduced the dirty sulphur content in
diesel fuel from 500 parts per million
to 15 taking that out reduces the energy
content in a gallon of fuel slightly but
primarily sets the stage for a key pair
of cleaning technologies to kick in
selective catalytic reduction puts a
special catalytic converter in a diesel
cars exhaust system inside that can is
sprayed a mist of urea fluid that
combines with heat and the special metal
surfaces in the catalytic converter for
a reaction that scrubs diesel emissions
way down in several key areas the
downside of SCR is that you have to add
this expensive plumbing to the car's
underside and refill the card supply of
urea fluid from time to time typically
at 10 to 15,000 mile intervals some
dealers will do it for you as a courtesy
during routine service or you can do it
yourself with a bottle of the stuff from
Amazon or an auto parts store it's like
adding washer fluid but it's one more
thing to fiddle with the TV we love
right about now we should have smelled
something fishy VW is meeting stringent
new u.s. diesel emission standards from
2009 on without SCR on most of its
diesels which seemed like a trick no
other car maker could pull off as we now
know they weren't pulling it off either
these events are deeply troubling
retrofitting one of these bulky complex
scr exhaust systems and urea tank to the
affected TDI VW s and Audi's out there
is one way VW may have to address the
current cars that are on the road and
violating emissions standards
but what if diesel exhaust could be
cleaned up before it's even exhaust
that's what they're working on at the
Oak Ridge National Labs where they're
developing diesel engine tech that
injects fuel into the cylinder early in
the combustion cycle something which
almost defies the definition of a diesel
that along with a new breed of sensors
to manage the fuel timing precisely
based on nuanced real-time measurement
of cylinder pressure could be a big
break for the diesel engine is by its
nature a dirty beast but it's fuel
flexibility lovely torque and high MPG
keep it an important player in
combustion auto engines even if keeping
it there requires a constant stream of
new cleaning tech or car tech
