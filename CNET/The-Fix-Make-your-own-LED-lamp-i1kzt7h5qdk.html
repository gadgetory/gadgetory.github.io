the one that you make yourself for a
gift that anyone will enjoy but takes a
bit of nerdy electronic skill to make
I'm going to show you how to make your
own candle flicker LED tilt lamp this is
based off of David backers design for
the dry lamp eeeh from my version we're
going to use a glass jar some copper
wire some stranded wire a candle flicker
LED see our 2032 watch battery watch
battery holder and a tilt switch this is
the real secret ingredient here these
things are a lot of fun to use
so from 20 bucks you can get enough of
these supplies to make about three or
four of these lamps to start things off
we're going to take a length of copper
wire and we're going to mold it around
into a u-shape around the back of the
battery holder here the next step is
we're going to solder the battery holder
onto the wire
finally we're going to flip it over and
that negative terminal that's on the
other side we're going to slider some
stranded wire to that and then just
leave it alone
all right give it a little tug make sure
it's nice and secure all right that
looks good
so that's going to get our power
everywhere it needs to go next up we've
got the tilt switch my favorite little
switch we're going to take one leg we're
going to bend it down we're going to
wire this in so that the circuit will
turn on when the jar is turned upside
down
find the place Midway up on one of the
copper wires and give it a snip
now solder one of the two feet to the
bottom of the clip section then take the
other foot and solder it to the length
of copper that you just clipped off all
right it's working now we can solder on
the led take the longer the two leads
from the LED and wrap it around the
copper wire coming from the tilt switch
that's going to be our positive side
then wrap the other lead around the
opposite side slaughter both of them in
place and clip off any extra wire now
that the LED is there to hold the shape
we'll go back up to the battery holder
and take the stranded wire from the
negative terminal and use the exposed
bit to wrap around the copper that's
opposite from the tilt switch and then
solder that down with that done clip
away that copper that connects the
negative side to the positive terminals
and now you have a complete circuit now
for the very last step we're going to
mount it inside the jar to do that we're
going to superglue it down to the jar
lid now we're going to use a big heaping
glob of superglue not just because it's
going to hold it in place better because
it's going to act as an insulator and
keep the circuit from interacting with
the metal of the lid alright now that we
got everything glued in place you notice
we have this extra length of copper here
on the bottom we can either just clip
that off so it'll fit in the jar or you
can have some fun with it you can bend
them around make some interesting
designs just make sure the ends of those
copper pieces don't touch each other all
right now let's give it a test let's pop
in a wash battery pay close attention to
which size positive and which size
negative
all right let's screw this into the jar
give it a test
boom so there you go now you've made
your very own led tilt lamp a very
simple design easy project for beginners
I really like that's got that candle
flicker LED in there to give it a cool
vibe nice gift for kids too makes a
great nightlight or just make a bunch of
them to have around the house the
inexpensive to make have fun with it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
