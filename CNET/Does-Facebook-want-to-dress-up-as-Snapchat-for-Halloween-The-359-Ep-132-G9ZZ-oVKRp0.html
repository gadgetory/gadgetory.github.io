thirty-first and it is time for episode
132 of the 359 podcast and Lisa needs
braces good morning everybody morning
everyone it's Halloween yeah very spooky
here today i forgot halloween you guys
I'm just sitting next to two really
sharply dressed guys this is how you
wish I love a costume this is how I
normally look yeah I can't and I am
Idaho it's coming you really are keep
you straight face man I apologize to
everybody listen errata to the to the
audio podcast later as you hear this as
I'm covered in carpet installation as
appropriately themed all right what are
we talking about today what are we
talking about today we're doing we
talking about a busy day facebook trying
to buy snow which was a a snapchat like
service owned by the popular asian
messaging app line i will also be
talking about Teslas SolarCity's plan to
get more solar panels on top of your
house when other solar tiles solar tiles
you're right not not panel is not the
big big hole yeah individual tiles that
collectively together are they cheaper
is that the deal from what it's supposed
to be yeah all right so there we go I
the lastly bacon and V are you heard me
right bacon NVR this is a time of this
is what VR was made for this is like the
prequel to Wally when everyone just sits
like this is yes this is what leads we
don't even leave we don't need to go to
a restaurant we just need to strap in
our headsets we just scratch the headset
and then boom bacon goodness all right
as always if you have any questions
about these these really random topics
or about our costumes what lips tombs
look like it right
leave them in the comments section our
producer Lisa will pick out the best and
that will answer all right all right
let's get started before everything
falls apart all right let's get this
podcast recording anyway and 32 welcome
to the 39 when we talk about the top
tech news of the day and all have a crap
we want to throw in I'm Roger J I'm
Alfred Aang so Facebook is in the
headlines a day after reports emerged
that had tried to buy snow a snapchat
rival made by popular asian messaging
app line while the deal was unsuccessful
it shows that Facebook still is obsessed
with snapchat right they're having a
very hard time reaching the teen
audience heads yeah I mean that
everyone's jumping on a snapchat because
everyone wants to you know keep private
now no one wants their entire lives
archived and out there on facebook where
I know your mom is on your dad is on
your grandfather's on his grandfather's
on and it's just all these things wait
till you saw with instagram instagram
story is basically a drug ripoff right
and then I think the reason why people
aren't migrating to that either is you
can make your Instagram stories private
but the thing is it's it's hard to send
just messages to individual people the
feature really isn't at all there and
they're also lacking on you know
stickers filters the geo tagged filters
and that might be why they're trying to
buy line which you know does have a good
amount of that right well not lying per
se they were looking at but right now
yes like Lionel know if they could even
before line lines super popular and you
know in Asia but snow I've be perfectly
frank I've never even heard of snow I
just know that it does really well with
its filters and that's kind of the thing
that Facebook is really lacking on right
now you saw what they were doing for
halloween filters already yeah you know
it's it's you got to find a different
way to captivate your audience i don't
think this is it you know i think their
moves into messenger has been doing
really well yeah Usher again people just
want to have right but i think the core
dilemma is still that the demographic
isn't there right like those are
removing messenger are older people who
have already are on facebook right so
all right moving on Tesla and solar city
believe they have the solution to
replacing solar panels on the roof those
big bulky solar panels instead these
smaller cheaper tiles that would you
know blend in with the roof and look a
little bit more aesthetically pleasing I
mean is it
is that something you consider I think
yeah as a homeowner Alfred I think
that's you know been a big problem for
you know solar adoption where you know I
why would I get this giant battery
looking thing on the top of my building
but like you know with these tiles it's
also more affordable than just normal
tiles I think in that case you know it
looks better and it saves you a ton of
money i mean i think that's a key right
getting that cause down is really what
gets adoption up Elon Musk says that
because they're made of glass that last
Kwazii indefinitely which I'm not really
sure what that means that's that's my
new favorite phrase he was Ian
definitely I don't love that all right
lastly I want to spend a lot of time
talking about this bacon and VRS is very
important this is huge people a hormel
has yes today has introduced a black
label bacon VR experience you can strap
in a headset and visit for different
bacon centric world salty see the
vastness of variety jalapeno volcano and
the cherry woods to complete the
experience that they'll send you a
hormone special hormel google cardboard
with the scratch and sniff scratches a
feature which you know can get to the
the bacon smelling move just send me one
of those and i'll just use all my
vacation days in sick days left and I'll
just stay in bed and just do that
beautiful bacon bliss my god it's you
know bacon has had its moment in a lot
of places now there's like bacon shampoo
bacon coffee now I'm wondering when the
bacon meme is going to die out I don't
know if I'd ever will but so delicious I
can't imagine it with diet it you know
if these were available today and you
gave kids these for halloween like
trick-or-treaters you would be the
coolest person on the block oh yeah for
sure and look this is ultimately a
marketing stunt but damn if it's not an
awesome marketing stunt I'm only
disappointed that they don't actually
ship you bacon with it it's kind of a
well so we once you're through with a VR
world there's like sort of a direct link
it will take you right into their site
where we can order all the lovely slabs
of bacon I just want free bacon yeah
it's not no free bacon for you sorry for
more about these stories check us out on
cnet I'm Roger Cheng I'm Alfred dang
thanks for listening
mmm unexplained bacon hahaha that's my
Homer fruit today that was good that was
a decent over so even though you're
channeling Lisa right now it's a little
confusing I am the embodiment of
Simpsons goodness how dare you hey katie
is springfield there you go a question
they are so cool but how much do the
solar tiles cost no there's no direct
price point on a lan MOS is just talking
about how it's going to be cheaper than
you know actual tiles you think it'll
vary from like location to location uh
might I mean I look I imagine it's it's
still gonna be expensive right like
changing out your roof is never a cheap
investment so it's gonna cost you a lot
it's just it's not gonna be as expensive
who's as sort of those traditional big
bulky solar panels that's are the key do
you think snapchat should have accepted
Facebook or Google's billion dollar
acquisition attempt absolutely only they
are worth way more than a billion look
they're already reported to go IPO a
four billion dollars so yeah there I
think that's sort of a good call by Anna
tegel rare absolutely killing it and the
thing is is that you know they have a
grasp on this market that Facebook and
Google can't get which is why yes and
marketers love that like they have they
have that sort of that demographic that
like all the other major players just
can't figure out snapchats all over and
the key part about snapchat usage is
like it's all about it's like does very
well on engagement where you know the
other where Facebook doesn't where it's
you know people post stuff but that's
about it right with with snapchat you
know they get there they basically turn
you into the ads you know that little
like I remember one Xmen apocalypse was
coming out and they had they turned
every single filter into like one of the
x-men oh yeah yeah yeah then you know
you're basically being the commercial
for them yeah they did pay a lot of
money for that ad so and kids love to be
as part of the the experience they're
saying in the chat you know kids don't
care about privacy they care about
filters yeah is people love dressing
superheroes and characters it seemed you
know I'm talking about now I get it it's
kind of stupid but people love doing it
I live my life how I live my life and
thank you everyone for our all
our costume compliments this is
absolutely miserable hey it's wonderful
for us I'm our vantage boy this is made
a terrible mistake yeah I don't know if
you folks know just how a mobile brian
is right now it is it's amazing that
he's able to keep this podcast going cuz
this is an extent of the range of motion
that he should write all right so what
kind of bacon do we all want and
apologize to anybody who's vegetarian or
vegan yes we are going to talk about
bacon for a second I'm like very um I
don't think I know bacon that well
because i was reading all these
descriptions I'm just like I just I just
like bacon yeah that's the thing I mean
I would just go to the mark and buy
bacon then then they help us stuff like
a jalapeno crusted whatever and it's
like I it's just bacon dude it's one of
those I feel the same way about bacon as
I do about pizza as much as I like bacon
on pizza keep it simple yeah yeah cheese
and pepperoni even just cheese you know
but bacon it's the perfect formula out
the gate it tastes great but like the
others are they offering flavors with
the goggles that's what I was the
goggles they do nothing I think it's
just a general bacon smell yeah hey
that's good enough for me I don't need
the special flavored bacon smells bacon
bacon bacon is amazing exactly just
start start simple there's just never
enough of it it doesn't feel like it's
filling I don't Bacon's a oops biggins
interesting on our I pulled up the site
it's like a site it's like new way to
bring we have a podcast to do here Roger
you can't get bacon later all right guys
it's like good was a be like that's how
we get bacon it is it so feel guilty
operating just like candy thank you so
much bacon when do we get the review
units here in the office actually i
believe aaron carson down louisville
unfortunately that guy well she's a
woman oh but you know oh no everybody in
this company i'm sorry sorry Aaron but
screw you still send me the bacon all
right that was that was all Brian not
I will ask for her to send when she's
done with the that's that i ever send it
up here we'll come on all right stop
hoarding all the men suffered enough but
clearly you suffered enough today I uh
Facebook and privacy do not go hand in
hand that kind of go David yeah they
definitely do not know which is why
everyone's on snapchat now that's the
other thing with Instagram that they
messed up off of Instagram stories yeah
you know in scram is way more users but
the thing is that like if you stories
are public no one's gonna want to put it
up there like right it's right you can
make it private but then it like takes
away the fun of it because I'm all your
followers and then you have way more
followers than you do Instagram than you
do on snapchat you keep do you like your
personal circle yeah I think that's the
that's the weird thing like they're
trying to go from this sort of public
almost like Twitter like model to a
private messaging model that snapchat is
and it's they don't work too yeah the
kind of butt heads right so just yeah
it'sit's and then the way that standard
ethics is like if you want to be seen by
everybody if you want to be public you
can submit it to like new york city
stories or leg right these stories you
know it's like its participation based
it's not you know everyone it's
definitely more voluntary yeah proactive
about it yeah absolutely absolutely
we're just getting giggles now and the
people listing their favorite bacon in
the chat yeah what are some of those
different types of bacon bacon turkey
bacon says I do it I do enjoy turkey
okay I got it I gotta say um not that
big gun to my head I hate turkey bacon
yeah I'm not you didn't like one of your
head for that I would most won't like it
I would rather and the i would rather
fake bacon I just really think about the
taste of turkey bacon turns me off I
don't get it I don't like I love turkey
I love bacon I don't like bacon made out
of Turkey and it was a fair assessment
yeah yeah I I like I it's just like I
pretty much turkey everything when I can
hmm so I just uh turkey bacon it's okay
to me I can I like if I'm Barry if it's
very early in the morning I can't tell
the difference fair enough somatic if
you're drunk whatever yeah which happens
really the morning I mean that is one of
the best hangover foods oh yeah
absolutely what bacon or turkey or
turkey bacon bacon bacon egg and cheese
sandwich for a second yeah that's not to
go to
what are you guys uh looking forward to
out of the bacon V are you gonna try
bacon VI when it comes to your home oh
here we go what could be the next big
thing for snapchat also is this bacon vr
kosher it's because oh yeah I don't know
should find out we should what that well

youngins know us old people hey how so
all right just be her I don't do we all
got here leave me alone turkey bacon is
for those who can't eat regular bacon
for yeah that's a good point there some
people cannot eat pork I do understand
that but until then no absolutely done
for you for me yes this is a very
personal issue to me I'm very passionate
about what kind of it doesn't like
sizzle or like get crisp in the same way
that like normal bacon does is the
problem like i love i love turkey but i
don't like it as bacon I don't know stop
trying to be what you're not turkey more
