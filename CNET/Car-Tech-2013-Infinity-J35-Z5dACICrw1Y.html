effortless quiet and a little detached
here's an all-new model from Infiniti
aimed at a sector of the car buying
market that's coming back rather nicely
let's drive the 2013 Infiniti jx35 and
check the text well starting back here
at whatever that is you've got a midsize
crossover based on a stretched Nissan
Murano platform the corporate v6 up
front nothing wrong with that this is a
guy that starts off front-wheel drive
can be had all-wheel drive slots a
little below an x5 or a q7 or a big Benz
SUV in both price performance and to
some degree weight and ponderous knees
now inside the JX it's that kind of high
tone exotic wood nightclub bottle
service look I like it that's more than
I can say for this disaster continuing
on for about the seventh straight year
is the fisher-price navigation system
doesn't mean it doesn't work well you've
got the Infinity controller here which
turns pushes to enter kicks around in
different angles you can do just about
everything with this knob although you
do have a touch screen here as well this
is part of the navigation system eight
inch LCD if you don't get this you've
got a more basic vehicle control system
seven-inch non touch LCD but you still
have the controller knob then average is
hard drive based so response is pretty
good it's also got live traffic and
weather through satellite radio feeds
let's check out the voice command
usually pretty good in these infinities
and here's what I like about it would
you like to add for its own navigation
that's it gives me a nice menu of my
choices from a very universal point of
view I find this one of the easiest
systems to learn and to get a scope of
what I can do
navigation navigation please say address
address what speed please California
California San Francisco showing the
matching c11 please say the street Nick
second street
showing the matching 1 1 2nd Street 2 3
5 2 3 5 2nd Street
calculate route calculating route it's
not like a BMW you can spit out the
whole address in one phrase but I'm ok
with this even though it's 1 Z 2 Z
because it's so robust 3 audio systems
in this guy a base 6 speaker unit with
some number of watts a bose upgraded
system 13 speakers not surround and then
a Bose surround rig 15 speakers 5.1 DVD
encoding and all of that everything tech
is a package on this car by the way
there's nothing a la carte your media
sources include you've got USB 4 USB
sticks and iPods in here you've got an
optical disc slot at least CD if not DVD
bluetooth streaming audio is optional
based on a package and everything's
gonna go that way no HD radio in this
guy sat alight radio is in there from
the get now you get a standard glass
moonroof in an ejx but here's the odd
part we have the optional second and
third row roof which you can see how
they work back there I got a feeling
that they carved out some of this real
estate to make room for that thing in
the back now because it's an infinity
that means there's everything here to
make sure you don't crash
starting with camera city put this thing
in reverse and you've got like 8,000
views
here's my look back with my distance
markers in my trajectory marker in two
different windows including an inset in
my around view complete 360 which also
has distance warning zones there and I
haven't even changed the view yet now
I've got my curb rash camera back here
along with rear cam and I can do this
again and go to full screen rear cam you
can spend all day just playing with the
camera in fact I think I'm going
the j' acts like most infinities offers
enough driver assistance to be damn near
robotic blind spot warning and
prevention via yaw braking lane
departure warning and prevention via the
same technology
there's adaptive cruise control forward
collision warning even automatic braking
to make sure you don't bump into someone
and stop and go traffic there's even a
gas pedal that pushes back in Eco mode
to keep you from lead footing it too low
MP chain we have a three and a half
liter v6 real classic really good Nissan
stuff in this iteration sitting
sidesaddle driving front wheels
typically all-wheel drive optionally
you've got 265 horsepower 248
foot-pounds of torque gets this forty
three forty four hundred pound beast up
to 16 it's about seven eight seven nine
while delivering 1824 mpg or 1823 if
you're moving all the wheels one choice
only on the gearbox it's a CVT let's
check that out on the road driving in
this guy is best summed up as effortless
quiet and a little detached now I'm in
sport mode here
it's gonna hold my shifts a little
higher it's gonna give me better
throttle response the usual mix of
things and because this is a CVT a lot
of folks expect it to be mushy or
slippery or vague Nissan's somehow has
cracked the code on that and against
engines with pretty good power like this
one there's a bunch of power here you
know this vehicle is one of those
impressive ones that shows you how great
a six-cylinder can be this is not a
light vehicle but it's really quite
light on its feet in many ways
infinities hit a home run with this JX
41 4 is your base price but that is
gonna be 1,100 more if you want
all-wheel drive now here's where it gets
expensive look at these packages start
with the Premium Package for 49 50 to
get the navigation the first bose system
streaming Bluetooth and the around view
camera but you need deluxe touring for
25 50 more to get the surround of Bose
and the second and third row moonroof
and some nice wheels and heated and
cooled seats the tech package brings you
blind spot detection and prevention and
the lane departure tech but you've got
to go for the driver assist package on
top of that to get adaptive cruise
forward collision warning and the Eco
pedal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
