our health these days is kind of like
driving a car whose dashboard only works
one hour a year that is literally the
model of the annual checkup even Star
Trek saw a better way over 50 years ago
pervasive comprehensive monitoring of
what's really going on with you right
now we're on the cusp of that the omron
heart guide this is the FDA's first ever
approved blood-pressure machine that
fits around your wrist it's in its final
FDA approval phase right now going to
market end of 2018 no prescription by
the way now new blood pressure
guidelines issued in early 2018 now mean
that 46 percent of Americans have high
blood pressure according to the American
Heart Association that's up from 32
percent under the old decades-old
standard the maladies high blood
pressure leads to are almost too
numerous to count but they don't call it
the silent killer just to be dramatic
that should tell you something now if
you think you're good think again major
studies have found that 18 to over 30
percent of us have what's called white
coat hypertension in other words we only
exhibit high blood pressure in the
doctor's office
perhaps another 10 percent of us have
masked hypertension we don't exhibit
hypertension in the clinic but we do
have it most of the rest of the time
only constant monitoring can sussed
these two out now let's turn to a little
bit of sugar
the Dexcom g6 is the latest of
continuous glucose monitors knowing what
your blood sugar levels are all the time
you wear it for 10 days at a time and
simply swipe your smartphone or a small
dedicated reader over the thing to check
or record your glucose momentarily to
build a history or to alert family
friends or clinicians about a crisis
level you might be the Medtronic
Guardian connect and the Abbott
freestyle Libre round out this hot
category and all are aimed at the idea
that non diabetics will one day wear
something like this to avoid becoming
type-2 diabetic
now check out the alivecor kardea band a
band for an apple watch but it's
actually a wrist worn electrocardiogram
machine it's specifically designed to
detect atrial fibrillation that's when
your heart kind of flutters instead of
beating smoothly and it's a key
contributor to the future risk of stroke
this band is said to be about 87%
accurate at detecting afib and like
other products we've looked at it's FDA
cleared a live core and Imran who we
just saw worked together their products
can already create a single channel of
information about your heart health for
you or the clinician who would like to
see it when something is outside the
realm of normal
the last healthy heart tech I'm going to
show you today is one that is the most
prospective and futuristic and yet you
probably already have the devices you
need to do it a groundbreaking study
conducted at Mayo Clinic found the first
evidence that your voice may be an
accurate indicator of whether you have
coronary artery disease 81 tonal
features of voice were measured after
patients spoke to a recording app using
technology from a vocal biomarker
company called beyond verbal upon
further confirmation this study could
open the door to you monitoring your
circulatory system by just talking where
does all this go next first these
devices need to give us answers not just
information and answers that motivate
rather than overwhelm or discourage us
secondly it'd be great to have a single
dashboard of our health from many
sensors hopefully without us having to
wear many devices third make these
technologies over-the-counter so we can
wear them long before we supposedly need
them this does however set up some
tension between devices that keep us
well and pharmaceuticals that fix us
when we're not and fourth recognize that
everything is a health signal from your
smart home devices to your social graph
we need to learn how to read those and
integrate them with traditional medical
indications to unlock the keys to truly
personalized health for the first time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
