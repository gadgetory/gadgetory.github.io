glove in town but it's not for video
gaming a brand new album that you can
only listen to through trees and in
Japan toilets and elevators you heard
that right tomorrow daily
creating citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show in the known universe I'm
Ashley scale that Jamie's always kill
anonymous one of the the fanciest people
on the earth if I'm being honest crikey
and I have to say the round of stories
that we have today suck are awful but
you should still listen to them they're
not awful they're pretty amazing here's
the headlines all right meanwhile in
japan oh we're sorry okay we're starting
off with a weird one meanwhile in japan
meanwhile japan the government's working
with the country's elevator corporations
the industry of elevator making people
to bring these citizens of japan toilets
in elevators this is this video you're
going to see is from like 2008 or
something these are these little things
that you can actually find now in
elevators it is like toilets there for
emergencies there's put them in the
corner but okay let me explain emergency
corner toilet emergency corner let me
explain though because Sears think what
you're seeing right now is something
that is actually kind of important in
Japan because Japan is a lot of
earthquakes and they just had an
earthquake about just recently they had
a 7.8 earthquake off the coast and what
happens when there are earthquakes is
elevators get trapped you they don't
work so and if you're inside the
elevator and you don't get to not take
the elevator down you take the stairs
but people in the elevator don't have
that luxury and sometimes they can be
trapped in there for hours a day two
days like depending on how big the
earthquake isn't how long it takes
workers to get to those elevators so it
can get kind of messy which is really
gross which you know you see the video
that we were showing which is these are
sort of emergency toilets but they don't
really have any plumbing attached to
them these are just like if you are
desperate you can go and there's also
things like water they have like
blankets water things like that in the
event of an emergency inside these
elevators as well um so now the
government wants to work with the
elevator industry to figure out how to
get running water and toilets like
actual flushing toilets in new elevators
in Japan it they want a full functioning
in a public elevator yes which can't
possibly go wrong actually you know if
there's any culture I trust to take care
of and use appropriate use a toilet
appropriately inside an elevator or
working toilet it would be the Japanese
if I could find a way to make it so that
it could slow down and only reach my
destination when I finished I'd be down
on this that seems like a really good
floor hmm and it's like slow it's like
yeah it's like well I have to like it
goes between four and five it's like oh
I noticed you haven't gotten up yet
because here's the thing guys Japan's
toilets are some of the most advanced
toilets in the entire world like if you
haven't seen a Japanese toilet or used
one you are super missing out number one
and number two yeah this is like they
are at the forefront of toilet
technology through my toilet I think a
year ago they they're about a year ago
we did a story about a toilet exhibition
at a museum in Tokyo where there was
literally like you could put on a little
poo hat and slide down into a real like
a huge 15-foot tall toilet as you would
ya as one does um but yeah so they have
really fancy toilets in Japan so
honestly if there's any government or
any culture or any group of people who
are going to figure this out I think
it's going to be Japan it is the land of
tomorrow they have toilets that to me
seemed like from the future so it seems
like this would sort of be the next
evolution of that and I feel like they
could totally pull it off guys the
government is approving these toilets in
the elevator so they're putting pressure
on the elevator industry to make music
pressure in a toilet story I well I will
not be like well that's a good point
well made um so that brings us to our
hashtag the day TD flushed where would
you like to think of poop no that's not
the question although that would make
for some very interesting answers you
can answer that question it can get
segments listen guys if you want to
answer that question to kale you can
find him on twitter at kill anonymous or
you can answer in the comments on
YouTube whatever you want because I'll
go read them but the question for the
hashed out of the day is give us one pro
and one con for toilets and elevators
working plumbed toilets and well how
about this I there's already a problem
people farting in an elevator why would
we want us to like take that to the next
via con that would be gone for sure
yeah how can you think of a pro like is
there is there a good reason like what's
what you got one con what about a pro
what's a what's a good reason I would
argue the pro would be that aside from
you know getting trapped in an elevator
I mean sometimes you know what if you
get sick what if you have to throw up
what if you got me you don't want to
throw up all for the people in the
elevator you've a nice toilet to do that
in maybe you drank too much so I'm
saying you know where they should put
these inside the luxor in las vegas with
those diagonal elevators cuz people get
sick in those guys it's very specific it
is really sets this very specific use
case that would push it makes sense all
right I'd say that's a pro it like
keeping people from making a magic
traveler here crappy idea get out of my
studio so check check this out all right
so you've heard of crazy album like
people release an album a really strange
way Beyonce dropped hers without telling
anybody right well this guy I'm sorry
this group John moose release their
album only in the forest wait you can
only listen to the album in the forest
okay so here's how it works you download
this app this is John moose app then it
makes it so that it'll it'll keep
beeping and you keep walking towards the
forest and when you're finally deep
enough into the forest it'll start
playing the album that is super weird
yeah it's a it's a band from Sweden uh
it's it's pretty cool I think it's
pretty cool it uses google maps to pick
out green spots and it set your gps to
the closest one much so the reason he
did this is because you were they john
moose did this is because the album was
written pretty much in relationship with
nature and so so i listen to it in
nature is supposed to add to the effect
i see i'm downloading it right now i'm
ryan do addition or not anywhere and
that's the issue this is a really cool
idea i don't really want to do this
because i go hiking and and logan
producer looking just went hiking but I
there's not a lot of forests close by
necessarily maybe they'll also accept
parks maybe Lex at parks cuz on Google
Maps you're saying it's the green spots
a lot of
x parks are green parks are green too so
maybe a nice wooded park yeah get away
from it all and listen to John moose so
the this is this is just a pre-release
like you're gonna get the album normally
it's not like you can only listen to it
there but you can listen to it now if
you download the app and then go to your
nearest forest and then stand there and
enjoy a deer licks your face love it
yeah exactly feet so there you go John
moose how much amazing go check that out
it's just I guess it's just called the
John moose app i looked up john Boozman
in the app store it's I Oh looks like
it's iphone only no iPad but you can get
it on my phone droid 20 spray vibrate
might be on android it probably is yeah
but i just i just looked it up on the
app store it wasn't for ipad i had to
look it up fries so they go that is a
chef john moose kind of amazing also
very appropriate name I don't know if
your group or a person but nicely done
I'm gonna get into John moose um no
Johnny's seems like a really cool band
just a cool sweet is like oh that feels
like a hipster things like have you ever
heard of John moose I don't think so
yeah I heard about their meat what do it
what are you doing in there moose in it
like that's really my god guys John
moose the band the hate kale just gave
you a great verb for your band loosen it
you can't steal my verb alright what is
your you got a power glove yes you know
the power glove is so bad it's so bad um
so I gotta tell you about this power
glove it's a little bit different than
agendas power glove this is from Harvard
engineering so it's for medical use but
it's really cool because it's helping
people and I think this is awesome it's
for rehabilitation it's made to help
people with conditions that affect the
usage of their hands so there are a lot
of people out there with these
debilitating diseases or injuries that
prevent them from really kind of
controlling the use of their hands so
this woman that you're seeing on the
screen right now is a patient who has
been demoing the unit for them on video
and she she talks about in the video
like she's like I just want some
semblance of control over my environment
because I can't even hold me I can't
hold anything I drop stuff all the time
dropped my glasses I can't hold stuff
and this glove is made of Kevlar and
silicon and then there's actuators
inside that open and closed the fingers
and this is the cool part the strength
of the fingers closing an opening can be
specifically tailored to suit each
patient's disability so like if you
maybe have something
if you have a disability that doesn't
require as much force then you can set
it to do a little bit less you can
actually set it to do more depending on
what you have and exactly how much
damage or disability your hand is
experiencing that's awesome yeah it's
pretty cool so they want to try to get
people to experience something close to
the very natural feeling control in
their hands and they made this video
explaining all of how it works and they
showed that prototype which is really
cool looking and next they want to
integrate EMG sensor so that patients
can trigger the glove more accurately
based on their intent so it's like oh I
want to use my hand specifically do this
thing and then the EMG sensors would be
able to go in and like do it
appropriately like enough pressure
appropriate pressure which is pretty
great yeah I like that it's adaptable
that it can it can go to based on how
debilitated you are yeah make sure
you're not super reliance on it so right
because if they made it all the way
powerful and then you know you only have
a little bit of muscle problems than
your muscles with atrophy because you're
using it more right if there was just
the sort of one-size-fits-all setting on
it it would be first of all more
difficult for people with more
debilitating injuries and and then also
on the other end it would probably be
actually more difficult for people less
debilitating injuries because then
you're losing control that you already
had in your hands yeah so this is pretty
great that you're able to hold you hold
things move things around based on and
custom tailored to exactly what type of
disability or injury or disease you
might have that could help that has
prevented you from using your hand in a
one hundred percent capacity this is a
little cooler than the power glove it's
a you know the power of love is pretty
good you guys know it's so bad hey
that's so true um I thought that we're
making a wizard reference today ah look
at our younger audience doesn't
appreciate them no idea it's okay it's
okay you guys you can appreciate this
power glove this is much better powerful
Tomatoes pokemon reference we should do
that too ah you're like mudkips we're
gonna go make some pokemon references
we're gonna take a quick break we're
gonna come right back it's Tuesday which
means there's new releases and I'm
pretty sure this week was tailor-made
for Cail and on top of that we have your
user fee
back and of course our phone tog refer
the day so don't click away it's
tomorrow daily check out watercolor Mad
Max
super cool mudkips lips welcome back to
the show everybody we have returned it's
Tuesday which means it's time to tell
you about all the nice things that are
going to be emptying our wallets this
week it's time for new releases how
excited are you Cale from lego jurassic
world i'm pretty excited I actually do
like Lego games they're really good and
I love and and and in the ligature lego
games are his best and here's the best
part about Leo jurassic world i just
want to mention to you guys if you can't
read the lower third if you're either
listening or don't feel like reading
that lower third it is available today
for xbox one xbox 360 playstation 4
playstation 3 wii u wii 3ds vita and pc
so pretty much any platform you own like
you're gonna be only coasters micrel of
it and microwave ovens your car the
roller skates pop yo grandma yeah your
grandma can play this game well the best
part about this game is that unlike many
other Lego games they didn't break
everything up if this covers Jurassic
Park one trust part 23 and Jurassic
world and then of course they cute see
it up they always make it a little
interesting I am I don't know how far
they go into the story with Jurassic
world but there is a potential for them
to I'm actually kind of the trailer
pretty great like there's a lot of
moments from the trailer that they you
can see there you get to play through
Jurassic Park 1 C therefore dress park
adventure are really cool I am buying
this game I both during the break was
trying to figure out if I should live
stream this I think I'm changing my mind
I think I'm a live stream I think lego
jurassic world was worth it would you
Logan do you think I should live stream
this sure why not he's usually got it
usually either yessir yeah Logan's are
pretty yes or no guy he's on the fence
might not be well alright well maybe do
some soul-searching yeah alright that's
pretty good but I don't think anything
can be lego jurassic world coming out
this week how about Jurassic world yes I
said dress a growth is gonna be out this
view hey clever girl mm-hmm thank you
thank you I love being compared to a
velociraptor on a Tuesday but only on a
Tuesday on so yeah
is this is the final trailer that came
out which kill and I agree and producer
Logan is the best trailer it makes the
other trailers look stupid and childish
it does it makes the movie it look
really scary like in a good way like an
old man this is like very exciting and
thriller and it's it doesn't seem I
don't think that this will be what the
movies like but it's it's great these
are all the intense moments Kevin
trevara said that the second trailer was
more like his Jurassic world like what
he wanted to show but either way this
shows that there's some intensity in the
movie which you know you're kind of
frayed up but there you go there's the
indominus rex and kale you were saying
you were trying to get tickets and like
it's sold out everywhere in a lot of
emails and a lot of the high population
areas it sold out faster than mad max so
but I mean this is an IP that's people
are even it's not rated R either so it's
pg-13 that's true so these silly easier
to sell out pg-13 them yeah I'm very
excited about this much hype I still
don't know if it's gonna be good but i'm
going in with high expectations which
may be bad could be bad Kevin Trevorrow
he's never done like an action movie
don't put your acid world up on a
pedestal man I put Chris Pratt all on
the high everybody puts Chris Pratt on a
pedestal that's fine he can handle it uh
and then lastly uh just drop this like
kind of brand new news today right 43
microsoft announced a one terabyte xbox
one so this is a new xbox one so xbox
one right now is a 500 gigabyte machine
not anymore the 399 version is now I
have a one terabyte hard drive built-in
which honestly you guys is the way it
should have been from the get-go it
should have been this way from the
beginning did you run out of space
pretty quickly uh yeah because these
games like 50 gigs if you're downloading
games I mean they're huge games you get
ten games in there it's over like it's
done you're done you get ten major
titles and it's been it was like in the
growing pains of that trip like cross
over there lies digital and which they
should have had these you know really
good SS look one terabyte SSDs in there
and the thing is is they just didn't and
and Sony is equally as guilty of this
they have a 500 gigabyte hard drive and
at least with the xbox one you could do
an external hard drive like that was
fine but on the PlayStation you can't so
and they have a new controller so the
new controller has a regular headphone
jack which a lot of people are
super thrilled about really yeah it's
not that weird like proprietary
connection it's just a normal three and
a half like headphone jack so you can
actually as normal people headphones on
your ex seems like they're getting a
little nervous and they may be gonna
answer a lot of problems they've been
having I that does seem that does seem
to be okay so a few more consoles so now
if you want to get the 500 gigabyte one
it will permanently be 349 and then this
new of one terabyte Xbox one is now what
I've 399 my console box on my console
already had two terabytes in it though
which one Tara pc o your piece boom and
I can edit on it not uh I'm not a
console but it is I mean it's very nice
you see master is it's very nice um so
that's our new releases for this week
which means it is time for your user
feedback you don't have you don't have
enough time kale you don't have time for
that stop making out with the
velociraptors um they are technically
the size of chickens uh so well only am
like you really you like not not in and
and right on right on a motorcycle next
to them this is like this is the new way
I want to see that scene recreated with
Chris Pratt riding a motorcycle with
real size velociraptor a little tiny one
um I things you do actual chicken
actually that would also be amazing so
we asked you guys to use hashtag TD WWDC
15 to tell us what you guys thought of
you WC honestly by a lot of you guys
agreed with us so first up we have Frank
who said hashtag I fell asleep zzzzzz
and then put a little picture of a baby
and then galle road in and Gail said
honestly couldn't care less III is
around the corner with you will be
telling you all about on Thursday and
what we're going to be doing there
nilesh wrote in and said I am so glad
that the ipad has finally gotten real
multitasking it's about time and that's
the thing is very like some people were
more excited about this than others like
one feature like I bet you he or she
ever was it English yeah was not like
everything else was amazing just like oh
man multitask on their iPad have been
waiting forever Rob wrote in and said
hi Ashley I have a question since absol
is releasing a new paid radio service
what's going to happen with iTunes radio
yeah good question beats one will be the
right that will be iTunes radio for all
intents is Apple music is now like that
is all of their music services iTunes
radio is gonna be rolled right in two
beats one it's just going to be served
at curated content and then you're also
going to have i miss i believe i saw all
of the the playlist like the curated
playlists and things like that you're
going to be able to kind of have that
sort of same radio s experience like a
Pandora or Spotify playlist or whatever
you'll have that in Apple music so as
soon as Apple music officially launches
I'm i believe iTunes radio will will go
away but just they get absorbed right in
a beats one makes oh yeah and then also
just as an FYI everybody yesterday we
were debating offline play and Apple
music does have offline play so for
clarification for sure offline play Alec
wrote and said I would have loved to see
an update to the ipod that's what kind
of made them popular and all they have
done to the ipod line up lately was
discontinued the ipod classic sent from
my ipod no was it I think it was uh but
ya know a lot of people really love
their iPods and a lot of people use an
ipod the like have their music work out
and everything but then they they don't
want an iphone like so they can android
device but they use but i wonder if that
will change you know this braid almost
feel tonight why do you even need an
update why do you need an updated ipod
why don't you just have like one of the
older i have an older one that I use
sometimes when I go running but I mean I
only need it to play music it doesn't
need to have like crazy features or be
updated or anything but I think some
people wouldn't mind having like an
updated camera because it's such an old
camera when you take pictures like
really grainy like they wouldn't mind
maybe having an updated camera okay so
that seems like it'd be pretty expensive
though yeah well I mean it would be I
mean you're upgrading it so I i do think
i will say that it is a pretty cool
device once you have it connected to a
Wi-Fi network yes basically an iphone
just without an actual phone part well
you can FaceTime audio now mean you
FaceTime audio other iphone so all right
it's kind of like a phone I'm just
tackling the running logic yeah
and a crazy thing but it is very true if
you want to use it as a home device than
right yeah but I mean then you could
just use an iPad I don't know where's
the argument here I like why don't they
refresh the ipad but I actually think
that Apple music debuting on Android is
actually kind of a that's a way to
combat this sort of new ipod thing where
it's like well maybe if you have an
android phone and ipod or they're
they're gonna they're gonna make you
either have an android phone use apple
music or haven't get an iphone like
that's gonna be there i think that's
going to be the thing that's sort of the
end game there because they're not
making any money off of you if you have
an ipod like that you're buying a lesser
and product in apple's lineup they'd
rather you buy an iphone obviously I've
got like the generation 5 iPod and fine
with it I can't even know what my I
think I gave my ipod to my knees for a
verse in it like you know obviously
can't play like games on it but just
listen to it for music it's yeah but in
my pocket don't go around that's what
it's for that's what it's for I'm a
really good really good feedback you
guys and that brings us to our very last
piece of user feedback which is always
our phone tog refer of the day totally
love this picture it's from a note 3 you
ready for a little galaxy note 3 photo a
little one from our friend Mohammed who
wrote in and said just an amazing view
to wake up to took taken by note 3 from
Dubai United Arab Emirates um wow what a
skyline I did cool really Dubai is like
one of the best I would argue like I
would say man there's probably about
five cities in the world where they just
have like the most incredible
interesting skylines and no offense to
New York I mean listen guys we're from
LA we have a boring skyline like our
downtown is garbage but like our skyline
is not very good there was a law for a
really long time that prevented anything
other than flat tops of the buildings
with skyscrapers they just lifted that
ban but it's been around for like 40
years so we're finally we might finally
now have interesting buildings like tops
of buildings in Los Angeles so we have a
cool skyline but it's been it's going to
take a while but there are some cities
like Dubai like this that are just
amazing like do you see buildings and
they're just constantly under
construction their stuff undergoing
struction all the time these huge cranes
and everything you have the you know the
Burj Khalifa and you have all these
other amazing things inside to buy that
are these buildings that are incredible
feats of human engineering which is
super cool so thanks for the picture
Mohammed yeah that's pretty good like
super great if you guys want to send in
