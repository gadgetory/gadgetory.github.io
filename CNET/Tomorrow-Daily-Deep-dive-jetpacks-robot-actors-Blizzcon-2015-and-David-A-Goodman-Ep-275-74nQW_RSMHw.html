jetpacks Tesla's autopilot limitations
and a Japanese actress who just happens
to be a robot we also talked to author
David Goodman about his new book the
autobiography of james t kirk only one
of the greatest Starfleet captains of
all time and also Jeff and I take a trip
down to blizzcon 2015 to check out the
eSports scene get ready guys it's our
new set it's tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the Internet
welcome to tomorrow daily podcast geek
talk show in the known universe it's
actually talk show this time that's just
it one person talking at the camera yeah
yeah one person talking in a show by
themselves there's two people here I'm
Ashley's gotta join me for the first
time in our lawn show format jeff
cannata i am so excited to be here
Ashley this is awesome it's been fun
doing the the small shows during the
week but being here hanging out with you
we get to talk about stuff deep dive
into stuff it's gonna be good yeah yeah
so basically if you have not been
watching if this is your first time
checking out tomorrow daily welcome to
the show and secondly if this is you
know you're coming back after a while we
have a new thing now so monday through
wednesday jeff and i each host a short
version of the show we kind of hand off
the short versions and that's kind of
like homework for the thursday show
that's i'm gonna call it homework but
it's fun homework yeah it's a it's
homework if without the work it's just
what's home play yeah home play like
it's home play and then you're gonna and
then you can come join us on Thursdays
where we deep dive into our three
favorite stories of the week and we're
going to talk a little bit more about
what they mean and why we like them and
what's so interesting about them beyond
just the news itself which is all we can
get to during the short shows plus we're
gonna have guests we're gonna have fun
other stuff going on calculus yeah it's
a much longer cooler show and so I don't
think that'll be a good complement to
each other the the bite-sized stuff and
then the full meal yes and can we just
take a quick second to appreciate our
brand-new set which I have to say uh it
was an extremely amazing job done by the
team at CBS com and also some other
crews here inside the building um this
set went up in about a month yeah and it
is amazing all of the panels in the back
are actually they can be changed the
color can be changed them at any given
time unfortunately we don't have anybody
running the lighting board because
producer Logan is in the control room so
but it can change and then we also have
our robot friends joining us on the show
think of it as our studio audience yeah
we got Genghis of course Genghis always
here we have the portal gun hanging out
ha applause and then we have Wally we
got a MIT robot we have a sony Poochie
over there which is old school and then
we also have Eva from wally and then of
course bb-8 I need to get an r2d2 I
think they should all
this thing should rotate in and out I
think it should know a no car using
robot well habitat changing we can
change this to whatever we want we got a
portal gun back here it's not
necessarily robots so so you have great
stuff and we're really excited about
this and we hope you like it and ho and
and if you don't have time to listen a
long show listen the short shows during
week but if you have time now you can
listen to us yeah if you want to see
your robot on our show send a truck send
it to us we need to hit a p.o box all
right guys let's hit the headlines
obviously number one story the way for
me is jet packs well anytime we can talk
about jet packs is a good time as far as
I'm concerned yeah and this is good jet
packs yeah I've seen jetpacks before in
most the time when you see a jetpack
it's the size of a small car and very
loud and noisy and very impractical and
it's not the jetpack dream that we've
all had which is easy and compact and
Rocketeer like yeah Rocketeer lay and
that's for me why I was so excited to
see the jb 9 from jetpack aviation so
here it is you're looking at it that is
the inventor and CEO David Mayman he's
taking a spin fighting crime I think
he's fighting crime is that what you're
doing I I like to think that that is
probably what he went and did later that
night in New York City in Manhattan
Gotham if you will I think that's
probably what needs to happen he's just
patrolling the city for super villains
right now but none of the supervillains
have his awesome yeah yeah and no one's
coming to attack the Statue of Liberty
fortunately so he flew around the Statue
of Liberty that thing looks really agile
look at me that's amazing that is
amazing that is the dream guys that is
the jetpack dream I love the fact that
I'm hearing about this on our show and
and our audience is hearing about on our
show but I kind of wish I heard about it
by just being in New York and seeing him
fly free just feel like there's a man
and look up in the sky it's a bird it's
a plane ya know what to do to jetpack
amazing yeah um ok so let's discuss the
jb 9 because i think this is worth some
discussion he says that they flew this
thing very conservatively ok so uh they
can unleash this thing to go about a
hundred and sixty miles an hour how much
do we have to pay him to unleash it uh
we should he says he won't because he's
like I'm no I'm too scared to do it but
he said you could theoretically there's
somebody that'll do it oh I'm sure like
felix baumgartner guy who jumped out of
the jumper face like let's he'll do it
that guy there's nuts you totally do it
I bet redbull could pay him a lot of
money do it so I think I would do it the
flight times about 10 minutes depending
on the way to the pilot that's not a lot
of time to fight crime in no that's a
very quick crime-fighting flight and
then to me the interesting thing is
they're already working on the jb 10 and
the jb 10 they said can go over 200
miles an hour right because nobody will
go as fast as this one will go so let's
make a faster one yeah exactly like
let's make it quicker uh and and also
this is my favorite total favorite part
of the story he says that someday he
wants to eat ok so he doesn't want the
jetpack to end up in the wrong hands and
he means that from a safety person it
means that from a supervillain
perspective let's be honest no I
probably yeah they see safety from
supervillains I'm assuming that's
correct um so he so he says I don't want
it to get into consumers hands too soon
because this is a direct quote which is
my favorite he's like um I'd want to
feel like we have an infrastructure to
train them we could technically just
send them the unit in a box and say good
luck but it's jet pack or jet pack I
don't I want to be part of the jet pack
or said but it's not necessarily going
to end well if you're doing 200
kilometers an hour 5 feet off the ground
you know like we have no idea you're
doing right yeah we're not going to that
would be a trained super soldier program
yeah of jet pack or we should call it
The Rocketeer University I'm right I'm
ready I'm ready sign me up please I'm
yet my favorite thing about this you
told me about it that it's actually
powered by kerosene yeah it seems a
little steam punk to me it okay so they
actually are calling this jetpack
aviation is calling this the the a true
jetpack and the reason why is because it
uses turbine engines as that's what
powers it and so there are competitors
like the martin jetpack this is that's
the enormous one that's the really big
one and the martin jetpack uses a piston
engine so it drives a bunch of fans so
it's not really like a true jet pack
right back it's a fannie it's a family
pack yeah it's really as a fanny pack
and also it's huge and this particular
jet pack the jb 9 is able he said you
can store it in the backseat of a car
you strap it onto bassett
that would drive to your jetpacking
location no no you don't want to do that
because that's that's your the feedings
of the purposes yeah you're completely
to be in the purpose but he says and
then also the guys in Dubai who do the
jetpack flying have you ever seen those
videos no but I'm going to be searching
from them as soon as I get yeah they're
amazing so these guys who fly over dubai
which we've seen on the show before
actually use they use turbines but they
don't use them for hovering they
actually just use them for thrust so
they have wings that they use those like
they look like flying squirrels fly
around us up but they use turbines just
for thrust to go forward not not hover
this guy can can fly he can hover he can
I mean he did a little pirouette in
front of the Empire State they are
disabling goodbye this uh he says not
yet he but the Martin jetpacks gonna go
on sale next year for 150 thousand
dollars oh I gotta start saving so I'm
saving for that putting away that cash a
lot he does well I anticipated he does
say these two things before we move on
the next thing he says someday they want
to get to a point where you're gonna be
able to put on the pack press a green
button and immediately hover suspended
hover Oh from naps I just want to hover
and dig a nap just lightning how
comforting it you'd only get a 10 minute
out I could do that and then uh and then
he says he also wants to put together
jetpack races I I know that's that's the
face everyone's making right now come on
I would jetpack races forget horse
racing let's just get rid of that it's
that it's literally that the luge of the
sky I know so I think ABC should really
pick up on this and we should have
BattleBots paired up with Jack racing in
the summer programming the only problem
is the massive death count that jetpack
great the thing is undoubtedly gonna
heal listen they know the risks that's
all I'm saying uh I have another story
for you there is one of my favorite
things I'm ready for this as much as I'm
ready for jetpacks I am ready for
self-driving cars everyone in la is
ready for a self-driving car yeah I I
don't understand people that say no I
don't want self-driving car give it to
me I'm ready one of my really close
friends is leasing a Tesla AA jaana he
has the autopilot feature he showed it
to me it's amazing I'm ready for this
this is amazing but just like everything
else on the internet the autopilot
feature is getting ruined by people on
YouTube
maybe abusing the privilege of having
autopilot yeah it turns out that Tesla's
going to have to do some sort of
management of this because people are
posting videos of themselves doing some
really reckless things I saw very
interesting video it's this one right
here this is Estonian Anonymous which
I'm assuming as a cousin of kale kale a
kill anonymous an estonian anonymous
this guy from the Netherlands um he
climbed into his backseat and let his
tezel drive him around I kind of love
this seems like a really bad idea but I
don't like the fact that it's on YouTube
for he's ruining it for all the all of
us no no I'm polishes on youtube because
now Tesla's like hey we're gonna limit
this but it's awesome like that's what I
want I want to be able to just hang on
the back drive you lay down you you be
you wouldn't be able to do this okay I
feel like this is the first major move
forward in technology that is that
scares me isn't as an old person like
the crazy thing today yeah it's out of
your comfort zone it's out of my comfort
zone so so this is the first bit of
Technology where i'm like i would
genuinely be terrified maybe because I'm
a control freak that's probably why yeah
I'd be terrified to give up control of
my car because car culture is so big in
LA like I live in my car me like it but
you know what's better than driving cars
than you computer bots yeah totally and
and so i get the value of it but i'm
really scared of the idea like it's
gonna take some getting used to like
give up control in a car and be like
okay okay siri take me home and series
like I got you and like take I'm
convinced that our kids generation and
their kids generation are going to be
mystified that we ever let humans drunk
oh why do we let there be like wow
people drove those did anybody die oh
yeah lots of people died all the time
it's gonna be like hard we hear about
leaching in the Middle Ages or something
it's gonna feel insane and I think we
just need two cars are the fourth
biggest killer of humans yeah if
somebody came to you and said I have the
solution for the fourth biggest killer
of humans you'd go let's do it sighs
what's a fifth like if they said hey
listen we figured out heart disease
involves dropping a little robots to
clean up your arteries all you gotta do
is release
little control in your life see ya
that's hard for people they don't like
that and I think it's tough for some
people who have dr mean who'd driven
cars our lives I'm I'm I'm a lifer in
the commuter sense like I mean I've
always driven yeah and so for me it's
it's scary it's really scary what do you
think they're gonna do to like curb this
that's the problem is now that now
that's on YouTube they want us to I
don't think they should stop it i think
this is what we want to get to i want to
do is look in that but i think that's
probably going to have some sort of
requirement that you have to stay in the
see you probably have to keep your hands
on the wheel yeah there's some language
of stuff that disengages when you let go
i think BMW doesn't yeah and but that's
a bummer to me because i think i think
what we really need to have more
controls on is youtube yes youtube is
what's ruining it for everybody you know
is it's not the autopilot that's the
problem it's the jackass who's putting
it on the web yeah don't just there
should be an auto and autonomous robot
in YouTube's algorithm that refuses to
let you upload tezel autopilot videos
yes just don't tell you I'm us guys yeah
like don't tell your mom like ruin it
this is the kid who's like oh don't we
partied last night until 3am you look
shut up shut up you're ruining it for
everybody what he's having a good time
right now everybody's making it work but
there are some is there have been some
close calls though like people went oh
gosh like and having it reeker echt
right they're using it wrong they're
using it too fast the system can't
correct in time I I would guarantee you
that there's gonna be more problems from
the people over correcting their like
the computer just thought that's why
they said we're gonna limit this because
people have been letting them drive
hands-free at like 90 miles an hour yeah
and then when it hits a curb it hits a
curve and it goes the wrong way or it
starts going into oncoming traffic like
not good so enter details we're gonna
starts listen mark my words friends
we're going to start seeing some very
serious accidents with Tesla's unless
people start being responsible send me
up I'm ready I'm ready be responsible
I'm ready to be as your response I'm
just pushing myself into the future one
irresponsibility at a time fair enough
all right I like that I'm we should have
a teacher that says that pushing
ourselves in the future it wasn't
irresponsibility of time let's talk
about gemini def okay robot actress this
is pretty exciting stuff I find this
super fascinating Geminoid f is a
that was built by Hiroshi Ishiguro who's
a roboticist in Japan I'm sure you've
seen this guy on like discovery channel
science channel he's the guy who built
the robot her Japanese got yes and the
robot looks just like him yeah it's a
little disturbing that you would build a
mini me not even a mini yeah its
full-size full-size me a robot me uh so
he also made Geminoid f and so Geminoid
f is in this movie here's the this is
the trailer for it from Phantom film
called sayonara it premiered at the
Tokyo Film Festival and the story is
like really sad it's about a radiation
plagued to Japan and everyone has to
leave Japan they all have to leave and
go to other countries and so everybody
in the country gets a number that
assigns them a priority level and so
this woman who the robot acts opposite
of uh is stuck in her very rural
countryside location waiting for her
number to come up and she's getting
sicker and sicker the radiation sickness
basically it's like making her very sick
huh so I still still more compelling the
Nicolas Cage this robot but not as
compelling as i know i was just say
slightly more slightly more emotional
than kristen stewart house it has the
road I've been on Cameron be able to
pick out the robot well that she was
there yeah it's she access her like I
guess her lifelong cut a care giver uh
and so Leona is the robot saying that's
her and and so she is dead sea geminis
right there that's her acting and
apparently she is supposed to be her
caretaker for like a robotic caretaker
who is built you know in a wheelchair
and she because the robot can't walk so
they had to think of a story device to
like really wanted this robot in the
movie I guess so and it but it's really
interesting to me that on the website
they treat her like she's a real actress
like she's born in 2010 or like 2012 or
something that I was really funny and
she got a whole bio up on the fan film
website first they come for our assembly
line jobs and income for our actors and
they come for our acting gay some people
i think would probably prefer it was
never around um how do you feel about
this I you know I like that she is a
robot playing a robot like I said she
was actually
a robot meant to be a person like oh
it's my friend that's not believable
heard like that would be kind of near
friend is so stiff I don't be like a
Bicentennial man like I've remind me of
that uh but yeah I think it's you know
it's so Japan guys it's so Japan and of
course it's in Japan but I love that we
are finding new creative ways to put
humanoid robots into you know features
like I think that's a yes would you
which if let's say Star Trek The Next
Generation it was coming out today would
you want data played by an actual robot
not yet because it seems like it seems
like the robots can't really express
emotion the way obviously a person can
well I mean the whole point it was with
data clear robot avocations I don't know
I mean if it was a really cool robot i
think i might say yes sorry brent Spiner
I feel really bad about that but I don't
know about this i think it's i think
this is a little bit gimmicky and seems
so i would love to see the movie to see
how it actually feels yes maybe it maybe
it makes sense in the context of it all
but it's me like the idea it makes a
little sense it feels a little premature
I feel like we're still so far in the
uncanny valley that it doesn't but you
know it's supposed to look like a robot
to be a robot yeah cos I'm saying like
if it's playing a robot playing a robot
like that seems ok that seems alright
but I mean what do we think that maybe
there are actors already out there that
have been replaced with robots because
only maybe maybe we are all been
watching movies maybe Mark Wahlberg has
been a robot the entire time I'm just
saying I mean listen guys Julia robots
cyborgs Bullock Oh Talia robots Oh Jilly
robit' yeah oh boy I think I'm not know
we gotta clear we got it okay wait fer
we go to break we are gonna get Rick to
focus i need a laughter brings you broke
me broke me broke me uh we have to tell
you what the hashtag it so we're doing
is something new with the hashtag
instead of hashtag of the day we're
gonna do hashtag hey TD and we want you
to use that hashtag for any of the
stories you hear during the week so when
you watch the show monday through
wednesday the short shows if there's
something you find interesting you want
to comment on it write us on twitter
and use the hashtag hey TD and tell us
your thoughts about it and then if we
decide that we want to talk about that
story on Thursday show we might use your
feedback now that week so will our to
make this a more interactive experience
and have you guys commenting and have us
reacting to your comments yeah so use
the hashtag hey TD hey TD so we're going
to take a quick break and when we come
back we are going to have author
television writer all-around great guy
David Goodman talk to us about his novel
the autobiography of james t kirk so
don't click away tomorrow daily welcome
back to the show the gentlemen we are
about to talk to has a pretty fancy
pedigree he has written in television
for 26 years and has written for shows
that you love family guy futurama star
trek enterprise and now he's got his
second book out we're gonna talk to
about it the book is called the
autobiography of james t kirk which we
love and the author is david goodman
thank you for being here thank you so
much for having me I'm so excited to our
very first guest on my gosh I I think
that somehow sad I think it's awesome
because you're surprised very good well
maybe someone out there is crying this
is the worst how does someone get to
write the autobiography of jeans okay
I'm gonna hold up the book yeah hey
james team you know no strings a he's a
he is a fictional character yes that's
true so he did not write the book but it
was the idea of the book was this idea
that he's writing it in his own voice
he's towards the end of his life he's
looking back and i got to write it i had
written another book another star trek
both before and a friend of mine named
Dave Rossi who who's worked on a lot of
the Star Trek shows as well this was
actually his idea and he thought I would
be the right guy to write it and I was
very nervous in the beginning to write
it because I can imagine Star Trek fans
are very passionate and if you get it
wrong they don't have to tell you yeah
yeah you know if it's wrong even if you
get it right they'll tell you what's
wrong so it's uh well I am the biggest
star trek fan there's really no way to
prove otherwise also lazy no but we are
talking to the world's greatest and
biggest stars
I forgot to mention that in the
honorific Star Trek Star Trek I'm sorry
I don't think I'm the biggest stars I
like Star Wars not yes Star Trek but um
you know you've what I've watched all
the episodes I've watched all the movies
and it became a bit of a puzzle like
what do we know about him and what needs
to be filled it yeah and it's there was
a lot whole swathes of Kirk's history
that had not been written about did you
get to make it up I essentially made and
how do you get to be able to make it is
there like some sort of core group of
people that maintain yeah james t kirk
or Star Trek Council like a Loremaster
no okay ah that'd be you maybe that is
maybe it's me now maybe it's me now with
the book but the molding it up again but
the mic and Denise okuda I know if you
share familiar with their names they've
been involved with starting for a long
time and they wrote a chronology which
ends up being kind of a source for me of
and in this chronology they place all
the events of Kirk's life that we know
from the series yeah so I know where the
gaps are ya and then the guy at CBS
consumer products i'm john van sitters
big star trek fan i had to basically
clear everything through him okay but
I'm as big a fan as he is so it's not
like we had a disagreement what about
like it can you say something like Kirk
hate sushi or you can you make up little
details like personal details yeah i
mean i could uh I didn't do that unless
I felt it sort of with somebody that
would be like no no he loves seeing well
you could say that because I don't think
they ever showed him eating sushi so I
said it then the cannon would support
that it wouldn't contradict it rang I
would be found out janet and i canna
doesn't contradict assassinating but is
it i thought yeah but the thing that the
the job of the book was to sort of find
things that we haven't said about Kirk
but are there any way so for instance we
know Kirk had a son we find that on the
star trek through the wrath con but if
you do the math of how old that son is
looking at the chronology he was Kirk
was
a dad the whole time he was captain the
enterprise which is a big deal absentee
dad absolutely there so what does that
say about a guy who's like you know /
tuesday work / family so that fat
because and that way from his kid I've
your whole career way never sorry care
so that's a guy making decision the guy
never had never could seem to keep a
girlfriend now what people might say oh
he was having fun but there were all
sorts of things in the original series
that implied that Kirk was very lonely
so what if he's lonely and he's a
good-looking charming guy what what's
the problem so these were all sort of
things that I was kind of playing with
ya without contradicting things we'd see
already is there any comedy in the book
is it is it a straight like legit
autobiography of Curtin you know that it
is straight but like Star Trek which
always had moments of humor there's
moments of humor so for for instance
there's a Star Trek episode where Spock
is getting married and at the end of
that episode dr. McCoy fakes Kirk's
death in front of one of the leaders of
Vulcan and so I have a scene later on
where this leader of Vulcans basically
says what what the her son know what the
hell is what the hell what the Kirk what
the hell what the hell you said you you
were dead what happened and then she
also maybe says he's put on some weight
so that they're there are sort of
moments and then the way I deal with
some episodes which I felt were somewhat
ridiculous a reader reading it might see
that I have that attitude towards that
episode but I'm not dismissing it at all
alright so yeah so in terms of
Technology mean obviously you've written
for a lot of shows that have futuristic
technology them and many of them are
very optimistic about the future so for
you what is the most exciting technology
that exists right now I think it's the
technologies that made that Star Wars
robot toy it's just amazing to me that
they
made that that that is a practical
effect in the movie but then also the
toy exists and we can dial that's
amazing to me i think that that's sort
of comment on the kind of technology
that we sort of take for granted that
that can make this completely accurate
toy which if I was like when I was a kid
that toy would be incredibly
disappointing it would be it would have
two wheels underneath after hanged up
and it would go like this and you know
and and the fact that now kids get to
have that talk so what you're saying is
as the author don't put words my weight
as the author of the auto body is about
autobiography of james t kirk Star Wars
is more exciting than Star Trek I just
you know words so not only am I said
that at all that was uh that was like
its support it doesn't contradict yeah
nothing does gotten bigger cannon you
know there is no star wars without
starter that's again or I've worked with
George Lucas he is a big star trek fan
and he took lots of things and and also
there's lots of parallels between how
Star Trek was originally produced the
technology that they had to create to do
spaceships week in and week out is very
similar to the technology that Lucas had
to create to make Star Wars they were
both groundbreaking properties and they
both created a world that fans love to
live in so there's lots of similar and
another similarity is we're getting a
new Star Wars but it sounds like we're
getting our Trek TV series very exciting
it what are you looking forward to for
that what do you hope that it is I hope
it's smart I'm very excited because it's
clear that CBS CS this is something they
want to be big and succeed and and and
so it'll be it'll be big to me Star Trek
is always about the writing and the Star
Trek shows that i have loved are written
by people who are much smarter than me
so i hope they find somebody much
smarter than me who writes this show
well that's battle do you think um but
even if you even if terrible i'm gonna
watch so yeah of course ya know we will
too if hypothetically speaking let's say
like some day you become the showrunner
of this new star trek universe like or
if we just get if they just said okay
they call you tomorrow and they say
whatever you want to make it would you
make it something
or would you prefer to see something
that already exists in star star trek
Kenan or would you rather see something
brand-new like a new crew on a new ship
I think its new crew new ship I think
that you I think you said it further in
the future I think Star Trek always to
me is always about the time in which it
was made so there is there always
commenting on things are happening right
now and to me you want that show to feel
like it's hat it's in a different era
it's in our new era and it's reflecting
politics social mores who we are yeah
yeah I think that's very of science
fiction in general but specifically
start right well also you know I think
that that's the thing that Ron Barry did
so well this template that he created to
do a show that could be this
action-adventure thing but also have
social commentary I mean that that if
you look back in 1966 and what was on
television at that time it's an amazing
a completely different house that was
the time of all of those the Dukes of
Dukes of Hazzard or even before this I
was like watch TV Green Gables I think
man from uncle or lots of westerns
bonanza out so yeah to take a judgment
warning oh yeah I was definitely me I
born then uh so so what are some of the
adventures that Kurt gets into in the
book is it stuff from the series and
beyond uh I'm filling in his life so I'm
sort of showing how he becomes the
captain we know so life on the farm when
he was born in Iowa life on the farm
whose parents were his connection to
Starfleet and then how he gets into
Starfleet Academy I just I want to show
you guys really quick if we take this
that there are some great pictures in
here I love that their actual there's
some amazing photos of you know when he
graduates the Academy and oh here soon
payments together it's pretty great
you should there's so much great stuff
in here I really and so it's really his
adventures leading up to the adventures
that we know how he becomes the starch
of Captain that were familiar with and
then trying to find ways to talk about
the Avengers we're familiar with in a
new way whenever I'm
summarizing events that were familiar
with I'm injecting a new perspective or
something some detail that connects to
something else later on or earlier on
his life and then really just trying to
create a story of a guy who becomes this
hero but is also tragic in some ways as
well is never really fully happy yet
makes a difference in his world so very
last question I when can Jeff and I buy
tickets to see the oscar-winning biopic
in theaters yeah there you go for that
gonna be up to you guys that's right for
me I have to get this made leaving a
song oh you know I would Jeff and I were
to start production company right get
going all right so guys the book is the
autobiography of james t kirk here it is
i'll show your show to show you this
lovely cover right here the
autobiography of james t kirk you don't
wanna miss it if you especially if
you're a trek fan but even if you're not
a trek fan get into it because there's
gonna be a new star trek soon and you're
gonna want to know all about james t
kirk swan the OG captain of the
enterprise e kappa r OG OG oh I guess

what's a trier book yeah hey I am very
drive alright guys we will be right back
we're gonna take a quick break and then
we're gonna talk about some blizzcon
2015 so don't click weights tomorrow
daily
welcome back to the show that was a
delightful interview it was delightful
he was great and speaking of stuff
that's great we were down in Anaheim
this weekend checking out blizzcon 2015
is specifically looking at the eSports
phenomenon check it out if you haven't
been paying attention eSports is a huge
industry some analysts are predicting it
will net over six hundred million
dollars worldwide in 2015 and it's only
growing at this year's blizzcon
blizzards annual fan convention eSports
proved to be one of the show's biggest
draws the Olympic Games of eSports is
happening here for World Championships
at blizzcon for and it's super exciting
everybody here is really really thrilled
to check this out and see who the
champions are going to be most Game
Studios involved in eSports have a
single game in competition as we
mentioned Blizzard has for starcraft 2
the uber-popular realtime strategy game
that pits Terrans Protoss in Zerg
against one another in a military sci-fi
epic mega MMO World of Warcraft's arena
championships featuring PvP teams duking
it out for glory blizzards newest game
heroes of the storm a free-to-play
multiplayer online battle arena starring
playable characters from every game in
the company's arsenal and hearthstone
the collectible card game for PC
smartphones and tablets that lets
players build custom decks and face off
against local or online opponents there
for very different types of games and
even though every games dev team knows
the ins and outs of each one eSports
players always make it interesting I
think they always surprise us they are
always doing things at a level play that
is so far beyond what any of us are
capable of its gonna deal all the damage
for clock 9
carry the baggage
all those people cheering they're
cheering for a game that just came out
in June starcraft 2 has a long-standing
even bigger fan base with even more
intense fans so exciting and amazing be
able to watch that especially in person
and see your favorite person I'm still
trying to get life's autograph favorite
players and teams are a staple in the
eSports community just like traditional
sports Blizzard is well aware of that
fact and when its developers work on
games with potential eSports components
they definitely like to keep players and
spectators in mind those values that we
kind of instilled to make the play
experience better for the player
hopefully will be valuable for someone
who's watching the game and speaking of
valuable those winners aren't just
walking away with pride the prize pool
across all four championship series at
blizzcon 2015 was 1.25 million dollars
we are in the wrong business and need to
get better at video games it's obvious
that eSports is huge even if you've
never seen a match yeah the whole
convention is built on passion
passionate fans passionate creators and
eSports themselves I think just builds
that passion and builds on that passion
eSports is only gonna get bigger from
here it's true and you know who knows
maybe we'll see one of you here playing
for the world championships next year
uh blizzcon was so good that is that
moment where the player from cloud nine
picks murky the whole crowd just went
ballistic it was such a yeah you see it
in the in the package we just showed
that moment the their team composition
was so bizarre they had one warrior
who's kind of the tank they had two
healers and two specialist murky andaba
thur bizarre team com no assassins in
the team and yet they made it work they
won the game it's that kind of thing I
think that makes this an exciting
spectator sport yeah I mean it's it was
funny I was watching some of the stuff I
missed at blizzcon I was actually like
watching it on my TV last night I pull
up on YouTube and checking it out and I
turn to my husband and I was like is
this who i am now like I'm a sportsman
I'm an eSports fanatic now like I'm like
honey the game's on I'm watching heroes
of the storm yeah shush that's what it
felt like last night it was amazing it's
pretty cool I become so addicted to hear
the storm but you know people have the
same feelings about League of Legends
and dota and mo business particular are
capturing this feeling but I think also
it's it's manifesting in stuff like
games done quick yeah you see these guys
do speedruns who trick the game and to
do anything as it wasn't intended to do
the idea of watching someone else play a
game at a high skill level I think is so
it's catching on and it's so compelling
yeah it's compelling you want to see it
because if you're any kind of gamer
regardless where your casual are really
in the gaming like to see people play at
that level is really impressive like
even I mean I play a lot of video games
but I to watch somebody play something
up splatoon is a great example so I play
a lot of splatoon we know this to see
people play at really high levels is so
impressive to me and sometimes we come
up against these people with you know
with a specific weapon where they're
using it in a way that I'm just like oh
my I can't get around this guy like I
don't know how he's doing it and I wish
I could rewatch those I like just as my
own for my own value yeah but so it
really speaks to that you know the value
again I've spectator for for all of
these games really the only thing I can
equate it to is playing pickup
basketball and then going home and
watching the NBA you know it really is
that same experience and I think that
for this entire generation we're going
to grow up and that's just going to be
normal and it's only going to get bigger
and more tell
lized in more prominent yeah yeah I
agree and blitz kind of general was just
so much fun there was the costumes you
guys amazing and then of course you know
they have all of the games we have to
play some overwatch like we play a lot
of that yeah it was great if we have it
such a good time and and we highly
recommend you check out some eSports
whatever game it is but we specifically
we were at blizzcon and they happen to
have four championships so we check
those out but but yeah it's definitely
worth your time to just watch a match
see if you see if you like it cuz I feel
like some of you really enjoy it and
speaking of stuff we enjoy I think it's
time to talk about into it alright so
I'll let you go first is your first time
on that the long shows it jeez tell me
what you were into this week I can't
wait well I think you know this about me
I am a gigantic hobby board game player
good I slightly knew this the designer
board game movement the european-style
board games if you think board games are
just monopoly and Parcheesi and clue
there's an entire giant giant massive
cool industry happening in and my into
it is uh is a board game that I
kick-started that I got recently and it
is now available anybody can buy it it's
called steampunk rally okay I think this
is right up your alley and that is a
punk rally yeah so you play as one of
the great scientists of history and the
only way these scientists can decide
whether or not they who's the best
scientist yeah I 9 and Tesla and Madame
Curie and all these uh the only way they
can decide who's the best is that they
get together and have a race on machines
that they built and it's just cool like
steampunk giant machines so as you play
you select one of those scientists and
you start constructing this machine in
front of you and you try to race around
this desert environment I already like
this it's incredible so you're you're
you're literally drafting cards and
placing them down in front of you you
have to fit them together to make this
machine work and then you roll dice and
assign the dice to certain parts of the
machine that make it do certain other
things to create more dice to be able to
roll those two then propel your machine
through the race so you're really trying
to build this like perpetual motion
machine with all the different parts
that it's making and the dice that
you're rolling it is extremely fun my
wife really dug it it's one of my
favorite
games that I've gotten recently and it's
about 40 bucks you can buy it now okay I
really really like it hi this is you're
a huge nerd my god finding this out
today Oh is there any doubt until I got
the job like I kind of knew but I didn't
know the depths the depths of the nerd
itude the attitude nerd tassa t you know
what a city will take it up but ya know
this is great this looks really fun I
feel like I want to try it it's cool
because it can play from two to eight
players and there's very few games
nowadays that can play up to eight it's
like really cute four or four to eight
like there's yeah usually eight sold a
lot of number of people and you have a
big party you can still play this game
and it doesn't slow it down because
you're all drafting at the same time
yeah and board games are great if you
know I love video games but there's
nothing like sitting across the table
and being social with someone having
drinks having some food and playing a
physical thing I love him so check out
steampunk rally steampunk rally okay
cool alright well I have something
completely different that I'm into but
it's really really fun and it's super
weird you guys of course it is uh in
1977 this guy his name is Peter stony m
sh Willer Tim Schueler is his last name
uh he interviewed himself in 1977 using
at the time state-of-the-art equipment
and he's calling it later that same life
okay so here he is that's him that's
good old Stoney yeah he's 18 years old
in this and this is shot this is 77 he
put together the sizzle reel and he went
to crowdfunding and say hey listen like
when i was 18 i filmed myself asking
myself a whole bunch of questions about
my life like how my life turned out like
woo did you marry you look really like
just intervista lee totally going host
on himself and interviewing him but no
like he filmed like fake answers like
aha oh my goodness yeah he filmed
responses and he was like he was like oh
oh that's that's really disappointing
like it's reading he basically gave
himself a toolkit for later in life to
fill out and fill in this like kind of a
video journal of his life it's really
impressive it's sort of like you know
those journals are you fill out like
questions and you answer them and then
you go back three years later you
to them again kind of like that but
instead of a couple years 30 38 years
what's so crazy to me about this this
story is that if I had done that in my
what early 20s or you know late teens in
he's in this video I would have done
this way sooner he waits till he's like
50 something years old well I think he
said I'm in the in the crowd fund
website he had said he had a like a
house a minor health scare and it made
him realize like oh I should do this
like I really should absolutely do this
so he went to crowdfunding he asked for
ten thousand dollars right now there's
six days left he has 22 thousand dollars
people really like the idea if he gets
the 25,000 which I really hope he does
he is going to digitally remastered I
old footage he's going to rent a
professional black like a queue but to
like a soundproof black cube to film his
responses in um he used to make films
when he was a kid so some Star Trek it's
great because he did a little bit of it
that you see in the crowdfunding video
yeah and it is I'm fascinated by time
and yeah and and the ravages of diamond
amazing and you see it really draws into
stark contrast like how we change as
people and it's a kind of a beautiful
thing he asks him like how did you meet
your your spouse oh like I mean it's
great it's really a great it's hilarious
it looks really interesting also very
poignant like I think like you said
there's some there's some really deep
kind of ideas here uh but he's here in
Los Angeles so I feel like we all try to
get ahold of him and bring him on the
show how do you have the forethought to
do this when you're young I wish I had I
had had that kind of forethought because
you don't I don't think about myself
well I vote my team let's track him down
let's interview him and get some answers
let's see if he could figure out a way
to interview me when I was a kid maybe
he's a time machine that'd be great I'd
be awesome all right guys it's time for
