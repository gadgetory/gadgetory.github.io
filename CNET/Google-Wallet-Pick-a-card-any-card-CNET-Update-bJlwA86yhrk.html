hoot I'm Bridget Carey and this is your
C hat update
google wallet used to require a citibank
mastercard or google prepaid card well
now google has put the system in the
cloud and it's allowing users to pay
with any major debit or credit card and
as cool as that sounds is still going to
have one of the few sprint devices with
an end of see trip that's because
verizon AT&amp;amp;T and t-mobile they don't
want you using google wallet they want
you to use the competing system that
they invested in isis which has been
under development for more than two
years and there's no clear launch date
the Transportation Security
Administration has been ordered to
address comments and concerns from the
public about its airport body scanners
you see when the TSA started using body
scanners in 2009 the law required a
90-day public comment period because it
could affect the rights of air
passengers but the TSA never did it they
broke the law they were told a year ago
to do it and they still have not now
court says they better respond by the
end of august there's also a white house
petition to force TSA to follow the law
and if it gets enough signatures the
president has to respond critics say the
radiation used to see through clothing
is a health hazard and a threatens
privacy some have posted videos on
YouTube about how they just don't work
now this comment period will give TSA an
opportunity to respond to these critics
here's some news that may be hard to
swallow the FDA has approved pills with
digital sensors that report to a doctor
when you're taking your pill as well as
details about your health the sensor is
about the size of a grain of sand and is
powered by stomach acid it lives in you
for seven days and collects data on your
heart rate temperature body position and
it sends it all to a mobile phone app we
have come across fake accounts on
Facebook but the site has stayed in a
public filing that 83 million accounts
are fake or duplicates that's about
eight point seven percent of total users
while you're waiting for the Mars rover
to land on Sunday you could zoom in on
NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida
to get a street view close up at the
complex the new images were added in
part to honor the Space Center's 50th
birthday want to add some fun to
watching the Olympics on tape delay you
gotta try the TV check-in app into now
it's run by yahoo and it just got an
addictive new feature it's
shazam where it knows what you're
watching just by listening to what's on
TV but after you check in it provides an
endless stream of still fringing the
show pick one add a funny caption and
set it free on Facebook and Twitter to
go viral you'll find yourself refreshing
the clips all night laughing about
captions people come up with during the
games that your tech news update for
