here in Cupertino California at Apple
Park Apple's new campus the company held
its annual shareholder meeting here for
the first time and there were tons of
investors out to learn what's in store
for Apple the first part of the
shareholder meeting is pretty routine
they really like board members they hear
other proposals about compensation this
year there was a proposal from a
shareholder to set up a human rights
committee that did not pass it's really
the second part of the shareholder
meeting that everybody's coming for and
that's the qat with Tim Cook so this is
an opportunity for investors to kind of
ask basically anything they want and we
really saw a lot of that here today one
investor asked if Apple was going to get
into oral healthcare Tim Cook said no we
also had a lot of compliments people
saying how much they liked the campus
people I talked to that was a really big
reason why they wanted to come out here
today they wanted to see what Apple perk
looked like they wanted to go in the
Steve Jobs theater they wanted to see
Tim Cook in person a few things that Tim
Cook talked about that were pretty
interesting he said that mobile payments
hasn't taken off quite as quickly as he
thought it would when I talked to Tim
Cook a couple years ago at an event he
said he believed that Apple would kill
cash now he's saying he hopes that cash
is dead before he dies basically Cook
also talked about health care Apple
really sees this is a big opportunity
for them in doing things that it doesn't
necessarily mean that this is a
something that they have to do to get
reimbursed from the federal government
he also talked about tax reform this was
kind of a huge thing for Apple this year
they have almost three hundred billion
dollars in cash most of its overseas
with the tax reform passed by Congress
Apple's able to bring it back with
paying only 38 billion in taxes Tim Cook
talked about the benefits of that for
Apple and for the shareholders we also
heard about some other areas like
wearables with ear pods Apple watch this
is becoming a really big business for
Apple he said it's about the size of a
fortune 300 company at this point then
there were some other comments about R&amp;amp;D
other random questions there always seem
to be people wanting
Tech supports one woman asked when the
iPhones would be waterproof which
they've been water resistant for a
couple generations now
I'm sure Tipton with CNET news thanks
for tuning in</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
