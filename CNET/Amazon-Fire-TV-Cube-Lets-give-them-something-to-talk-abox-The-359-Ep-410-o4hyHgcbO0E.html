Afra dang Dan that's Myer oh I was gonna
introduce you and we've got with us
David Katz Mayer aka cat's in the cradle
aka whispering damn it see that's a
pretty good intro you should have waited
for it David is here to help us walk
through the new amazon firetv cube a new
alexa powered video streaming box that
the company just announced this morning
the 120 dollar device which is only
available in the US for now can be used
to control your TV cable box sound bar a
and AV receiver using a remote and Alexa
voice commands so David we both got a
chance to demo this thing what are your
immediate thoughts what did you think
like big picture well that's a lot the
simple thing is you can just say Alexa
turn on my TV and it happens and that
happened in our demo amazons guys showed
us that that's pretty straightforward
functionality we actually able to do
that for about a year if you have an
echo and a fire TV this thing builds it
in to one little device and that's kind
of the hook is you can get that kind of
living room voice control without
picking up the remote from one single
thing so you know it's it's a match of a
bunch of different things but the
coolest part is that it blasts out
infrared signals to turn on your TV to
play around with your sound bar volume
up and down that sort of thing just with
voice commands so that's really sweet so
you've been able to do this for about a
year with your other with your other
setup that you have I've been really
skeptical of this since the beginning
like how much of a change is there
really to be able to turn on your TV
with your voice so at home I use a
harmony remote which is a really awesome
universal remote that this thing doesn't
really replace cuz you still have to use
like your remote to do stuff like set
the DVR and and things like that that
require a clicker this thing is great
for turn on the TV turn off the TV
launch Netflix stuff like that like you
know large commands that start something
off but once you get into the Nitty
Gritty of browsing you know it's it's
you're gonna need a remote I mean you
can say stuff like Alexa page down or
you know Alexa right left but that's not
nearly as easy as just pressing about on
our own I think they did a pretty
credible job also saying that you know
there are some
many different apps now specifically
whether you have a Roku streamer amazon
firetv whatever and to a certain extent
I kind of feel like using voice and
doing it with the fire TV cube might
actually be easier just to jump to I
don't know Rick and Morty on Hulu and
then go to I don't know something else
on Netflix whether it's I don't know
what's on Netflix right another thing
really
yeah well the that's nice you are in the
fire TV universe you know which means
that you're gonna be directed toward a
lot of Amazon stuff they were showing us
HBO and Showtime for example that's not
support for those apps that support for
the Amazon channel within the Amazon
universe so you know and Netflix was not
quite as supported as you'd expect you
know they're they're a competitive
service so prime video use a lot of that
stuff is gonna be a lot more useful just
like a regular for our TV I also wanted
to get into you mention harmony already
but how do you think this will stack up
against the competition and where do you
think it kind of fits into that well
first of all it's a really unique device
there's nothing out this like this on
the market right now harmony does a lot
of the stuff but it doesn't have
integrated voice you gotta add you know
echo or whatever to get that to go
there's another device called convo
that's a lot more expensive that's
another universal remote so Amazon's
getting into a space here where there's
not that much competition I mean harmony
kind of rules the roost in terms of
device control so I'm really excited to
see Amazon provide some competition and
you know kind of take these guys and and
make them more voice centric and maybe
you know light a fire under them because
harmonies been the same for a long time
you need like a specific type of
television for this like it needs to be
like the latest like HDTV or something
or you can put on something that's like
10 15 years old yeah so the joy of IR is
that you can use other devices you've
had for a long time and Amazon says they
support for thousands of devices they
say 90% at the cable box they say a lot
of the you know sound bars and other
devices out there so we'll see we'll
take no one taking what there were but
I'm pretty sure that you you're gonna be
able to control pretty much whatever you
have out there no it's pretty cool
either way we're out of time for the
podcast itself so if you want to read
more about these stories check us out on
CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred hang
I'm David cast Meyer thanks for watching
thanks for listening really I said
thanks for thank you via podcast let's
keep it true to form Ben I mean we were
an audio podcast first yeah sorry hey so
now it is time as always for me to jump
into the chat and pull out your
questions and comments and everything
you want to know about this little box
game cube cube 2.0 in the meantime so
David tell me does this instantly render
the fact that I have an echo and a fire
TV completely Moo and I just throw them
away start fresh no unless roam away
anyway we must you've always been
hankering to control that random thing
with your two devices that you can't
control are ready for example if you
have a sound bar and all the volume
comes through that you know you can't
control volume with a fire TV and echo
combination right now so that's I mean
you can't with some TVs but with most of
them you can't which at the demo I think
we were both pleasantly surprised to see
that they went a little bit further than
just creating a fire TV and crammed it
with Alexa and then calling it a day so
to their credit I think they did a good
job in trying to provide a little bit
more value to customers for that but if
you've already got a fire TV streamer
and you've got an echo across the room
you're 95% of the way there what's that
what's like is that customer actually
gonna go and switch and get the cube
they would have to be a pretty rabid
Amazon fan I would argue to do something
like that yeah or the again the kind of
person that has this other device in
their system that they've never been
able to get to work with it you know you
always said to keep your soundbar remote
out to turn it on for example you know
as stuff like that but for the most part
that this does tread on a lot of
territory that Amazon's already been
there by the way I also wanted to
mention if you're really interested in
this device it's on sale for the next
two days today and tomorrow for $90
again it's in the US only but if you're
a Prime customer you can get it for $30
cheaper today or tomorrow
that's a pre-order and then it actually
ships June 21st and we'll probably get a
chance to get our hands on it and spend
a little bit more time with it as we get
closer to that date and David you'll
probably have a fuller review yeah
one of the things I'm really good in is
AV receiver control so that's one of the
key to set ups where the using AV
receiver for the switching instead of
the television be actually see how well
that controls it cuz you got two
different input switching things in the
system and you know a harmony does that
beautifully or for example if you're a
guy that ran out of HDMI inputs in your
using one of these HDMI switches to
throw on you know whatever it is you
know there's a lot of legacy stuff in
people's systems that Amazon's got to
account for especially early you know
when this thing first launched is that
they're gonna probably not be able to
support very well so it'll be
interesting to see how well it actually
you know does that I'd be very impressed
if I could put the echo cube on a on
like an old CRT yeah yeah it don't
control it if it's got the the IR codes
it will and and I think Amazon can
probably do that well one of the things
I asked in the demo was and I wasn't
just being jerk but I said hey can this
thing control an Apple TV or a Roku and
because I mean honestly I like Roku a
lot better than fire TV and I like Apple
TV better than fire TV so I'd want to
use one of these things he's like we
haven't really figured that out yet but
why would you watch them like because
they definitely have a lot of research
going into them yeah right of course
that's the first thing I want to do is
support the competitors product if that
being said do you think that this device
gets them a little bit closer to some of
those other guys no because this isn't
really about streaming this is about
controlling your other stuff I mean
you've been able to control a TV with an
Apple TV since launch for example it
actually has volume buttons on the
remote it can it can turn on your TV
with CEC really reliably and control
volume and you can pick up the remote
and ask Siri for stuff so you know again
this isn't like all new the thing that
is new and cool is the far-field voice
built into one box I feel like the big
bet for this is that everyone loses
their remote controls every day yeah Oh
totally
totally I agree and I was also gonna
like and we should get the question soon
but all right so Amazon key folks right
they come in your house and then they
take your remote control so that you
have to get
firetv cube i like that idea
jacket the pre-chat i hope you're
watching this is this is a great idea on
a first-name basis with good basis I've
never spoken to you together every day
unfortunately I'm pretty sure Jeff
doesn't know I exist but that's okay
well anyway that takes a good segue into
a really good critique coming in from
APEC okay we can always count on for
being my fellow YouTube cynic The Voice
Alexa thing is hilarious how is this
different from what Microsoft did with
tea and the Kinect and the 360 and the
one especially now that the Kinect is
our IP for good reason without I added
that part
well this survive in the long haul he
goes on to say I once had TV av audio
and everything routed through the Xbox
one would connect support for voice
controls and it was great all along with
the gestures and the whole nine yards so
is this really new I mean I would make a
big argument that the big difference is
that like this is like how much cheaper
then yeah and the size yeah yeah and
also like they have a whole like
dedicated like Ewing service for it
right yeah yeah well so does Xbox but I
take your point I mean again this is
stuff that a lot of people in trying to
do for a long time the infrared part of
it is is cool it doesn't just rely on
CEC ostensibly you know with all this
alexa integration you can do different
stuff with skills that you couldn't
begin to do with something like an xbox
I mean that whole universe of extra
stuff is already coming along with this
device like they showed us that Jeopardy
thing for exists which I kind of liked
it was just basically it's the Jeopardy
skill that it shows up on your
television so you see the clues and you
can kind of like play along it seems
like a fully interactive Jeopardy game
so if I if I asked it to play like music
from Spotify like it would show up on
the TV yeah that's really cool with the
lyrics and much better sound than any
echo or da you know because you're
listening for your soundbar or whatever
how much of the audio testing were you
able to do because I know you mentioned
it in your review of your first take
where it's like they adjusted the
microphone so that even if you're
blasting something on your TV to be able
to hear you cuz I always have that
problem with my Google home
like right next to my TV as well mm-hmm
so we you know this was right next to
the TV it was a can demo you know so who
knows from from Amazon when this thing
ships we're definitely gonna want to
test that because you're right
my echo is across the room and I use it
to control the TV with harmony that
works very well because it's far away
from other speakers and I can turn my
head and kind of shout out it if I you
know if I'm in the in the room with a
music playing loud but if it's right
next to the TV they're saying we use
beamforming technology and there's a
primeira phones and there's a bunch of
new crap we need like the microphones up
front which is apparently supposed to
help with that - genius yeah yeah I take
your point I mean it's not an easy thing
and for example Sonos has been
contending with this because their one
speaker so most one speaker has you know
microphones and it plays music loud and
you know it can those two things can
interfere with each other so it takes
some some pretty good tech to be able to
figure it out in the demo it worked
so to their credit it didn't completely
like its he was playing the sound bar
pretty loudly and it would hiccup but to
balance that out there would sometimes
he would query Alexa and it would take
like the second or the third query to
actually get it to do what it yeah which
is pretty typical when you're using
these types so when you use this do you
have to talk to this specific like Alexa
for for it to turn your TV on so what or
like if I'm in my kitchen and I have an
echo they're like turn on TV I don't
know like relay it to like the cube so
usually the way these things work is
that all Alexa's in a system recognize
you so you you talk to them you've set
them up as an Alexa home and and they're
actually supposed to be recognized which
ones closer and have that respond so I
haven't tested it yet we didn't ask that
question but I'm almost positive that in
a home situation with a secondary or
tertiary device you'll be able to do
that kind of TV control as well another
thing to remember is it does come with
the fire TV remote which has voice
built-in so if it can't hear you or if
you're in another room you can pull out
the remote and talk into it and get the
same effect so you know that's another
way to use it that makes it a little bit
more versatile i'm with alfred honest or
no they should have gone for efficiency
i want that thing ready by the time I
make my six-foot journey from my kitchen
to my living room
yeah there's no time to waste here it
works it works really well or or you can
you know you can shout in the bedroom
while you're walking or if you know your
kids are watching
I use this literally
every day kids are watching TV I can you
know hey turn off the TV and it you know
it didn't have to find the remote I
don't wait for the kids to do it it just
I don't know that that actually works
though because there isn't an IR blaster
and the other echo speakers sorry so
what I was talking about well what he's
asking is it requires a network so it
requires this cube to know that there's
another echo speaker and have that
speaker do the kind of control that
turns it on I would be pretty cool I
don't yeah we didn't test that out we
didn't ask yes we'll find out I feel
like I'm asking all the questions
instead of like our viewers so I don't
Brian do we have any more questions
oh absolutely Danny Green wants to know
does this go on or is this going to work
with TiVo great question we don't know I
so when you say work with basically
you're asking does it turn on and switch
to the right input and start me off
because once what else is TiVo do well
you know DVR yeah all that stuff Tebow
does a crap load but most of you're
gonna have to use the remote control to
do of course t-boz his own voice remote
but the whole starting and activity is
kind of what this is about and and
controlling the volume mute that kind of
thing yes I mean you'll be even be able
to say skip forward 30 seconds would be
really cool but we don't know yet so
like this isn't exclusive to just like
Netflix or Hulu like online streaming
stuff right like you can also use that
for like normal TV yes old TV you might
say you could play ESPN live like what
you do is you look at it and we don't
know how complicated the setup will be
for this but when you setup with your
cable box you just say like play ESPN
live and it's gonna know what Channel
tells you so like you know you can say
like play cat videos in a row no to put
like cat videos on I wonder if you say
like play basketball will it like put on
the game itself or will it play like
just like and one basket but like street
ball clubs yeah or or it'll find like
you know a basketball movie yeah there's
a lot of stuff like that that routinely
messes up on alexa and other voice
assistants and it's just a matter of
them being smart enough to prioritize
hey this is what this person means in
context and i see google assistant
honestly is better at that in my
experience then alexa is especially the
entertainment stuff because they've been
working on it for a while but it seems
to know a little
more about what you're talking about
let's let's delve into YouTube by the
way because we just mentioned cat videos
we we asked in the demo how does YouTube
work on this thing I'll let you take it
from there
yeah the interesting thing is so
background YouTube and Amazon have a
little bit of a feud going on where for
example certain Amazon devices like the
show don't have a YouTube app and you
can't use YouTube on them at all which
is an issue because YouTube is gigantic
and awesome
so hey YouTube out there so you with
this thing YouTube works beautifully so
there is no YouTube app what happens is
the same thing happens on any other fire
TV when you activate YouTube it launches
what is actually looks just like an app
but it's a browser and there's a little
bit of a URL there at the bottom but
otherwise it doesn't look anything like
a browser link of it yeah yeah so we
heat the in the demo the dude said you
know YouTube I want to watch some cat
videos popped cat videos on YouTube
exactly like the app experience so
you're missing nothing with this thing
and compared to having YouTube built in
so it's just a different way of getting
but how does the search work on it like
if I said like I want to watch like the
latest episode of the 3:59 right episode
409 like would it like specifically put
that on words yes I mean it again it's
the search worked with that phrasing
Alexa I want to watch the 359 on YouTube
that you know according the demo you
just saw would call it up exactly as
you'd expect and start playing this
amazing podcast alright guys we're
expecting everyone in the chat to go buy
one and test this out and report back to
us thanks specifically with the 359
right now so good such a hard like thing
for it to pick up I think that like I
think we need to keep yeah yeah waiting
for your Alexa to fire back like oh you
should have picked a better name well I
want the other 359 okay we are getting
close to running out of time so let's
try to crank through some more of these
questions because there's some good ones
piling in from Huey yeah Google seems to
be lagging behind Amazon in devices is
it likely that Google will respond with
a similar device in a year or two or is
Amazon finally leaving Google in the
dust
that's a good question from a device
perspective this is actually the 11th
Alexa powered Amazon gadget that I
counted and that feels like a lot to me
I mean like three right so so is more
I don't know I think that Amazon is just
currently in a phase of experimentation
and trying to figure out what's actually
working if you are buying an echo
speaker most of the time it's an echo
dot because the price point is really
good it goes on sale for like between
thirty and forty dollars all the time
mm-hmm
I don't think my immediate impression is
is that the fire TV cube is not going to
be a huge market for them but they're
still trying to experiment and figure it
out and try to see okay where can we
cram Alexa into all these different
places in your home whether it's your
entertainment system or your closet with
the echo look or just like more of a
generalist device with like the echo its
dot and the just like the regular echo
yeah and and some of those devices fall
flat you know like the spot for example
like really the Amazon tap is a really
good example yeah nobody's really buying
that or very few people are buying they
just made the echo look like publicly
available for everyone now - I'm like I
don't think I know what's gonna buy that
one either yeah they just throw as much
as they can at the wall plus they're
hardware company they've a lot more
motivation to come up with different
gadgets whereas Google is much more of a
software company and they're again every
time you talk with IO what they care
about is you know AI and and making
their smart assist yeah in software I'm
smarter I also make the argument that
like Google has been way ahead of Apple
sorry way ahead of Amazon as far as like
TVs go considering that like the
majority of Smart TVs are running
Android like it's not like a like a
smart home thing not now or like a voice
assistant thing but like yeah most like
Smart TVs are running Android aren't
they well if you're gonna compare the
two yeah I mean but Roku TVs is actually
a really better seller than either one
right now and Samsung is the you know
anyway so in terms of smart TV itself
but you're right that Google has a head
start and smart yeah because they've had
chromecast built in on Vizio TVs for
three years now they also have Android
TV on Sony TVs and you know these amazon
firetv Edition televisions are
relatively new best buys to start
selling and stuff like that so Amazon
although but then again Amazon has a
lead in there right there with
chromecast in terms of device sales so
their fire TV devices are really really
popular fire TV stick with the legs of
voice control I think Amazon says it the
best selling device on their site and
that one
yes $40 device so they're both really
into
avy space especially streaming because
amazon wants it you know get you to
watch prime video okay let's take a
quick and easy one from chris is this
faster than the fire TV stick or the
fire TV box
it's from what i saw it's basically the
same as the new fire TV which is hella
fast the new fire TV stick is also
really fast so i think an operational
speed you not gonna see much difference
we neni of them they're all pretty darn
fast from syringe oi speaking of Alexa
do you think Amazon will soon infiltrate
car assistance with dedicated
integration like apple carplay and
android auto currently handful brands
support Alexa Ford Lincoln and BMW yeah
yeah he knows been he knows Oh sir enjoy
knows all friend joy does know more than
I do and most topics so yes the answer
is absolutely yes and that's that's a
big play for for all those companies
because smart home and automotive are
two of the strongest plays for voice
assistance because they're private /
semi private areas where you know you're
not going to annoy people by talking to
your voice assistant and they're a
little bit more contained than doing it
in an open office or a subway let's take
one more from stern joy do you think in
video should focus more on TVs with more
affordable variants of the shield TV yes
the og right there yeah I'd like to see
a cheaper shield something along the
lines of a you know original Nexus
player at a hundred bucks instead of 200
it's a great device with assistant
built-in but I think in videos going in
a different direction more gaming
centric more processor centric like they
show to see yes they actually had a
Nvidia BFG monitor and and that thing is
pretty crazy just like a super
tricked-out gaming smart TV monitor
thing so it'd be interesting to see a
cheaper shield I don't think there's
much room there in the market for those
cheaper streaming devices with Roku and
everybody else playing there the general
takeaway in the chat right now is that
Amazon just seems to be kind of flooding
things throwing everything at the wall
seeing what sticks and maybe that could
backfire them could we see any potential
negative results of them just cranking
Alexa into every device next one the
spoon right if I read right the Alexa
spoon yeah yes if if you're like a brand
new customer to this kind of stuff it's
possible that you would just get over
well
didn't like move away and try to find
something else to do but okay
maybe you would consider Apple but the
home pot is three hundred and fifty
dollars and there's only one of them but
at the same time it doesn't really
provide you nearly as much optionality
to the point of like you would really
want to have that device if you were
gonna spend there antimony and and once
they get their hooks into you with a dot
for 50 bucks or 40 bucks or whatever it
is your next thing is like oh I really
like this thing what can I put in the
living room what can i you know put you
know elsewhere in the house what can I
do for this and that and that's what
they're trying to do is ramp you up as a
lifetime ecosystem customer yeah at some
point I expect them to trim this
portfolio but they haven't really yet
I'm surprised I haven't discontinued any
of this like the Amazon tap seems the
most likely that they would discontinue
at some point but they haven't even done
that yet so I don't know I would say
wait to see that but like I said before
at this point they're in like flood the
zone their interpretation phase yeah I
think that's been mirrors gonna be the
first one to faceplant I would say look
for like a home pod mini that's probably
like the most likely new smart speaker
that I would hope to see sometime later
this year and next year because like
Google already jumped into that space
Amazon's been doing that really well I
don't know what a home pod Mini price
would be it would probably be at least
$100 actually more expensive that's it's
smaller though and he's super thin I
would love to see that even though
syria's like a much weaker voice
assistant but I think Apple will
probably inevitably have to do that but
guessing the future is a fool's errand
Scott my it's still waiting for Alexa to
Pier and a Smart Watch wants to know if
anyone else is interested in that cluck
says when will Google duplex be able to
tell Alexa to turn on your TV
yeah can you turn on the TV for one
please about three almost at a time
couple more cookies let's talk about
going around the horn from the other
integrated smart home entertainment
systems Josh asks why doesn't the Sonos
beam include a fire TV it's already got
the Alexa on it
probably cuz it's not really about video
I think that's one of those things where
it's designed to be an audio centric
device first and foremost and Sonos is
really good with their audio ecosystem
and they don't want to really dip their
toe in that area again where it's very
very crowded already will you be able to
run your own apks or Kodi on the fire TV
cube I'm guessing yes Amazon has a lot
of traction with that kind of stuff with
the fire TV universe the stick is super
popular with preloaded you know apks in
the shady realm of things so I can't
imagine they would turn any of that off
for this device and one more from Josh
is this the first time that they've made
something cheaper for Prime members they
make everything cheaper for Prime
members they're desperately hoping that
you join prime because it's another one
of those elements where they get their
hooks in you they make shipping cheaper
for Prime members are you kidding yeah
how quickly do they arrive like they I
don't know every I don't know okay
there's like three to five days would be
pretty good I didn't really say if it
was to joining some that's not possible
there's no way actually one more let's
take one from Yahoo how much is this FBI
proof I'm assuming that this is in the
air of security and everybody's cameras
it's not a burden it's not FBI FBI proof
nothing is FBI yeah there's there's
absolutely no way especially the fact
that it is a like it records your voice
it sends it to Amazon servers I mean
they could subpoena Amazon for it
there's been that like murder trial
where Amazon just gave up that data to
them that wasn't the FBI that was just
like the local police okay the alleged
guy yeah agreed to get the data release
yeah just to throw that out okay but
like still like it was the local police
who asked for it right yeah yeah it's if
you're concerned about this data getting
into an Amazon server don't buy this
device it's just if you're uncomfortable
with it it's not gonna work don't get
any voice assistant if you're worried
about like you know police or
any like law enforcement like trying to
listen in on you or get and you don't
use a phone either yeah maybe just go
