killing plants with Facebook I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your cnet update you
can log into websites by using your
Facebook credentials but how about
paying for stuff with Facebook the
social media giant is apparently working
on a new payment feature according to
all things digital Facebook is planning
to test a mobile payment service in the
next month or so it would little pay for
products with just their facebook login
the idea is that you would have credit
card info stored in your profile and if
a mobile app asked for a payment it
could just tap into the card you have on
file with Facebook the network will
partner with the shopping site
Jackthreads to test it out but if this
takes off it would compete with services
like PayPal imagine seeing a pay now
with facebook button when you're
shopping online you can turn any wall or
flat surface into a touch screen with
new software called ubi that uses
microsoft kinect for windows sensor
along with a projector it can be used
for business meetings store displays or
even just playing angry birds on the
wall the Ubisoft where starts at one
hundred and fifty dollars but you do
have to buy the kinect sensor and the
projector separately kin shows are the
hot battleground for streaming services
as Amazon and Netflix fight over having
more content to babysit your kids
Netflix made a deal to show scholastic
programs like the Magic School Bus and
goosebumps although those shows are kind
of old there is new kids content on the
way it's working with DreamWorks to
bring 300 hours of original kids
programming based on DreamWorks movie
characters and Netflix also has the
rights to some PBS shows amazon is also
pushing to create its own original shows
and it recently scooped up the rights to
show Nickelodeon content if you're
looking for a simple puzzle game to kill
time check out dots it's a popular free
iOS matching game and it just arrived on
Android and on the kindle fire but if
you like a little more adventure in your
mobile games get out your sunflowers the
zombies are coming the
highly-anticipated plants vs zombies
sequel has arrived and this time you're
not defending your house
from waves of the undead plants vs
zombies 2 sends you back in time to new
lands yo battle ancient Egyptian mummy
zombies and pirate zombies and cowboy
zombies in the Wild West there were also
new types of plants and different
power-ups but if you're a real big fan
of the game you might be sad to learn
that some of the plants from the
original are locked behind a paywall you
don't need them to beat the game but if
you want squash snow pea and jalapeno
you have to pay up that's your tech news
update and you can read up on more
