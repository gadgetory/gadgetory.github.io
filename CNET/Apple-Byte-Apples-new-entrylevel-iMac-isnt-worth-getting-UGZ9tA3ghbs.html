to the Apple buy for all the good and
bad inside the world of Apple there's a
new iMac kind of and more iOS device
rumors so let's get to it and Apple
released a new iMac this week but it's
not a speed refresh for the entire line
like we're expecting instead it's an
entry-level 21.5 inch iMac with the
starting price of 1099 the price sounds
nice and you have the option to get a
fusion drive on this model but tear
downs show there's no expandable memory
option because it's soldered onto the
motherboard no bueno
now Geekbench speed benchmark tests show
that it performs pretty much the same in
its single core test but it was
significantly worse in its multi-core
tests with the score of 54:35 the
previous 21 inch iMac in a score of 90
204 now maybe it's because they're using
an ultra-low voltage 1.4 gigahertz dual
core i5 processor the same one used in a
MacBook Air so even if you're saving
$200 you're not getting desktop level
performance
you're getting a 21.5 inch MacBook Air
I'm sorry Apple biters I love the iMac
line but do not do this I'll ride in
phone use Amazon released their first
smartphone called the fire phone with
its 3d like dynamic perspective
interface that looks cool and its
ability to add almost anything you see
or hear to your Amazon card now I don't
expect this phone to be huge just yet
but keep your eyes on what they're doing
because they have the second-best media
ecosystem behind Apple's an t-mobile is
offering a new plan in partnership with
the big a that will allow you to test
run an iPhone 5s or the latest future
phone on their carrier for seven days at
no cost with unlimited data use in an
attempt to win you over if you like
their coverage service it's the first of
its kind they're calling it 7 nightstand
and they're also starting a new plan
where any music you stream from the top
services like Pandora iHeartRadio and
even iTunes radio will not count against
your data cap at all now I never thought
of it before but if they get the iPhone
6 I'm gonna
take them up on this offer and see how
it works for me in San Francisco
all right Apple has seeded the latest
updates for OS 10 Yosemite and the
second iOS 8 beta alongside the new
Apple TV OS beta as well Apple still
hasn't made OS 10s dark mode as an
available setting yet but you can get a
glimpse of it here thanks to Hamza stood
with this terminal command it's not
really even fully complete yet so just
look at these images instead or do this
at your own risk and yes there's also a
terminal command to undo this now the
latest Apple TV also looks to get some
iOS 8 features with iCloud family
sharing it's not functional yet but we
can expect users will be able to log in
with a single account and access music
movies and photos from other devices on
the same family sharing account it also
looks like the Apple TV will be able to
integrate with Apple's handoff feature
on some level after users running the
latest betas are seeing a notification
like this appearing on their Macs
now there are no direct references but
one possibility is that if you're
watching iTunes content instead of
throwing to your Apple TV via airplay
when you come home it would
automatically be synced from that point
from the cloud for you to continue
watching your movie again it's all
speculation and we'll just have to see
how this evolves in iOS device rumors
not many new rumoured details but a
couple interesting nuggets from the
economic Daily News that may or may not
be true like others they believe the
iWatch will be introduced at the end of
q3 2014 and according to them the iWatch
is expected to use an OLED display but
prototypes are still having power issues
they also claim the rumored 4.7 inch
iPhone 6 we use Corning's Gorilla Glass
for the display while the larger 5.5
inch iPhone will sport the sapphire
crystal screen but is having low yields
due to production issues but overall
rumours are still split over if this
sapphire display will be for all new
iPhone models or just the larger screen
one and details inside the latest Xcode
and iOS 8 reveal the next gen iPhone
could include a new sensor a barometer
now a barometer sensor is commonly used
for a measuring altitude and can be
found in the Galaxy Nexus but it could
be more important for more active
lifestyle users like hikers
bike riders or aspiring mile-high club
members who want accurate altitude
information now barometers can also
measure temperature and other weather
information but having a dedicated chip
would provide instant data and could
also aid their compass application than
working on all right guys that's gonna
do for this week's show send us your
emails to the Apple bita cnet.com or
tweet me at brian tom thanks so much for
watching and we'll catch you guys next
time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
