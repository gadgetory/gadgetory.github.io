looking at Xena work this one is a dual
stick shooter and it has just amazing
graphics there's actually really
mind-blowing just the first time you
play has a move around left side moves
right side fires now the object is to
clear out each level it's sort of like
Angry Birds you can get a three star
rating here's another thing that's good
to know is that you press the pause
button that's right here you can see an
overview of the map and this is really
good because if you want to get that
three star rating you want to kill every
enemy and you can see that the enemies
are here in red and this is also another
secondary objective here that I'll need
to get also notice that these arrows in
the upper left shows which direction I
should be going a lot of things in the
game are destructive so even these soda
machines here can blow them up doesn't
give any points or anything but it's
cool that it works alright so here on
the screen that comes between levels you
see over here you have the leaderboard
there you're selecting your primary
weapon I'm gonna buy this one because I
have 10,000 coins this one costs 500 and
then my secondary weapon I always like
to have like a shotgun but maybe how
about a grenade launcher since that's
exciting and then you also can change
the load out of your character so
actually well I got the money I might as
well get this medium armor for 10,000
and the most expensive one is 25,000 and
of course you can also buy more money
but here's the thing about this is that
I founded this to be a really good deal
so $0.99 for 10000 that's quite a lot
and then only 399 for a hundred thousand
so really if you like this game and you
want to you know get a step ahead and
buy all the weapons you want 399 is not
too bad a price in my opinion you know
that sometimes your gun overheats you
have to switch weapons really quickly
it's sort of that sort of looks like a
yeah
and I'm dead see you next week</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
