came out your five-year-old gaming PC
may be beginning to feel like a gaming
relic but the great thing about gaming
on the PC is the inherent flexibility
and we're gonna explore that flexibility
as I show you three ways to enhance your
PC's gaming performance solution one
upgrade your graphics card drivers this
is the simplest way to increase your
performance so it's a Skyrim and it's
running at medium settings in 1920 by
1080 resolution and as you can see it's
running pretty smoothly this isn't the
most taxing game and also I don't have a
settings set too high but you can always
use better performance and downloading
the latest drivers can ensure that
you're running as optimally as possible
now our graphics card is an NVIDIA
GeForce 9800 GTX so we're gonna go to
the Nvidia comm right click then click
on the drivers go to GeForce drivers
we're gonna select G for series 9
because that's what we have make sure we
have windows 7 64 bit because that's
what we're using and then we're gonna
click start search now we're gonna click
on the latest draft card drivers we're
gonna click agree to download and now
it's downloading so once it's downloaded
we're gonna double click to install
but yes okay
all right so now we've installed the
latest drivers and we're back in Skyrim
we looking at the same scene we were
looking at before and I'm not seeing
much difference at all and that's the
thing about graphics drivers you're not
gonna see a huge dramatic difference by
downloading the latest drivers however
what they can do is make your game more
compatible with your graphics hardware
solution number two is to optimize your
games settings now I have a game called
sleeping dogs here running on my older
brightest part with the latest graphics
card drivers now today looks pretty good
it's running at a decent framerate
however the textures and lighting are
set pretty high
the lighting is pretty dramatic there's
shadowing on the characters that you can
see the shadows of the fans on the
ceiling on the floor however it's not as
smooth as I would like I feel like it's
not as responsive as it should be like
my button presses don't correspond
one-to-one with my actions on screen
now there are two ways to address this
the first is to go into the actual game
settings and change the settings
manually the other way is to download an
application that'll do it for you so
we're gonna go into sleeping dogs
display settings so we're gonna take the
settings down to the lowest possible
level or turn them completely off and
then go through each one and take the
settings off or take them to the lowest
possible level and save the settings I'm
gonna go back to the game so you see
that these shadows are gone you don't
see the fans shadows on the floor the
detail in the backgrounds are gone and
you don't see as much lighting on the
characters however the game is a lot
smoother it's more responsive to my
button presses and it just feels from a
gameplay perspective a lot a lot tighter
okay this might be a little too plain
for some of you however so what you can
do you can go back to the settings and
then start turning on different options
one by one and seeing how they affect
your game their goal should be to have a
smooth experience well I'll still have
an anesthetic LEEP easing game
solution number three is to buy and
install a new graphics card now this is
the most dramatic way to increase your
graphics card gaming performance but
also the most costly graphics cards can
cost anywhere from 150 till whopping
$3,000 and of course the more you pay
the more dramatic the performance
increases are going to be now ideally
you want your game to run about 60
frames per second however we have a six
year old card here so we have to turn a
lot of the graphical effects off so we
run it at 30 frames per second here
which is good for a gameplay not as
optimal as 60 and also the game just
isn't as pretty as it can be muddy
textures simple lighting you don't even
see a shadow below her there's no real
lighting on top of hers all light Maps
it's not real lighting so when it's kind
of blowing in the background you see a
little bit of mist but not much detail
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna
upgrade our rappers car in order to get
better performance
so now have the new graphics cart
installed this is two meter running at
the same exact settings as my old cart
see that the detail is the same but the
spring rate is much smoother what I'm
gonna do now is turn the graphics
settings all to their highest possible
settings just to see it how far we can
push this car with this game and wow
that is a huge improve looking lighting
look at her hair look at the textures
and the frame rate holds up is really
still smooth like her model just looks
much more realistic than it did before
and the lighting on her is also much
more realistic and like I said just as
smooth as it was on the old car with the
really really low settings this is
really impressive to tell the myths
still the detail here looks really
really nice even a detail of the dust
and rubble kicking up on her feet
they're like that now giving you three
different options to help improve your
PC gaming so hopefully one if not all of
them will help you do just that
