luxury gonna do both well at almost 17
feet long I've got a lot of cabin room
in this 2015 audi s8 for luxury
appointments I'm riding on an air
suspension
I've got adaptive cruise control Bang &amp;amp;
Olufsen stereo with 19 speakers and oh
yes massage seats but this is the s8 the
sport version of Audi's a 8 so I've also
got 520 horsepower and torque vectoring
now wheel drive it makes this big sedan
feel absolutely nimble howdy says zero
to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds
calling something of this size with a
sedan body a sports car would start a
bar fight among some car enthusiasts but
from the driver's seat I'm feeling that
Sports applies the s8 twin turbo
four-litre v8 puts out 520 horsepower
481 pound-feet of torque and when I
floor it this thing really sleeps
forward and it makes a great noise too
but it's in the turns when the s8 really
shows it's tough the air suspension
keeps the car really level the all-wheel
drive gets all tires gripping and the
torque vectoring actually puts more
power to the outside rear wheel in a
turn so I can feel the back end of the
car be pushed around those corners it
really helps the handling incredibly
well this dynamic setting is really good
but it makes the s8 pretty high-tempered
I don't want to drive with it and stop
and go traffic so let me dial it back to
the comfort setting and by dial I do
mean dial this is using Audi's
Multimedia Interface or MMI and that
suddenly loosens up everything it makes
the car just more manageable even with
520 horsepower that that power comes on
a lot smoother from the throttle but
even with this air suspension I don't
think out he really has the ride quality
dialed in for the comfort mode on an
undulating section of freeway I could
feel the car porpoising that's kind of
going up and down and was making me a
bit seasick but the massage seats go a
long way to make up for that for
navigation I'm looking at satellite maps
from Google Earth brought into the
system
for a 3d data connection Howdy's newer
models have 4G but the s8 hasn't been
upgraded yet
howdy integrates online destination
search here really well I can enter any
search term using this rotary controller
or tracing letters on the touchpad and
it gives me results from Google one
problem here when I plug my iPhone into
this adapter cable in the console the
car tells me I need to turn off
Bluetooth before it can connect that's
kind of stupid I've been in plenty of
other cars that can switch between
Bluetooth and a cable connection
seamlessly
why can't out II this car has the beggin
offs an audio option and it sounds great
nineteen speakers 1400 watts this is a
true audio file system to expand on the
comfort and convenience theme this s8
has adaptive cruise control which will
automatically slow down for slower
traffic ahead it's got a blind spot
monitor and that flashes a warning when
their cars in the lanes next to me and
it's got a surround view camera that
makes parking quick and easy I've also
got a head-up display but it only shows
speed and rudimentary turn guidance Adi
could do more with that
all right let's price at our 2015 audi
s8 base price is 115 thousand eight
hundred twenty-five dollars and that's
pretty well equipped but the GoSee net
style let's have the Bengal Olufsen
audio package sixty three hundred
dollars and the driver assistance
package for only twenty one hundred
dollars and we're looking at a total of
a hundred twenty four thousand two
hundred twenty-five dollars back to the
question of sport versus luxury has
really impressed with the S eights
handling for such a large car on the
luxury side of things the ride may not
be as smooth as I would have liked but
the connected capital echt Ronix the
stereo system and those massage seats go
a long way to make up for</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
