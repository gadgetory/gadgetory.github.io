CES talking to eric schweig who is
designed these robotic toys modular
robots show us what they are tell us
what they do all right this is cubelets
and it's a modular robotic construction
kit for kids like we used to play with
Legos and erector sets and we were kids
and these are construction kits with all
sorts of robotic elements built in a
bunch of different cubes they all do
different things the black blocks or
sensor blocks like a temperature sensor
a light sensor or a distance sensor that
can detect my hands right the clear
blocks are action blocks so they do
things that like the outputs like a
speaker block or this flashlight block
or a bar graph block with a little block
with wheels that's driving around one of
these guys and all the colorful blocks
in between are thinking books so they're
like little bits of intelligence that
you might embed in between the inputs
okay so what kind of things can these
robot to do once you build on it sounds
like you can build them in any way you
really want put them together in any way
mobile robots the drive around on the
table you can create robots that
communicate with each other you can make
a robot to drive until its senses the
edge of the table and stops but
basically you're building additively so
we'll start out with maybe the simplest
possible robot you can build say one of
these one sensor a light sensor and one
actuator a bar graph cover up the light
sensor and the bar graph goes down then
you can add some intelligence in there a
pink block is an inverter blog put it in
between and it reverses the behavior
cover up the light sensor and the bar
graph goes up so it's building
intelligence additively of the robotics
entity and then what's the end product
put the end product little robots to
drive around flash chase each other and
little competitions with very design
interactive sculpture or create a
security system for your room that
sounds a siren when your sister steals
your diary so I've been at this booth a
lot today it looks like there's been
intense interest how long does it take
to get one of they cost it's insanity so
right now we're taking pre-orders we're
sort of borrowing money from our
customers to fund our next round of
manufacturing it's 160 bucks for a
starter kit of six and I think if you
pre-order now I think we're shipping
around April
thanks so much thank you I'm Paul Sloan
with seen it and we've been talking to
Eric like art of modular robotics</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
