for Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update one of Microsoft's biggest
selling points for the Xbox one is the

amount of resources the company has sunk
into the technology that's resulted in
some 300,000 servers worldwide the
latest of these investments is that just
announced 700 million dollar server farm
in Iowa that will handle Xbox in office
365 cloud computing when Google decided
to shut down its reader service it
opened the door for other third parties
to take advantage of the void joining
feedly and dig AOL is now launching a
similar service that will allow the
aggregation of RSS feeds AOL reader is

to complement Google+ well one site says
they think they've uncovered a feature
that google has secretly been working on
that will allow users to keep track of
their belongings so what does that mean

vine are being leaked out through none

the feature list but we'll know soon
enough after an app update now would you
rather rent a movie that's still in
theaters I know I would and that's
exactly what Disney and Sony Pictures
are experimenting with in South Korea on
a trial basis the same model may not go
over so well in the US though as regal
and AMC the two largest theater chains
in the US won at least 90 days to play
movies before they're offered somewhere
