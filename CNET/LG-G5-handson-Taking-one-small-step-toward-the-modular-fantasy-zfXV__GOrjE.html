the boldest and most unique flagships LG
has designed in a long time for one
thing LG went with an elegant aluminum
design but instead of ditching the
removable battery which a lot of phone
companies have done with their top tier
phones the g5s battery pulls out at the
bottom of the phone second LG released
and this is just an estimate about a
bajillion other products in conjunction
with the g 5s launch some are standard
like a new Bluetooth headset while
others tread into new territory for LG
like a house monitoring robot and a
refreshed VR headset but one interesting
thing is the cam plus which is a camera
grip that connects modularly when you
detach the handsets bottom chin it has
physical shutter buttons to record and
capture video and a zooming dial while
the accessory itself is pretty basic it
does mean that LG is dipping its toes
into swappable phone parts which has
long been considered the next big step
in the mobile industry lastly the LG g5
has two rear cameras you have a standard
16 megapixel shooter and an 8 megapixel
camera with a wide-angle 135-degree lens
this means you could fit more into the
frame and you could switch seamlessly
between the two cameras when you zoom in
and out of course the g5 wouldn't be a
flagship without all the other stuff
that keeps it competitive the 5.3 inch
handset has a fingerprint sensor a USB
type-c port a Snapdragon 820 processor
and expandable storage it also runs
google android 6.0 and it's screen has
an always-on mode which displays basic
info even when your device is sleeping
while no exact pricing or availability
information has been released yet the
company is looking at a retail launch
sometime in april</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
