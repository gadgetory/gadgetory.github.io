home TV I'm Bridget Carey and this is
your CNET updates game pop is one of
several Android based game consoles and
it just announced it'll be offering a
new free mini version of the game pop
with a seven dollar monthly game
subscription that subscription is said
to give you access to more than 500 paid
Android games there is a larger more
powerful cube that is free with
pre-orders before June 30th but as of
Monday that cost $130 they both can play
the same games there's also a report
from The Wall Street Journal that Google
wants a piece of this Android game
action and it's working on its own game
console it could be a remake of the
failed Nexus Q sphere if you subscribe
to Netflix and if you have a PlayStation
3 then say hello to max it's a new
Netflix interface available on the ps3
that recommends movies and television
shows for you to watch but he doesn't
with a goofy game show host personality
low rating game ready set go max gives
suggestions in different ways you can
rate a few titles and he gives a
suggestion and a pitch about the show
it's man vs. machine time and the
machines look like us you can also pick
a show between two celebrities or two
comically different categories there's
also Max's mystery call it will just
randomly pick something based on what he
knows about you depending on how this
trial goes on the ps3 Netflix may expand
this to devices like the iPod Google's
next version of Android has been spotted
in the wild the blog sam mobile
published leaked screenshots of Android
4.3 running on the Google Play edition
of the galaxy s4 looks like the next
version will still be called jelly bean
if these images are accurate the latest
rumors say this upgrade could launch in
July
Time Warner Cable subscribers will be
able to watch live TV channels using the
Xbox 360 instead of their cable box
later this summer a Time Warner Cable
app will launch on xbox live so if you
have another TV in the house and you
don't want to pay for another cable box
you can't just hook up the Xbox to watch
up to 300 channels of live TV and and I
thought it was already dead news
blackberry announced it will
no longer upgrade the PlayBook tablet to
the BlackBerry 10 operating system and
the company will rather focus on
smartphones for now today's app to watch
is we heart it it's a social network for
sharing photos of cool things similar to
Pinterest this app says it has more than
20 million monthly users what makes it
different from Pinterest is that it's
more about sharing inspirational or
creative photos rather than a place to
collect recipes and wedding wish lists
that's your tech news update you can
