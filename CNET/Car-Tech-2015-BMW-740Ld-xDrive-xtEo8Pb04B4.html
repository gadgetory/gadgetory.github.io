continues and this is BMWs latest
lecture let's drive to 2015 BMW 740il D
the most prestigious u.s. BMW to yet get
a diesel and check the tech now first
off all seven diesels are long wheelbase
and all-wheel drive it's the only way
they come I'm big on the long wheelbase
part because to my mind all sevens ought
to be I don't get buying a car of this
size and cost then you take out some
guests for dinner or something and
they're on the back going it's kind of
tight in here you got to move your seat
up it defeats the purpose of this now
the heart of the matter on any car that
has a D at the end of its BMW badge is
the D here it is this is your 3 litre
inline-six turbo diesel moving a nearly
4,700 pound car this is relatively
petite displacement for that job but
because the diesel the torques there to
get it done 255 horsepower but 413
pounds eat of torque that's the magic
number here the 60 despite all this
weight is just a little over 6 seconds
your mpg is 23 31 as I mentioned all
these diesel sevens are going to be
all-wheel-drive and they all go through
an 8-speed conventional but very refined
automatic now this has twin power turbo
that is not the same as a twin turbo
typically you wouldn't do that on an
inline this is a twin geometry turbo
actually can have multiple geometry
because it can change the way the veins
inside it operates so it works better at
lower or higher rpm notice that red line
on the tach is not typically diesel low
this guy can run high rpm or grunt down
low
now inside there's not a whole lot
changed here from a slew of other BMWs
we've reviewed so I'm not going to spend
too much time in here let me call out
some highlights though the instrument
panel on this car is now all LCD
including those two ancillary gauges on
the far ends although they mimic a
traditional dial gauge as do the two in
the middle but notice an interesting
trick the needles visually pass behind
the numerals we know the iDrive system
and of course the seven puts it on a
nice big screen with the big controller
the current generation has a handwriting
touch pad on the top and you know I
gripe a lot about BMW nickel-and-diming
you on the Alucard option sheet for so
many things that cheaper cars include
standard but they're getting away from
that a bit 7 Series now has BMW online
and BMW apps standard high-end Bluetooth
kit and USB jack for audio are now
standard now the driving controls are
familiar paddles on the wheel this
spatula shape shifter here and then of
course your drive mode controls what
might surprise you in a 7 with a
smallish diesel is that you've got not
only in Eco mode - comfort modes and -
sport modes including a Sport Plus you
can see it changes up the instrument
panel rather markedly something the old
dial gauge car couldn't do the first
thing you notice about 740 d is it's got
a certain note or a tone to it different
than the gas engine cars that are
smoother and less intrusive right there
sporty actually I don't think anybody
can object but it is a different sound
in the gas engine vehicle now the real
fun comes when you get into the Sport
Plus you also see that it indicates that
Stability control is off I assume that
means it's mostly off why in god's name
would you want to have no stability
control on a giant luxuries 50 you're
never taking this thing to the track and
if you are you need a new hobby or
another one but I gotta tell you this
car gets around a corner and uses that
torque nicely the nice thing about a
diesel of the turbo is you don't have
the same turbo lag as a gas engine
because you've got diesel grunt at the
bottom to get you going
even before the turbo spools up I guess
you can tell this is probably
favorite 7-series there is nothing wimpy
or downmarket feeling about it even
though it's got a smallish inline-6
that's a good sounding car and by the
way what's not hurting its handling is a
near-perfect 50:50 weight distribution I
was surprised to see that okay a 740 LD
is about 83 5 bass I'm not going into
details CNET style because we're really
focusing on its diesel nough supplies to
say you can spend 12 even 15,000 more
pretty easily getting it done our way
now the real story here are the numbers
around the diesel the diesel engine in
this car adds 1500 above a comparable
gas engine 740 it also adds four miles
per gallon more efficiency average
looking at today's price of us diesel
fuel versus us premium per gallon you're
not saving a ton of money per year at
the 15,000 miles average your payoff on
this car's diesel engine would be like
17 years so it doesn't make total sense
financially to pick up one of these
diesels however if you appreciate its
everyday luscious diesel torque as I do
especially this kind of a car that's a
small premium to pay on a car that's
expensive
secondly this is a good hedge against
the expected and perhaps pronounced
spike in those u.s. fuel prices I'm
comparing diesel now against almost
historic lows on gas at the pump that
may not stay that way in this car and
its owners man up having the last laugh</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
