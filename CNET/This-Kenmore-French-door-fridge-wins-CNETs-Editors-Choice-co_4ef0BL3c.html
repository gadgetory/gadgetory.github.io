with the Kenmore Elite French door
refrigerator model number seven two four
eight - winner of our editor's choice
now like all Kenmore appliances this is
actually another manufacturer's bill
that Kenmore has bought to sell at Sears
under the Kenmore name in the seven two
four eight to s case it's an existing LG
model that they're selling now it's not
exactly the same but it's quite a bit
like the LM XS 307 8 6 s a very nice LG
French door fridge that I reviewed a few
weeks back it's a model that offers
great features very solid performance
and good overall value despite a pretty
high price tag this offers all of that
as well at a much lower price tag
selling for 2950 compared to well over
$3,000 that other LG model so you're
getting all the LG bells and whistles
here at a much lower price chief among
those bells and whistles is this pantry
drawer this is the custom children from
LG but Kenmore just calls it a pantry
drawer like the custom Childre you can
adjust the temperature in this thing
from a couple of different presets that
are specific to different ingredients I
like it a lot it adds a lot of storage
space to the overall fridge capacity I
also like that you get plenty of
vertical clearance here about five
inches of height to work with that's one
of those subtle little specs that
actually makes a big difference in the
overall usability of this fridge inside
you've got a lot of the standard
high-end French door features you want
to see you get spill proof shelves
you've got a sliding shelf you can push
back to make room for tall items and
you've got this slim indoor icemaker
that's the same as the slim space plus
icemaker in LG fridges I like this a lot
it moves the icemaker out of the body of
the fridge and puts it totally into the
door and keeps it flush so that those
shelves they're easy to get things in an
attic now combined with the pantry
drawer you get over 21 cubic feet of
fresh food storage space which is just a
terrific number we had no problem
whatsoever fitting all of our test
groceries into it all the stress test
items didn't have to move the shelves
around at all at all just fit and
there's plenty of room to spare just
fantastic performance was solid too it's
very accurate temperatures that's at
just slightly above the target
temperatures the only drawback I found
is that like some of the LG fridges
we've tested that right door tended to
run a little warm with hot averages
across the three shelves not that bad
not that big a deal but still something
to keep in mind another drawback you can
only get this fridge in a white finish
or a black finish left that's a
deal-breaker for you you have a
stainless-steel kitchen you want
something to match this won't do the job
still as such a well-rounded high-end
fridge at less than $3,000 this is just
a terrific value and I'm looking to buy
a high-end large sized French door for
my kitchen this is the one I'm going to
go with and that makes it an editor's
choice you'll find funny more in my full
review at cnet.com and feel free to
field any fridge questions my way on
Twitter for CNET appliances I'm Randy</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
