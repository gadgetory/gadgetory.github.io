controlled not just your cell phone but
in fact your entire home I'm Jessica
Bell court for CNN here at CTA 2012 in
the lovely Garden District of New
Orleans where AT&amp;amp;T has set up a concept
connected home that would control
everything from your security to your
appliances let's take a look so here we
are inside the house where me and talk
about some of the security features
there are a couple things that happen
first there are these physical sensors
that are going to go on the windows on
the doors they're going to look a lot
like this they're very sensitive when
you move them two things happen first
there's a physical response inside the
house whatever you program the lights to
go on you're going to program the
strobing light to go on program the TV
to Blair or the radio to Blair and that
will let whoever tampers with your home
know that you know that they're there
the second thing that happens is that
AT&amp;amp;T is monitoring so they'll get an
alert that something has happened to
your house they'll call the numbers on
there they'll send out a responder a
dispatcher there is of course an
application component as well for
tablets and smartphones on the
application you can see any security
cameras you have there are two in this
house you can tap on the security image
to change the angle of the camera and
press refresh to watch in real life
there are also a lot of other things you
can do in this sitting room there are
also controls for the thermostat for
lights so from here you can actually set
the thermostat heat it up pull it out
and let it go so now we're in the study
and we're going to look at programs
which is another thing that you can set
up here so you can manually control the
lights you can control the TV pretty
much anything with an on and off switch
even a dimmer you can also set a program
so by pressing the program like if
you're going to go on vacation or
something by pressing the program you
can also control the radio here the
fireplace over here and the lighting
system all at once by pressing one
button so here's how you do it it's as
simple as in this room for the study
we've got a program already set up and
it's sort of like well you know you're
coming in you've got the music on and
you want to create a nice cozy
atmosphere so you can relax with a book
and the fireplace so you definitely
don't want the music you don't want the
lights and you want the fireplace on
simply going to press your program
button to run now it is going to take a
little while for everything to happen
but as you can see we just have a live
fire place so now this room is ready for
some cozy reading so this was your brief
tour of a TNT's digital life connected
home for security and appliances now the
service will start in trial this summer
in Atlanta and Dallas until then we
won't know anything else about pricing
or availability I'm Jessica doll court
