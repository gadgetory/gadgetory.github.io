skills the ability to make fun photo
frames to share on Facebook and it's
available today globally to see this we
put frames studio in the hands of
artists all over the world and they
builds frames for their local
communities so when you visit a new
place you can actually see these frames
from the artists there the frames can
make even everyday photos more engaging
I posted a photo of Bethany on her
birthday recently by adding frames to
this this annual post becomes just a
little bit more special and now I can
post a video with the personalized frame
to make it even more engaging and by
adding augmented effects I can make her
live birthday video even more meaningful
this new content type brings AR to
everyday life it connects art and
technology to create new immersive
experiences and these are just a few of
the effects we've created for camera so
far with the cameras apply effects
platform artists and developers can
create so much more and we're excited to
announce a second tool AR studio that
makes this all possible
but imagine you had to build all of
these things on your own imagine the
kind of large engineering and design
team you'd have to bring together to
make that possible but a or studio
simplifies all of this it allows you to
create animated masks and interactive
effects that respond to actual motion
and data so let's take a look at a
couple of my favorites this isn't widely
known but I'm a gamer and yes my
gamertag actually is Deb inator here's
an example of an EA PC and console game
Mass Effect Andromeda something I spent
way too many hours on already uses our
camera to build an immersive experience
to talk about my gameplay let's take a
look behind the scenes at AR studio with
real-time face tracking you can layer a
3d mask to fit any face and you can have
that mask actually responsive facial
motions so when a mouth opens or head
moves you can have it automatically
respond
without writing a line of code and when
you flip the camera you can see stats
for my latest mission using the
scripting API you can create a
leaderboard and dynamically put it in 3d
space on top of that you can pan the
phone and actually using sensor data you
can experience the game visuals in
augmented reality ya use AR studio to
make this engaging effect possible for
you soccer where's the rest of the world
say football fans I would love to show
you this effect from Manchester United
it brings real-time data from an actual
match that's happening and adds it to
your video
so when man.you scores you see the
effects come up as goal and you hear the
cheering and there's confetti so imagine
having this effect available for your
favorite sports team in the next game
this even works on live video goofy is a
way to express yourself through images
so they say an image is worth a thousand
words an animated one must be worth ten
thousand so you can take this effect and
it does something really interesting it
actually responds so the interactions
from viewers so when someone takes a
hashtag or votes by a poll you can
actually make it respond in the video
itself goofy is making this available
soon so make sure you try it out this is
what we're releasing today with a our
studio but it is the very first step in
a long term journey and we're just
getting started</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
