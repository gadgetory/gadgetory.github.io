welcome to the Apple by for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now I just came back from Disneyland you
know the happiest place on earth and now
I'm back with you on the apple byte the
second happiest place on earth so let's
get to the show and yes we're getting
closer to apples annual worldwide
developers conference that was
officially announced from June the
second through the sixth this year the
iWatch is still Apple's Vegas unknown
but according to digit times three
different supply firms have delivered
flexible circuit boards that will be
integrated into apple's iwatch and is
expected to be released sometime around
the august and sep tember timeframe
according to multiple publications now
I'm lean on the earlier side of that
time table Barclays also chimed in with
a report that the iWatch could include a
UV light exposure sensor to help people
who are prone to Sun burning I'm not
because I'm brown now texas-based
silicon labs announced the first single
chip digital UV sensors in February and
company net atmo showed off their own UV
sensing bracelet at CES 2014 but the
barclays article doesn't provide any
specific links to apple's iwatch it's
all speculation and there has been no
sign of any kind that this will be part
of apple's wearable alright still not
convinced about why you need to buy an
iWatch i'm not either but Piper Jaffray
spring 2014 teen survey yes that's an
actual thing showed that there's fast
growing interest in an iWatch in October
of 2013 only twelve percent of the
roughly 7,500 teen respondents we're
considering buying a product that
doesn't even exist well the recent
survey now shows that seventeen percent
of those teens would purchase an iWatch
if it's priced below $350 so you can bet
apple says okay let's just push it to
399 these future spenders are also very
iPhone centric with sixty-seven percent
of those teams playing to make their
iPhone their next smartphone purchase
and you can add in a one more teen to
that list who's looking forward to that
iphone as well especially guys if it
looks like these latest renderings from
another leak schematics by designer
fairy passion
those are just juicy all right guys an
Apple TV news of filing from comcast and
time warner in their pitch to the FCC
for their planned merger spilled some of
the beans and referenced apples
development of their new set-top box now
in this filing they're arguing that this
will help them compete with Silicon
Valley giants like Google and Apple so
let's for a moment forget how scary a
Comcast Time Warner merger would be for
consumers and your cable bills but
according to pass reports both companies
have been pitched by Apple and it makes
sense that both companies have been
sharing their future plans and talks
with potential partners like Apple now
if the two merge it would actually make
implementing the rumored Apple TV
connected to a single cable service a
whole lot easier but waiting for a new
Apple TV could even be delayed by the
company's not merging yet but you guys
you're allowing the top to us broadband
and cable TV services to merge to get
that it I inhabit that all right we now
know that the apple vs samsung trial
round two is going on defendants exhibit
number 489 245 it's an email from Steve
Jobs that he sent to his top execs in
2010 outlining the visions he had four
products including the iphone and
changes to mobileme and what was also
called the apple TV 2 jobs referred to
it as making it a great must-have
accessory for iOS devices with content
partners like NBC CBS and HBO including
a possible TV subscription and
suggesting apps up browser and even a
magic wand we like remote that apple
filed a patent for in 2007 now we
haven't seen many of those things yet
and unofficial reports are still
pointing to a new Apple TV in April also
we mentioned WWDC earlier in the show
but for the first time ever Apple's
implemented a ticket lottery system
because of the demand Apple has just
sent out the notifications telling
people who have won a chance to purchase
a conference ticket for 1599 that's 1599
dollars but if you didn't win at least
you get this letter of rejection also
WWDC has always featured the future of
iOS and OS 10
it should be no different according to
925 Mac iOS 8 is codenamed oakum oh and
it will retain that same flat and punchy
jony ive's look and feel to it the big
focus will be moving apple into the
fitness and health tracking world with
its health book apps and services that
we've mentioned in past episodes and a
major focus to bring its maps up to
speed with better mapping data that's
more accurate and it's Vegas omission
public transit directions billboard is
also reporting a possible dramatic
overhaul of the itunes music store after
failing to stop declining music
downloads and a potential on-demand
music streaming service that is a
no-brainer to me the report says Apple
as a radical plan for iTunes which could
lead to a completely different
experience in three to five years in I
think most people wouldn't complain
about a cleaner and tighter experience
compared to the bloated app that does
too much these days all right guys let's
get to our apple bike giveaway and if
you've seen this show you know I'm a
huge fan of gelaskins because they keep
