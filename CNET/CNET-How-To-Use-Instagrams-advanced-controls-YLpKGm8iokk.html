makes it quick and easy to make your
photos pop and then share them with your
friends you just take a photo slap on
the filter to give it a little style and
share it but what if you want to dig a
little deeper than Instagram stock
presets I'm Donald Bell i'm here to show
you the advanced image controls
available in instagram six-point oh so
let's open up the app select a photo to
use and then hit next now here's the
screen where all the magic happens on
the bottom you'll see the usual Trey of
filters that you can tap through and
find one that brings a little extra life
to your photo they're great but what if
you want something a little more subtle
with Instagram 6 you can tap and hold on
that filter and bring up a slider bar
that you can use to blend in just the
right amount of the filter with your
original photo the same hidden control
as you toggle the filters frame on and
off something used to be able to do from
the main screen when you're happy with
it tap the checkmark but that's not all
above the filters you'll see two grey
icons the middle one is called luxe and
its instagrams proprietary blend for
adjusting exposure and sharpness just
like filters Instagram now gives you a
slider control to dial in just the right
amount you can bring it down to a soft
haze or crank it up for extra grit but
when you really want to get fiddly tap
the wrench icon here you can rotate the
image adjust brightness contrast warmth
saturation highlights shadows vignette
you can apply a tilt-shift blur or you
can sharpen things up it's like a little
mini Photoshop hidden underneath one of
these simplest photo apps on the planet
as someone who's found myself using
other apps to edit my photos before
bringing them into Instagram these new
controls have made things much easier I
can now do everything I need right
within the app so now you know how to
access the advanced editing tools in
instagrams more tips like this visit
