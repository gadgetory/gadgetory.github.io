smartphone had a zoom lens but they're
not willing to sacrifice mobility and
usability to get it that unfortunately
was what Samsung offered up with the
Galaxy s4 zoom and hopefully changes
with the Galaxy K zoom
I'm Josh Goldman with CNET and while the
galaxy K packs a similar 10x zoom lens
with optical image stabilization as the
bulky and awkward s4 zoom Samsung
redesigned the internal lens components
so there's no more protruding lens
barrel and its large hand grip is gone
too behind the lens is a 20 megapixel
BSI CMOS sensor that's physically larger
than most smartphone sensors and the
same size is what you get an appointment
shoot Samsung added new camera options -
such as the capability to set separate
focus and exposure points a selfie alarm
that lets you position yourself and
alert you before it shoots and a pro
suggests feature that gives you a
selection of scene shooting options
depending on your subject there's a pro
suggest market as well so you can
download and use settings others have
created as well as create your own
setting combos to share as for the
smartphone bits it's running Android 4.4
KitKat with Samsung's TouchWiz interface
on top and is powered with the company's
six core Exynos 5 hexa processor and two
gigs of memory it has a four point eight
inch Super AMOLED HD 720p screen so
overall the phone is a bit more
mid-range than the galaxy s5 but a
definite improvement over the s4 zoom
and if you want a smartphone with a 10x
zoom lens it might be worth the
sacrifice the K is expected to come to
Asian markets first but there are
currently no plans to bring it to the US</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
