google issues for everything google that
we can pack inside of a show each week
and the number one question that i get
from you guys is tell me more about to
google watching while nothing is
official elias is added again recently
claiming the purported specs for
Google's first watch in its partnership
with LG now Evelyn's revealed the
rumored specs that will include a 1.65
IPS LCD display with a 280 x 280 square
resolution with 512 megs of ram and 4
gigs of internal storage for possibly
apps and mp3s with an internal processor
still yet to be determined evelyn's has
had a stellar record and so we could see
an announcement soon aligning with the
rumored march time frame and a google
i/o release in june now the game
developers conference is underway in San
Francisco this week in google announced
that it will be bringing multiplayer
support to iOS through google gameplay
services along with other improvements
for developers Thank You googs for doing
something about cross platform game
development between the two now Google
will also be introducing game gifts for
devs that allow users to send virtual
in-game objects to anyone in their
circles the play games app now supports
multiplayer invites directly and there
will be 18 new game categories to make
it easier to find games you love now one
of them is rumored to be games with the
word flappy but unfortunately flappy
Brian was rejected in I don't see what's
wrong with flappy bird oh alright
amazon's android running set-top box
that is rumored to also play games and
release around March or April is
building some buzz after leaked photos
of an Amazon branded controller were
discovered in an overseas regulatory
filing by website that's not funny now
the controller features standard game
control buttons shoulder buttons and
triggers in addition to media controls
centered in the bottom area of the
controller and a home menu and back
button as well now the latest report
from TechCrunch claims that Amazon's
streaming box won't be a box but a
dongle like the chromecast that could
also feature on live like streaming of
games
and apps now this also flows along
nicely with the recent availability of
the software development kit for
Amazon's ab stream service that will
support a variety of apps and games and
would be the perfect complement to get
content on its set-top box as soon as
possible amazon wants to be a player in
the living room and its recent purchase
of game developer double helix the team
behind killer instinct and Strider show
its commitment to making gaming a part
of its offering as well so we'll keep
watching this as the living room battle
just keeps getting bigger and Amazon
will celebrate its own apps or turning
three years old this saturday marks the
22nd and will be launching a two-week
gift giving campaign slashing up to
sixty percent off of some of its most
popular titles in the store all right
guys let's check out the quick hits and
this one is worth paying attention to
Google is lowering the monthly plans it
offers to users across the board for
drive space Google still offers the free
15 gigs that come with your google
account but the plans are now one dollar
ninety-nine cents for 100 gigs down from
499 a new plan for ten dollars from one
terabyte down from fifty dollars and a
ten terabyte and up plan that starts at
ninety-nine bucks also we're about a
week out from a cici's official reveal
in we've shown you the phone and now you
can see tidbits of a cici's sense 6.0
you I demoed on this video now there's
nothing drastic here with a little
flatter and bolder colors here and there
but the biggest discovery so far has
been motion launch gestures like swiping
up left or right to launch different
features of the phone and Samsung is
also opening up development for the gear
2 and gear 2 neo with the release of
their Tizen SDK for wearables now
partners that will already launch apps
with the gear to include CNN I Heart
Radio ebay and others and UK customers
looking for the gold colored galaxy s5
well Vodafone will exclusively carry the
gold version for fans of gold band aids
with pre-orders starting on March 28 and
it could possibly remain exclusive to
Vodafone in the UK tier alright guys
that's going to do it for this week's
show keep telling me your deepest and
darkest secrets in just email us at
Google licious at cnet com or tweet me
at brian Tong thanks so much for
watching and we'll see you guys next
week for some more of that google ish
