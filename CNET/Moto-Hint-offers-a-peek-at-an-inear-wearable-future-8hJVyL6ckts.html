Chicago do you remember the movie her
well welcome to the moto hint this is a
newly redesigned headset that's meant to
be an intelligent assistant that works
specifically with the new Moto X phone
but also with any Bluetooth connected
phone it comes with a little charge case
it's got a 10 hour battery life with
three top off charges of about three and
a half hours each moto hint is made to
live inside that little case and attach
to your keychain on-the-go and if you
feel like you wanna up the design these
come in a variety of different materials
for you to pick from not exactly like
Moto X but its own styles that you know
match the case and show up over here on
the moto hint and you just simply talk
to it and say okay whatever because the
new Moto X moto voice service allows any
sort of a tag for you to connect to or
if you don't have a Moto X you can
always tap to connect a series or any
other audio assistance service that you
wish it's also got IR sensors in here so
the moment you put in your ear it
automatically turns on to save battery
life and it knows that it's connected
when you take the Moto hinge out of your
ear well then it automatically will
relay calls back to your phone that type
of smart connectivity has not really
been seen in a lot of Bluetooth headsets
the moto hint is gonna be available for
149 later this fall to debut alongside
the Moto X some scotts teen and taking a
look at the multi designed patterned
moto hint earpiece here in Chicago</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
