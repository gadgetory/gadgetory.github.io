bargain-basement laptops you're wrong
there's a small crop of high-end
Chromebooks on the come up and this Asus
is one of them the 12.5 inch ACS
Chromebook flip has a sleek all
aluminium design that looks and feels
high-end with compact dimensions that
make it effortless to carry around it
also has a 360 degree hinge that allows
it screen to flip back so you peez it as
a tablet it's not an exact replacement
for your iPad or Android tablet but it
comes in handy if you ever need it
you can also prop it up like a tent for
watching video the Asus Chromebook only
has two ports two USB type-c and they
don't support Thunderbolt 3 there's also
a microSD card slot on the right edge
and a volume rocker and power button on
the left with an Intel Core m3 processor
the Asus Chromebook performed swimmingly
performance rarely slowed down and
lagged even if multiple apps and tabs
were open at the same time the only time
I noticed any lag was when I was
downloading video however that's usually
the case with most devices its battery
life is also pretty decent averaging
little under 10 hours in our testing
what's the catch well it costs $500 now
that's cheap in comparison to MacBooks
and some windows 10 laptops but it's
expensive if you're simply interested in
a cheap laptop like the $200 high synth
Chromebook however the Asus Chromebooks
solid and speedy performance and it's
luxe and perfectly compact two-in-one
design make it unique if you're
interested in a stylish and capable
Chromebook that can double as a tablet
the Asus Chromebook flip is the way to
go</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
