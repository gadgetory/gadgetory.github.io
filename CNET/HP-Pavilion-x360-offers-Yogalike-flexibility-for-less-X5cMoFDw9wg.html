for a hybrid laptop I'm Dan Ackerman and
this is the HP Pavilion x360 this is an
11 point 6 inch hybrid which means that
it spends part of its time as a
traditional clamshell laptop but it can
also twist around and become a tablet
much like lenovo's yoga line you can put
it in this kind of mode that's like a
kiosk you can flip it up like this and
they call this table tent and of course
then you fold the entire thing down and
it becomes a tablet obviously have the
touchscreen there and on the back you
still have your keyboard and touchpad
but in tablet mode those are deactivated
like a lot of the best hybrids this
thing works fairly well as a traditional
clamshell laptop which means that when
you have it set up like this you don't
even really even notice that it's a
tablet or a hybrid you could just use it
a regular laptop and it's fine I
especially like that the keyboard is
nice and big and the touchpad is fairly
large the 11.6 inch screen is just a
1366 by 768 screen but that's what you
would expect at this size the key here
is this guy is less expensive than just
about anybody else in this hybrid space
now this model starts at 399 for that
you get an Intel Pentium CPU and four
gigs of ram regular 500 gig hard drive
we've got a little upgrade in this one
it's got eight gigs of RAM for another
like seventy-five dollars seems like a
fairly wilth worthwhile upgrade gives
you just a little bit of boost to
performance now the downside is you're
not gonna get the same level of
performance that you'd get with your big
thousand now our 15-inch laptop if you
stick with the Windows interface over
here things still feel fairly zippy my
big downside to this particular system
is that the screen it's pretty low
quality it doesn't get very bright and
off-axis viewing is terrible especially
with this overly bright screen if you
even there anywhere near daylight you
can hardly see it when you have a more
expensive system obviously you get a
higher quality display and it gets
brighter and it's more useful in that
tablet mode where you're handling it and
moving it around especially if want to
share content with people this green is
especially bad for that but again it's
$400 lenovo makes an 11 inch version of
the yoga called the yoga 211 that's
about $100 more it's about $500 for a
decent configuration of that also very
low power
system but a much nicer screen certainly
something's worth taking a look at I'm
