sports car a small car compact
two-seater front mid-engine rear-wheel
drive they tend to make hot rods out of
other Mercedes here's a real different
departures the true sports card they may
have seen this AMG GT in photos and it
probably looks bigger than it is that's
what I thought now that I'm in front of
one in person it really is a tidy
package that you can credibly see is a
911 fighter what we're looking at here
is also a car that has an all-new four
liter biturbo engine up front a compact
v8 quite a potent mil 503 horsepower
going into a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox
that runs the rear wheels only and like
out either nestling the turbos top of
the engine inside the V as opposed to
down low around the exhaust the
reasoning for that is better turbo
response and they say better emissions
bottom line all you care about is 0 to
60 somewhere in the high 33.7 and of
course that handling is front mid-engine
rear drive classic sort of dynamics on
the road inside the very interesting
cabin Mercedes they've done two major
things here the center console is
massive and kind of high it's a sort of
Porsche style don't tell them I said so
really cool-looking ducks up here for
the ventilation here are eight controls
that are circular they say echo the v8
configuration of the engine okay I'll
buy it their latest touch panel
controller here for command and then a
set of analog gauges with little carbon
fiber in sets and beyond that is pretty
stock Mercedes interface and wheel
controls but in a car that could be very
claustrophobic they've done a pretty
good job of keeping it feeling
relatively airing the only odd note is
what car makers have to live with these
days are kind of flat square or
rectangular center screens this doesn't
fit the look of anything else in here it
gives you an indication of why car
makers are intrigued by what they can do
in the future with flexible OLED that
will map to the organic surfaces until
now they're stuck footing sore thumbs in
their cabin
