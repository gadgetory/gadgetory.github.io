fifth generation of cellular technology
it promises to be super crazy fast and
it can change the future of technology
as we know it and it's right around the
corner but before we get caught up in
all the hype let's rack up the facts and
have some real talk about the
expectations and I figure why not do
that over a game of pool I'm Bridget
Carey let's break it down
go now the understand 5g first you gotta
know a little history in the beginning
cell phones were all about voice 2g
brought texting 3G 4G that was boosting
your internet speed 5g is the next stage
and there are three angles to this
upgrade first up is speed it could be
ten to a hundred times faster than a
typical cell network even faster than
what most people get at home we're
talking downloading a TV series in
seconds it's also about connection
density that means getting way more
people and devices on the network
without congestion problems and it's
about eliminating latency that means
there's no delay in the information
getting to you we're talking a lag time
of one millisecond that's as fast as a
camera flash when you bring all these
features together it means we could
think differently about how we use the
Internet it means self-driving cars can
talk to each other on the road without
delay there's gonna be way more gizmos
and gadgets online tracking data and for
you it'll be so smooth you can watch a
live sports game in VR from anywhere
there's a lot of potential but to build
this world we need technology that can
tap into a new section of the
electromagnetic spectrum
it sounds wild but it's not that
complicated information is carried in
airwaves all around us and the easiest
way to think of the spectrum is to break
it down in a line now most of the
technology we use today is in the lower
end we're talking radio waves TV signals
microwaves and what the cellular
networks are using now on the high end
that's where you got your visible light
UV light x-rays the higher you go in
frequency the faster speed you can
achieve and there's this section of
frequency that's higher than anything
we're using right now we're gonna pluck
from that to get 5g
it's called millimeter wave but it comes
with its challenges millimeter wave can
be kind of finicky it doesn't do well
with obstacles in the way like buildings
or trees I mean even a leaf can get in
the way and it can cause interference to
get around this carriers can beam
signals in specific direction targeting
customers directly or sometimes that
means pulling a trick shot where the
signal bounces around obstacles to get
to you
millimeter is fast but it doesn't travel
as far let's say this dart is a typical
cell phone tower it disperses a signal
to a wide area but with 5g the signal
doesn't cover as much you need many more
cell sites to cover the same space more
antennas all over the place on street
signs and lampposts and rooftops
wireless companies will have to install
hundreds of thousands more antennas all
over they're also trying to cram more
antennas on existing cell towers this is
a messy project and it costs a lot
plus you got neighborhoods upset about
how ugly it looks to have antennas
everywhere and people are concerned
about the health consequences of having
all of these high frequency beams all
around us now the first 5g networks are
rolling out over the next two years but
the 5g you get may not even be the
technology I'm describing here some
carriers are just boosting their 4G
networks and calling them 5g and the
speed you get really depends on the
wavelength that's used it's complicated
and that's even if you have a device
that can tap into 5g speeds
5g holds a lot of promise but it's a
challenging path to get there so the
next time you're buying a phone and you
hear all that cool marketing lingo
consider this I wouldn't want you to get
hustled thanks for watching and a big
thanks to society billiards in bar in
New York City for letting us have fun
with 5g so let me know in the comments
what you want to see me break down next
and be sure to do that thing that's so
dandy
like subscribe ring the bell you know
the drill thanks guys</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
