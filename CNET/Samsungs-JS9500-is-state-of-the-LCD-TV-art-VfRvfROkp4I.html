of the year the Jay s 9500 series seen
here in its smallest size at 65 inches
packs in all the company's best TV
technology and delivers some of the most
impressive images of any TV that said
it's still not as good as OLED before I
get into the Nitty Gritty of the picture
it's worth taking in the exterior of
this expensive television it's curved
like all samsung's best TV these days
and unlike OLED models it's not
available in a flat version the curve
doesn't have a major impact on picture
quality its main function is aesthetic
but even so I'm not a huge fan I do like
the rest the TV style however the silver
edge around the screen is angled back
sharply like a picture frame and the
splayed leg stand complements the curve
nicely the Jay s 9500 is thicker than
most LCD TVs these days when seen from
the side but still keeps a sleek profile
unlike most TVs there's a separate box
that houses the inputs it connects to
the TV via a single cable and can be
upgraded in the future for new
capabilities the remote is simple and
incorporates both motion and voice
control the motion control works well to
move around the Smart TV system and in
general responsiveness was quick and app
selection solid of course you get 4k and
even HD are capable versions of apps
that support these high-end formats
including Netflix Amazon and YouTube all
that said the main draw on a TV this
expensive is picture quality and the J&amp;amp;S
9500 mostly delivers it produces
extremely deep black levels you can get
brighter than just about any TV I've
tested for superb contrast and pop color
is accurate and video processing is
superb it's not the best picture you can
buy today however compared to OLED TVs
from LG this LCD TV from Samsung didn't
deliver as deep a shade of black and the
picture suffered more when seen from
seats other than the one directly in
front of the TV set yes
the Samsung got brighter but all it is
plenty bright enough for just about
every room of course the js9 500 is
still a great high-end TV and since it's
available in even larger sizes than OLED
at 78 and 88 inches it remains very
appealing if you happen to be lucky
enough to afford one
