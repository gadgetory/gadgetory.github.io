parading around superhero that's a scene
from Ironman the mega blockbuster
recently released on DVD
to build this kind of computer-generated
scene the designers at San
francisco-based Industrial Light and
Magic filmed it on their image capture
stage the idea is that you are
surrounded by a room full of cameras you
wear a special suit that's got markers
on it all the cameras are threshold to
just see the markers the computer takes
all the images of all the markers and
figures out where each one of them is
moving in the room the ILM team has
worked on the motion capture for more
than three dozen films in the last
decade we sort of choreograph or mime
the process it's almost like a video
game you have this 3d world that you can
play around in directors love using the
technology because it can save them time
and ultimately money you could
photograph an environment and then come
into this space and explore that
environment virtually set up your shots
your camera angles you don't have to
take all that time on the the actual
location to do that now it's my turn
it's got my bootys I've got my suit now
tell me how did I ever agree to wear
lycra on camera television I think I
must be nuts
flattering don't you think
next the ilm team velcro's fifty
glow-in-the-dark balls to my suit if you
look at this in the light you'll see
it's reflecting right back at the camera
and that's the only thing that the
cameras are the only thing that exactly
they're cameras are reading the
reflective dots and they see all the
circles so they don't see anything else
and stand your size try to keep your
feet about hip width apart as I go
through a series of basic calisthenics
the 40 cameras in this space capture my
movements to customize it to my exact
physiology we have a model of what the
human skeleton looks like and based on
where it's all your dots moving its
going to adjust the model to match your
bone lengths and where your joint
positions are exactly we are tracking a
performer skeleton through the room and
then we can take that and hook it up to
any animated creature we want I get the
realistic performance from the actor
into the creature yeah with an accurate
picture of my frame and how I move I can
play with Iron Man or in this case iron
woman the end result is this
subconsciously believably real motion
that's the whole point of the technology
after perfecting this motion capture
Island says they now need to work on the
facial recognition which is incredibly
difficult given the the nuances of the
skin in a human muffled I do hope I'm
invited back to that demo however I'm
