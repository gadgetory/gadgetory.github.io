race is back on i present to you the
canon eos 5d s and 5d SR we have a 15.6
megapixel full-frame CMOS sensor so if
you were thinking to move to medium
format just to get that extra boost in
resolution this might be a camera to
keep you on the 35 mil side apart from
the crazy resolution sensor the 5d s and
5d s are shared to digit 6 processors
which allow a camera to shoot at speeds
of up to 5 frames a second there is a 61
point
AF system inside and a redesigned neuro
vibration control system so the mirror
has been redesigned entirely to reduce
the effects of mirror vibration on your
front image there is a 3.2 inch LCD
screen at the back and the cameras also
come with dual card slots both CF and SD
if 50 point 6 megapixels is just way too
much resolution for you you have a 3
intima crop shooting modes - the first
is the full crop then you can move down
to your aps h 1.3 x crop and then down
to your aps-c 1.6 times crop and also in
the viewfinder when you're shooting
these three modes you will actually see
the viewfinder show you the total area
that you'll be capturing so if you're at
a 1.3 or 1.6 times crop the viewfinder
will actually have a blacked-out area
showing you the parts of the image that
are not being captured the 5d s and the
5d s are designed primarily for stills
photographers so while you get all the
bells and whistles of cameras like the
5d Mark 3 in terms of all your movie
shooting features you don't get
and headphone out ports and you also
don't get uncompressed HDMI out for
recording purposes the Canon 5d s and 5d
SR will be available globally in June
with pricing released closer to the date
