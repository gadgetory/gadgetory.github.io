in the battle for streaming box
supremacy never stopped its a prizefight
punch-out between the new kid on the
block Amazons fire TV and the reigning
champ the Roku 3 our judges for this
fight are executive editor John Babs the
bone Falcone - your associate editor
Matthew Big Show moscovia and myself
can't go wrong Tom we'll take each round
scorer and average them out to the
nearest tenth of a point the final prize
fight score will be an average of all
rounds using the same system let's get
this started
round 1 is design Amazon's first entry
has a slim and square matte black
profile that remind you of an optical
drive and it will fit right in with your
TV setup the Roku 3 brings its black
glossy finish and a smaller package with
thicker curves just the way I like it
they're classic fabric tag and a solid
weight now the fire TVs remote is really
one of the best out of the gates with
the right size and feel compared to
Roku's bulkier design these are still
just two black boxes but we're giving
the fire TV the edge with a 4.3 and roku
gets off the floor next router user
interface can navigate the fire TV does
things right and wrong here it's really
one of the snappiest UIs and videos play
almost instantly but its biggest
drawback is that the content feels
jumbled and unorganized you have a watch
list for videos but you can't pin apps
and services to specific locations for
favorites at the moment its focus is on
Amazon Prime content but there still
isn't a place just for prime content and
then try to watch a series like 24 it
shows you pricing for episodes but
you'll have to make a few extra moves to
find out that Prime members can watch it
for free no bueno now we know that these
issues will be resolved over time but
it's still frustrating now its voice
search accuracy is really stellar it's
the first time for a streaming boxin I'm
impressed with how well it works fast in
the Furious
but it doesn't search deep enough with
other services and its content
organization needs to be better the Roku
3s interface and content is just
organized better plain and simple
there's plenty of customization to
personalize the entire layout of your
channels I still think that the UI needs
a fresh coat of paint especially with
some apps still retaining the horizontal
scroll look and feel but let's not
forget it's killer Universal search that
pulls from rows whose multiple content
sources and tells you what service and
the price it will cost across multiple
apps that's a killer feature the Roku 3
gets a 4.7 and fire TV gets up to 1.3
after averaging two rounds Roku leaves
round three is both of these $99 boxes
bring HDMI 1080p video support dual band
Wi-Fi and Ethernet the Roku brings a
micro SD card slot for additional
storage and a USB port to connect
external drives the fire TVs USB port
isn't used for anything yet it adds an
optical audio output but its quad-core
processor and 2 gigs of RAM make a
difference in performance that you could
feel now the Roku is remote with a
headphone jack for private listening is
still a favorite feature no one can
touch but the fire TVs remote has voice
search capability that is really a joy
to use brian tom
and I promise you I had nothing to do
with that movie now if you're in the
Kindle ecosystem you can use a Kindle
Fire HDX
as a second screen for their awesome
x-ray feature that delivers more content
and info during a movie and if you're
watching a movie on your HDX you can
just split to your fire TV both remotes
can act as controllers for some basic
games but if you're talking about gaming
the fire TV has an option for a $40
wireless game controller and the power
of this machine allows you to play real
games for the first time on a streaming
box that is not a dedicated gaming
console both boxes let you stream your
personal photos or videos but having to
upload to Amazon's Cloud Drive is an
extra step Amazon brings even more to
the table with free time that limits the
content kids can watch and is a big deal
for families but sling box users can use
a Roku to watch their Slingbox from home
on another TV and this is really a
killer feature Roku is once an
untouchable in this round but the fire
TV brings things we have never seen in
this space Amazon gets a perfect 5 and
Roku get a 4.3 the final round that
decides it all is content the fire TV
brings almost every major service you
can think of on launch like Netflix Hulu
and YouTube but its biggest omission is
HBO GO which is coming later so you
won't be able to share your HBO
subscription just yet and Time Warner
customers are also left out for now it
has music covered with Pandora and
iHeartRadio and I won't dock it for its
lack of my favorite CNET app Amazon does
get a nod for its gaming content and
it's only going to get better but
nothing can compete with the over 1,000
plus channels of content on roku that
includes HBO Go and Time Warner now Roku
has pretty much everything covered from
movies to music to sports and news
including Amazon Prime and it's still
the king of content right now it's
pretty clear roku takes us down with a
perfect 5 and
on gets a four so let's average out all
four rounds and both sides claim two
rounds of their own but it's the Roku 3
that takes this battle four point five
to four point two and is your prize
fight winner Amazons fire TV is an
impressive entry that will only get
better and if you live in the Amazon
ecosystem this is the streaming box for
you but until then Roku is content
library still reigns supreme
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching and
we'll catch you guys next time for
another prize fight</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
