record mixtape also a robot that's gonna
make you pancakes and we're gonna show
you an IRL first-person shooter that's
better than all of your other
first-person shooters pretty great
Samara daily
creating citizens with the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk-show in the known universe I'm
Ashley together
that's calamus and one of these days I
might have to say that's kill anonymous
I'm Ashley together just to throw
everybody off yeah people would probably
stop watching they would get really
confused and just shut it off like
that's not true
stop navigate away on that note let's
talk about our headlines all right so I
mentioned vinyl record mixtapes
obviously it's really expensive to make
a small batch vinyl record what do you
look is there spider in my of you have
one hair that is pointing straight up
into the air and it's like like I got it
it's like a like a dr. Seuss character
it's just no it just gets crazy anyway
I'm sorry science anyway science so it's
really expensive to make a vinyl record
really expensive especially if you want
to do small bats because usually if you
go to a company that presses vinyl they
say you cut it order at least a thousand
like or 500 or whatever but that not
anymore that's not the case there is a
there's a company called vinyl of phi
vinyl if i ify if I was vinyl 5 first
vinyl if I who wants to who wants to
make their mark on the record industry
by hand cutting one-off records
impressing your vinyl mixtape that's
super cool into a one-of-a-kind item
which is pretty awesome
um ok so here's how it works there's
they they were based in the Netherlands
and so they started this service a few
months ago and now you can get them
shipped to the internationally like you
can go if you live in a different
country which is pretty cool they're
opening it up to international orders
it's actually much less expensive than I
thought it's 55 bucks it's a 50 euro to
get a custom press record you get 10
minutes on each side and here's how you
do it you go to the website you upload
tracks that you own or have permission
from the artist yeah you can't can't use
Taylor Swift or Avicii or any other
unless you're Taylor in which case I
think you're probably not going to use
this service
so yeah you upload tracks that you own
or vinyl
actually is working with artists to get
permission and so they actually have an
online library of music tracks that you
can choose from right now they're very
netherlands-based
artists and European artists but they
did say that with their international
release they're gonna try to get more
artists permission and more songs and
things like that so you might see maybe
in the future you might see some of your
favorite artists put their tracks up
there or maybe give permission to have
people like make a mixtape out of a
vinyl record they accept really high
quality audio so you can upload like
flak or wave like really really high
quality stuff and then you can design
your own cover art they have like two
templates and then a fully custom like
upload your image as the cover art where
you make your whole front and back and
then you pay and they hand cut your
record press the covers and then press
it and then they ship it out to you it
takes about a month that's between the
price and the turnaround time and the
fact they only have to buy one pretty
great it's incredible because I remember
it was like I want to say like six
months ago I was looking to give a gift
to my significant other and I was like I
want to print her a vinyl of me like you
know saying how much I love her whatever
like it was it was being like an
original idea that came out of nowhere
and then put the vinyl on or whatever
and that's super cool how do you look it
up and it cost like thousands of dollars
you need to print 500 of these scale
yeah the cost of you know 40 bucks a
record
so get 499 other significant others that
you feel you could give this record to
and then we can talk like that and there
are there are a couple of crowdfunding
efforts I think that I've seen that are
kind of these small batch vinyl record
pressings things like that
but nothing has shipped yet so I don't
there's not really that market hasn't
really emerged yet so I don't know if
any of that's any good so this company
is doing it they seem to really enjoy it
vinyl if I but I know that we can't use
official tracks from artists that we
don't have permission from in vinyl if I
but we can for our hashtags a day which
is why I figured we would have some fun
with this and you'll really like this to
your music Guy TV album and we want you
to make the best twenty minute mix that
you can think of look what's the what's
the mix that you're gonna put on this
record and who would you give it
- as a gift like which artists or which
artist which songs like whatever you
want and then who would you give it to
as a gift hmm
let's just say just give me your a side
what's your a side like three songs
because it's ten minutes for each side
okay I don't want to set the world on
fire by Ink Spots great all out yeah
probably tomorrow comes today by
Gorillaz and by the way you're putting
me on the spot for them I know I really
am come up with these are good choices
those great choices
thank you and I'm just a Black Betty
that I'll back buddy
all right there you go that's I got that
last one I wouldn't fully subscribe to
the guy okay uh I think I would go with
have you ever heard of postmodern
jukebox where they read they do covers
of like it's sort of like the new
version of Richard cheese because he
doesn't tour anymore or make records cuz
he can't sing poor guy um but they do
covers of like modern songs and jazz and
like nineteen joint it's great really
good so I I maybe pick um I really like
the fancy cover on postmodern jukebox
there's like a slow jack it's like a
quick jazz cover almost like a like a
Charleston or like a jitterbug it's
great and then I think I'd with that I
think I'd go with oh man I think I'd go
with the Turks theme from Final Fantasy
seven so it's a little very jazzy I
suddenly went very jazzy and weird and
then I think I would pick a new Fang by
them crooked vultures okay yeah any of
that hipster crap it's not a hipster
it's just all that stuff is it like on
vinyl - that's I know that all of my
songs are like obviously Xboxes on vinyl
anyway alright cool that's absolutely
album okay tell us what you would do
tell me about this look I I didn't know
people still used chatroulette it's okay
if you don't know what chatroulette it
is you basically hop on chat or a lot
and it randomly hooks you up with
someone who's someone else's webcam and
you either talk to each other or you
troll them or you bad other things but
but it's it's just kind of this fun
weird site well random people a lucky
few people about 20 P
we're able to switch and they were
suddenly viewing a first-person view of
like basically a live-action video game
and they got to control the video game
by telling the player what to do so
you're sounds on the screen oh my god
actually is somebody actually with a
live webcam with their hand that's the
guy's real hands and then the graphics
are on screen and the people watching
would tell him okay pick up the gun or
open that box or run or jump over this
thing every single command and he would
listen and we're so far yeah he would he
would respond to pick stuff up and there
was there was a small like pathway in
which he had to go and like there was a
boss battle and there were zombies all
around that he had to fight so it was
really cool and everyone that got to
play and had a really good time they all
it the way they cut the video they
showed that people had different
reactions and different suggestions to
what to do but it was fantastic this
blew up like last week and that we have
some details about how it was done and
basically it was a room full of really
talented people there was a voice-over
artist
there's obviously this guy who's wearing
a camera on his head and he's all
dressed in this outfit there was a
graphics artist guy there's just like a
few days and then of course there's tons
of people dressed as zombies there's
also people that had to do the makeup
for the zombie there's people that set
decorated it they own this house they're
a production studio that owns this house
there's a big hole behind the scenes
video of this but it was a huge group of
people they're very proud of it it was
huge on reddit good be and people have
asked them oh you know will you do this
again and they said we'd love to we'd
love to do it again and there's no plans
to do it again but they they said they'd
love to do it obviously it ends the the
video ends with this with one guy going
to it says proceed to next level so but
that's the way it ends leaving it open
but ya know it's really great actually
at the end of the video I think they
show a shot of the there they are big
team the guy wearing the Batman oh
there's the guy the guy in the middle so
yeah big ol team there's a voice actor
Wow
I didn't realize there were that many
people working on it that's incredible
so it's
it's just a bunch of creative people
getting together to create something
creative without really real intent but
maybe they'll get some money to do the
next one maybe Call of Duty will be like
hey we want to sponsor like some kind of
mark so anyway that was from realm
pictures it was a British filmmaking
company but way to go guys yeah that was
amazingly creative it makes me want to
use chatroulette and then I realize
they're not doing any more and now I
just won't ever so unless they ever do
that again don't go into that dark dark
no no I don't want to I can I tell you
about this robot it's gonna make you
pancakes probably yeah I mean everybody
loves it already so there's a European
project that I think we've alluded to
something very similar about the robots
watching YouTube videos to learn how to
do stuff so this is called Robo howl and
they use the actual text in wikiHow to
teach robots to understand what to do
when you tell it like I want pancakes oh
cool so if you say make me pancakes -
any a person they sort of can figure out
like okay well I need to get the batter
I have to get a spatula I gotta use the
pancake the griddle I got to do all this
stuff well the robot reads a wiki how
and then over time it sort of learns by
figure it sort of figures out how what
steps it needs to take to make pancakes
so when somebody says make me pancakes
it doesn't need to be fully programmed
because it's learned this stuff cool
this is pretty pretty awesome this is a
pr2 robot we've seen these used for a
variety of different things that that
we've had on the show before but this
might be one of my favorites because I
love pancakes they are the best so there
are not only learning from wikiHow which
is pretty cool they are also doing
things like having a person wear gloves
to track their motion and VR and perform
a task and then giving that information
of the robot so they can learn how the
person would do it which is pretty cool
and then once it completes something
successfully or has a set of
instructions that it sort of figured out
they actually are uploading that those
successful instructions to an online
database for other robots to like be
able to get and learn from Wow which is
pretty amazing it hasn't made a pan
cake yet though it's still it's still
figuring itself out so it's this is
these are all like the testing that
they're kind of doing on this and
they're talking it's like kind of
talking its way through it
like it talks about like all the
different things it needs to do so it's
like yeah I couldn't reach object now
I'm gonna try different pose but it's
it's figuring it that's learning yeah so
it's figuring it out which is pretty
amazing it's not just like okay I'm
gonna program a robot to do the exact
steps and if anything is off in any way
like oh well then the robot can't do it
it's like no no this robot recognizes
like this if I'm looking at it based on
the wikiHow like that's pancake that's
the pancake batter that I understand I
need to use that to do this and then I
need the spatula to do this like so it
and then it says oh there's the spatula
I have to move to get the spatula and
pick it up so it's pretty interesting
stuff that's happening and I just I find
that stuff's really cool and makes me
feel like one day baby I could have my
own Rosie the robot so I'm saying it's
it still didn't make a pancake I'm
working on it though it's trying but
it's not a pancake making robot if it's
not making pancakes
let's work it's trying it's bad it's
gonna be a pancake making robot listen
weird little mouth robot thing I
appreciate the effort but make a pancake
and then we can talk and we can and then
we can discuss yeah come on the show and
make us pancakes is what we're telling
you yeah but actually make a pancake
well even let use the commissary at CBS
well let you use the huge grill there
you can just make it's not just Mary he
is kind of a cranky guy yeah I feel a
little cranky today he was a little mad
so I'm gonna tell you something he's
like no sorry what was the right thing
to order
he's like pancakes nothing you say I'm
sorry I don't anything today I want to
make pancakes yeah that's might be - you
gotta have a robot make us pancakes
so yeah that's uh it's sort of like what
do you teach a robot how to learn it's
like teaching a kid how to learn
somebody got a step-by-step you say okay
first you need this thing is so that's
how they're doing it pretty cool stuff
yeah okay not officially
flipping tons of tens of pancakes but
still working on Timmy what one pancake
absolutely we're gonna take a quick
break we'll be right back it's new
releases Tuesdays we're gonna talk about
what's out and emptying our wallets but
until we come back don't click away it's
tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's Tuesday
this is a good Tuesday it's a pretty
interesting and good Tuesday so there's
a lot of fun stuff coming out that next
week it's like the avalanche begins of
great games but for now there's some
good stuff this week too so let's talk
about new releases
yeah I was I was thinking it was next
next Tuesday is yours like avalanche
it's like Mad Max Metal Gear yeah it's
at the beginning okay so then what is
this week all right so this week there's
a couple good things no movies I
wouldn't looked at like what the release
slate was for like theatrical there's
nothing that interested me it's like two
movies I'm like go see straight and so
uh call of duty black ops 3 beta
launches tomorrow oh yeah or is it today
today on what's on PC not tomorrow on PC
and Xbox one PlayStation 4 got a head
start they started a week ago but but
now it's Tuesday where's everyone says
26th so that's what I saw I was 26 okay
so drops drops Wednesday and man people
are really excited as they always are
about call duty but but I will say Call
of Duty recently in recent years has
seen my slight slump in terms of general
overall enjoyment of the series like
most of my friends who are really into
called duty have been like I played it
for a couple weeks and I stopped but
when black ops 2 came out people were
obsessed like and it feels like this is
gonna be a good return to form right
there's some really good features in
this one people really excited well it's
hard for this team and see this is me
going to the defense these millionaires
that make the same game over and over
again it's hard to read like reinvent
the wheel right and and what's what's
worked about Call of Duty has been just
the addictive nature and so they have
they're like well I guess we got to
throw something extra and they're robots
right if it ain't broke don't fix it but
then how do you keep it fresh every year
so this year it seems like they're
actually there's some really good
features that people are really excited
about gonna keep it fresh I don't need
that much robot stuff like I want I'll
buy a sci-fi game I don't want my Call
of Duty fair enough ok I was excited
about recore that's the that's the sort
of robot game that I am but again I buy
every single one of these and I hate
that I do that yeah I know it's like an
addiction like I know I'm only to play
it for like two weeks and that's like I
go buy it anyway and then I play it and
I love like really into it and then I'm
just like oh yeah okay that was fun
me alone Call of Duty I well I got to
stop buying you if you want to go baby
if you want
take it back and go retro Mega Man
Legacy Collection comes out this week a
lot of people obsessed with Mega Man
loved Megaman wish there was more
Megaman but right now Legacy Collection
is out you can get this on PlayStation 4
Xbox one or PC it is the first six Mega
Man games plus other stuff they're
promising a bunch of extras and things
like that but Capcom is really gonna
gone all out on this I I am impressed
with the fact that they're releasing all
this together there I can't tell you how
many people I know that are like
obsessed with Megaman so I am very
excited for those people I was never a
Megaman kid like I don't know why you
didn't haven't picked it up yet you love
platformers I do but I was never good
because it's all six the first six like
and then it's like okay well I'll just
play them all out
I don't like super difficult platformers
so it's not really much I think I played
the first Megaman in the third and main
three and that was pretty much it
like I like Kirby's Dreamland I'm oh
that's like like super lame over-the-top
like got super like I'm like no no I'm a
rock so I can't it's not like him I'm
adorable kirby Mars yeah alright so
hipster hipster gamer Ashley has to tell
you about run both it comes out this
week on Wii U I'm actually really
excited about this game because I played
it a little bit at e3 and it was a blast
you can play up to nine people it's
really it's like hard and easy like so
anybody can pick it up but if you get a
lot of people together who are really
good at it it becomes very difficult
it's like a racing game so you have all
of these different colors so your
character is a specific color and you
are racing to the end of a stage and
there's like platforming stuff but the
stage keeps moving and you have to keep
everybody from winning like you like
ball fighting each other while you're
racing to the end it's really really fun
and it's based like an Action Party game
and there's different modes it's not
just the the race people have no idea
what this game is about even based on
your description it's still the most
accurate I know it's it's one of those
games or when you play it you get it
like you're like oh I totally got this I
know what this is but I love the art
style it's very like 60s sort of but ok
that's game play okay so it's like Smash
Brothers but the stage is moving
yeah kind of yeah I mean they do that in
Smash Brothers as well but it's like
it's more of a linear like it's not like
a three dimensional space like you're
jumping on the platforms that are flying
from behind you and stuff it's a so
there's some co-op so it's very strange
and but delightful to play like really
delightful you can put like a side you
can play with up to nine people a great
party game and I think it's like 15
bucks so if you have a Wii U it's a good
it's a good pull for a party so that's
what comes out this week as we said next
week the the these first snowball of the
giant avalanche of ridiculously good
holiday games starts yes so because it's
like Metal Gear it's on and then I go
into hibernation till fallout yeah
pretty much
and then kale will literally fly way
into the ether and we're seeing the nice
knowing you guys I am I've already
talked to my parents they got my affairs
in order so did you get your will here
last yeah Testament not it's like so
long guys yeah just a thanks for all the
fish alright very last saying today is
user feedbacks we're gonna talk about
your your TD Yan in part 2 part 2 so
let's let's hit it
okay these are the last two emails are
gonna read about this but as we
mentioned yesterday we had an avalanche
of user feedback about James Cameron
saying that virtual reality was Yan Yan
Dustin wrote in to us he emailed us and
he said I do kind of see where James
Cameron is coming from right now VR AR
is new technology and completely
uncharted waters like when we first
started with video games I think the
best way to convince him will be a Hugh
that it will be a huge money-making
medium is to run a short demo video of
all the potential ways people can use VR
from video games to simulations the
possibilities for VR and AR are really
only limited by imagination and do not
have creative people like James Cameron
on board would be a huge setback bottom
line mr. Cameron VR AR is the new video
game industry which now rivals the movie
industry and revenue and early adopters
of the industry while they might not
make up as as much up front will really
benefit when the technology starts to
roll in millions of dollars carpe diem
Mr Cameron carpe diem
he's you're very enthusiastic for James
Cameron and get on board he wants to Chi
wants him to reconsider yeah reconsider
your thoughts here and then James wrote
in not James Cameron but another james
wrote in james we're gonna call him
james a because we have james see james
cameron that's it
alright so james a wrote and said
perhaps james cameron is simply jaded in
regards to vr to help him appreciate VRS
potential let's trap him inside of the
Avatar world keeping him busy preparing
the sequel meanwhile VR will have time
to grow into its potential or at least
deep enough into it for Cameron to see
it and appreciate it it is a win-win for
all involved
perhaps Cameron could take a parsec or
two and give a few pointers on how to
improve VR before we track them in the
average our world
I like that just taken prisoner and
never sorry
isn't that a measure of distance and
it's nothing everybody just is like it's
on the cusp and you give it some time
mister people are saying that you're
judging it too early
Mr Cameron Cameron yeah Cameron E um all
right so it's time for our grant last
these use your feedback which is always
our front Agra for the day
so this comes from James we will call
him James B this is going on there are a
lot of James involved in the today's
show I'm sorry I'm so sorry I didn't
realize it until like we got into user
feedback and I'm like we're talking
about James Cameron there's a user
feedback named James and we have a
photographer don't listen don't we have
a producer a producer James on today
producer James producer James yep oh
it's weird I can't even hear so many
he's James Dean that's his catchphrase
by the way that's right
so James we'll call him James B wrote in
and said fun at the Illinois State Fair
these pictures are of the amateur art
show the metal backpack by Jessica
Hatfield I think is perfect allegory to
going back to school because it's made
of metal as heavy it's depressing then
something special just for Cale gossamer
threads by Timothy Carter and these it
this is like a little like wire he used
wiring needs to make it look like it
doesn't matter
a metal spider is even scarier than a
regular spider because it could come to
life and you couldn't kill it with a
book can step on a metal spider oh it
would give you tetanus why okay I get
that spider webs are beautiful but
spiders are not beautiful some writers
are really pretty pretty is the wrong
word I think you can say impressive but
I'm still gonna say you're right
some spiders are very impressive looking
I think they're beautiful spiders if
you're watching I think you're beautiful
