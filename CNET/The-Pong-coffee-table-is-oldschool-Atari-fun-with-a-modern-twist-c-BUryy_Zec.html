welcome back to our live coverage of CES
2018 I'm Claire Reilly and with me is
Walter Nagar oh here to show us a really
cool spin on an old-school pong game
we've been playing quietly before we
started during the break and I'm not
going well so this is you're probably
familiar with the old-school Atari game
pong but this is kind of like an updated
coffee table version of the game I'm
really okay alright I've not done well
at this so what we've got here is a
physical coffee table and this isn't
actually a digital screen we've actually
got physical sliders here knocking a
pong ball back and forth
Walter why have you decided to make a
physical coffee table version of pong
she wanted to make a homage to the first
video game in history
we watched pong back in the 72 he want
you also incorporated designed Fayed
maybe to make it functional we
incorporate also speakers through
bluetooth for example produce music and
also play the game we want you to you
know take some distance of the classic
digital that kind of thing all right so
I'm gonna serve it to you just press the
button ooh yeah that's right the thing
that I'm not going great at is getting
the angles like I used to play this when
I was really young and I always sucked
at those like side angle balls but I
love it how this just kind of zooms back
how did you um how are we controlling
this because it looks like it's a
physical bar how are you actually
controlling that underneath the table
well yes if we make a mess in the floor
with booties and magnets on gay skates
it's like when you play with magnets
between a minotaur table you know trying
to move them around okay that's the kind
of the puzzle all right so it's pretty
simple and kind of high-tech and
low-tech at the same time and it's
probably a lot gosh I'm not going great
this is a zero to four game is it hard
to play or am I just really terrible at
this or is it day one of CES and I'm
already got some city miles on me
you know on a beginner spiel what
happens if we go to higher speed well
okay awesome
and it's also okay so its first two
seven hasn't worked ideally for me it's
also a there's also a Bluetooth speaker
it may be a little out on stage I don't
know how we go but we can play your own
music through and you sync it up and
it's got as it got a solo and two-player
mode play against the sworn enemy so
what's the what's the AI like if I try
against AI how smart is your AI alright
one player oh gosh see the AI isn't as
cruel as you are Walter or maybe it is
I'm holding my own oh gosh oh gosh ah
and so how long have you guys been
developing the table because it's
obviously you've gone through prototype
stages yes well the idea the consumption
of idea wasn't of Daniel normally seguir
was 2014 2014 it was a you know a long
way from there that the company was
invited to the white exhibition was one
of the only companies in the Americas to
go there from there we got to get key
sorry
these are was a major success
Kickstarter so I have a duty right
through a Kickstarter we were asking for
250 we've got 300 35k wow that's amazing
I really love that I'm doing interview
based mode here where I have to like
talk to you whilst playing a relatively
simple game but I just cannot do it this
is like October last year we sign an
exclusive manufacturing and distribution
agreement with units technologies and so
you're starting to sell it now that's
the that's a great thing so who's gonna
be blah who's gonna be buying what a
base this it's around its $27.99 yeah
okay
we expect to see these I know why is
that sound so cruel why do you have to
just make it sound like I'm a failure
Jonah plate to player again it's on okay
so we're just choosing highest number
plays first all right serve so do you
reckon the superfans again you reckon
the superfans are gonna buy this so do
you reckon it's more likely that I'll go
and play it down at my local pub it
gives from 31 to 80 years old
who have experienced the italia and also
won some you know even with design that
they can't put on the living room or
recreation area okay also the bars
because you can have a beer on a pizza
yeah because it'll be a reminder of my
constant failings
I am so how much palm have you played
now developing this game almost blown
the air played too many hours would you
say you're a bit of a probe I love a
broad you know Danielle poor though more
there the guy that great is he keep it
he beats me all the time
alright look yes I'm not great at this
I'm so sorry but thank you so much for
joining us today</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
