how to make a robot even more terrifying
by giving it robot snake legs the
interview will be available to view this
Christmas and we're going to tell you
how to see it and a group of animators
is bringing really old ancient artifacts
to life and it's awesome start early
greetings citizen from the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best speak
talk show in the known universe I'm host
Ashley scatter joining me as always
Santa kale it's almost Christmas hey
you're getting you're getting jacked on
Christmas time right they hope I get a
lot of cool stuff I only you already
bought it all from scipy yo yeah hi I
said I wanted a raspberry pi I want an
iphone 6 plus okay I yeah I want a lot
of electronics there's like a whole
bunch of lists up on CNET's like channel
you're like I'll take that I was
watching them and I'm like oh no there's
no way I'm gonna get all this stuff now
but then then we have CES coming up
don't we get everybody we got CS coming
Christmas too for those of us in the
technology nerd verse um that's like
second Christmas cuz we get to see all
the cool stuff we can take but but
here's probably can't take any of it
home oh oh uh real quick before we get
to the stories there's been a story
based myth bust yes so there's in case
you haven't noticed there's been this
this story that's been circulating you
know how it works with facebook and and
BuzzFeed a story that seems a little too
good to be true it Red's around can you
tell us what about it as a rumor
happening that says that there's gonna
be this planetary alignment on january
fifth and that you're gonna if they're
just gonna mess with the Earth's gravity
and that you're gonna be able to jump
and stay in the air for three seconds
instead of the regular point2 um which
you know is insane and guys if that's
nope debunked there you go no no D you
can go to snopes com and they'll give
you all the information that was
previously reported yeah April fourth of
this year they said it was gonna happen
and then you know it didn't of course
cuz I think we would have all remembered
the time where gravity came to a
lessened on the planet and then and then
again on january fifth cuz they said oh
no no it miscalculated it's January it
was like I Stan by like a NASA
tweet that maybe somebody fake through I
don't yeah I might have been faked I
just it's on snopes not true not
accurate I don't try to jump over
anybody on january fifth is what I'm
saying but ok you might get hurt but
either way if you didn't know about this
it's kind of fun to see how people fake
science stuff and then get people to
love you like yeah I'm Jennifer let's
all jump just so there you go two
seconds to reach other way our saying
just wanted to just wanted to let the
the tomorrow daily people be smarter
we're debunkers yeah we're saying and
you're at your holiday parties and your
New Year's Eve parties if someone brings
that up you're like not true go wrong
you could be that guy or girl at the
party / eggnog on their face look okay
let's do it close Terry let's go to the
headline yeah oh I don't like that I
know you know cuz you hate spiders so
kale is not a fan of the spider and well
you know robot spiders are terrifying
enough okay you think this is this is
really interesting and I love this video
so this comes from the bio robotics lab
at Carnegie Mellon University and they
have this DARPA funded robot and they
gave it a six it's a hexapod with six
robot snake legs and you can see it's
all the leash but chicks out seat whoa
and it can correct it's very good at
correcting being pushed or being moved
it's it's extremely versatile and
extremely very stable very stable so the
neat thing is is that each each leg is
its own sort of robot and so they're
able to kind of operate not necessarily
a hundred percent independently because
they all have to work together but they
can each make their own decisions that's
like what it needs to do to correct
itself so you can watch it crawling over
some debris here that they just threw on
the ground and it does it does it pretty
well which is it's just a little bit
scary and also you know don't put a
gattling gun on it is what I'm trying to
say here don't put or poison darts just
nothing that could maybe attack a person
so yeah they're saying that potentially
you know maybe this would be use in the
future for rescue robots to be able to
go into eyes or space exploration I
don't I mean there's a lot of different
things that they could use it for and
it's just a super fascinating way of
putting a robot together and I saw that
video and I was just like whoa like that
is that is intense like somebody was
just like you know which I snake robot
legs to this to this little robot I
think it would go over really well like
in it and it did but I'm scared I I
think the young you know the legs or
whatever the fact that it you can't be
disturbed like you can push it they were
kicking it yeah it would be able to
really like kind of correct itself
there's a lot of articulation in each of
those legs so really getting over like
we're saying debris or any kind of
obstacle would be relatively easy for it
compared to other robots so we see
another robots kind of struggle but yeah
this is pretty cool i like seeing the
video like seeing a guy like push it
with a split yeah just is like bro
forget it where's your speed your spider
robot I'm a breath yeah um so yeah
that's uh that's that's our scary spider
robot I like I actually like it I'm with
it it only walks it's not as long as
it's not venomous it's not venomous you
shows up in your shower that's pretty
cool 6am okay okay so here we go the
interview is is is definitely back on
but in select theaters and we don't know
VOD you're saying the Viet like they're
not wait they haven't said exactly what
so for those of you keeping up sony i
decided i'll just a few like a week ago
that they weren't gonna release hey yank
the interview because of North Korea's
threats well they decided I didn't lean
allegedly my doing is threats so they
decided hey we're gonna we're gonna day
wait we're cool we're gonna do it this
is the quote that they have from the CEO
of Sony Pictures Michael Lynton we have
never given up on releasing the
interview oh never but I think they did
last week yeah they did I continue we're
excited our movie will be in a number of
theaters on Christmas Day so it'll
apparently be offered simultaneously on
VOD of course Seth Rogen had something
to say about it he said Shh I said I
think you should oh the people have
spoken oh cuz I good keep going freedom
has prevailed Sony didn't give up the
interview will be shown in theaters will
shown in theaters willing to play it on
xmas day so there you go and then James
Franco said uh victory the people and
the President had spoken so there you go
but even the President did speak and
called him James Flacco so that was I
not yeah you didn't see that know when
when President Obama did when he talked
about the Sony like pulling the
interview when he talked about this the
Sony decision to pull the interview he's
like you know I
Seth Rogen and James Flacco oh man so
I'm my greatest I'm interested to see so
I'm interesting how many theaters cuz I
haven't gotten a full I think right now
they said it's like 200 but they said
there might be more they're talking to
more theaters but it will be available i
know the alamo drafthouse is is
definitely showing us Justin uble will
see that so I'm interest to see how many
of you guys would watch it on VOD like
what let me let me know in the comments
and we'll find out you know I don't know
we're gonna watch it and to clear up the
air on this a lot of people have been
asking us via email like why aren't you
guys covering the Sony hack and i gotta
tell you yeah like we are fully aware
and and are always like reading up on
what's going on but we also feel really
uncomfortable about the fact that we
denounce the iCloud hack is like this is
a crime and the people should be held
responsible and anybody who shares these
pictures is not not cool like it's
private data like private data is
private down a regardless of whether
it's a bunch of d-bags up and up at Sony
like making terrible jokes and just
being jerks or people who you know it
doesn't matter if you're a jerk or not I
mean your privacy is your privacy and
their company and I don't know I kind of
feel a gross I do not support the fact
that the media use this to propel
themselves a lot of sites a lot of
YouTube news channels they all used it
to kind of fuel their views and they
wanted to drop every single little thing
and I wasn't supporting there's a
certain that's a choice that's a natural
choice and that's fine but just I'm not
I'm not we're not into it like we're so
different not only that we're here for a
completely different reason we're here
to give you future tech we're here to
kind of fuel your creativity that's why
we're here we want to create
conversation okay positive yeah we'll
keep it positive you know keep it real
so you know we just you know it's like
everyone else we appreciate that you
wanted us to talk about it we really
really do one hundred percent but just
they have our thoughts we have our
opinions man will tell them on Twitter
whatever but the show if you find us
walking around at CES you can ask yeah
I'll tell you what we think but yeah
just generally for money not for us to
really talk about and also like I don't
want to really deep dive into these like
crazy emails I've seen a bunch of
headlines about like oh
jelena Jolie's like fighting with
so-and-so oh my god just I don't want
you let that that's just the way it go
let it just let it die go away so so
they go thank you for asking and on that
note uh here's the story 3 which can I
think it's every strike the deck no kale
hasn't seen this video and I'm really
excited to show Tim so this is from an
animator named Steve k Simmons and an
ancient Greek history expert named Sonia
Nevin they work together to take ancient
art works on vozes and other things in
berea Greek culture and they animate
them and bring them to life so check out
this video so that's wow that's an
actual laws that they took and skin is
scanned or recreated as an animation and
they bring them to life and and show you
different kind of just ways of that they
the Greeks might have been like which is
really cool and they have all kinds of
different ones of ancient Olympics they
have clash of the Dicers which is what
you're watching now this is a it's a
dice game you know it's like something
cool and then well wishers every soldier
which is kind of like a kind of a war
sort of thing and then they have a few
more and it's just really really neat
and if you have any interest at all in
ancient history and and that sort of
thing it's just really fun to watch and
sort of see these images come to life
via panoply a website it's a fun way to
get into the sort of art yeah very any
3d maybe you have kids or a little
brother sister who might want to see
something like it like this is really
fascinating to me I believe there's like
there's a few in each category so they
have they have a few animations each
category there's one called the runners
but they take this that's a fragment
just a fragment of the art and then they
animate it which is so so cool and I
just thought that was super fascinating
i love the idea of this sort of being a
future way of preserving history like we
have these like sort of animations of of
things that least have i'm gonna get my
go ahead and say what somebody is
already gonna mention Oh Hercules yeah
reminds me Kirk you ladies all the muses
I'm the bosses but this is really this
is a really cool thing to do it I'll
creative it's so creative um you can go
over to panoply org UK and you can check
out everything so in panoply is PA and
opl
so check that out it's super cool you
are missing a lot of visuals on this
show if you're just listening today like
there's the robot and then also these
animations are really really neat so I
suggest you check them out but on that
note we're going to take a quick break
we'll be right back we have a lot of new
releases including the interview
obviously and it's our it's our last new
releases of the year and then we and
then we have your user feedback and of
course our phone tower for the day so
don't click weights tomorrow daily
welcome back into the show we are we are
here it's our last Tuesday of the year
that will be here I hope you guys are
going to miss us next week will be on
vacation but you know for now I think
it's time to check out one of our
favorite parts of the week which is all
the new releases
so first up as kale mentioned the
interview mm-hmm the interview with
Eddie in select theaters I saw some
people tweeting this morning saying you
know even though it's coming out it's
still not showing in a theater within a
hundred miles of me so that might be the
case for you but if even if it is the
likelihood of VOD we're hearing rumors
as of right now is of the taping of the
show we're hearing rumors that Sony has
been talking to VOD outlets to break to
end and telling theaters they will be
releasing it VOD the same day that it
will be released theatrically so
hopefully yeah might as well they must I
gotta say it cuz if only select it's
only 200 liters yeah there's no point in
that there you go so there's that um my
one of my favorite childhood frustrating
games duck hunt is now available for the
wii u virtual console you can now go how
do you I think you just use well I would
imagine with the gamepad maybe you could
do it or you tap on the ducks you could
do the or they yeah the controller yeah
and you can angrily but ineffectively
shoot at the dog or if you're if you're
really feeling like you need vengeance
from the dog who laughs at you you can
go over into super smash brothers and
kick his face in mm-hmm which makes me
feel a lot better if I'm being honest
yeah just really cathartic all those
years I finally am able to beat up the
duck hunt dog and then I thought this
was awesome so apparently Temple Run vr
is now available oh I for free for the
Samsung gear VR so if you have a note or
a note edge a note for note edge you
were able to in first person du temple
run it looks like it looks really look
really good um it makes me want to go
get all those things and try it is a lot
of things it is a lot of things but it
looks really neat and I am like I think
a lot of people are gonna be really
excited about kind of this sort of thing
like we're gonna start seeing kind of VR
games hit app stores and different
things like that was right pretty fun um
but yeah so that its Temple Run VR again
it's free you just they'll pick it up
yeah awesome and then in theaters as
just like the interview on Christmas Day
we are gonna see big eyes which was not
Tim Burton yes are you holding the cnet
logo I appreciate that goes right big
Isis
burns newest flick it is a based on a
true story about Margaret Keane who was
the kind of creator of these paintings
with you know kids with big eyes and all
this stuff and it became kind of this
phenomenon it was kind of a kitschy sort
of fad that caught on it was very very
popular and then but what happened was
her husband at the time was a con man
and took credit for all her work because
it just said keen and so he took credit
for it and christoph waltz plays oh yeah
you can't go wrong with Amy Adams or
Christoph Waltz yeah and it just it
looks fun it's colorful looks
interesting like I I'm curious about it
I think it might be really good I know
Tim Burton has kind of been a little
uneven like over the last maybe 10 years
yeah but a lot of people are saying that
big fish this is like a big fish seems
more like a big fish as opposed to you
know kind of whimsical obviously a
whimsical Alice in Wonderland or Charlie
chocolate I was on the thigh was one of
maybe two people on the planet that was
on the fence about this move everybody
seems pretty excited but you can just me
that it's an interesting story it's
based on a true story and one of the one
of my favorite things about this movie a
fun little like tidbit that I read which
is true is um there's a there's a
courtroom scene obviously they have to
go to court to like work all this stuff
out and that happened in real life as
well and apparently it was so
over-the-top the real-life courtroom
situation that when they were filming
the courtroom situation timber and ask
Christoph Waltz like tone it down and
they were just letting the writers were
like no no it was even worse than what
we wrote in the script like it was even
crazier than what we wrote so like I
highly recommend just looking up the
story anyway and if you see it like you
can sort of check out like what then
alright what the creative liberties were
with the story but I just I'm interested
that and then lastly next week a most
violent year is going to hit theaters
this is oscar isaac jessica chastain it
looks really good and really kind of
dark and gray to emote on Christmas no
no I think this is a really good New
Year's movie I'm really really
fantastical it just looks good i love
jessica chastain obviously Oscar Isaac
is in the new star wars film if you're
if you're into into IMDb but I like
Oscar Isaac a lot um he was great in
that Coen Brothers flick what's that one
I forgot
inside llewyn davis oh yeah the lead in
that movie and he was so good at it um
and of course Jessica Chastain is
fantastic and also hailer halo 5
multiplayer beta is gonna start sometime
the next I think week or so oh yeah so
yeah Fox why I didn't put that in the
notes but I just remembered it right now
gotta get on that somehow nobody huh
yeah well gonna come out you come over
come over to my house and the will play
uh oh yeah that'd be fun you're in it
you're in the beta I don't know I'm sure
I could try you have to sign up you have
to do something I don't know I don't
know how that work gotta have friends
among friends that are friends in high
places not low places okay um okay well
on that note let's head up your user
feedback so first up I have to let you
know we actually got either a tweet or
an email from somebody and I am a
terrible person and I didn't write it
down but they said a lot of the trash
you would burn it on it would burn off
in the atmosphere on reentry so maybe
they would like throw like throw it back
draw back at Earth and then light burn
up interesting I thought that was
a really good which is really good idea
it's good idea ok so we asked you guys
use the hashtag TD trash and tell us uh
what what you'd want to see you floating
around on the sky or what you we you
know we'd be cleaning up in any sci-fi
universe you guys came up with some good
ones Sean Rogerson said the lost
tomorrow daily blooper reel somehow I
was floating above our head you never
get a seat are you see where he or not
we are not in that blueberry oh uh
George Roach was instead agreed with
Kailyn said Luke Skywalker's right hand
would that be awesome be so weird uh
Tony wrote to us Tony wrote to us yes
okay guys it's just thumbs up a great
dish faces Chewbacca says what happens
in space stations hahahahahaha what do
you would which made me laugh that was
really funny good and then Matt wrote to
us and said we may find a white round
object with a glowing orange I that
seems to be very interested in space
space yeah it's basic space do you know
what that's from because because the
space i needed about 10 seconds so think
about it space gotta go to space mm-hmm
of course it's from portal for sale
whately everybody's favorite everybody's
favorite robot yeah I don't want to give
away name it
a space that's great ya bub it so yeah I
love the Wheatley reference that was
delightful your hashtag of the day today
we are actually gonna where it's going
to take a couple weeks or actually no
that's it's tomorrow TD best of 20 I'm
sorry that's tomorrow jack is tomorrow's
hashtag I'm getting ahead of myself TD
best of 2014 we want to hear from you
guys what's your favorite tech stories
what is your favorite pop culture stuff
what is your favorite video game of the
year we want to know what your choices I
am very interested to hear what their
favorite stories were a lot of good ones
I ain't even had to do a lot of research
but honestly it's gonna be whatever one
surface to on your brain that you may be
told other people yeah or that made you
look up others are that you got really
excited about spoil my I won't spoil
mine either but I am kind of a theme on
my yeah so mine was one singular event I
think it was good ok yeah it could be
like you know anything that happens NASA
can be any of the future tech gage
attack could be it somebody printed out
toilet' exhibition in Tokyo whatever you
want it's totally fine you weren't here
for that that was one of our earliest
shows there was a ton exhibition in
Japan about the toilet the history of
the toilet and part of it was there was
a 15-foot tall toilet that you you
walked into a room there's a giant
toilet and then you picked up a little
hat and it was a poop and you put it on
your head and then you slit is a slide
you slid under the toilet then you can
learn about like staying in stata Japan
uh-huh of course of course it was but
really I was extremely enlightening yeah
for a lot of people who went there and
learned about the history of the toilet
so anyway TD best of 2014 that's your
hashtag do do that up and let's talk
about our very last piece of user
feedback which is of course your user
feedback no our photog refer the day
okay so this is from sean s they took
this with his galaxy s5 whoa what is
that ok so he explains he says hi guys
big fan of the show have been supporting
it since day one I haven't submitted any
photos to be featured on the show as I
didn't think I had any photos worth
sharing I found this photo of that being
said I recently found this photo that I
took with my oh I'm sorry a nexus 5 will
correct that it was taken on 11 11 14 at
the Tower of London 880 8246 ceramic
poppies flooded the tower in order to
remember the soldiers who lost their
lives in the Great War over 100 years
ago it was a truly humbling experience I
wish both and all of the
behind-the-scenes crew I'm very merry
christmas and a happy new year that's
fantastic I've never found it worse is
that I've been to the tower and I loved
it it was amazing but I've never seen I
hadn't seen it like this so I I knew I
think I saw some pictures on social
media of people taking photos of this
but not at night like this and that is
just stunning very cool and what a great
memorial like what a beautiful sort of
poignant way to honor those who you know
fought in them yeah thanks for sharing
