and yes 4th friday i'm jay pag are
filling in for Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update as you may or may not
know today is force friday actually of
course you know about it because this
Star Wars marketing campaign is
everywhere the movie might not be out
for another few months but the
merchandising machine is in full effect
that said this bb-8 rolling droid is
pretty adorable check out some of this
footage oh my god what did i do we've
got to look at all the Star Wars march
hitting the internet today so head over
to cnet.com for the latest the ephah
consumer electronics show going on right
now in Germany has debuted a handful of
eye-popping new products there's a Wi-Fi
robot vacuum from neato a sleep monitor
you slip under your bed from Samsung the
new gear s2 and moto 360 smartwatches
and a bunch more we've got a full team
on the ground in Berlin so be sure to
head over to cnet com / IFA for the very
latest as that show comes to a close so
there's a new personal safety app that
allows a user's friend to virtually walk
them home at night it's called
appropriately enough the companion app
and it was created by five students from
the University of Michigan an app user
can request a friend or family member to
keep them company during a walk and the
app will send the companion a link they
don't need to have the app installed
that link lets them track the user via
GPS and they'll get notified if the user
Falls if they start running or even if
their headphones get yanked out some
really smart stuff there it's free and
it's available now on iOS and Android
and finally you didn't think I'd finish
up the week without one last tiny tidbit
of information ahead of next week's

to release a new version of the 21.5
inch imac in october with a bumped up
for

bump in price for the 21 and a half inch
