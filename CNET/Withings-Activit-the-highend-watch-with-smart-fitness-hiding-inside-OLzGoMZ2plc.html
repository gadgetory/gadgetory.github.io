little bit of style
maybe that's so invisible that it just
looks like a watch I'm Scott Stein and
hey I'm going out at night I look at my
wrist in what's this it's a high-end
watch actually this is the fitness
tracker this is the whigs activity and
it looks like a regular analog watch
that's the whole point this is a Swiss
design watch which the French company
Withings explains to great lengths on
their website it has a sapphire crystal
on top French cabs leather strap
stainless steel and it's water-resistant
to five atm like a regular watch and
it's got a battery that lasts about
eight months to a year but inside it's
actually got high-tech guts this has got
bluetooth it also vibrates to wake you
up
it tracks your steps it tracks your
sleep and it syncs with your iPhone
Android is coming soon and the Withings
app which has already been available for
some time works with a variety of other
weddings fitness trackers plus smart
scale plus blood pressure monitor and a
couple of other apps like run keeper and
MyFitnessPal so under the hood it's
pretty high-tech at least as high-tech
as your recent generation of fitbit's or
jaw bones or misfits doesn't have heart
rate tracking however that stuff's a
little half-baked anyhow the design of
it again this looks like a regular watch
and the only indication that it's not is
a secondary dial which tells you your
daily activity progress and that goes by
your daily step goal 10,000 steps or
whatever you set it to and then if you
want to set an alarm it will buzz gently
to wake you up you can double check that
by double tapping and it'll go right to
your alarm time that's only nifty trick
it's got up its sleeve the rest of it is
really meant to not stand out and if you
want to go swimming with this there is
going to be a firmware update to allow
swim tracking and it comes with a
silicone band that you can easily snap
on and off is this something you want to
get well consider that it's $450 yes
more expensive than the entry-level
Apple watch and it's in limited supply
however it might set the bar for
slightly smarter watches down the road
expect this to be a trend with major
watch manufacturers who start sneaking
in some features like Fitness tracking
into regular watches
I'm Scott sign and this is the whigs
activity which my mom said was the
nicest looking activity tracker that
I've worn all year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
