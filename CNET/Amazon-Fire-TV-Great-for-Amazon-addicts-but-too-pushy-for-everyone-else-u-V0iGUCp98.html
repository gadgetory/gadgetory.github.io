Amazon video streamer is designed to
compete against devices like Roku Apple
TV chromecast and even your Smart TV
unlike those devices its main focuses on
delivering Amazon own streaming content
sure it has apps for Netflix Hulu and
many others but Amazon TV shows and
movies take center stage but let's start
with the hardware the box is slim and
tiny designed to hide on your AV system
it has an HDMI output an Ethernet jack
and of course supports the latest 802
dot 11ac Wi-Fi standard the new version
drops the optical port but adds an SD
card slot for expandable storage it also
has a more powerful processor legend
though as any real-world improvement in
response times which for excellent their
mode is small and sleek - and it's the
main way you'll talk to the new fire TV
press this button and fire TV starts
listening new for this year is Alexa a
voice assistant that replies to your
commands and questions much like Siri on
Apple's iPhones here's a taste Alexa
what's the weather in New York at 60
degrees with clear skies and Sun today
you can look for partly sunny weather
with a high of 69 and a low of 50 add a
baby monitor my shopping list I add a
baby monitor to your shopping list when
is the Mets game tonight the Mets will
play tonight at 8:07 p.m. away against
the Cubs elects is a cool feature but
not as useful on a device like this as
the ability to search for TV shows and
movies voice search works well on fire
TV but the results again favor Amazon
content that's fine if he only subscribe
to prime but if you subscribe to other
services too like Netflix Hulu Plus HBO
GO or others Roku and chromecast have
better search and as you can see here
most of the categories on the main
interface go to Amazon content despite
the fact that fire TV supports three
thousand other apps and games speaking
of games fire TV is also available in a
gaming edition it trades a standard
remote for a game controller a 32 gig SD
card and a couple of free games if
you're really into the kind of casual
games amazon offers most of which were
originally designed to play on phones it
might be worth the extra money both
versions of the new fire TV box support
4k video 2
from Netflix and Amazon currently with
more 4k apps like YouTube coming soon 4k
video looked very good in our test but
not that much better than Amazon's
regular 1080p streams and of course most
4k TVs have streaming apps of their own
built in all told the new fire TV has
some decent improvements over the old
version but unless your primary
streaming source is Amazon Prime it's
not as good as the alternatives I'm
