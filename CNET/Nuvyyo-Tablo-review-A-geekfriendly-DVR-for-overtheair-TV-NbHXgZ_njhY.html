keep up with sports and award shows is
using free over-the-air TV but the
options for recording that content have
always been limited especially if you
don't want the hassle of building a
media center PC hey I'm Matthew moscovia
from C net and the new vo tableau is one
of the most exciting over-the-air
recording solutions to come out in years
it uses the same concept that simple TV
debuted at CES 2012 streaming live and
recorded over-the-air TV to devices you
already have like iOS and Android
devices Roku boxes the Apple TV and
chromecast
there's not much to the hardware it's a
simple black box and on the back there
are a few ports including Ethernet 2 USB
ports and an antenna input
there's also built in Wi-Fi and tableau
has dual tuner capability so you can
record two programs at once also note
that there's no HDMI output and that's
because tableau doesn't output any video
itself it only streams live and recorded
content to other devices on your home
network one of the nice advantages of
that is that you can put tableau
anywhere that's convenient it doesn't
have to be right next to your TV in
addition to the tableau box you also
need a USB hard drive and an antenna for
tableau to work and neither of those are
included the tableau itself costs two
hundred and twenty dollars plus there's
a five dollar monthly fee but make sure
you add in the cost of the accessories
to get the true total price on the unit
now the user interface for tableau
depends on what device you're using but
they all have similar categories like
live TV prime time TV shows movies
sports and recordings the iPad app is
the best experience overall with plenty
of screen real estate to navigate
listings programs load very quickly even
over Wi-Fi and skipping through
commercials feels almost instant in the
living room the Roku is the best option
since you get a true on screen display
but the overall experience still needs
some work there's only a super basic
channel guide and there's no easy way to
skip through commercials there's a
10-second skip which means you have to
press forward too many times
or you can try and fast forward but
since only the progress bar moves
forward not the screen on the background
you kind of just have to guess when the
commercials end if you do most of your
TV watching in the living room rather
than on a tablet the short companies do
get tired
well they found tableau to be remarkably
reliable in recording my favorite shows
it wasn't quite up to the task with
sports where tableau only records the
allotted time for games now since most
games tend to run a little long that
meant tableau recordings were cut out
before the end of the game new vo says
it's working on a fix but until then
you're not going to want to count on
tableau to record sporting events the
most impressive aspect of tableau is its
image quality especially if you choose
the highest recording quality option
usually streaming solutions like this
really struggle with sports but tableau
actually looks pretty good and on non
sports content it can be hard to tell
you're not watching regular TV in the
first place so altogether there's a lot
about tableau that really impressed me
from its overall reliability to the
image quality and the excellent
experience on the iPad what the issues
were recording sports and the clunky
Roku app puts a blow squarely in the
early adopter territory for now even
though the technology looks quite
promising if you're willing to live with
some growing pains tableau is well worth
of two hundred and twenty dollars but
mainstream buyers are currently better
off with more traditional products like
the channel master DVR plus and the TiVo
