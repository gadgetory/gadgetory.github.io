scar se boy joined by senior editor seth
rosenblatt and sets today we are talking
about the debut in the much-anticipated
Google pixel the touch book Chrome yes
tell us a little bit about this device
first so this is the device that had the
video ad that was leaked two weeks ago
it's a touchscreen Chromebook the first
of its kind it's actually kind of
interesting because when google debuted
the Chromebook several years ago the
very first thing I did with it
accidentally was open it and touched the
screen ah so this is something that I
think a lot of people certainly I have
been anticipating for quite a while
you've had your hands on the device
laptop for a couple of hours now what
are your initial impressions our
thoughts it's interesting the divide the
laptop has a different screen ratio than
most screen ratios most laptop screens
are designed at 16 9 because that's wide
screen and it looks Bend Hollywood
movies look very good on it this is
actually a three to two ratio screen
because most of the web is vertical at
least that's google's theory and so
people will be scrolling vertically
through their docs yeah through websites
and instead of trying to get web sites
to change to a horizontal orientation
which is going to be very difficult they
just decided to make the screen more
vertically oriented what's interesting
about this is that i found that while i
was typing on it the screen was just a
hair further away from my fingers when I
went to go touch the screen then I've
been experiencing with windows 8 devices
which tend to be more horizontally
oriented did you find that the
touchscreen was responsive fast enough
it was most of the time it was very
responsive a couple of times it was sort
of wonky and Google's sundar pinch I the
senior vice president of chrome and
google apps explained that was actually
not a hardware issue but a back-end
issue that will be fixed over time as
Google's Chrome OS which powers the
device iterates it updates every six
weeks so instead of waiting with Max or
with Windows for a couple updates a year
if you're lucky this gets updates every
six weeks just like your browser and
another important point about this pixel
is that it's also one of the first
pieces of
her laptop hardware that Google has
designed itself it is the first be first
so why is that important as far as where
this company wants to go in the future
well up until now Google has only
developed their own hardware for Android
and this is the first instance of them
developing hardware that's non-android
except for google glass right so with
this where i think what i think what
we're seeing is the first steps towards
a unified Android and Chrome operating
system mmm interesting you can do the
hardware and the software and do it all
together yes and finally how much is the
cost and when is it available all right
it's not cheap the Wi-Fi only version is
going to cost you 12 99 in the US and
that's available for pre-order now I
believe it's shipping in a week or two
the lte-enabled version is going to run
you a couple hundred more than that and
that's going to ship in early April but
you can also pre-order that now great
thank you so much your senior editor
