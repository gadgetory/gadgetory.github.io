one of all time and what movie franchise
just needs to go to sleep and stop
bothering us go away forever well hey
what's going on everyone welcome to
another fantastic addition of nope sorry
the debate show where I Jeff Bakalar
argue with my friends and colleagues and
sworn enemies over three rounds of dead
serious discourse joining me today a
former friend mr. Nick Henry how's it
going yeah we already ended our
friendship before this episode right so
we have nothing to lose all right here's
how the game works Nick and I will
debate over three rounds and we will be
assigned points based on how well we
made our argument assigning those points
today thank you for coming back Abby
Russell is here thank you so much for
having me it's exciting to finally be
the one to wield the power here it is
don't let it get to your head No - wait
okay it's gone straight to her head we
are the victims in this episode Abby
what is the topic for round one well as
we all know Nintendo has come out with
many amazing consoles right but there
can only be one best what's the tippy
tippy top of the best Nintendo consoles
you have 90 seconds on the clock
starting now okay it's obviously the
Super NES or thus Ness for short this
was a generation defining console it
brought us Super Mario World the best of
the Mario's we all know this to be a
true fact of no arguing that Link to the
Past Donkey Kong Country Super Mario
Kart can you name a more influential
game changing title in the history of
games you cannot this this brought couch
co-op to the forefront Mario Paint was a
game changer it was but they was it was
the most defining console of our young
generation everybody most people - okay
guys were just gonna cut sell you
you're in the video game industry and
you can use fancy words like couch co-op
whatever the hell that means but I'm
gonna pick the Nintendo 64 because it
will always have my heart it was weird
it was fun
had all those wacky controllers that
came in different colors as well as the
console and people saw their like how
the hell do I hold this thing well you
know what Jeff they figured it out and
not only did those controllers work they
worked well and they had all these
insanely fun multiplayer games up to
four players we had Super Smash Brothers
cool tonight Mario Kart 64 my parents
played Mario Kart 64 with me did they
play any other games hell no and you
know even even ripoffs like Diddy Kong
Racing we're fun as hell
they had freaking planes hovercrafts you
know I'll never be an n64 classic
there's a reason there's an SNES class
just to your point real quick zelda
ocarina of time super mario 64
those are up there in the in the
all-time bonus all right well only one
person can decide our fate for this
round Abby Russell what's a yeah it
feels good I just want to relish in the
power for it much just soak it in anyway
I think both excellent points across the
board Jeff a lot of great points but a
lot of just talked about how the you
know the library of the SNES is great
still very strong but I will give you
two points for that
and then you Nick of course you talk
about the versatility of the n64 the fun
colors and your parents are into it my
parents also played it so three points
for me for the Nintendo 64 it's not my
fault my parents aren't 40 years old but
it is your fault that you only talked
about the game library oh yeah because
there's nothing else important it okay
fine I'm not gonna argue with the judge
that got me in hot water last time I
know that Nick's gonna go first
this next round Abby what's the topic
well as we all know movies are coming
out left and right and there are tons of
franchises nobody ever makes originals
anymore am i right fellas you're right
even this isn't an original right so
what is the most tire to film franchise
out there once again you got 90 seconds
on the clock here we go alright I'm
gonna get a lot of heat from this one
maybe even from our in-house producer
Brian but I got it I got to say Star
Wars okay I grew up you know being a fan
of all the originals including returning
the Jedi because Ewoks get too much hate
they're mad cute and they have really
sweet houses
but in the mid-90s I don't know if you
remember this but they remastered the
originals and they just added these
horrible like ps1 graphics there and
that should have been the first warning
sign that all Star Wars is is a gigantic
money grab and then after that then came
the pot racing trilogy and as well have
been the pod racing trilogy because we
got to see badass Darth Vader as a
little ding bat kid and a brooding
teenager I don't want that get that out
of here
now there's a new movie or a TV show or
a Taco Bell advertising collab every
other week they might as well be Pokemon
Thank You Star Wars thank you for what
you created but I'm ready to move on and
just see some more original ideas tough
act to follow I agree with you on pretty
much every level there I'm gonna say
just straight-up like Avengers now maybe
more the marvel at large but like there
came a point when all these Avengers
movies were coming out where I was just
like I don't even know which one I'm
supposed to see next you should never
have to do homework to ensure that
you're going to enjoy the film you're
going to watch it's ridiculous it's
confusing what do we got a play catch up
I got to read all these guides on which
movies to what what the hell's going on
it's fucking billions and billions of
dollars it's the same money grab
situation of Star Wars let me live maybe
just wait three years to release an
Avengers movie I feel like I'm bombarded
just stop already it is it's exhausting
move oh that was exhausting boom that is
exhausting I will say both of you
excellent job excellent reporting on
both these very tired franchise enough
already
but I think Avengers as you well put you
got to do a bunch of research to even
understand what's going on it's crazy
our war is they're easy to follow you
know you don't got to do anything you
just hop right in
but Avengers whoo boy I don't even know
what's going on I don't know anyone's
names and that's why you win with three
points Jeff and you are slowly behind
with two like Josh Brolin is like
different characters and different I
don't understand yeah it's weird and
there are like five different Chris's
and all of them there's a ton of Chris
I'm also pretty good looking there's too
many Chris's alright five to five round
three gonna decide it's the rubber match
is that what it's is that the right
use of that term I don't know these
hockey terms that's a baseball thing oh
it's a bit I like baseball oh great I'm
glad I got your attention new word new
word round three a B here we go ah yes
so it is wintertime the peak of winter
right now and there are some favorite
winter sports not hockey unfortunately
but Mountain Sports
we got thing four one one thing for both
feet or one thing for each foot which
winds skiing or snowboarding 90 seconds
on the clock take her away okay
obviously skiers are the better people
everyone knows that my god snowboard is
driving me crazy or carving up the
mountain you're pushing snow to the side
so all the ice comes up nobody wants to
go down the mountain if there you've
been on it because it's a ridiculous
thing I got a freaking go down like some
sort of rocket power scared it's enough
stop carving up the mountain you can't
even get up the ski lifts you're
bunching up is the board's hanging from
one foot you look goddamn ridiculous
you're hopping along like some sort of
bunny rabbit in the ski queue come on
get out of here
nobody wants your junk and and when you
guys fall it is who knows what's gonna
happen people could die lives can be
ruined when a skier falls the skis
detach you fall off to the side it's not
from what is some skis what the catcher
thinks when the snow killer Falls
that's it could be it so good luck
rolling the dice every time you're
skee-ball right let me start this your
plane right in my hand snowboarding is
for the people skiing is for the 1% when
you think of a skier you just picture
this old guy who just like ballet
there's Mercedes G wagon the whole day
just been scoffing at other people that
get too close to him there's like oh
yeah and then I'm like mister skier dude
relax you got sleds JEP to your feet
you're going down a mountain this should
be fun and he just looks at me and goes
you're standing on my ski and they're
probably the reason for you know really
expensive snowboarding Johnny tsunami
was a snowboarder and let's face it skis
are the rollerblading of snow and
everyone knows that rollerblading is not
cool good luck on a flat area mister
snowboarder I'm not letting you tag
along and hitchhike on my Pole okay
as if snowboarders don't pay for going
on the mountain he's going over the time
you're right but this is fine I like I
like a little spice those waffles she
likes spice Abby skiers don't like
suicide this episode please I have to
say this was a close one
really neck-and-neck I'm kind of going
back and forth on that final point
there's really gonna work there's
nothing there it's enough anyway I think
you both made excellent points I wish
you argued more in the favor of your own
thing versus just against the other
thing it's hard to do in scale it's just
like you know a friendlier debate I
guess person sure I think you made some
excellent points about how skiing they
attach to your feet they fall off that
seems like a safety thing sure I don't I
haven't really done either snowboarding
you've ruined a mountain okay I
appreciate that and then snowboarding I
was way onboard you have a lot of fun
voices which I liked you talk about a
fun character which I liked what I
didn't like is you bashed rollerblading
and rollerblades Kulish so you lost the
point on that one Jeff gets three
tickets too if he didn't say about
rollerblading get 101 I use my eraser
because of that robic and kulish I guess
rollerblading is kind of cool but but
skiing is not cool it is this is Trail
and it is for the 1% rich people ski
feeling ski lifts in like getting up
there yeah where'd you get that
snowboarder guy where'd you get that
snowboard and the helmet hmm wasn't free
alright over yet it's over I won 8 to 7
this is not over you and me oh I'll be
back dude I gotta take a breather here
thank you so much for somehow refereeing
that very highly contested match their
excellent judging thank you so very much
McHenry I'll shake your hand but it's
only a formality because I don't buy
into any of this I'm the winner what did
I win
ooh a flip oh that's a good price guess
what I'm gonna need it on the mountain
with my bougie ass
all right thank you so much to everybody
involved in oh sorry I appreciate it
if you want to suggest a topic to debate
for next time do so in the comment
section below I guess I won't be seeing
you on the mountain after all there Nick
nope we'll take separate ski lifts all
the way up I'll just peer into your back
when we're going ups now you can just
hop along like the cool guy you look
like thanks for watching we'll see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
