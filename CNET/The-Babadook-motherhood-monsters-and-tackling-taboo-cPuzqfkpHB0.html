writer and director of new Australian
horror film the babadook Jennifer the
Babbitt Rock was actually born from a
short film he did called the monster
the monster is really different in tone
how did you progress it from that really
but that almost playful tone to
something that's quite a bit darker yeah
well I didn't intend to write the
babadook when I made monster at all I
wasn't thinking I want to make this into
a feature film it was just the idea at
the core of my short really stuck with
me this idea of you know the importance
of facing your dark side facing your
shadow side and so I was working on a
number of films after my short and I
couldn't like and they kept I couldn't
get them made basically and and so I
kept coming back to this idea and then
eventually years later I started writing
a film about it this idea of yeah facing
your dark side I guess so yeah it's a
much more complex story obviously being
a feature but it is a lot darker I'd say
what made you think of Kickstarter as a
method of funding the film we
fortunately already been funded by
Screen Australia and the South
Australian film corporation so we had a
you know a small but tidy package of
money to make the film but we didn't
have enough for our design department
and there's a real world to this film
and we knew that we needed to create it
so we thought we'd you know we'd put it
out there and see what support we could
get back and the support was phenomenal
and it also generated a really strong
fan base for us and people that felt
involved and that was really important
for us and we've kept them informed and
they're up they came to our premieres
all around Australia so yeah it's been a
really positive experience for us
I did notice however that you only just
made your funding goal
did you have a plan B if that had fallen
through no we did not have a plan B and
you know I was on set directing and then
I go off and I'd be checking my phone
and thinking no era you know will we
make it and it was really touch and go
but I think that people just you know
pulled out all stops and at the eleventh
hour and we had extraordinary support
from really quite high-profile people
you know Miriam margulies and Tom
Stoppard and just incredible people so
they brought a lot of publicity to our
campaign you seem to just not care about
the tropes at all for example you've got
a film with a parent and a child and
normally the child is the creepy one you
flip that on its head an interestingly
for an Australian film it's all set
inside a house where as Australian
horror is typically located in wide open
spaces as a filmmaker I really can only
do something that I feel very drawn to
so there wasn't a sense of thinking I
should make a film like this or I should
make a film like that it was very much
going from that core idea of facing your
dark side and I guess I love horror I've
loved her since I was a kid so I know
all those tropes very well but I
certainly didn't feel reined in by them
I didn't feel like I had to be a good
horror film maker and make a film that
horror fans would like you know in with
all due respect to them I really didn't
care I just needed to tell this story in
the best way possible so yeah maybe
that's what makes it a little bit
different to some of the other horror
out there
I really love the characters of Amelia
at am and I found it interesting that
the biggest fear that the film seemed to
speak to was a maternal one which is
what if I can't stand my own child how
did that become a story you wanted to
tell well it's interesting you know
because when I started to write this I
was googling women who hate their
children or women who can't love their
children and it was very telling to me
that I could find nothing but yeah so
people think that that that's not a
reality that you know we would all like
to think that every mother comes into
the world with this innate sense of love
for them for their offspring but it's
disturbingly common for women to
struggle with that and I've also seen
every woman that I know I don't have
children but I've seen every woman that
I know say you know I'm sure was a
better mother and feel like they're not
a good mother even if they're
extraordinary lovers so I really wanted
to touch on that you know I really
wanted to be honest about Mother Love
and the shadow side of that and it's had
a wonderful response from from women who
who felt this collective sigh of relief
there's others that aren't perfect out
there as well and I think that's one of
the really important things about the
film actually one thing but it can also
be very treacherous magic tricks to
surprise shock your family and friends
so you mentioned that you've always
loved horror since you're a little girl
so did you start off wanting to make a
horror film or did you start off wanting
to tell a story about a mother I think
they came together so I think that the
idea came and the whole point of facing
something you know and that you can't
face and it gets bigger and bigger is
terrifying for most people and to put it
in a drama context in a dramatic context
didn't seem to make sense and I think it
would have become melodramatic and it
wouldn't have reached people and grab
people the way that it is now so I think
horror allows us as an audience to
really enter into a heightened world and
it also allows us to explore me and
these things really they may seem unreal
on the surface or heightened but the
emotions running through them are very
real and I guess hora is a gift in that
way to tell this kind of story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
