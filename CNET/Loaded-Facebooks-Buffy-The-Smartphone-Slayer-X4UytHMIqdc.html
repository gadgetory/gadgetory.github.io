Wilson Tang on cnet com and it's time to
get loaded rumors of a facebook phone
have persisted for quite some time but
according to a report from all things D
Facebook has tapped smartphone maker HTC

social network integrated into its core
experience it's code named buffy after
the television series starring sarah
michelle gellar supposedly the phone

support html5 as a platform for
applications speaking of mobile apps
CTIA the Trade Organization for the

Google research in motion nokia and
microsoft app stores companies are
trying hard to find ways to keep and
recruit talented employees and microsoft

stock options or big bonuses but free
bacon the company is trying to double
the size of its engineering team and has
set up a bacon wagging to serve free
slices of that delicious meat Adobe
wants its customers to subscribe rather
than by their software it helps the
company maintain consistent revenues
when many creative pros think that the
features of cs3 are still good enough so
the company has decided that it will
make up rating to new software more
unpalatable when the company unveils its
creative cloud next year it will cost
4999 a month and include access to apps
like illustrator indesign premiere pro
flash pro after effects dreamweaver and
new adobe apps edge and muse meanwhile
only users with cs5 or cs5 point-five

on older versions you'll only get 20
percent off the regular price until the
end of the year now here's a company
that knows the value of a good deal
