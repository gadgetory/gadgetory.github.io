super watch it's part activity tracker
part GPS running walk and part
SmartWatch I am Dan Graziano and this is
the Fitbit surge this does everything
you expect from a fitbit product it can
track the steps you take the distance
you travel calories burned floors
climbed and automatically track your
sleep at night there's GPS onboard so
you can see things like pace and
distance when running and it can even
display notifications from your
smartphone so it's currently limited to
calls and text messages perhaps the most
interesting feature is the optical heart
rate sensor on the back of the device
this will measure your beats per minute
all day every day which should
theoretically help improve sleep
tracking and estimates for your calories
burned now this all sounds great but not
everything is perfect I found a resting
heart rate to be relatively accurate
when compared to a polar chest strap but
things didn't go as well when I began to
work out the surges readings were
usually off by around 30 beats per
minute when lifting weights or running
speaking of running the features are
basic even among the most basic running
watches out there there's no smart
coaching no recovery mode auto pause or
any other feature you would find in
parable GPS watches battery life also
isn't that good with a continuous GPS
signal you can expect again around five
hours which isn't enough time for most
people to even finish a marathon Fitbit
said that with a continuous heartrate
and activity tracking battery life is
around seven days but I found it close
to five the last thing that really
bothered me about the surge is that you
can't wear it in the shower or all
swimming it's only sweat and splash
proof the Fitbit surge is available now
for 250 bucks for more information you
can check out my full review over at
cnet.com I'm Dan graziano CNET and that
was a first look at the Fitbit surge</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
