gets a lift and Wall Street is buzzing
about Facebook I'm Bridget Carey and
this is your cnet update it's a new day
and a new leader for Yahoo after four
months on the job Scott Thompson
resigned as Yahoo's chief executive
regarding the scandal about how he made
false statements about his education for
several years Thompson's bio stated that
he graduated with both an accounting and
computer science degree but he never
went to school for computer science but
there's more to the story the wall
street journal reports that last week
during the investigation Thompson told
the board he has thyroid cancer and his
health is part of the reason he wants to
step down Yahoo's new interim chief is
Ross Levinsohn he was in charge of
Yahoo's advertising strategy Levinson is
Yahoo 6 CEO in the past five years the
job seems to be a revolving door at
Yahoo let's see if Levinson can change
that it's time for some apple rumors and
speculations best buy has just
discounted all mac computers and chances
are it means the store is making room
for some new models there's been talk of
a new line of MacBook Pros coming out
they would have the latest Intel
processors beef in like the macbook air
and could even have retina displays and
sources at I'm or say the iPhone 5 is
coming out in October but before you
roll your eyes at this this is actually
the latest in several reports we've
heard about an October release so maybe
there's something actually to this
October launch rumor and the wall street
journal reports that apple is planning
to update iCloud so you can comment on
and share photos with other I cloud
users right now I cloud is just
restoring your files and syncing them
with your own devices not for sharing
with others this is a historical week
for tech on Wall Street Facebook is set
to launch one of the largest initial
public offerings in history on Friday
and when Facebook goes public you can
expect the company to focus on new ways
to make money we previously reported on
a new feature Facebook was testing
charging you two dollars if you want
your status to be seen by more friends
we asked if you would pay for something
like that and here's a few responses we
got on tout absolutely not
I think that would turn facebook into a
paid service like eHarmony which is
basically what Facebook is already
absolutely not because first of all I
don't care about my facebook statuses
and no one else does either second of
all that's two meals on the dollar menu
of McDonald's thanks for the comments
and you can check out all the responses
on tout and send us your thoughts any
time that's your tech news update for
