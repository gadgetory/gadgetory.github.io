spring by taking a closer look at smart
garden tech and how it's evolved over
the past couple of years so without
further ado here's the state of the
smart garden let's start with plant
sensors as a category as of March 2018
plant sensors are trending down I
thought this category would be the
darling of the smart garden they're
relatively cheap 60 bucks 100 bucks
anyone can use them you can stick them
in your indoor garden your outdoor
garden for a potted plant for a one but
a lot of the big-name plant sensors I've
reviewed like the parrot flower power
and the Eden Garden sensor are no longer
available so what the heck happened to
this once-promising category well they
kind of got caught in the middle they
didn't give enough details for experts
and for beginners they cost probably
still a little bit too much now let's
talk about robot lawn mowers as of right
now robot lawn mowers are holding steady
they used to be very expensive and
tedious to set up as of right now
they're very expensive and tedious to
set up they are taking off a little bit
more in Europe and companies around here
are adding technology like GPS to robot
lawn mowers so we may see a leap and
then hopefully as this category grows
you start getting options that are a
little bit more accessible as of right
now it's still cool it's still promising
but it hasn't really fully matured as a
category next let's talk about smart
weather monitors I thought these things
were way too niche to survive and
especially now that smart plant sensors
are dying off but as it turns out smart
weather monitors are holding steady they
were a niche product they're still a
niche product but people that are really
interested in hyper local weather data
are still very interested in and we are
seeing some improvements more and more
the smart weather monitors are working
with other smart home gadgets like your
Amazon echo or your Google home so
there's still niche but they're actually
getting a little better
lastly smart sprinklers again these
things didn't used to excite me as much
as plant sensors because you
an in-ground sprinkler system to make
use of the product and there are a
hundred to two hundred dollars at least
but believe it or not smart sprinklers
are trending up as it turns out if you
already have an in-ground sprinkler
system getting a smart sprinkler is a
really good option these things watch
the weather for you they set your
sprinkler schedule for you and they make
controlling your sprinklers a whole lot
easier and as a result these things are
spreading more and more companies are
offering them they're getting more and
more feature-rich and demand continues
to grow I talked to a few smart
sprinkler companies and people are
replacing their old dumb sprinkler
controllers for smart options even when
the old ones are still working so
because smart sprinklers are kind of a
no-brainer upgrade they as a category
are taking off so will continue to keep
an eye on these categories as they grow
and evolve and we'll put them to the
test here at the scene at smart home to
see which ones can help us make our own
garden grow</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
