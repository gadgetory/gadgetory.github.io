tablets or mega eerie ders we review the
galaxy tab and the nook color plus
counting down the top five home theater
essentials what's new in Apple's ilife
11 and zombies invade your iPhone it's
all coming up right now
hi everyone I'm Hollywood and welcome to
the Cena tech review where we collect
our hottest videos of the week and tell
you what's good and what's bad in the
world of tech and offer some unique tech
wisdom in the form of the bottom left
let's start with the good any new tablet
computer that comes on the market has to
face comparisons to apples ubiquitous
iPad so how does the new Samsung Galaxy
Tab stack up Donald Bell has the answer
hey I'm Donald Bell and today we're
taking a first look at the samsung
galaxy tab this is an android-based
tablet computer running android 2.2 the
7-inch capacitive touchscreen it's
available on all major carriers starting
mid November with various pricing plans
this version is in from sprint which has
the tab for 399 dollars for the two-year
contract plus a monthly data plan that's
a minimum of twenty nine dollars as a
competitor to the apple ipad the tab
isn't cheap but the samsung's credit
they didn't skimp on the product we've
already seen cheap 7-inch android
tablets like the ark 07 and they're not
great as the name implies the galaxy tab
offers Samsung's Galaxy smartphone
experience in a larger tablet form on
the front you've got a screen which is
covered with a scratch-resistant gorilla
glass the LCD underneath is a crisp 1024
x 600 resolution which is on par with
the ipad but since the screen is about
half the size the pixel density is much
tighter above the screen you have a
front facing 1.3 megapixel camera which
is perfect for video chat and across the
bottom you have the typical android
style buttons for menu home back and
search there's a standard headphone jack
on the top and volume and power buttons
on the side along with a microSD card
slot for this model from spent a 16
gigabyte card was included on the bottom
you've got Samsung's dock connector and
a pair of built-in speakers flip it over
and you'll see a white plastic back and
a larger three megapixel camera with an
integrated flash overall the field is
very solid it's about a half-inch thick
same as the iPad but not as tapered at
the edges it's lighter than the iPad
easier to hold in one hand and has the
huge benefit of actually being able to
fit in an average pocket that's
compared to the five inch dell streak is
large enough to deliver an experience
that's closer to the iPad 9.7 inch
screen the on-screen keyboard is ample
and the screen size is large enough that
it can share the same page as an email
or web page the keyboard itself isn't
quite as accommodating as the iPad but
on the upside smartphone style thumb
typing feels natural and the keyboard
responds with haptic feedback samsung
also includes swiped capabilities out of
the box allowing you to run your finger
over groups of letters to trigger an
auto suggestion the tabs paperback size
is also a natural fit for e-books and
the Amazon Kindle app comes
pre-installed another big deal here is
that the official google app market is
included front and center giving access
to all the popular apps pandora
tweetdeck yelp Angry Birds they're all
here and they all look great on the big
screen samsung also throws in a few of
their own unique apps such as the media
hub store for downloading movies and TV
shows absa light contacts calendars and
memo have all been optimized for the
larger screen and because the tab
includes GPS along with 3g and Wi-Fi the
included navigation app does an
excellent job as an in-car navigation
device offering turn-by-turn directions
points of interest and voice search
another little advantage to the tab has
over the ipad is adobe flash 10.1
compatibility allowing all of the web's
flash video content to play natively in
the browser the results are a little
choppy in some cases but it's nice to
have the option so is the galaxy tab
better than the ipad it may be for some
people who really want the portability
the camera the flash support or the
extra carrier options but i don't think
the ipad is too much to worry about
honestly with the tab about half the
size of the ipad the kind of different
products the ipad is more of a netbook
alternative while the tab fits into more
of the smartphone and e-reader camp it's
a solid device though and if the price
and the carrier contracts don't scare
you off you should definitely check it
out so that's the samsung galaxy tab
pristina calm i'm donald though
so okay the galaxy tab isn't quite an
iPad killer but with the kindle app
built in it does look like a pretty nice
color e-reader that does a lot of other
cool stuff too but maybe you don't want
your e-reader to do lots of other stuff
maybe you just want to read books
magazines and newspapers in color well
then let me direct your attention to the
new nook color from barnes &amp;amp; noble i'm
david carr noah executive editor with
cnet com and i'm here at the nook color
launch and i'm here with Theresa Horner
who is the vice president of visual
contact with Barnes &amp;amp; Noble and she's
going to give us a quick demo of the new
nook color so this is a book and
basically what i want to show is how
quick the screen changes we've got some
social features on here so i can tap and
hold and i can share and i can do some
immediate sharing with my friends of
either i can recommend or i could share
a quote or anything like that so it
really brings social to the book so in
the my shelf area I've got my magazines
all queued up here so I'm going to pull
up the National Geographic which is
absolutely gorgeous when you see the
color so this is a single page spread if
I turn it like this I'll get a two-page
spread and I can page through the
magazine just like this I can also pull
up a slider bar here and so I can go
back and forth and browse through the
magazine as though I'm doing it in paper
which is kind of a nice feature and you
can see that the the color is just
gorgeous on this screen we know you like
this new hard button so what's nice
about it is it's actually very tactile
you can push it and it brings you right
back to the home page and this home
screen basically you can put all your
most current reading books right here so
they're already right at your access so
i can go right into this kids books is
another nice feature of nook there's
these beautiful color books that we've
got going and right here we have this
again a nice page turning experience you
can page through the book just like this
so the web browser is kind of a nice
view
we've got a sort of a quick access
feature here I can go to bnn review and
it will pull up to being in review page
so the extra page is really great
because it shows the the beginnings of
our app marketplace so we've got pandora
we've got contacts we've got crosswords
and the gallery actually shows you we've
got some video loaded up in here and it
shows video they're really nice features
are the social aspects bringing social
to reading to easily share books with
your friends and quotes with your
friends so the home screen is great
because I could even do things like I
can expand it I can drop them off and
then I can launch products right from
there like I showed you so it's very
nice handy little feature and there's
multiple screen so you if you've got a
lot going on you can do it across three
or four springs okay great thank you i'm
david carr noi and that is a first look
at the new barnes &amp;amp; noble nook color
e-reader so wait the nook has books and
video and music and web browsing how is
that not a tablet I guess I better call
Donald maybe he can help explain the
difference now you may have a 30 40 50
even a 60 inch HDTV at home but without
access to the right programming that
giant screen won't mean diddly so that's
where your TV accessories come in and
Brian coolies back to count down his
five favorite home theater essentials
maybe you waited through my recent top
five TVs which actually was nine of the
damn things lots of ties well to reward
you for that I've got the perfect side
dish top 5 home video gear devices to go
with that new TV and yes it's actually
five this time let's go warming things
up at number five the brand new roku XDS
streaming player you want to join the
whole screw you cable company movement
this is about the best way to do it for
a little bit of money under a hundred
bucks you'll get Netflix Amazon Pandora
MLB TV Hulu Plus for a fee no iTunes or
YouTube support though hmmm this will
not raise the vein on your forehead when
you're setting it up either we like the
simplicity and go for this XDS version
because it has a USB port for playing
your own movies off a thumb drive rounds
out the package nicely number four is
the slingbox solo our favorite place
shifting device now I think slingbox is
something of a niche device personally
you either don't need one or you
absolutely love it it takes whatever is
on on your home media system and streams
it to just about any computer smartphone
or other device that can run the sling
software it's great if you have one of
those pricey live sports packages and
you'll waste a bunch of it because
you're away from the house all the time
you can get one of these guys for as
little as one hundred and sixty dollars
coming in at number three the samsung BD
c 6500 blu-ray deck it's our favorite
straight up blu-ray player but even if
you're just lukewarm on blu-ray itself
like yours truly.this box also gets you
streaming services like netflix vudu and
youtube it has seven dot once-around
outputs and a gigabyte of storage on
board plus built-in Wi-Fi oh and Samsung
is pushing their own apps platform now
so down the road aways you'll be able to
load this thing up with what you want
and make it a personalized home media
terminal at number two we have the
harmony one do it all and make it easy
unified remote these guys kind of own
this space and the model one is the
sweet spot of their line in our opinion
you program tasks like let's say play
DVD
five dot one audio via HDMI input to you
put all that into a little macro and
that's programmed via a web service
could not be easier okay before we hit
the number one present you should give
your TV look at how many TVs we own good
grief the latest Nielsen numbers show
just seventeen percent of households are
scraping by with one television
twenty-eight percent of us have two and
fifty five percent of our households
have three or more in fact the average
now is three TV sets in the home okay
let's reveal the number one best piece
of home video gear to hook up to at
least one of those TVs it's the sony ps3
slim just about the priciest thing at
350 but still the best value games
blu-ray online streaming from their
service as well as others like Netflix
and Sony just gave it a 3d update so now
you've got some future proofing there
with a compatible 3d TV full details on
all these products are over at Matt
Mackowiak slist on cnet and keep an eye
on it if you're in the market because
this is a very hot sector and new
products are popping up all the time
just go to cnet click the home video
category then best home video products
or just go to our page its top 5 cnet
com I'm Brian Cooley thanks for watching
I do have to say my ps3 really does help
tie the whole living room together but
it's still nothing like the rooms in our
next piece turning our attention to the
world of corporate synergy for the past
several years our sister companies
Showtime has put together an annual
showcase for its original programming
they call it the Showtime house and then
all the shows like dexter and nurse
jackie are the design inspiration for
each of the rooms so this year CNET's
editors got to help put some good tech
into those rooms well here's dan
ackerman with a tour of the finished
product i'm dan ackerman from cnet com
we're here in New York at the casa hotel
residences home of the 2010 show time
show house we're going to take a look at
some of the really cool technology
inside everything from 3d TVs to blame
those fans so let's go take a look I'm
going in
we're here in the weeds office and we've
got an HP TouchSmart PC touchscreen
technology is really probably one of the
hottest trends this year and you can
actually use this to help design your
own wallpaper a series they call it HP
wall skins and with that you design your
own wallpaper HP print it out and send
it to you then you can put it up on your
wall just with water and then later take
it off with water so you can change your
wallpaper every year great idea now
keeping things cool we've got a Dyson
air multiplier it's really one of the
coolest industrial designs in technology
this year it is a bladeless fan what it
is a bladeless fan so you can keep the
air flowing and actually just stick your
hand right through it like that don't
worry about hit your fingers on the
blades because there aren't any much
simpler let's destruct
we're here in Pope pours a study and if
you're saying to yourself hey I feel
like I knew a lot about Renaissance 15th
century Italy that's probably because
you've been playing assassin's creed two
from Ubisoft the game actually takes
place in the same era and has a lot of
the same characters including the
Borgias we're watching it right now
through this one-way mirror playing on a
big samsung flat screen TV let's do this
thing we're here in the Big C lounge and
I'm immersing myself in this relaxing 3d
nature image and the best part is I
don't need the big bulky 3d glasses or
to view it that's because this magnetic
3d display uses lenticular technology
and then let you see the image with the
naked eye take it from me the future 3d
is eyeglass free there you go
so we're here in Dexter's refuge and one
of the coolest things in here literally
is the LG art cool what is this is it
12,000 BTU air conditioner him behind
this picture frame you hit the secret
button then the vents open up and keep
the room clue without the need for an
ugly wall you take you to the head turn
now we're in my favorite room Dexter's
gaming room back here I've got a JVC
ultra thin LED backlit TV it's the
thinnest TV you can buy and playing on
it you've got Mark echoes of dexter game
available for the iPhone and iPad we're
at the other end of Dexter's game room
and behind me since aureum ad has taken
this gigantic wall of mirrors attached
transducers to the back and turned into
one gigantic vibrating speaker I'd like
to know more i'm dan ackerman from
cnet.com to find out more about the 2010
show time show house you can go to sa
Joe com thanks Dan for sparing us a
visit to the californication bedroom and
although we didn't see it I'm going to
have to assume there's a mini-fridge
somewhere in that weeds inspired locked
speaking of which here is your chance to
go grab some munchies we'll be right
back with more Cena tech review after
this
and welcome back to the Cena tech review
our weekly video digest of all things
good and bad we've seen here at cnet TV
continuing on in the good beyond the new
macbook air in a preview of Apple OS 10
lion Steve Jobs and friends spent a lot
of their stage time during the back to
the mac event talking about all the new
features in the 2011 version of ilife
well Josh Lowensohn has a lot to say
about it too but he can do it in a lot
less time hi i'm josh lowensohn with
cnet com and i'm going to walk you
through some of the new features bundled
into ilife 11 Apple's latest update to
its consumer media editing and sharing
sweet ilife 11 comes free with every new
mac but if you've got an older version
it's a fifty dollar upgrade this year's
edition comes nearly two years after the
release of ilife 09 and the time since
Apple has updated just three of the five
applications that make up the suite
iphoto imovie and garageband leaving I
DVD and I web untouched since the last
version to put I life on your machine
you'll need a mac with an Intel
processor one gigabyte of RAM and Mac OS
10.6 point 3 or higher you also need
about five gigabytes of storage free on
your hard drive for us the upgrade took
just a little under 20 minutes and
required no restart one of the biggest
changes in this week can be found in
iMovie as Apple has added the option to
edit the audio in your clips hitting a
new button that appears just underneath
your project timeline you can see a
waveform of the clips audio and make
edits to how loud or quiet it is but
it's not just about making Audio more
even Apple has also added some fun
special effects tools that let you tweak
the audio these range from the rather
mundane of making people sound like
they're on a telephone or a shortwave
radio to giving them a robot or alien
voice
you can also adjust the pitch up or down
which lends itself well to some video
hijinks along with audio editing a new
feature in iMovie 11 is movie trailers
which lets you create short movie
trailers using footage of your friends
each trailer is set up as a template and
you're given a list of characters that
you can drag and drop footage into to
make this process easier I movie will
scan your footage for people to figure
out how many people are in a shot and
how close they are to the camera we
found trailer making to be easy to use
quite a bit of fun and highly
customizable it's also very fast process
if you've already planned out your shots
ahead of time besides the additions to
imovie apple's photo editing and library
management tool I photo has been given
some nice tweaks first and foremost you
can now do everything in full-screen
mode which is especially handy on
notebook computers where you're trying
to squeeze every bit of usefulness out
of a smaller display Apple has also made
sharing a better experience with the
option to send an email of your photos
from within iPhoto previously you'd have
to fire up Apple's mail program Apple
has also enhanced how I photo talks to
Facebook so you can post photos not just
to facebook albums but to your wall and
profile picture too for analog sharing I
photos books are still there and joining
them in this year's edition our cards
you can now print flat and folded cards
along with letterpress cards all of
which can be customized with your own
photos and text then purchase from
within the app Apple has given the book
and card making experience a complete
overhaul since last year's version with
a new carousel view which lets you
preview what each style looks like
before you dig into customizing it
notably missing from this process our
calendars something apple says is coming
in a future software update in the
meantime you are limited to making books
and cards rounding out the list the last
application to get an update is
GarageBand Apple's music training and
editing software this year's version
improves on the lessons program with the
new system that will actually listen
while you play a song with the practice
track and highlight all of your mistakes
you can then go back to those parts and
replay and retry until you get it right
along the way GarageBand keeps track of
your progress and can give you a virtual
report card of how you've improved since
you first started besides lessons Apple
has added two new ways to adjust
instrumental tracks you've recorded the
first is called flex time which lets you
tweak the timing of a recorded note if
something is in the wrong place or
slightly off you can drag it in garage
bands timeline this is incredibly easy
to use and can make a track with just a
few mistakes into something that sounds
like you've nailed it on the first take
but if a lot of things are wrong apples
included something called groove
matching which lets you pick a single
recorded track is the one you want the
other tracks to sync up to this is a one
click affair and we'll make flex time
adjustments to all the rest of the
tracks automatically these are just a
few of the new features you'll find in
ilife 11 it may be a little bit late
compared to previous versions of the
software suite but at twenty dollars
less than the last version and with some
significant improvements to three of its
core apps we think it's a pretty good
deal for more be sure to check out our
full review i'm josh lowensohn and this
has been a first look at Apple's ilife
11 yeah that new first like theme music
is really catchy also Josh you put a
tractor on your Christmas cards I don't
know about that dude but let's not dwell
on that too much because it's time to
move on to the bad
now don't get me wrong I am all about a
bargain so on paper this new AV receiver
from onkyo with its six HDMI port should
be a good deal but that's on paper in
person it's a whole other story hi I'm
Matthew miskovic senior associate editor
at cnet com and we're here with the
onkyo HT RC 260 this is a mid-range AV
receiver from onkyo and is currently
selling for about three hundred and
twenty dollars online which is much less
than many competing receivers we've seen
this year now the receiver has a typical
onkyo look with the big bulky design and
an all black finish there's some
additional connectivity on the front
panel including an HDMI input in the
lower left and an a/v input in the lower
right if you turn the unit on the oculus
graphical user interface also has a
utilitarian feel it's a step up from the
text only interfaces available on
competing marantz and Denon receivers
but it doesn't look quite as nice as
what's offered on Yamaha and pioneers
models still you'll probably only see
these menus during the setup so it's not
a huge loss around back you'll find the
real strength of the alkyl which is
connectivity there are five hdmi inputs
on the back plus the front panel input
which is six hdmi inputs total that's an
outstanding value considering it's
selling for about three hundred and
twenty dollars those hdmi inputs are
also all 3d compatible and support Audio
Return Channel functionality what they
don't support standby pass through which
is something that's offered on some
competitors there are also plenty of
analog video connections on the back and
the onkyo is capable of upscaling them
to 1080p over its hdmi output one thing
you may notice is that there's no iPod
connectivity out of the box so you'll
have to purchase onkyo is proprietary
iPod dock if you're looking to connect
an ipod now while we're generally big
fans of the sound of onkyo AV receivers
we were underwhelmed by the sound
quality of the HTR c260 we're guessing
onkyo had to make some compromises to
hit the lower price point and we felt
that the sound lacked detail
and it was a full step behind
competitors like the pioneer vsx 1020 k
and the denon AVR 1911 so altogether the
onkyo HTC RC 260 offers an extraordinary
value for a receiver with six hdmi
inputs but it wouldn't be our first
choice for audio files on a budget I'm
Matthew miskovic from cnet and this is
the onkyo HT RC 260 so if you don't have
a ton of money to spend you could
probably do worse than the onkyo but it
sounds like you could probably do better
too and with that let's turn our
attention to the bottom line zombies
they're everywhere not the real ones of
course or at least I hope not but the
undead are all over pop culture lately
from TV shows to movies to historical
fiction you name it the zombies just
keep coming back for more so in honor of
Halloween this week's tap that app is

popular plants vs zombies we're going to
look at three other undead gaming hits

zombies appear touch the red arrows on

gun-wielding passenger another source of
damage against the relentless zombie
horde once you pass certain milestones
in the game like driving a specific
distance for example you'll unlock
weapons for your backseat passenger that
you can set up before each run with your
passenger properly equipped and a little
luck you'll stay alive on the zombie
highway well for at least a little while
zombie highway is a one-of-a-kind
driving game in the app store and goes
for just 99 cents well our first two
zombie game picks will help prepare you

last game might be required playing for
