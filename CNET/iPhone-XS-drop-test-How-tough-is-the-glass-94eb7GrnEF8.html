year's 10th stainless steel frame and
glass on either side but has the glass
gotten tougher Apple seems to think so
and it's covered on the front and the
back back with a new formulation of
glass that is the most durable glass
ever in a smartphone challenge accepted
I'm out here on the sidewalk which let's
be honest is where most of these
accidents happen and it's the same
surface where we broke the iPhone 10
from last year now in my hands is a
brand new iPhone tennis in gold which I
just took out of the box but before we
begin let me say this is not intended to
be a scientific test but just a
real-world demo and results may vary
depending on the drop now with that out
of the way let's begin our drop at hip
height or about 3 feet
here we go three feet screen side down
in five four three two one
it didn't sound so bad but let's take a
look at that screen it did land screen
side down so here we go you guys can see
it first
how does it look it doesn't look bad
okay so turn off the screen and as you
can see here no cracks at least no
visible cracks on this screen just some
scuff marks where it hit a little bit on
the side over here but they might
actually come off part of that is from
the actual cement and look at that they
are coming off it doesn't look that bad
and then on this side up here I don't
know if you can see that there some more
scuffs but it's kind of coming off it is
a little bit dented the glass seems a
little bit dented as I'm running my
finger through it I can I can't feel it
a little bit but now that I've kind of
cleaned it off you can barely tell now
this is already a win for the iPhone 10s
because this is the same fall that
cracked last year's iPhone 10 so I can
definitely say that it survived this
first drop now let's take a look at the
glass on the back is just as strong as
the one on the front so I'm going to be
redoing this test at the same height of
three feet from hip height but this time
the back is going to go down first side
note it is freezing out here my hands
are shaking I apologize for that we're
gonna do this three feet this time
screen side up in five four three
- one okay so that was not the most
graceful landing it didn't actually fall
right on the back it kind of landed on
the side first and that is stainless
steel so it kind of did break the fall
but anyway we're gonna take a look at
the back you guys can take a look first
it's looking pretty pretty good let's
look at that aluminum frame there are
okay so there's there's a little scuff
on this side this is probably the size
that hit now that I'm taking a look at
it closer so there are some scuffs on
that stainless steel frame if you take a
look really closely but it's not bad
it's really not that bad considering
that this is now the second drop of this
phone and it's it's looking good the
screen is okay the back is okay just a
little scuffed up on the sides so that's
the second drop that it survives I'm
gonna take it even higher why not this
phone is already exceeding my
expectations so still within the realm
of possibility five feet which is kind
of roughly face level maybe what would
happen if you're taking a photo and it
falls out of your hands now this time
around I'm not actually gonna try to
have it land anywhere I'm just gonna see
where it what happens from this position
when it hits the floor
okay here we go five feet in five four
three two one
okay so that had a little bounce to it
because it landed on the edge again it
didn't sound bad it kind of moved a
little bit so I think it landed screen
side down but here take a look at it
first screen looks good so far back
looks good so far the sides look good so
far I cannot believe this is the third
time I dropped this phone and I'm still
having a hard time finding any kind of
damage on this phone okay so I got to be
honest I didn't think we'd get this far
I'm not sure what to do with it next but
I really want to test out that screen so
I'm gonna have it try to land screen
side down this time from the same five
feet now just bear in mind that this is
the fourth fall so it's already been
compromised with that said let's do it
okay five feet screen side down in five
four three two one
so that definitely did not land screen
side down because I can see the screen
right now I'm gonna take a look it
landed right on the corner and then with
the back to the floor so let's take a
look the screen looks fantastic nothing
wrong with the screen it doesn't seem to
have sustained any damage to the camera
at least that I can tell right now
just some marks over here on the edge
couple marks on this edge few on the
bottom over here and on the side but a
hundred percent in working order still
but ultimately it's in pretty good shape
considering how much I've dropped it
right now now I gotta say I was
definitely not expecting the results we
got today I thought for sure it was
gonna break at the first drop like last
year's 10 but just take a look at the
difference this is for Falls in nothing
this is two Falls and look at the back
now we did get their screen replaced so
I don't have that to compare but both
the screen and the back on last year's
10 broke now is this the strongest glass
ever made on a phone I can't tell you
that I don't know for sure but I can't
let the results speak for themselves
and for all you guys who still want to
see this phone break we're gonna be
doing a part two of this video where we
basically find out what it takes to
break the iPhone 10s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
