welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now the big announcements from WWDC are
all here it was just like we expected
all software and no Apple TV it made for
one of the most lackluster keynotes
we've seen in a while but as always
there's plenty of news that shakes out
afterwards now the most significant
announcements out of the bunch to me
came from iOS 9 there's an improved Siri
that connects your data and gives better
context a deeper spotlight search and
app improvements like Maps adding
transit options the news app is really
like a flip work style app for iOS and
notes gets beefed up as well there's
other improvements but the two biggest
things iOS 9 brings multitasking and
different ways to use split screen for
apps or picture-in-picture for video
it's really going to take the iPad line
to the next level and yes we'll be doing
microsoft surface like things but now on
apple's hardware in apple's own way now
i've been talking up the ipad pro for a
while and all the software enhancements
here are setting things up quite nicely
if you're an iPad user now the other big
thing that will affect everyone battery
life iOS 9 will squeeze out an
additional hour of battery life and a
brand new low-power model will extend
battery life for three hours low-power
mode will save power by limiting network
activity emails won't be fetched
automatically background downloads and a
pre freshers will be stopped it will
also use sensors to stop the screen from
turning on when it's laying face down
now hints of what's coming in future
Hardware can also be found from code
inside the iOS 9 beta developer Hamza
stood has discovered support for the
front-facing FaceTime camera to get
1080p video while capturing 240 frames
per second at 720p as well as a
front-facing camera flash all first on
an Apple product and likely coming to
the next iPhone now next up watch OS to
the biggest thing here is that Apple is
finally opening up the SDK for native
apps from third-party developers to live
on the Apple watch other side
improvements like different custom watch
faces support for FaceTime audio calls
through the watch or even watching video
on its teeny tiny screen aren't
game changers but improvements and let's
not kid ourselves with nightstand mode
are you really going to fiddle around
with the Apple watch and even try to
press its itsy bitsy buns at six in the
morning if you're going to use it as an
alarm come on you won't now this update
is all about the apps and killing those
load times but we'll see if apps on the
Apple watch can be as significant as
apps were for the iPhone and really
that's what the big a is hoping for all
right Apple kept it low-key but watch
os/2 will also bring an activation lock
to the Apple watch that prevents someone
from reactivating a lost or stolen apple
watch without a previously linked Apple
ID the big thing here is that you'll
have to turn on that feature in the
Apple watch app alright Mac OS 10 point
11 gets the name El Capitan and
refinements across the board for Safari
and the mail and notes app spotlight
also gets the same contextual awareness
and natural language improvements and
metal for Mac brings a fifty percent
improvement in rendering graphics with
forty percent less CPU required you also
get useful features like split view for
using two apps or calling out your
cursor with a wiggle so you can find it
more easily but nothing big here in Mac
OS 10 just subtle improvements like we
expected and finally Apple music apples
all in one app and music streaming
service will cost nine ninety-nine a
month or 1499 a month for a family plan
that can be shared between six people it
will bring a 24 hour live radio station
hosted by djs from around the world
they're calling it beats one and it's
also touting itself as a platform for
high-profile artists as well as in the
artists to share content behind the
scenes for fans to engage with now think
of it as a music streaming service that
will try to be the next myspace or band
camp that's all built into one place
with the Apple muscle behind it
highlights of the announcement included
in appearance by rapper Drake who's
notoriously a frontrunner when it comes
to NBA teams like look I'm sure he's a
huge apple fan that's had that apple
jacket for years for example I bought
this vintage apple employees jacket
using a tool known in the rap world as
the internet it's gonna be huge this
year
nevermind but i still love his music and
the low light of the keynote Eddy Cue
dancing definitely gets my Cuban blood
going let's not see that again all right
confirmed reports also say Apple music
will stream at 256 kilobits per second
the same as iTunes Match but lower than
the 320 kilobits per second from Spotify
Apple still has no free ad-supported
model like Spotify but will try to lure
customers in with a three month free
trial and Apple music also most streamed
the entire itunes music store catalog
these are really two different things
the beatles are one of those bands that
you won't find on their streaming
service but you know who's still on
board with apple taylor swift
hi not that I even know who Taylor Swift
is but if you do and I know there are
plenty of you that do and if there's
artists that you can only get on Apple
music then maybe you might jump over to
the service and the side note for ipod
fans and a sad sign of things to come
Apple has removed the ipod from the top
navigation bar of apple com and you can
now find them at the very bottom if you
scroll way way down in the music section
tier all right overall the keynote was
good not great in sometimes extremely
boring but it laid the groundwork for
new hardware coming this year on to our
feedback of the weekend if you missed it
we dropped my Apple watch review as a
separate video last week so check it out
here's what some of you said jf Darcy
comments most honest review of the crap
will watch and COO nope I says that's
sweet you send your heartbeat to your
boob Ryan does he send his heartbeat
back and speaking of the Apple watch you
know I have this on boy bet over the NBA
Finals with you Cleveland Cavs loving
Apple biters well LeBron James is
famously known for being a samsung
spokesman but do you know what he gifted
his entire team right before the NBA
Finals that's right Apple watches now
yours might have been on pre-order for
over two months and you still haven't
received it the same rules don't apply
to LBJ so at least King James and I have
two things in common we both got Apple
watches and we are both great basketball
legends and with game for around the
corner don't worry warrior fans this
series ain't Dellavedova alright that's
going to do it for this week's show you
can email me at the Apple by to cnet com
or tweet me up Brian Tom thanks for
watching we'll catch you all next time
for another bite of the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
