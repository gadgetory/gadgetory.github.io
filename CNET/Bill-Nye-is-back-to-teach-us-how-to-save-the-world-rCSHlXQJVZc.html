well mr. science guy himself Bill Nye
thank you for joining us it's so good to
be here all right so your new show on
Netflix
Bill Nye saves the world yes quite the
title no pressure right no it was a
half-hour that's enough time isn't it
city of the entire world there's 13 of
them turn watch them all turn it up loud
Bingen so why does the world need Bill
Nye to save it now so need it is it is
to be hoped that we can make the world
better by with a television show now I'm
not joking well that's why we're doing
it I was a big fan of your show growing
up I mean you made science cool and
smart yes and you inspired an entire
generation but this is 20 years or so
later and you're back yes what is your
approach differently this time around
well we're doing this for it's for older
people and the topics are not cut and
dried so it is we do vaccinations
climate change and video games do video
games are they addictive do they rot
your brain or do they actually make you
think better or do you become a better
surgeon by playing a video game about
surgery apparently you do and so it's
very exciting to be back and we I am
hoping to get people to have a
scientific perspective about issues
facing our society I feel like that's
kind of an important mission now when
you have so much going on with people
maybe denying science you could put it
that way yes yeah so like like is there
something happening now is there
something that that you're kind of
trying to address in this show well this
is our mission is to enlighten people I
don't think this will last the anti
science thing and the big example right
now is climate change and the people who
in this case of climate denier
are almost all old there's very few
young climate change deniers so these
people are gonna age out are we gonna
replace them with enlightened people
wanna do something to climate change
fast enough well let's make a TV show
about a dog on it what can we do to help
save the world
so it vote is what I always say boat but
we need big ideas I mean huge huge ideas
we need huge wind turbines we need
photovoltaic panels everywhere and we
need to reconfigure our electrical grid
to handle a distributed power generation
system rather than concentrated but we
can do all that let's go there's a lot
of big problems out there what do you
think is the biggest right now and three
things we want for everybody in the
world clean water reliable renewably
produced electricity and access to the
Internet or whatever the future of the
Internet is called and then if we can
provide clean water to rural populations
in general they will have be able to
grow food if you can provide electricity
they'll be able to grow food efficiently
and then if you can provide the Internet
this will enable everybody to get
educated especially girls and women when
you raise the standard of living of
girls and women through education they
have fewer kids and the kids they do
have have more resources so they are
more successful and everyone benefits
this is all good let's get her done in
people's</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
