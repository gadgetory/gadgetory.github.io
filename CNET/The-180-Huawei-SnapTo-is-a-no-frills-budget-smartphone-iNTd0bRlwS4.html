the Huawei snap to this is an LTE
smartphone that's trying to spruce up
the low end of the mobile phone market
you can pick one up unlocked for 180
bucks the snap to looks nice enough if a
bit plain the bezel around the screen
isn't too thick which leaves plenty of
room for the 5 inch display it only has
a 720p resolution which of course pales
in comparison to the pricier phones you
see on the market but all told it to be
some screen photos and images look good
and while the off-axis viewing angles
aren't especially wide collins don't
shift when you took the screen around
the snap to name comes from the five
megapixel cameras ultra snapshot mode
press the down volume button twice when
the phone is locked and it will snap the
shot of whatever you're looking at the
camera isn't exactly spectacular though
and it doesn't tackle motion on that
wall which defeats the purpose of that
ultra snapshot mode the phone is a
quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon processor
performance is fine I didn't have
trouble getting around the interface and
I've been doing a lot of testing on the
new mobile game does not commute which
works well there's only a measly 8
gigabytes of storage but you can pop off
the back cover and add a microSD card
for a bit more room the phone also runs
Huawei's customized version of android
4.4 kitkat menus and icons look a little
different from stock android but it's
generally pretty easy to get around
there's no app drawer like you find in a
normal stock Android phone though which
I've always found really annoying and
that's the Huawei snap to it's a pretty
basic no-frills device but if you're
looking for LTE and don't want to pony
up for a contract 180 bucks is a fair
price there are as expected compromises
so you're going to want to read my full
review before you pull out your wallet
I'm Nate thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
