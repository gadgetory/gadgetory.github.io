marker BB and this is the show where we
feature the hottest apps on planet Earth
today we are checking out a neat privacy
app called vault now vault essentially
creates a encrypted password-protected
space on your phone in it you can store
photos videos text messages even parts
of your call log it's perfect for
someone who might have a little dirt
they want to put away here's how it
works
once you download vault and set up your
password you can go through and start
marking photos videos text messages and
parts of your call log that you want to
keep private and if you like you can
even add specific people to a private
contacts list doing this automatically
hides all past and future messages
between you and that person and from the
private contacts list you can determine
an incoming call action you can
automatically answer the phone mute it
or auto reply with a message if you want
one of the coolest features of vault is
the stealth mode which is only available
to premium users stealth mode hides the
vault app so that no one can see that it
even exists on your phone the only way
to access vault from there is to
actually place a phone call to your
vault password lastly there's the break
and monitor another premium feature if
someone gets nosy and tries to get into
your vault using an incorrect password
vault will actually take a picture of
that person and notify you if you have
stuff on your phone that you need to
keep private or you're carrying on some
super secret correspondence with someone
that you don't want anyone to know about
I suggest you try vault it's available
for free on Google Play but if you want
the premium features like the break-in
monitor and the stealth mode then you
got to pay a dollar ninety-nine a month
that's it for this week if you have an
app that you want me to tap holler at me
