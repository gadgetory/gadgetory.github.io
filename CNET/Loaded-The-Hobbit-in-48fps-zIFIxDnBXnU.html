Morris and it's time to get loaded cisco
is shutting down business on the flip
cam Cisco purchased the company that
made the popular consumer camcorder for
590 million dollars just two years ago I
guess they really didn't know what to do
with it and high def camcorders and
smartphones kind of put the stink on
this kind of product you can now watch
your rented voodoo movies in your
browser voodoo is the video movie
streaming service that was purchased by
walmart it allowed you to watch movies
on a voodoo compatible TV or blu-ray
player but now you can use the browser
to rentals are good for 24 hours and
Voodoo's library has over 17,000 movies
and TV shows a program called fire say
lets you use voice control in facebook
this is a Firefox extension that can
already do things like a simple Google
search or Hulu video commands it now
works with Facebook too but it only
controls your webcam but imagine being
able to like and poke without even
touching a button HTC unveiled the HTC
Sensation it's an android phone that
will run on vodafone overseas and it
comes with something called HTC watch
this lets you watch movies and TV shows
from a library of content that you don't
have to download you just stream it
directly from HTC you can buy or rent
movies but if you buy them the videos
are available to you on up to five
different HTC devices it's a nice
feature but Nokia didn't really have
success with selling media that was tied
to devices Nokia's comes with music was
shut down just this year we'll see if
HTC can make this work speaking of Nokia
the company launched two new phones the
e6 and the x7 both are running the
updated version of symbian which they
are calling Anna even though Nokia is
moving towards Windows Phone 7 Anna will
be pushed out to more phones later this
year improvements include new icons
faster internet browsing and new and
improved OV Maps sprint also launched a
mobile phone based music service sprint
music plus is now a mobile app that you
can access on a sprint phone or at
sprint com it lets you discover find and
play music you can also make playlists
by ringtones and entire albums
songs are also drm-free so you can take
them with you to other gadgets and
devices microsoft's version of Google
Street View is called Street side it
will involve real-life images that live
inside of Bing Maps Microsoft has
started the process of photographing the
planet they started in London Street
side will have 360-degree camera images
and points of interest such as landmarks
and pubs as expected Apple did launch a
new version of Final Cut Pro X this is
the movie making software that most
digitally produce movies and videos
including the one you're watching right
now are made with the new Final Cut has
new editing tools background rendering
and a new interface it will be available
in June and cost 299 dollars replacing
the old and very expensive final cut
studio suite that was previously nine
hundred ninety nine dollars and finally
fans of Tolkien will be happy to know
that the upcoming movie The Hobbit is
being filmed at 48 frames per second
rather than the usual 24 frames per
second this should give moviegoers a
much better picture quality and make the
3d a lot less painful to watch for those
of you that have a problem with 3d part
1 of The Hobbit is due out in December
of 2012 that's your news of the day I
will see you tomorrow I'm Natali Morris
