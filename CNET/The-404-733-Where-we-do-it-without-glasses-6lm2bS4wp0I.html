tang and I'm Justin you and this is the
show where we do it without glasses we
don't need glass in your glasses yeah I
can see you guys Oh glass I'm taking
these things off ladies and gentlemen
joining us for the first part of our
show today mr. Clayton Morris remote
Morris thank you guys for having me
thank you for roping me in at the when I
was eating my box lunch that's fine your
CES box lunch yeah would you by the way
it's the unhealthiest box lunch hahaha
it's like three different types of junk
food all in one and everyone has left
the Apple there's an apple in the box
and looks like thousands of apples
gathered up around the press room right
now I'm gonna say to use for later
that's so sick so what is it this year
because normally it's like a like a
they've got like a chicken Caesar salad
then they've got a ham swiss set our ham
swiss cheese thing that's been there i
think for a couple of hours i think i
got the last box lunch really there's
something there's something wrong for
the hole right there was something wrong
with it I'm sure but now I'm not
hungover or something like that yeah if
that ham starts getting to me you know
what's wrong but thank you for having me
guys our pleasure you've been here
you're a long time a guest on our show
we loved having you whenever you can be
available how's your show going so far
other than the food it's been good you
know I think there's a lot more
excitement this year than there was last
year it seems like there's a lot more
categories that are interesting instead
of just last year everyone was
anticipating what Apple was going to do
a few weeks later with the ipad and last
year it seemed like all the talk was
only around 3d TVs sure right remember I
think I even wore 3d glasses on the show
here last year yeah okay so last year
was 3d glasses and now they're like I'll
take those off right like don't realize
no one wants to wear them it's all say
year to right and they cost like at
least one hundred fifty dollars each
they weren't cheap right and if you get
a bundle of five some of the televisions
coming with like three of them or five
of them you know if you've got kids
laying around and you see them they're
breaking them in half
and we just one hundred and fifty
dollars a piece so I think there's a lot
of different categories this year that
are exciting I mean we're certainly
seeing a lot of accessories a lot of
things it seems like it took two years
to get those add-ons to a lot of the iOS
devices that we were hearing about blood
pressure monitors heart rate monitors I
mean finally finally after two years but
some really useful things like the dr.
Albert came up with this ECG monitor
that you slap right on your iphone four
monitors your heart rate be able to
email your heart information right to
your doctor not have to worry about a
nurse coming to your house on a regular
basis well you probably like that is the
only and I'm in need of medical
assistance little too late to have to
wait for the internet you know what I
mean I mean it might be faster than that
one I guess regardless well I you know
back to what Clayton was saying though I
I agree with him I think this is one of
the most exciting CES is since I've you
know been doing this because it's it's
more than you know windows laptops and
desktop machines now like we were
actually starting to see things outside
of oh now it's now you can open up word
ten times faster great connected cars
mean we're seeing what Ford is doing
here for it as a big huge presence this
year at CES which is exciting seeing a
lot of the connected devices so I think
there's a lot of categories that I'm
excited to see a 3d cameras looking at
some of the different 3d cameras for the
first time in that you got to see a
bunch of really like actually useful 3d
cameras well I mean Fuji you know Fuji
get rolled out there finepix and the
software is unusable by the way but I
really like the actual don't get the
native software for but the actual
cameras itself really you know it's
really interesting that with the dual
the dual lenses and taking still photos
and HD video and a consumer's rights
look at them well all the devices
software right or you'd put on you know
you'd have them you can want you
actually look at them on your desktop
but then the special software mostly
you're looking at them on the device and
then I guess you could output it over
hdmi and through you know through to
your three or 3d television those
glasses no I mean these are that's
what's great about looking at that type
of camera is that you don't need the
glasses LG also has a prototype DTV
mobile television with the antenna so
it's
the over-the-air signal in 3d it's a
prototype right now but with no glasses
so you're starting to see no glasses i
know that was fast the whole glass you
got here very quick well speaking of 3d
you got to speak to the president
nintendo today yes about the nintendo
3ds right yes is here it's it's really
cool i I never had a chance to actually
sit down and play with it but you know
it's sort of like how connects remember
magic I you guys remember manager Guy
when you look at a painting to look for
the hidden unicorn really I think I see
a unicorn or a sewer but that is like
getting the book or something yeah and
then never be able to see it across your
own eyes you know I can't see any way
nobody really would have puked after you
read the fine print on the 3ds is there
were people like Wilson who have
glaucoma hahaha or the part of magic I
the way that worked was they they wanted
you to cross your eyes a little huh they
were like all right you're gonna go
ahead and play with yourself a little as
I all right but the 3d s obviously
doesn't require that but there is a sort
of I'd say half a second moment where
you have to your eyes have to sort of
agree with the screen yeah and you then
you're locked in well then immerse the
old going back and of course one of the
big stories that come out a few weeks
ago at the 3ds is about the age level
the age restriction playing with your
seven or eight years old don't be given
to the kids because their eyes haven't
fully matured yet mature enough yet to
dig it handle three eyes yes sorry to
gain weight and we all know you just had
a baby a couple months ago you can't
just give him a 3ds to you know take
care of himself for the next couple
hours right yeah you gotta handle my
still I guess you got to go back and
hand him an ipod touch that's not safer
for a toddler right regardless of what
we've seen so far at CES I think we're
all in agreement that the bit we do best
of on Saturday forget it we're done we
know what we want right now already know
what festive see already best of CES
calling it now calling it now it doesn't
require batteries you have to plug it in
you have to do anything ladies and
gentlemen the Angry Birds board game
the only one that isn't excited about
this no they brought it out to the stage
yesterday and it was the most
unbelievable thing just 30 grown adults
it's fully grown adults freaking out
over it it's one look like McDonald's
toy it's like using a catapult to pull
back fake Birds to shoot at something
here's what a shot of it right here
isn't give a shot of it this yeah you
guys are freaking out about 99 from
Mattel coming in May an analog version
of angry birds exactly absolutely I'm
okay with it but maybe we're just so uh
yeah overburdened with the digital
technology struck just we want to use go
back to lego now I mean that's come on
that's best of senior because if I had
that my sister was in the house I would
forget the board game and I just be
pulling back and shooting birds and my
sister all the time well you know
speaking of which your jeff had the
brilliant idea yeah earlier let's maybe
get the audience and clean and maybe
anyone else who wants to help us out so
we love Angry Birds except for Justin
who has no soul but but uh stuff let's
say we have a little discussion about
which angry birds we all look like okay
this is something not really go this is
good this is good so we have we have a
great a shot on Justin's computer heck
this so there you go there the Angry
Birds roster okay God so clearly clearly
I think our friend Justin now correct me
if I'm wrong you guys can vote and
change what your ideas I think Justin is
our little let you know the fast yellow
guy oh don't say yellow cuz the channel
mom you guys go there play along with me
got the yellow angry bird yeah because
he's thin and pointy he's in and pointy
and any offense and if you're pissing
off he breaks through would easily yeah
it looks like doesn't look like which
one is it Ernie Ernie from Sesame I now
I can see it now you put it let's go to
Wilson clearly I mean this is a given
who even your wardrobe supports the idea
that clearly hash Wilson is the bomb the
bomb one you don't think so i can just
explode at any moment you know what
you're saying you once you touch
something you explode a second later
yeah I could see that that's how I treat
basically Wilson wreaks havoc right
around anything right everything around
so a lot of things are killed in his
presence that right yeah well I could
see out inanimate object so is the
translucent bird that's what I'm the
last one there's a mr. glass an honor of
your winter beard here I would say you
are the red one and classic angry bird
just ornery as all hell yeah and just
ready to blow up at any minutes unhappy
to be there I think it's true i mean
even that's the angriest of all the
birds and i would think that that fits
you well even the eyebrows are angry
yeah that's true well you know he
doesn't get a lot of love it's the first
guy you get and he doesn't have any
superpower they all have superpowers be
the white guy drops a bomb well clearly
you've been playing the game too long
cuz you know later the red angry bird
gets really fat oh yeah it just gives it
up this gives it up so now what do we
think Clayton who can we give Clayton
right now how about the eagle oh the
mighty the mighty eagle ID play this I I
know about him it's a sheet right yeah
its a cheat like you have to pay 99
cents extra yeah it's an in-app it's an
in-app purchase and so a lot of parents
are finding that their kids are in app
purchasing the eagle yeah and they get
this little in-app purchase and they and
it becomes flies right through the whole
level and destroys everything yeah bird
yeah
have you seen you've seen the Eagle
right have you ever done the chart of
him I refuse to cheat I wonder does the
Eagle come with the board game it's just
like a giant of my Eagle sure it comes
in here by isn't it uh we got a lot more
to talk about Microsoft had their press
conference last night that was I gotta
say the least interesting microsoft
press conference I've ever seen well we
all know that you despise the company no
I mean like every year they set this you
know the i guess the tone of CES sure
and I think that's the sort of the
biggest change this year than anything
else no all these manufacturers
releasing tablets the high windows thing
is like such an afterthought and last
night's press conference was essentially
connect bright which it was very
successful sure but it's not you know
the windows Empire right and like it was
just a huge letdown great so you can use
your hands to watch Netflix movies yeah
that's kind of a letdown i connect to
sold eight million units which is
mind-blowing right but I think that that
would happen in doing that we are
batting zero oh yeah don't I think we've
learned a lesson don't go to Jeff for
your prediction I was like avatar is
gonna suck i say um but you know I guess
you look at okay so they're giving you
the ability to use your hands to control
hulu and netflix now i have you tried
doing that with like zune content cuz
you can do that now with the zoom have
you try i haven't tried it was soon I
mean I like I mean I like the kinect
experience using your hands to go
through menus doing the different
workouts doing the different games I
can't stand the voice the voice
activation for Kinect if you played with
the voice activation to say connect go
back to this menu connect box listen
amongst yeah do this it doesn't listen
to you even in a quiet room it's like
you're gonna continue playing black ops
yeah I've even I've even like covered my
walls and pillows and padding just to
make sure it wasn't picking up in the
ambient noise and still wouldn't figure
out what I was saying so that's a bit of
a gimmick but I think people are super
and when you see kids before the first
time actually playing it and they had
all those stations set up at best buys
now when you
to a best buy they had a connect station
set up there they had a sony move
station set up there and so kids was i
was walking through best buy's over
there over christmas you're seeing all
of these kids just jumping in playing it
and their parents are standing off to
the side saying all right I know what I
have to get them this year so it seemed
like a no-brainer you know it's great
when I was in Hong Kong um they there
were all these like connect booths and
like we all know you know the game DDR
yes yeah dance dance dance dance
revolution that was that was there was
huge in Asia and I feel like this is
like in home ddr as they set up all
these things and people were just like
performing you know they joint screens
stages and they were selling the kinect
but people are up there performing
dancing I saw these really kind of
interesting add on to like for black ops
okay there's already a gun holster for
the i believe the controller oh no 44 x
by request before connect I think it was
it was crazy like you're inventing
product I mean this was the kinect I now
I don't know if it was legit or for real
because this was Hong Kong but like but
this doesn't that sort of fly in the
face of what we'd expect from Connect
which is you don't need a controller you
don't need any of these things you know
I I doubt that the the first if you're
playing a first-person shooter you don't
want that going like this yeah you don't
be like this you know it's I gotta say
like the driving game Oh what's the
driving connect connect Joyride Joyride
there I feel like an idiot yeah it's
doing this yeah great like I'm dancing
alone in your studio apartment you don't
feel like that's what you do every night
I dude yeah I have a secret a secret
fantasy about about doing doing the
kinect dance with dance studio know what
is a dance studio dance central sure
which is I want to be as good as like
Napoleon Dynamite but I want everyone to
think I'm a 62 lanky white guy and
they're like that guy can't dance him
like I've been in my apartment now and
dance central for three months I don't
move I just called up seamlessweb
they've been delivering pizzas under the
door for the past three months and now
I'm going to answer some bell biv devoe
minja miracle i right
yeah virtual insanity I'm loving it well
you came by you actually brought like a
really cool gadget right word this is
crazy it's rare that you're at CES and
something stops you in your tracks and
you're like wow I've got to get my hands
on that so I'm gonna show I stole it if
security is around hopefully they won't
see it now they let me use it because
i'm going to show this off on fox and
friends tomorrow morning and they have
different mounts so this is from tiffin
and it makes it say it's a Steadicam so
this mount pops in here so now this is
the iphone 4 amount they have flip flip
minnow mounts old I older iPhones 2 3gs
and the 3g it snaps right into right
into the mount that's amazing if I could
do this tactfully which I can't so you
got to carry around this steady cam I
mean how how is that practical well I
mean you're not going to take you know
take it around if you're shooting little
film and you're shooting stuff for the
kids the kids are running around the
backyard so it's a Steadicam that no
matter what I do does that blow your
mind or what America this is a magician
David Copperfield I'm baseman and so I
wait I took it actually down the steps
over here yeah I actually took it down
the steps of CES and I ran down the
bottom steps and shot video of it at the
same time and you can't tell it looks
like I'm going down an escalator the
whole time so this I me nuts amazed it's
pretty cool once you get a little used
to doing it you can do like pan you know
pan and tilts from this and you can run
through so I was getting some Steadicam
shots as I was going through the the
floor here and it looks like I'm on a
track another screen or what oh what oh
that here we go Wow check that out have
you ever seen a forehead like that
panadura wow look at that incredible
that's crazy how much is that gonna
cause a good question I think they're
you know it's a different mounts and I
don't know that they have I don't know
that they have the price points because
there's actually once you can put on
with other camcorders on top of its ok
I'm not sure about all the different
price points but I think they're under a
hundred dollars well you know like when
okay so Steadicam the company tiffin and
when I like they're mostly known for
professional products and the moment I
saw this I can imagine so many dads so
many you know people of family we want
to take quality home videos not the
shaky mess that you know everybody like
already puts on YouTube right this I
mean know if it this changes everything
really be about a hundred dads carrying
around this steady I mean you know it
also does it takes a need for you to
zoom on the iphone right it takes a need
it takes a need for you to have to zoom
away if you're in a soccer game with the
kids you can pan down the field and get
great shots of your kids what's up is
like jumping shots of you know one of
these spielberg's on the sideline you
know crashing down know that some dad is
gonna be popping this in a suitcase
taking it on a European trip and it's
why female what in the world you brought
that with you and he's gonna be out
there at the Louvre walking around
getting shots I mean and I know a lot of
the DSLRs this year and the future ones
produce like really high quality HD
1080p video I mean like very very I know
music videos even films I think a couple
of TV shows a shot on two or three
thousand dollar DSLRs slept one of those
babies on top of those and there's
really not too much difference between
you and Spielberg I mean of course 10
million dollars and say billions of
dollars then you can produce a film like
AI yeah you're right all the different
mounts that they have available so it's
not just for iphone it's not just for
flip I mean all the different higher-end
cameras too but and they have some
different different mounts so it's not
just this bottom piece here but it might
be to that one extends a little bit
longer so yeah you know you're taking
steady cams I don't know much about how
the cost of them but I know for film
project thousands and thousands of
dollars
just right just to write not even 20
like I I've actually I used to do some
Steadicam being myself and it's it's
crazy heavy you can only wear it for a
couple hours before you're back there
though you had a wrap it all the way
back and this like I mean incredible how
far technology because the iPhone itself
does 720p HD right so you're shooting HD
video on the iphone yeah the 720p and
you know and the microphones pretty good
too so there it is from tiffin pretty
cool thanks for bringing that along
Clayton I want to talk about the razor
switchblade have you guys seen this so
this is like a gaming product right it
is and it's I guess the best way to
describe it is a PC portable gaming
console okay so razor if we have a
little over here are alienware laptop
sorry so yeah they're short of the size
of these m11x is I'm maybe it's a little
smaller but what's cool about this thing
is that the buttons are they can have
interchangeable icons they're like I
guess they're like little LED displays
each button and every game can be
programmed to you know fill up those
spaces so you can tell from the photo
all those keys on there are custom made
from whatever game it's running so
you're really into call of duty or
something like that I guess I don't know
how it how comfortable it will be a
handheld sort of keyboard with a screen
attached to it but you know razor you
customize your the keyboard shortcut and
can you customize it that way I would
imagine that's part part of the the deal
but uh you know razor we love razor
stuff they make great accessories this
is very ambitious to say the least does
it well I'm curious about your thoughts
on like gaming laptops in general I mean
are they starting to are we starting to
see them go away no they're staying
right here and we love this alienware
sweeter some of the heavy ones I mean
there you know they're like 400 pounds
but I mean is that what we're seeing
we're seeing those large ones are we
gonna see I just don't see as many
choices as we were you ever a big pc
game of yourself pc gamer yeah but it's
not on a laptop I've just never your LAN
parties and yeah we go it easy crazy
land parties what base for how many
basements have you stretches yeah world
of warcraft usually basements in
Pennsylvania carpeting it's rotting i'm
just i'm sure there's like mold spores
under their reading that finally clean
myself up and showered yeah but I don't
know like I feel like especially okay
happy to say this I i think that the
largest segment of the pc gaming
population is still World of Warcraft
right right okay that's fair I I mean I
can be fair like it's probably huge
chunk a lot of the numbers and those
gamers want like as many buttons on
their keyboard as possible about like 90
million shortcut they won't read
everything you know reload and all that
jazz sure i'm also infused what people
that are playing pc games on the go to
are these guys with going to coffee
shops and i thought you would do that at
home in the privacy of your parents
patient right you've got your mount you
got your tower you've got everything set
up all you need is a good mouse and
you're playing in starbucks man you're
what your ass get so proud right it
might yeah it was on I would surely ok
to start showing their face yeah how
dared it I don't know but it but I mean
you know I there is a market for it yeah
well it reminds me of the people who go
to starbucks it have the whole office
setup right I passed somebody the other
day in New York at a starbucks and he
had like a printer honey I think yet a
printer and a huge laptop and I things
like and he had everything set up like
he's working there like that's his
office now why not I feel like you know
like in the tech world you know that
there's like these startup incubators I
really think Starbucks is by far the
world's largest is every time you walk
into any starbucks it's college students
and like startup entrepreneurs just
sitting there yeah you can't ever get a
seat in starbucks come on ever I've ever
said one ever
world problems alert this is why you're
the red angry bird this is what I'm the
red angry bird I want to talk about on
live you guys know about on live the
streaming game pc gaming initiative
they're building it into vizio so what
about this on live you say for the non
gamers right in the room i just
explained it yeah so clean have you had
some time to check out on live it's
built into a line of visio televisions
now so you know we're talking about over
the air all look heavy computing is done
all the graphic processing is done you
know remotely and you're just sort of
like sling boxing that screen of gaming
do we know do we know latent latency
times yet for it i mean weight around
with it right a little with it but
apparently it performs well enough that
the delay it doesn't affect your have
you guys had any experience with onlive
don't all jump at once yeah yeah
somebody baton oh we had one latency did
you notice any latency yeah a little bit
slow course we're also here where
there's all kinds of latency right so
that could be an issue too sure but yeah
you know I actually beyond just the
online thing I think Vizio is doing some
interesting things I mean I like the
whole ecosystem of the via plus and
being able to bring in the tablet bring
it'll bring in the phone and you know
because I look at my my audience and I
think about I think about when first of
all in this economy right Vizio has that
footprint at walmarts and targets right
and so they have that space already
locked up low-cost but really well done
televisions and be able to have that
ecosystem that someone can get in on and
get a tablet get a phone and it all
works together is pretty exciting so I
think Vizio is doing some interesting
things yesterday like I it's hard to
believe that just you know three four
years ago that vizio like people would
laugh at you know you oh it's because
you can't afford like a decent set and
now they've got all these like frankly
great products like the we mentioned the
tablet and the phone yesterday right now
the the now their TV instead of just oh
it's got the best black level ever at
this point I don't think anybody cares
whether it's like 10 million or 100
million
they're adding features like online
built in gaming and I think that that's
like the future everybody thinks that
smart TV is going to take off this year
the whole google thing kind of slowed
down but I think applications like this
you know I kind of believe that the next
generation of consoles may be the last
one that's not built into a TV set
really yeah I mean more like the wood is
the PlayStation 4 or Xbox 720 whatever
it's going twice one tell us like you
know we've got like Google TV already
being built in right you know
everybody's anticipating apple releasing
HDTV it's not too hard to extrapolate
you know getting if not the best console
experience a good enough council
experience on your HD t-shirt and it's
running below also too I mean it's not
it's not running above Android it's
running below it from what I understand
so it's it has better access to the
hardware so there's not as much latency
but you know again once you get some of
these graphics intensive games we
actually start to sit down you're away
from CES where it's really hard to test
anything that's on any sort of a network
here because you're gettin you're just
gettin all sorts of weird times with it
so it'll be interesting to see once do
we know a time when is that it's not
launching for as a cute is it cue to do
they say yeah I even wear that like I
know that on live doing some testing a
while ago I wasn't even wear that the
actual console came yeah the micro
console a micro console is that what
they call let's let's switch gears I
want to talk about tablets I want to
talk about the blackberry playbook have
you gotten a chance you had a chance
clean to check first time that they've
they've had an actual working unit it's
just been a video up until just been an
idea it's just been yeah it's just been
hidden behind a glass enclosure that we
can't I know so I haven't had a chance
to get over there yet to do it cuz I've
been running around like a chicken with
my head cut off today but do you think
it has a chance you know I have a lot of
people who are excited about I mean I
have a lot of people who write to me and
say that they're excited about the
PlayBook that they're holding off to get
a tablet until they see the PlayBook so
I think there's that I think there's
that built-in core group of people that
love blackberry and they can't wait to
they can't wait to see what that looks
like on a tablet and
you know I think with 4g on sprint I
think you know it's a compelling product
also loved Motorola's xoom tablet mean
so I think they're doing some really
incredible things but then of course you
just walk and you see 800 tablets all at
once so the ones that stand out are
definitely the blackberry playbook but
have you guys played with it I have not
gotten a chance having had to play with
it in hand I did get to play with the
motorola xoom yeah yeah it's a very
sleek very cool looking device but I'm a
little you know wary because it's it's
what the PlayBook was a couple of months
ago right now it's just a video like
when when they gave it to us to play
this video I'm sure there's lots of you
know after effects funny they were happy
but I I did do some scanning through so
many stuff and it was pretty fast it was
not video stuff that I got to scan
through so i just ate his screens
beautiful and you know i think it's i
think it's the tablet that android fans
have been waiting for i think it's
exciting and I think finally you know
first of all it's built for the tablet
form factor so we have honeycomb and
it's finally built for the tablet form
factor you know I felt like the get
samsung galaxy tab for the first time to
me android felt like it had room to
breathe so now it'll be interesting to
see it fully baked inside the inside the
motorola xoom engine honeycomb and
yesterday google released like a video
demoing the the operating system and
it's the first software from google
that's specifically designed for tablets
right and I got to say I'm very
impressed with the UI I don't quite
understand it just yet yeah but I think
it looks pretty cool real whoa whoa wait
what switch which one is this him about
a non apple product hahaha you guys are
witnessing history oh go on go on oh
yeah well come on you hate everything
but Apple is oh we've got a lien where
laptops uh Oh Clayton overhears anyone
with a mac is this true so I i don't
know i would actually very impressed the
UI i think looks really sleek yeah it
kind of reminds me of this is gonna
sound kind of weird but I really does
feel like the future yeah like on screen
the holographic
it's just it's really you know like it
screams future star trek Minority Report
all that stuff like I want to see that
built in with a connect someone hacked
that right oh you so you could just you
know wave your hand and from cruise in
jail figure out who you're gonna kill
before we let you go and before our
break want to talk really quickly about
Star Wars I know you're a big star wars
fans you're coming to blu-ray what are
your thoughts my thoughts are do I have
to buy another version of Star Wars yes
of course you have to buy a lot of one
right is this the extended one that'll
have Jar Jar Binks like in every extra
scene that I could possibly with no you
know what I bought the original VHS then
I have the the limited edition box set
the one that slides up the blue one that
slides up that has the hologram on the
front that has the star wars book and
all that stuff inside of it which was
like 190 dollars when I got the original
dvds and then I got the remastered
updated ones with all the extra stuff
shoved into it now I'm going to go buy a
blu-ray with some extra special features
are these the only ones that are
available on through these are the ones
that through panasonic right oh no I I
think that right now you can only
pre-order the blu-rays on amazon but
yeah I mean you're absolutely right like
I got it i'll admit i own the DVD boxset
own the original VHS listicle come on
yeah but why I'm it's like the Beatles
they were number one they were number
one cell I mean in the top ten they had
like the number-one albums that whole
week when they launched in itunes you're
thinking don't all these people already
owned them owned at least the CD you
know you can you know the whole point
itunes is taking that city and popular
right now so you know i mean you know
that the star wars fans are gonna go
right out there and buy all of the all
the blu-rays right away i think the
point is that it can't really get any
better right like this is 1080p HD like
you're not gonna get they'll figure
something out there still gonna look
what about 3d we need X that'll need
another year for now yes 2012 wait and
see ladies don't give our guests Clayton
Morris a big round of applause thank you
so much for being here
we got to take a break more 404 live
from CES 2011 right after this
you
to the 404 live from the CES 2011 show
floor Justin you how are you enjoying
yourself yeah all right I'm a little
under the weather you are but reminds me
I feel like we should tell people what
the 404 is about because someone just
came up to us and asked what we do why
are you oh yeah stop talking so we
should try to justify why we're here
sure you have this magazine cut out that
apparently explains it this is kind of
interesting let's explain first off of
what what the 404 is weird let's
apologize for the name because it's
probably has named a history of recorded
audio okay that you know the mistakes
were made but you know the our show was
a daily web show where we we pick apart
bits and pieces of the internet that we
find funny yes you know because the
internet is pretty stupid and we like to
make fun of it on a daily show called
the 404 and it's true live every day
1130am eastern time and there's a chat
room you can join it's the 404 dot cnet
com we have to stick rehab nowhere
thicker sure we're the only people at
CES I believe with stickers to help
explain where the 404 terminology stems
from an anonymous fan of the show was
nice enough to submit this sort of 404
lexicon identifier thing I'm going to
read from this right now you know it's
just sort of like the dictionary
definition of 404 okay number one this
is might seem obvious number one is the
number preceding 405 that's literally
what itself you could start here early
what it says okay so if you couldn't
figure that number two number two it
happens to be the Atlanta area code
which we found out with a lot of our
fans from Atlanta call up and they're
like why you you know why you trying to
represent you right exactly number three
is like the real reason the real nerd
the web page
a you know error why is how we did error
code right and number four and I'm not
joking number for the worst podcast on
the internet haha no it actually says
clueless but that resonated sure so
that's the definition officially here at
CES very exciting stuff yeah let's move
along to some stories we have Justin you
are the 404 resident food aficionado
right clearly you eat a lot aficionado
as much as like a terrible food rebel
food connoisseur definitely okay if it
will kill you or take five years over
your life right Justin knows about it
well as you guys know I love eating
processed food right and to prove that I
wanted to show you guys this the
Campbell's Chunky soup wireless cooking
kit yeah I think I seen this I don't
have it on the showroom floor but uh
this is actually a cup of soup that you
can cook on a coupled power table so so
this is taking advantage a lot of
companies there's powermat there's a lot
of companies releasing these wireless
charging station right this is the e
coupled version i call it yeah and all
you have to do is put this cup of soup
that you buy from the store on a
countertop that's a couple powered press
either low medium or hot heat I need my
cooking for you there's something very
wrong no like my seated there's no
chance you'll get cancer right yeah I go
I soup to have LED lights on it I don't
I don't want my soup to be electronic I
want it to be analog with you know with
real food in it had uh and what if this
thing you know explodes Allah you ever
cook soup in the microwave it bubbles
over well no one that's already pre life
Jeff all you have to do is heat it up
that's what this technologies you're
taking a chance that's true well okay
like I'm not telling you're gonna cook
steak on this well I have imagined a
little filet and yeah that would be
really depressed I mean like I so look
like the whole wireless charging thing
is taken off right I mean a lot of
people think that's really cool not
having to plug up anything right or to
charge your phone energizer had the
wireless charging pad or you just put
your iPhone on top and it'll charge
and you know like for people like you
would you seriously consider buying like
a i guess a wireless charged yes there's
why suffering you guys you have people
to cook food for you I live by myself so
I mean anything that will cut down on
the cooking times single guys an
elaborate call for help yeah that's
really that's that's basically what you
said but but so trying all of us are
married you know what can you say so
like what other applications can you
think of because I am assuming this up
sort of coil or something inside of it
hitting up the soup like are we talking
steak later down the road oh wait I'm
senior onions bag right the kitchen of
the future will just comprised of power
mass yeah I knew this time machine that
Owens and then you'll shelf hydrate your
pizza like in Back to the Future like
you your pizza is now dry weight yeah so
that's well that's a little huh yeah
well I thought that was pretty cool that
it is pretty I actually do think there's
some net is really my own life yeah
absolutely you know in it it's a one
less thing to have like a microwave
stove refrigerator who needs it right
yeah wireless to 2011 that's your best
come a long way wireless yeah definite
out of all the things to digitize yeah
soup with lucky forget isn't it oh you
meant you mentioned LTE just before the
show started there was the verizon press
conference they you know most of it was
about skype so they're there and they
rolled out their plans for LTE uh you
know it wasn't i wasn't really super
interested in anything that was right
going on because they didn't say
anything about an iphone let's be honest
let's go spey to see that's why you're
upset right yeah well everybody's been
anticipating the verizon iphone last
night some images of the i guess the
skeleton of the iphone leaked out and it
looks a lot like the iphone 4 but the i
guess the edges have different it's just
a slightly different shape than original
iphone
people are speculating this is what the
what Verizon may release it might
actually be like a world phone that'll
work anywhere because it has a GSM
compatible slot everything so I'm
excited about that and everybody was
sort of hoping that Verizon would have
nounced the iphone at CES that didn't
happen but Apple in typical fashion did
release something this morning that was
the mac app store right so you've been
clamoring to get this off your chest you
keep touching me under the table here
say let's talk about the story so Wilson
explain to us what's the mac app store
and what's it all about they apple took
the you know the iOS App Store and
decided to pour it over to the mac and
now you know a lot of the sort of bait I
wouldn't say big bottle there are a lot
of apple applications now that you can
just purchase with your iTunes ID
install your computer never have to
worry about the updates I had a chance
to personally play with it yet right I'm
having been update my Mac here but it it
seems like a really interesting concept
for operating systems down the road I
think windows 8 Android obviously
already has one about it it's how people
going to get software in the future I
don't think anybody's ever really going
to go to a store anymore or after a
couple years from now nobody's ever
going to go to store to buy software
just like couple years from now nobody's
ever gonna go to store to buy a video
game right well yeah I think that's
already happening though I mean I mean
you've talked about this on you on
pregame before no do you think like
PlayStation 4 or anything like that's
going to have a dis case you imagine the
next round of consoles and I don't think
they're coming anytime soon but you got
imagine they're still going to offer
some sort of physical media drive you
just I just can't see them or maybe
they'll offer you know a version with
the drive and a version without
something like that I just can't see
them just eliminating it you know in
from one jump one generation to the next
that said though I think when all is
said and done the next generation of
games you know when that generation is
over with I think the vast majority of
software will be consumed on a
unload only basis see to me that seems
like a loss for the video game players i
mean i don't i don't gain myself but i
do remember the nintendo era where you
would have to actually have the
cartridge remember and we get dirty and
you have to so you're saying i miss that
so you're saying ability you feel bad
video game into the console it's
important to the gaming about the
insertion yes yeah I like that coming
from a nun hi that's the one point you
have to bring up that's when I'm
bringing to the table you want to get up
off the couch and walk over to the
console and that's what you missed
that's my exercise or is it worth it i
like getting another appointment it
would just be a one-man gesture cuz the
tvs really pretty close oh my studio is
tiny i'm sure i have to step over the
toilet hahaha and my knees hit the wall
when i'm sitting on the toilet I'm not
sure and the Murphy bed only comes that
and there's a window in front of the
toilet and actually leaned on while i'm
using the restroom i can actually look
out the window at people so conveniences
uh doesn't really matter York oh I
really do think like the app store you
know a lot of a lot of tech people's
kind of think of it as Apple's way of
controlling how people using their
computers this doesn't preclude people
from installing their own software but
what I actually I really do think that
it opens up more I guess I more users to
downloading and buying software I've
never I've never bought so much more
software in my life that on my iPhone I
understand that but it might open the
door but at the same time I think it
closes the door okay because this is
just the the writing on the wall is very
clear to me at least is that now all
software on iOS platforms is going to
have to go through this you know very
strict but that's I OS like nobody wants
their cell phone to crash just say I
understand that but you know it sort of
just takes away that open source pneus
of it all well I I think that you can
still install like the same kind of apps
on Mac OS I think they did how long I
think that's got to be honest I think
that's going to be around for a while hi
Julie believe that and I like i said i
think that it opens up the door for a
lot of people to download
software that they never experienced
before because who wants to go to like
Walmart or you know best buy buy the DVD
spend like the hour to to install it and
then discover that you don't like it you
tried in the app store or let's take a
pan informal poll who is bought actual
software physical software who's like
gone to a store in the past year and
bought and software two gentlemen three
gentlemen this is CES and this is CES so
that's I think I would say the same
thing most of what I do on my computer
besides editing in Final Cut right is
through the browser sure everything I've
been IM Inge you know all my time at
work on facebook that kind of stuff
right follow the web yeah you just
winked at us don't do that at a time I
want to start talking about you know
today's the first official day I've got
a live audience you guys are very we
appreciate you coming out sitting down
even if you're just tired we appreciate
your tiredness uh what have you guys
seen and feel free to shout out because
we are live what have you guys seen so
far that has really blown you away
Reese's minis that's interesting that's
candy can you plug that into a wall you
could just eat it really okay okay
that's cool anyone anyone else like in a
product if some sure all that something
you can plug in maybe no one has seen
anything what what did you say did you
say Campbell's wireless soup no just
okay yeah you like what s our friends
over here Denny you guys seen anything
that's really blown you away would you
see these are not straight to the food
came right to the floorboard so Wilson
what about you today you've had some
time to walk around is there one thing
that you said you know what I'm gonna go
back and try and steal that uh there it
was I'll be honest so far it's been the
motorola xoom really i've been very i'm
really impressed with the product I I
think that it's the sort of like first
Android anything that I would really
consider buying that that sort of really
differentiates itself from
from the ipad recording this cuz this
has never had hahahahahaha this is
amazing so the zoom I I think that if if
it works like the way the video portrays
yeah I think that'll be a really
interesting product right um wanting
really cool thing that I thought about
it was that they say that the
communications part the 3g in the 4g is
actually interchangeable really so you
can take the zoom in to a verizon store
all right and if you bought the 3g
version you can they can switch it out
and install LTE antenna or something
like that and it'll still work so i
really cuz i think that that's probably
the biggest differentiator everything is
going to live in the cloud so we're not
i'm not so worried about whether to get
like the 16 gig versus the 64 gig virgin
anymore all my emails in the cloud all
my work stuffs in the cloud don't really
plan on editing video on a tablet
anytime soon sure yeah oh god no but I'm
doing on his iPhone floor though yeah
right yeah but but I think that the the
zoom is a is a very interesting product
I really really like it I think that
that's for me besides the Angry Birds
board game I can't stop thinking about
Justin you other than the inside of your
hotel room what has been the most
exciting thing here at CES well I am the
printers and peripherals editor here at
cnet please stop laughing jeff bagwell
um so i was walking around today i saw
the you know victorinox the guys that
make the swiss army knives yeah they
have a swiss army knife that has a built
in solid state drive know that goes up
to 128 gigabytes I'm not just talking
about because I blogged about it on cnet
but here it is look that's pretty cool
is it comes in a bladed version and you
can also get the airplane friendly once
without a night okay I was gonna say
like how much is it gonna hurt when you
gets compensated at the urb right so you
can buy the one without the knife
that'll get you through the scanner just
fine so I think that's pretty cool I'm
storage has come a long way I never
thought I'd see an SSD Drive an
affordable SSD drive with an ian has
flash we talking I don't know you don't
know how did no pricing yet no but uh
hopefully it won't be too expensive if
you want to go and pick that up you can
write but the story's really matter
anymore
yeah is there like pulling things off my
friends hard drives when I'm ever out uh
you know word files and JPEGs watch no
media or anything like that anything no
means no movie yeah yeah definitely
nothing like now or snow music on your
computer you can have internet man
technologies haven't seen anything
you've been on the show floor all day
what I what did you think about I don't
know if this is actually on the cs CES
floor sure but the the virtual remote
for a lot of these handheld tablets like
the iphone ipad ones from fling right so
wilson's talking about couple
manufacturers have come out with their
not virtual their physical joystick
add-ons that you're sort of like you
know you're just like suction a joystick
onto your iPad what it's it's cool it's
kind of interesting i blogged about it
earlier there you go um wow it's it's
check out this photo of what we're
dealing with you're basically adding on
you know like a multi-directional
joystick but how does that interface
with your ipad you know when you play
like pac-man on and I there's a virtual
you know thing in the corner we're not
just pack me wherever it is and I guess
you sort of have to Center the joystick
right undoubtedly pretty cool it's it's
a little ridiculous because it's like
taking the most advanced product
humanity's ever you know yeah hold on
let's bring it back to 84 right Steve
Jobs dream yeah well I'm sure he's
pissed about it you know but there's two
products of note there's one from
thinkgeek and that is the silver
joystick you see there and then a
company I forget what I think they're
called 110 design or something like that
they've come up with another suction d
pad a sort of device ten one design and
i think it's a it's a smart idea I how
long have your familiar with the way I
feel about ipad gaming I'm in feven you
want the buttons that's a service I want
to I want to attach some sort of casing
frame onto an ipad so I can have a
directional been a couple buttons
you know I gotta say it's it's the d-pad
that's the biggest issue with you
because I always feel like I'm about to
crack the glass like truant you know
right that's how I play your thumb many
people play ipad games you guys play
ipad games all right half the audience
you know you're playing a game with the
virtual joystick and all of a sudden
your thumb is like Alan left field
you're like how did it get over there
that's crazy well that's the point we're
trying to make okay and that as far as
gaming is kind of what your age oh well
I thought it was interesting anything
else from the gaming world okay I'm
gonna go back to the 3ds just because
you know no one really expected Nintendo
to be here you know the it's sort of
leaked out like oh they might be here we
don't know what they're going to have I
would like I said I was lucky enough to
play with it the the cool thing about it
and I didn't really understand it till i
play with it the 3ds the top screen is
the 3d screen and it has an adjuster a
slider on it and you can control I guess
how nauseous you want to get yeah and
you know you can either eliminate the 3d
effect all together or you can intensify
it to the point where you're really
involved like up in your face right see
that's the thing that's and that's a
good thing you brought up the 3d it's
more inside if the effect goes into the
screen rather than popping out but
nothing is like flying at you or
anything right so which is why I keep
bringing up the magic I analogy you know
and but obviously there's no I crossing
involved it just sort of happens
naturally Tendo guys and we talked about
the story yesterday about them warning
against kids under six using the 3ds
right did you ask him about that I
judged on another and he wants a 3ds and
I want to know if it's gonna damage his
eyesight if I buy it I'm gonna make him
go blind hopefully I don't know all the
other devices that kids use I mean I
mean look it's no secret kids are
swapping in front of TV screens for five
hours at a time anyway um look with all
devices handheld game you know in
moderation take a break there's a whole
magic world outside where the Sun shines
in the windows right so you know it's
healthy to do that every every now and
then okay and I think that's the real
takeaway yeah it's good advice great
advice from the 404 jogo ever thought
I'd heard
out and play some bass guitar what the
computer down no just bring my 3ds
outside no leave the three years yes but
we're getting close to the in the show
we should actually tease something to
you we've got the next big thing coming
up and I believe it's the north hall
right sure what about some some apps we
have some guys I'm seeing it you can you
can check out all the latest CNN news
