Bionic legs and seems super happy
Lego announced today that your Legos are
going to be coming to life it's not
April Fool's joke it's just it's it's
crazy just and a teeny teeny teeny tiny
computer that can sit on the edge of a
nickle probably gonna lose it tomorrow
daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best speak
talk show in the known universe I'm your
host Ashley Scott to join me as always
doing some kind of martial art Oh
praying mantis I see it I like it kill
anonymous what's up killer did you vote
get the end there that's a very
specification
it's an ancient trick I can't really
tell you about it yeah some people die
learning it but we had to when we were
doing the stories today we had to juggle
them around because we're like which
one's more exciting yeah there's this
Lego one I'm scare sighted about yeah
well your wallet should be terrified I
put my wallet in the other room for this
story I'm crying yeah all right here it
started with this crazy dog okay do it
so the dogs not actually crazy it's not
crazy I Cujo this is a real dog and I'm
it's it's a sad story it starts off
really sad but then it gets like a
hundred times better so just get ready
for your feels this is story about a dog
named Brutus Brutus when he was a puppy
was left out and sub like freezing
temperatures sub-zero temperatures and
the breeder of this dog saw that it had
really bad frostbite on all of its legs
and so just cut off all of it all of
this dog's legs just took him off cuz
that breeder is a terrible human being
just really bad example of how to be a
decent person okay but it gets better I
promise because Brutus was rescued and
his foster family I mean he has a ton of
people loved this dog and so they
decided that they were going to put
together crowdfunding to get Brutus some
prosthetics cuz he had like a little
kind of stroller thing but they wanted
him to be able to walk cuz he's a dog
and dogs love to walk and run and have
fun so they did that and they went they
went online and they crowdfunded some
Bionic legs for Brutus Brutus is now a
bionic dog he has all four of his legs
are are fitted with prosthetics he's
rolling out with four of them yeah have
we done how does that happen before I
think they said that there are only he
is one of two dogs that have all four
legs as prosthetic so he is of a very
rare breed
now pause static squeak all the pasta
cedex you're telling the story okay he
got the the Bionic legs are from a
company called ortho pets which does
prosthetics for animals and he now has
all four legs fitted he does therapy
sessions with Colorado State's vet
Hospital which is pretty cool and he was
actually recently like officially fully
adopted which is awesome but it seems
like ever since this dog got rescued
he's had a pretty big family like just
tons of people absolutely love this dog
I'm so there he is doing physical
therapies on like a balanced board with
his prosthetics like kind of learning
how to use them standing up like he
totally is got it no he's he's look he's
walking around it's like the best story
ever and I saw this video and I got a
little choked up because I love dogs and
and animals in general and I just got so
happy because this dog 10-15 years ago
this dog they would have been like this
dogs unadoptable we have to just put it
down which would be a tragedy it would
be a terrible thing but now Brutus has a
whole full new lease on life because he
gets four Bionic legs that is insane
it's like the best story oh yeah nicely
done I just I literally wanted everybody
to go off into the weekend like just
being so happy and this is the reason
why you can tell everybody about this
story I love that how much he's like
actually adapted to it yeah it's it's
that's really inspiring it's just so
inspiring I love it so much and that's
actually I like that's our hashtag of
the day because I want everybody to talk
about this but I thought so Brutus
already has Bionic legs so our hashtag
is TD Brutus what are you gonna do and I
was wondering you know like we should
think of other things that we could give
Brutus they don't have to be like body
modification but other things we could
give him and maybe we could turn him
into a superhero dog like I would give
him a jetpack yeah dog jetpack Furness
come back so do you have some flying
around like land on his Bionic legs and
Rhine like it would be great okay all
right or maybe like a helmet that
dispenses treats okay all right you
really look at it I love dogs listen I
want to give this dog the best life like
if I was Oprah rich I would give this
dog
life ever like I'd find a way to have
Eli must create him a Tesla and like he
could drive fast around like I'd find
ways to make this dog's life the
greatest life ever right on okay what
would you do well I'm more of a cat
person okay because I was born and
raised on the Internet my cats Oh
basically the same thing but I would
give him some sort of like I don't know
if you ever played the game metal gear
like he has that camouflage oh yeah
shoot so I would let him like do like
camouflage you could change colors I
like it yeah so he'd be like Bionic but
he'd be able to turn into a rock or what
I like yeah he could be invisible so
there you go what is it TD what TD
Brutus Brutus all right it's named after
a very nice hashtag all right so I got a
I got a I got a doozy to talk to you
about rights you are really different
success of the lego movie and just how
big of the possibilities there are out
there Lego has decided they're just
gonna bring all that right bright back
to you with lego dimensions now what you
know what this is is they imagine sky
lino Skylanders you know Disney infinity
it's like that so it's endless
dimensions endless universes and all you
have to do is buy all of their little
toys we add this on NFC portals and you
put them on there and and you kind of
explore okay so let's let's talk about
the cool things how can we talk about
much this is gonna hurt your wallet yeah
I was gonna say this seems like your
school expense it's the mixing and
matching of characters which is just a
great thing a starter pack comes with a
Gandalf there Batman wild style and and
then you have to build this little tiny
portal to play with you build it put it
on the NFC to thing and it activates oh
my god so this is already like out of
the gate just a really cool sounding
like easiest thing to play with so yeah
so you get to its the storyline is about
a villain tearing rifts between all the
Lego worlds oh yeah whoops it's a good
excuse to like get all the different
franchises together correct and you'll
be able to have minifigure minifigures
vehicles gadgets levels all available
through the game via the NFC base so
there's a there's a lot to swallow here
if you know anything about skylander and
Disney infinity imagine that
but with Legos and apparently a lot of
intellectual properties from WB I was
gonna say this seems like there are a
lot of Frant like a lot of IPs that
we're all really familiar of course like
Lego does everything yeah every some of
the ones that they plan and then we're
gonna get to price okay pricing so wait
some of the ones they plan or lower the
Rings WB Wizard of Oz oh oh look at the
minifig oh my god I'm gonna buy this
back to the future DC comics and more it
all sounds like WB yeah thanks a lot of
Warner Brothers Inc Back to the Future
is universal I think so yeah but still
the possibilities are endless
you could be any movie franchise Harry
Potter I think Harry Potter that's right
anything that's already been a lego okay
so to get started
starter pack is $100 okay next I'm
spending all right Ramona comes with
Batman Gandalf wyldstyle and the Lego
Batmobile you know that's actually not
that bad considering how much Legos cost
and then the those other little starter
packs whether in Lord of the Rings
wizard arrives fifteen to thirty dollars
each oh ouch
yeah again believe it or not still not
bad if you go to the store and look at
how much Legos cool yeah I was gonna say
like one Lego set sometimes there's
there you go you can see on screen sort
of eyes these are all these little great
games now I need really confused because
Lego already tried this online thing and
it didn't work out but I think this is a
little bit different in that this is
sort of a sand like a scene I have a
feeling you're gonna have a sandbox
situation very much like the toy box in
Disney infinity yeah we're gonna be able
to actually like put together Legos in
in a virtual space into whatever you
want and then sort of make gate little
games for yourself and things like that
cuz I'm in the toy box like people are
making like platformers and all sorts
right you can use you can use up to
seven dimension items at once at once
yeah once so that's a lot so again like
and I'm not trying to elongate the story
it's just it's good to know that they're
actually putting some work into it
wow that sounds awesome but but like
what it looks like we didn't see any
what it looks like didn't see any
gameplay that looks kind of like
rendered out stuff yeah I have a feeling
it so it may not look as good but it
made okay so we're gonna get this
September 20
seven so we're likely to see something
at e3 yeah
no here's there's a giant booth well how
can you play it well you can play it on
Xbox one 360 ps4 ps3 and the Wii U which
is good news for you me as a PC guy I'm
going to buy something else we have a
360 I have it yeah who cares though but
there you go
so yeah I'm more interested to know if
this if any but cuz because ultimately
people are driven by their fandoms now
of course yeah so the fact that they
said Back to the Future is enough to
drive me but then they said wonderings
Batman I'm sucked in so they may just be
like oh they work out a deal with Disney
I will do Lego Star Wars animalyzer
infinity Star Wars who knows we'll find
out more how do the Caribbean also had a
lego one kid you know Lego is just it
seems like Lego is friends with
everybody so it's I mean I would imagine
just like Legos the possibilities are
endless like I mean like just those
partnerships it seems like they have a
lot of goodwill with all of those
companies so I'll be really curious to
see if like Disney gets on board with
this if we see you know other companies
getting on board saying like well you
know I know that we have our own thing
but then maybe may be good to have a
lego thing too
I've seen a lot of grown men and women
that have buckles under their fandoms
they fall into this stuff whether it be
Disney infinity or skynox Skylanders
yeah you fall into it
then as an adult with the expose double
income yeah it's a rabbit hole yeah but
I'm I'm excited to see it I'm excited to
see it - we'll see you by the way sure
Lego weird choice using joel mchale as
the person selling it I like me some
Joel McHale I may be a sarcastic guy
that doesn't really like everything is
not a great choice yeah he seemed
annoyed by Gandalf food jack would have
been good oh yeah Wow I'm sorry that's
bad terrible this is time for our next
time it is let me tell you about this
tiny PC because this is pretty crazy I
saw a picture of this and I just my jaw
dropped a little bit cuz it looks
incredible so this is called the
Michigan micro moat or the that's this
of a nickel by the way well that's the
side of a nickel the cuy I like I almost
want Logan to just go back producer logo
needs to go back and we just pause the
screen right on Pat Nick look at that
that's great it's a normal sized nickel
and that's a little computer that's a
working computer on the side of the
nickel it is one millimeter cubed one
millimeter cubed okay so tell me about
this little tiny guy so it is from the
University of Michigan it is from their
computer science department it took them
more than a decade to make this it can
take pictures it can read temperatures
and record pressure readings and it also
is so small that it can be injected into
your body today did they say that yes to
perform ECGs it can be used as an object
tracker so one of the examples they gave
us what you would maybe use this for is
you would you'd pop that right on your
your keys or you would pop it on to your
phone or you would any you'll be able to
find it wherever it was in the house and
then also they because it's so small
they don't use a standard battery to
keep it charged they actually program
and charge it via strobing light at
really high frequency yeah look at how
small it is that's on a penny it's not a
penny in processes here's the it's it's
all like it's very small like
custom-built stuff it's not they're not
using like an Edison chip or anything
this is like they've been working ten
years on this this is this is crazy
technology I love this soap like
Fantastic Voyage tiny like go into your
blood show like the little school bus
like the Magic School Bus it's like that
yeah so um they were saying it's ready
for production but here's where it gets
even crazier team is not stopping at
this teeny tiny computer they're saying
they want to make an even smaller
computer and they're calling them as a
kind of like kind of self retro
referentially joking about it calling it
smart dust that's how small they want
these computers yeah like so tiny they
could be like little particles in the
air No and they were saying that someday
they want to be able to stick a chip no
inside a cell no yeah these guys are all
about no micro don't like computing
I don't cuz you're gonna hack people
then hack people I don't like that this
the penny thing is already too
I know we're gonna eject it into your
blood no you're not already inject this
into your into your system there so it's
cool cool but scare citing it's Sierra
sighting I like that a lot of our show
centers around things that are
terrifying but also really exciting they
actually said like this is science
fiction becoming real like one of the
people running this project was talking
about how like this absolutely sounds
like science fiction and it totally is
you know it's it's all fine and good
that they come out of the game with like
it's really gonna be good for your
health we're gonna make it into us so it
doesn't have to be injected yourself and
then some guy some guy that's bald it
has like a scar on his face and he's
petting a cat he's like yes I can use
this technology and then Apple also is
like yeah we're going to screw well
that's the guy running Apple right yeah
the guy running Apple is just some it's
like Lex Luthor is running a lot okay
wait hold on Logan does this scare you
at all they're saying medical uses
internet of things all kinds of some
industrial I mean really kind of
limitless uses for this that's look at
that's it program getting programmed so
they this life is so blind they program
it through the white that's cool yeah
it's crazy so um so yeah that's how
that's how it works which I mean just
this was me like I was literally the
Internet me was like like I couldn't
believe that that was a real thing so
that is a real thing that's a real
working computer you're welcome internet
you're welcome humanity and we're also
we're really sorry because this
obviously is the beginning of the end
the dust thing when they said smart dust
I was like they're real bad very bad
idea but I love it I also oh there's a
bunch of computer please of coughing up
computers I like the flash I looked it
up on WebMD as a symptom coughing up
computer help me alright guys we're
gonna take a quick break we'll be right
back with around into it and of course
we have your user feedback and our phone
Tiger for the day so don't click away
it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's Thursday which means we like to
talk about things that we're obsessed
with this is into it Kayla you've been
having a very week were you looking at
my catch it was checking out your
ketchup sock it is pretty good I always
I like that we have a variety of socks
okay oh so you've been following me on
my fave you follow me on on my facebook
my Twitter any of that I know what
you've been doing this week you know
that I'm Way behind and late in the game
into falling into the mobile world
yes MOBAs so unfortunately for me coming
out of the gate there's multiple MOBAs
that I can fall up all prey to so I've
been going all around this is what I'm
into this week because I wanted like I
want to watch the competitive gaming but
mostly heroes of the storm obviously
this is only in beta so there's kind of
a select few that can play it it's a
blast yeah the thing that I was telling
you and we kind of had slightly
differing opinions on is that the beauty
and heroes of the storm is kind of in
its simplicity but there's a difficulty
in in that I mean it's a difficult game
MOBAs are not just like I'm gonna walk
in and play it but I've been hopping
between this and League of Legends have
mostly been playing this with my friends
it's fun to kind of like I haven't had
that sort of like team-based friend game
in a long time don't you play call of
duty and just have my friends go do
their own thing yeah but even I get out
and I just run in but yeah it's a blast
the run rotation right now is Nova which
is the sniper so I've been having some
fun with that if you want to add me on
on here's the storm my name is dr.
president VR president so yeah not not
mr. president
but dr. president and if you tweet at me
because you don't have beta access I
might have beta keys Oh in my account
because they gave a bunch of beta people
keys and I think I have some so if you
tweet at me and you really want to play
heroes of the storm I might be able to
figure that then you're then it can be
you're into it as well but anyway yeah
I'm just hopping into that I'm having a
great
time I'm not usually yes kind of like
top-down kind of guy so yeah I like I
like Diablo so this is like kind of a
fun it reminds me of Diablo the top-down
kind of you know strategy type thing but
I mean it's obviously totally different
gameplay wise yeah but son I really love
I mean I'm excited to be a millionaire
from playing MOBAs like everybody else
is gonna say your career is just
starting your sports career have you
heard of this just really made all the
mobile babes
have you heard there's now like fantasy
eSports like where you can pick fantasy
or you can pick eSports players and then
like win money like this is that really
wanna do that I have to show it to you I
saw it this morning and I was like I
have to remember to tell kill about this
yeah there's like a thing now that's
like and they just got a whole big round
of funding and all sorts of stuff like I
saw it though and I thought of you and I
might kill is gonna get really into this
yeah I watched the Vice documentary
about you sports players that's a good
one yeah it's really advices lots of
good stuff you've if your personal
opinion didn't like the host but still
it was a while yeah he was just like who
do it no no it's not you're a
documentary trust me half of these
gamers make more money than you're doing
here oh the HBO now you should
definitely check out all the lot of the
Vice decorous so good because a lot of
people are just now subscribing HBO now
so if you get that you should check it
out so okay what are you into this week
I'm into this this little beauty right
here don't drop it
my beauty on taking pictures right now
with it that's a great photo this is
this is the Fuji x100t I'm gonna put a
Vanna White it a little bit after we
come back from this video but here's
that this is like the glamour shots from
the from the Fuji YouTube account of
course it looks fantastic this is the
third-generation model of the x100
series they have the x100 the 100's now
the 100 t my favorite thing
hybrid viewfinder which is exactly we're
looking at right now there's an
electronic rangefinder it's amazing you
could pop that up you can actually like
look in there and see exactly like is
your focus in check it is crazy good I
love it so much I'm a big camera nerd
and I am NOT I had a Canon 60d and I I
sold it because I I don't need a
interchangeable lens DSLR system like
it's just not I'm not a professional
photographer I did use a lot of it for
video work but now I do this show and we
have
black man's like cinema cameras in here
and we don't really take them anywhere
so and plus we have producer Logan for
that stuff so we're gonna are you gonna
wait let's get a picture of kale taking
a picture I don't even know I'm trying
I'm trying to do thing it's just looking
at oh yeah just it's just like the video
it's amazing
mm-hmm so yeah it's true of this thing
it's how much was it you sandwich it was
uh it was $12.99 and then I bought a
bottle hood an adapter lens adapter got
a UV filter on there got a bunch of
stuff to video yeah yeah sure it's a
it's so nice and it's to paraphrase
Ferris Bueller it's so choice and I if
you have the if you have the means I
highly recommend picking one up if you
want to see your photos they can follow
you on Instagram yeah if you um I I like
to I post pics look at it for you it has
a video feature on it
it's like Wi-Fi where you can send it
directly to your phone and I really like
that because now I don't have to mess
around on my computer like you know
futzing around with exposure and filters
and all that stuff because usually you
have your you take a picture you upload
it to your computer you do all of your
post-processing and then you have to put
it back on your phone or you know
somehow you get back on your phone and
then you can post it to social media if
you're using like Instagram because you
can't post via browser to Instagram so
now you just hit the Wi-Fi button you
connect right to your phone or to your
tablet whatever you can edit your
pictures right there and they're just
sharing which is so nice
but yeah I'm obsessed with it it's like
my favorite thing ever is a birthday
present to myself I was like you know
what it's gotta treat yourself and I did
so I went to bought it and I loved it
and it's my favorite birthday present of
all time from myself of course very cool
so that's what I'm into um but you guys
are also into things and you're way
smarter than us and I'll explain why so
let's talk about your user feedback
well I felt like a real idiot today when
I read that user feedback because you
guys had really good ideas they always
have better ideas than us I don't know
why today's surprise today especially
more like especially more intelligent
than what especially I put forward
yesterday which was a terrible idea
compared to everybody else okay we asked
you guys use the hashtag was dumb
real dumb yesterday I said so we use
that we asked you guys use hashtag TD
tree tell us what you want organically
grow out of the ground you guys came on
some really good ones a lot of you just
used trees or wood so Frank wrote in and
said grow me a group lamp
nothing is more authentic than a group
made from a real living tree I mean I
think that company needs a pivot
immediately and start making group
glimpse cuz I feel like that would make
a lot of money my angst I wrote in and
said I'd love to have a grand piano
grown out of stone it just imagine how
massive that would be a great piano yeah
I guess you would just carve it the
carving right now just a granite or
something Joe wrote in and said phone
cases swappable phone backs computer
shells outside of the outside of a mouse
swappable keys for a keyboard xbox
controller shell endless just cut too
many ideas using Joseph's trying to
start a business over that dad Joe had
so many ideas that that's what me I feel
so I felt so dumb like after I read
these I was like wow wow you you failed
at GD Trias gotta you really ruined
everything
hey Zeus wrote in and said give me an
organic spaceship I want the Leviathan
Moya from Farscape to starburst now whoa
gracious yeah that's like there's an
organic spaceship in the comic book saga
which is pretty great if you want to
check out saga yeah like that no I'd
live they did that so Douglas wrote and
said I think growing houses could be a
cool idea you get a new rumor story
every 10 years that one I was really
impressed with because I was like wow
why didn't we think of that why did we
not think of that I'm yeah pretty great
for soga Neil wrote in a freshly grown
bed every night like a gorilla's nest
with cotton puff sheets and sea sponge
pillow I'm tired now he said I love I
love how descriptive he was but great
another great idea
millions of them and then finally Chris
emailed us and wrote I want them to grow
disposable cups every time I see a
Styrofoam cup I think ah it's 2015 and
pretty common knowledge that styrofoam
doesn't disintegrate and yet these cuts
are still here see that's good like
that's good thinking about the area to
replace something that we're already
doing yeah of course their IQ each
individually is bigger than ours
combined so thank you guys very much for
those thank you we really appreciate
what's today's again as a reminder TD
Brutus TD Brutus make sure you tell us
what what fun other things you could
give Brutus to make him a Superdog even
though he already is and finally our
very last piece of user feedback as
always is our photogra for the day this
is a very timely series of pictures I
chose three from the same person
