around the show but we did run into the
I'm watch which is Italian yeah and
we're gonna do an unboxing right now I
should have nice leather on the band I
would know they're calling it the
world's first SmartWatch check that out
this is the black one they come in a
whole bunch of different colors not a
nice leather band no not a piss out of a
plastic and probably ever left handed so
I'm putting on my right hand USB
charging cable let's it's a little big
it's clearly upside down for me but it's
right set up for you hey you do that on
purpose English South African Inglis
espanol english united states there you
go touchscreen interface here I'll help
you mix
is the who cares I like it were like
time who cares that's a walk it's time
to do you know what time it is all right
so now calibrate your I'm watch sensors
to my phone in order to get the best out
of them start calibration not to your
phone yet don't worry okay sizes place
your I'm watch on a horizontal surface I
have one please rotate slowly your are
much in all directions rotate it this is
exciting
you're doing like the little guns and
roses dance yeah well Axl action
calibration complete ooh connect with
your smartphone now oh boy I'm watch I'm
watch contact importing may take several
minutes in several time actually says I
take soon waiting may take several time
shot is up let's take a little time to
look at the specs the I'm watch comes in
three models there are seven colors to
choose from with the color model which
is made out of aluminum the tech version
is made out of titanium and the fancy
jewel is made out of silver or gold
there's a 1.5 4 inch color display with
240 x 240 pixel resolution the watch
itself runs on a customized Android
operating system and it communicates
with smartphones like Android and iOS
via bluetooth tethering and this is key
you'll need bluetooth to run many of the
internet features from your phone to the
watch it's not a standalone device
there's a built-in rechargeable battery
which gives you about 48 hours of
standby time without bluetooth and 24
hours within they say it offers up to 3
hours of talk time using the watch's
speakerphone and you can charge it from
USB to a PC or via a power adapter
there's a 3.5 millimeter headphone
connection a microphone and a built-in
speaker so this guy costs two hundred
and forty-nine dollars or also 249 euros
yes so a little bit expensive but if it
works as advertised I mean I think that
we both agree this is a promising trend
I'm ready for wearables personally so I
hope that this is as cool as it seems to
be I can tell already tell it's it gets
smudgy real quick and something that you
wear outside all the time it's gonna get
a little smile but you know what it's
got the plastic on still oh it's okay
look there I'll fix it you know what
it's gonna happen to me it's gonna be a
lot less smudgy when you do that tada
look now would shine it pretty I fixed
it gonna take you everywhere I don't
know what I would do very cool so we'll
have to check this out more yeah all
right put it through its paces there you
go the I'm watch SmartWatch here at
mobile world congress 2013 out of the
bump</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
