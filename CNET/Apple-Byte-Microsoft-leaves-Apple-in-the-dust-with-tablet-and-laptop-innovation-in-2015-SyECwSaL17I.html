welcome to the Apple bite for everything
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now if you were paying attention to the
tech world this week Microsoft had the
best tech keynote we've seen this entire
year why that's right I said it the best
keynote of the year their standout
products were a direct shot at Apple
with a surface pro and surface book now
the surface pro floor is bringing
skylake processors alongside their true
desktop OS their surface pen can
magnetically attached to their tablet
and the opposite side of the pen can be
used like an eraser how clever is that
see that's one of those charming things
that you would never thought of that
Apple used to do when SJ was around the
iPad pro just brings a bigger screen
size and their pencil still sounds like
a stylus to me Brian
yes Charlie I know thank you for that
and even Microsoft's head of Windows and
devices Tyler Meyerson sent a shot out
to Apple and Tim Cook with this tweet of
a toaster and a refrigerator see that's
a callback to April 2012 when Tim Cook
offered his opinion on the tablet laptop
hybrid and said you can converge a
toaster and a refrigerator but those
things are probably not going to be
pleasing to the user you know I would
honestly like an actual refriger toaster
Tim and the surface pro 4 let's talk
about this is amazing but let me be real
even though I want one all my music and
movies and TV shows are in the Apple
ecosystem I'm still getting an iPad pro
and I'll love it but I just know that
the surface pro 4 is a superior product
and then you can't deny that the surface
book Microsoft's first ever laptop that
they design and built in-house is one of
the most innovative products of 2015
they built a laptop with a screen that
pops off and becomes its own clipboard
and then you can also flip it and
reverse it just like Missy Elliott said
yes
to use as a canvas with twice the power
of the MacBook Pro 13 inch now if you
love tech and you want to see innovation
look at what Microsoft just did Apple
will probably sell more iPads and Mac
books combined but Microsoft just kicked
Apple in there you know what and that's
real talk
so what does Apple have up its sleeve or
you know maybe on its fingers well the
US Patent and Trademark Office published
a patent application from Apple for
their next potential wearable ladies and
gentlemen I present to you the one Apple
ring to rule them all this is for real
and the Apple ring is described as a
wearable computer that would incorporate
touch sensitive surfaces gesture sensors
voice input recognition a camera a
microphone and more the application says
the Apple ring could be used with a
smart TV and act like a pointer on an
external display it could also be
wirelessly charged in your car by a
smart steering wheel by an apple card in
2020 you can wirelessly charge your
Apple ring see this thing is already
more useful than the Apple watch I'm
kidding
kind of now this doesn't mean they're
actually going to do this but look at
those drawings do you realize how huge
that ring would have to be it's like
wearing an Apple watch on a single
finger and yes it would still look big
if you have fat sausage fingers and
who's going to be the first person that
does a marriage proposal with this Apple
ring probably one of you watching all
right in products that you can actually
buy Apple announced the new beats pill
plus wireless bluetooth speaker will be
available in November for 229 bucks
their new pill plus is equipped with
both Lightning and USB ports for
charging and most importantly brings
improve sound that's louder has more
clarity and brings tighter bass from the
original based on CNET to own first
impressions now using the app you can
wirelessly pair two pill plus speakers
for stereo sound and two users can also
connect their smartphones and alternate
playing music in a DJ mode that you've
seen from other companies as well and
this week marks the fourth anniversary
of Steve Jobs passing and it's also the
week that the Aaron Sorkin written movie
Steve Jobs releases nationwide the movie
has received praise from critics but
that
hasn't necessarily been the case from
the people closest to SJ now Tim Cook
criticized the number of recent Steve
Jobs bio pics on the Stephen Colbert
show and called them opportunistic
Sorkin fired back with if you've got a
Factory full of children in China
assembling phones for 17 cents an hour
you've got a lot of nerve calling
someone else
opportunistic Sorkin later apologized to
Tim Cook Saint both of them probably
went a little too far people close to
jobs like Steve Wozniak Andy Hertzfeld
and John Sculley agreed that the film
does take a lot of liberties with the
facts but Wozniak liked the film
Hertzfeld said it exposes some deeper
truths and Scully says it's
extraordinary entertainment that depicts
only one aspect of the man The Wall
Street Journal reports Steve Jobs is
Widow Laurene Powell Jobs repeatedly
tried to block production of the movie
because it portrayed jobs as cruel and
inhumane she was offered to be involved
with development but she declined now
I'm excited to see this movie and I will
after I sneak in a couple of spam musubi
'he's after a good day on the beach in
Hawaii next week so just in case there's
no show you'll know why and don't
complain to me on Twitter all right
that's gonna do it email me at the Apple
bite at cnet.com or tweet me at Brian
Tong and I'll respond if I get a signal
on the top of Koko Head thanks so much
for watching we'll catch you all next
time for another bite of the Apple</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
