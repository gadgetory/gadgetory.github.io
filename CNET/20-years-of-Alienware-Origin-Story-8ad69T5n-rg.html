friends late 97 I said to myself you
know what I am going to send one of my
machines out to a review see if they
think that I built a pretty kick-ass
machine I sent out the machine to boot
magazine back in the day it got 8 out of
10 which was pretty good I called Alex I
said hey Alex listen I got this idea
what do you think of you know building
pcs for for people who aren't as
technically adept as we are calling it
aiming work he goes wow you know it's a
really cool idea
but yes I'm interested I told here's the
caveat you gotta drop everything you're
doing
quit your daytime job put a $5,000 and
join me in this fiasco we looked at Dell
and Dell had a pretty good business
model so we decided to take to the
online ordering thing back in 98 99 and
it was a huge success I'll never forget
that Alex told me one day hey there's no
way you're gonna sell a machine online
this is the $5,000 no yeah 5,000 our
machines back then in 1990 the circuit
card they're not gonna get it for 30
days we're asking for $5,000 I mean from
day one I had a website okay it was a
very rudimentary you know website but I
had we had a had a programmer who
eventually became our CTO programmer
configurator but you couldn't order it
you would just configure and then send a
text to us and then we would call you
and process working that way yeah I
asked him hey listen how much would it
cost to turn that quoting system into a
into a custom ordering ecommerce
solution because all thousand bucks our
lives and that's it yeah that's it's a
no-brainer let's do it when it got
really hairy was when we started
introducing colors and we started
introducing different jassi's with
different colors and at first we thought
hey you know where was gonna order or
yellow computers bent over yellow
keyboard and compete a little mouse
right a yellow monitor and I know
speakers yeah but you know here comes
purple here comes red here comes white
and we're like oh my god this is a
supply chain nightmare
I was always into sci-fi and fantasy and
into the whole alien conspiracy thing
the x-files were were you know was was
the biggest hit show on TV at that time
and obviously I was it's a hardware so I
said okay let me see here a news aliens
and hardware alien where that's that's
how that's how I became and I always
wanted a company with a to start off
with an a actually because it would be
the first on the list you know I said
well you know what so it kind of almost
became triple-a right anywhere I just
didn't know how successful that name
would ultimately become and with the
logo sort of part of the idea from the
very beginning or did that come later no
that was from the very beginning I
wanted an alien head for I mean that was
from the get-go was there any pushback
about having the Elliott hit I mean a
lot of people thought we were nuts
it's just the only people understood
this was was us I always ask people when
it comes to sort of people were very
into gaming PCs and and and game and
what games made them realize they first
had to start building their own systems
or really learn a lot more about how
this stuff worked I think for me back in
the 90s it was an embarrassing game it
was one of those full-motion video games
called the Ripper with Christopher
Walken yeah and I saw that in a friend's
computer like well now I got to get into
gaming computers and then later only
came the building my own systems it was
Mara when it was the first one was like
okay now I got to build everything rain
scratch what presented what was
something like for me it was I was a big
flight sim Civet a simulator guy so was
Alex and and Falcon drove that one and
then there was doomed I mean doomed for
me was like you know doom was like oh my
god this is crazy
when we went into this you know we said
you know the core competency of
Alienware has always been the product
marketing the product development the
product engineering side and there was a
breadth of autonomy that you know
Michael and Kevin at the time you know
allowed us in fact you know we took our
time purposely to even integrate into
Dell we're still in the same building we
were before dough acquired us just as
this I mean just think of the symbol
that that's a sense around you know the
autonomy that we operate within we're
still located in Miami Florida where the
company was founded we're a mile away
from the original office that we all
started working at we all have the same
cause that you actually had sort of a
demographic profile a certain person of
a certain age you know with certain
interests it's so hard to do I don't we
don't look at the demographic in terms
of age or gender because this is a very
old man next to me games you know the
gaming the population has is so diverse
nowadays I mean we have more women
playing games and we've ever seen before
we have kids coming into gaming as early
as ages like five and six years old and
then we have veterans like those of us
at the table that play games and we're
much older than that right so if I go
and I and I profile somebody as 34 years
old predominantly male they like to read
this and listen to this kind of music
I'm focusing on like 10% of my market so
what we look at is what are the common
factors amongst this demographic the
gaming demographic in general male
female any age group whatever what do
they care about the most and what they
typically care about is performance
value quality innovation design and a
couple other attributes and that's where
we train excel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
