operating system El Capitan is now
available to pre update for the Mac it's
promising faster apps and new improved
ways to get stuff done I'm Nate we've
seen it and today we're going to check
out some of those new features we'll
start with Mission Control a classic Mac
feature that helps you keep stuff
organized if you press the Mission
Control shortcut here in your keyboard
or just swipe up with three fingers on
the trackpad you get a bird's-eye view
of everything you're working on if you
want a little more space while you're in
the middle of something just grab that
app by the title bar drag it up to the
top of your screen and you can dump it
onto a new virtual desktop now let's say
you want to work on two things at the
same time a copy 10 split view gives you
a neat full screen option that could
prove useful now there are a couple of
ways to do this if you're on a cluttered
desk top click and hold the green full
screen button on the first app you'd
like to work with and pick a site to
drop it on now click the app you'd like
to share screen space with bell line up
side by side on a desktop of their own
with the vertical black bar running
between them drag that left to right to
shrink or extend the app to your liking
if you've already got a few full screen
apps running I want to combine some just
hop in a Mission Control and drag one on
top of the other gonna pair right up
which is really slick if you change your
mind you can drag them by their title
box to change their order or separate
them with a click Apple spotlight has
also learned a few new tricks it can now
for example offer whether results to
search for weather and the name of the
city you're curious about and you'll get
the week's forecast if you want to check
out how a particular team is doing spot
like until your results from their last
game and give you a peek at the upcoming
schedule if you want to check on a
particular player spotlight can do that
to you get a little info card with stats
and links of interest now there's still
quite a few things to discover here
Apple Mail now supports gestures you'll
find public transit direction Apple maps
even safaris learn a few tricks I'll
copy time is definitely worth the
upgrade while you're waiting for it to
download head over to CNN read my full
review I'm Nate thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
