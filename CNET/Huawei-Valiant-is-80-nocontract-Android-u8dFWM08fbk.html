cnet this is the huawei valiant for
metropcs this is an eighty dollar
off-contract android 4.1 jelly bean
phone phones at this low price point are
few and far between so be aware that
there are going to be some trade-offs
for example there is no LTE this is a 3g
phone second of all with the camera 3.2
megapixels no flash and no auto focus or
touch focus and is a fixed focus lens
there's no front-facing camera either
photos were okay they were bright and
colorful but that fixed focus will
really mess you up if you can't get the
perfect distance between you and your
subject also video quality is low
resolution only VGA and you can limit it
to send through SMS messaging which you
do get is a 4 inch touchscreen which is
larger than some of the other $80 rivals
phone is also pretty nice to look at
it's basic but there's a soft touch
finish on the back and the proportions
are pretty pleasing to hold in your hand
up at the ear slide into a pocket put
into a purse since this is a jellybean
phone there is Google now on the device
there's a 1 gigahertz dual-core
processor on the valiant however it
isn't fast enough to handle a lot of
resource heavy games I also personally
found a problem with stability on this
device a lot of the times apps would
flicker or reset they would crash and
sometimes they wouldn't even load that
didn't happen too often usually
rebooting the phone or even rebooting
the app would reset it but it is
something that you should keep in mind
is at least a minor annoyance storage
space on the phone is pretty low you've
got four gigabytes in total that's about
1.9 at your disposal but there is a
microSD card slot that can take up to 32
gigabytes in external storage there are
clearly some problems with this device
that I would keep in mind if you're
going to seriously consider it if it
were me though I just save up for a
better phone I'm jessica's all court for
cnet you can catch my full review of the
huawei valley in at cnet com
