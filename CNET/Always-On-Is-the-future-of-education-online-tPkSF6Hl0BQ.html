the styrofoam ability to each cell an
introduction to artificial intelligence
jazz improvisation the science of
astronomy these are just a few of the
hundreds of college courses you can take
online for free as education gets
totally reimagined thanks to the
internet the classes are called massive
open online courses or MOOCs and many
are taught by top professors at the best
colleges in the world and anyone can
take them we call them control Andrew
Inge is a Stanford professor and
co-founder of Coursera an online
education startup he says MOOCs are all
about promoting access to education for
everyone what we really did was create
the technology that makes it possible
for one professor to teach not just a
hundred but 100,000 students this really
changes the economics of higher
education and lets us do this totally
insane thing right take the best causes
and put them online Coursera offers
classes from 80 different universities
from all around the world so this is
your list of partner universities it's
pretty home like a pack horses from all
of these schools taught in English
Spanish French Italian German or
languages to come in the future the
online lesson plans follow a similar
format to a traditional class there's a
syllabus lectures homework and even
tests very few classes include college
credit but completing a class comes with
its own rewards most students are not
able to get credit for these courses or
a degree so you can say I took a course
but you can't say I graduated from
Princeton their fecal sir hoses are not
credits bearing and you don't get a DB
fold in for the most part but it turns
out that when you finish these classes
and list them on your resume employers
do take this seriously well how far are
we do you think from this becoming the
next stage of education previously the
multiplication was you go to school for
four years
then the next 40 years Yukos on what you
learn but that makes no sense in today's
world and all of us link regular boost
the shells of knowledge Heather we're is
one such student a user experience
designer at Oracle who signed up for a
course on gamification to broaden her
skills they have a series of video
lectures that you can watch there are
quizzes that you would take as well as
homework assignments papers that you
write I love to learn I love being in
class so this is a really easy way to do
that Coursera is not the only place to
get an online college education there's
also Udacity and EDX and some courses
can be taken online directly from
colleges but the father of the movement
is Sal Khan he is targeting the K
through 12 crowd with his startup Khan
Academy so if i take the x x 5 and then
also subtract x 8 his unique approach
which inspired this sea change in
education is about helping students
better learn in a range of subjects from
algebra to astronomy do you feel like
you've spurred a shift in the way people
view education we were the first to kind
of get to kind of show that what there's
a huge need for this there's a huge
demand but our goal is to not just
replicate kind of a traditional course
or just to be video lectures most of the
other people on the other side of this
wall or software engineers data
scientists alerting experts researchers
teachers we're working with them to
think about can we rethink how the
learning happens so it's more
personalized so it's more interactive
it's not lecture based it's not
explanation driven it's a human being
doing exercises so all this technology
replaced the traditional classroom it's
hard to say the most valuable thing you
could get from your education is this
ability to take ownership over your
education this ability to say oh wait
that's my goal I need to figure it out
here are the resources I have at my
disposal let me do it people get very
cynical all the time but i think we are
absolutely moving into like the dawn of
humanity
too dramatic no actually</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
