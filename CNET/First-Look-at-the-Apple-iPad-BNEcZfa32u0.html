I'm giving a first look at the Apple
iPad you no doubt heard a lot of hype
about Apple's new have a computer
there's a little under 8 by 10 and about
1/2 an inch thick giving it a natural
magazine like feel weighs 1.5 pounds
which is light by laptop standards but a
little hefty compared to something like
the Amazon Kindle there are two main
models one that connects to the web over
Wi-Fi and one that uses a combo of Wi-Fi
and 3G wireless from AT&amp;amp;T the Wi-Fi
models come in three capacities starting
a $4.99 for 16 gigabytes $5.99 for 32
gigabytes and $6.99 for 64 gigs the 3G
equipped models come in the same three
capacities but sell for $130 more on top
of the pay-as-you-go data plan you need
from AT&amp;amp;T to get the 3G working for most
people the Wi-Fi model is gonna be the
one to go with both because it's cheaper
and because this is really a device that
seems to be geared for the living room
the whole thing is based around the
iPhone OS which is scaled much bigger to
fill the nine point seven inch screen
there's a lot of familiar features here
such as email web photos maps music
videos and YouTube along with the links
to the integrated iTunes Store and App
Store when you launch any of these apps
however the user interface is slightly
different than what we've seen from the
iPhone mostly because there's more room
to play with the email app shows off
your inbox alongside emails while on the
landscape view and the Photos app
behaves much more like Apple's own
iPhoto software with these stacks of
photos grouped by events and apps such
as maps in the Safari web browser get
much closer to a laptop experience on
this larger screen Apple beefed up the
processor to using their own 1 gigahertz
a4 chip which makes the whole thing very
responsive which is something you notice
in particular on apps that don't depend
on the web like photos there's also an
optional download from Apple called
iBooks that gives the iPad a
drool-worthy e-book reader thankfully
the faster processor doesn't come at the
expense of battery life Apple promises
10 hours of active use including web and
video and up to a month of standby time
when you need to charge it you can
connect it to your computer or use the
included USB wall charger Apple also
sells this basic $30 dock which has the
advantage of transforming the iPad into
a pretty cool
photoframe while it charges speaking of
docks Apple has another one for $70 with
a keyboard attached which can really
help with hardcore emailing or entering
text into Apple's optional spreadsheet
documents and presentation apps which
sell for $9.99 each they're useful but
like the iPhone the real draw of the
iPad in the long run will be apps made
by third parties you've got all sorts of
games with stunning graphics video
streaming apps like Netflix a comic book
app from Marvel and tons of exciting
apps that are trickling out day by day
all of that really gets down to the main
appeal of the device there's no single
thing that it does that can't be done
with a thousand dollar laptop and in
some ways done better but given its size
and its price and its design like most
Apple products puts even most expensive
competitors to shame so there you go
that's my take on the Apple iPad you can
