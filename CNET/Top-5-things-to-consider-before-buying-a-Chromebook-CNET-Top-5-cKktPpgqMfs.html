event here are the top five things you
should consider before buying a Google
Chromebook and number five can you do
everything in a browser Google's Chrome
OS is essentially the company's web
browser expanded to a desktop screen
most things that run on the web will run
on a Chromebook intensive tasks like
video editing or photo editing are not
exactly great on the web so make sure
your usage matches the capability of a
web browser at number four does the
Chromebook run Android apps Google
announced that Android apps will run on
certain Chromebooks let me repeat that
certain Chromebooks at the time of this
recording only three Chromebooks support
Android apps with more coming in the
future and if you want to use Android
apps on Chromebooks they are a bit
quirky which brings us in number three
does the device have a touchscreen if
Android apps are important to you you'll
really want a touch screen on that
Chromebook Android apps were not felt
with a crack pad or keyboard in mind
they are built to be tapped
if Android isn't a big deal to you then
you have more options at number two your
Google password this is an odd one when
you log into a Chromebook you sign in
with your Google account personally I
don't know my password because it was
generated by a password manager if you
have a phone with Android 5.0 or higher
you can use that phone to unlock your
Chromebook using a feature called smart
lock so consider how you will log into a
Chromebook before buying one and then
number one is cost or value yeah it's an
obvious number one so let's talk about
something else that might be as
important can you wait reports from a
number of publications say Google will
release several devices that combine
Android and Chrome OS in a way that
should be different than Android grafted
on to Chrome OS but that's just a rumor
right it's not like Google just
destroyed its Nexus phone line in favor
of its own pixel brand wait a second
got other ideas I'd love to hear them
I'm at AI as on Twitter and I'll see you
online happy birthday Jenny</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
