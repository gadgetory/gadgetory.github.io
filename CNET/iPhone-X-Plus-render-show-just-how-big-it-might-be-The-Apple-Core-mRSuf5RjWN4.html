unwrapping more details about the next
iPhones on today's Apple core so let's
get started
by now we have a pretty clear picture of
what the next iPhones will look like
based on all the leaks but this video
from nine to five Mac takes those
rumours a step further tech journalist
Seamus rahi 3d printed mock-ups of what
the expected iPhones would look like
side by side we have the 6.5 inch iPhone
10 plus the 6.1 inch LCD model which he
calls the iPhone 9 and a regular iPhone
10 to represent that second gen iPhone
10 which is expected to have the same
dimensions and mind you this guy has
been right before the phones are inside
actual sketch covers meaning even the
case makers are betting that these
mock-ups are true
the other interesting thing to note
about this video is the size of that 10
plus when compared to a 7 plus if
true-to-life it would mean Apple has
actually managed to add a full inch of
screen without increasing the overall
footprint of the phone just by
eliminating that home button and the
bezels so if you can fit a current plus
in your hand then you should be good to
go with this next gen ok so now that
we've seen the exterior what about
what's under the hood if Apple keeps
with tradition we can expect a faster a
12 mega bionix
supersonic or whatever other fancy name
Apple decides to come up with but how
much faster up to 10 percent if you
believe these Geekbench results for
mysterious iPhone 11 comma 2 originally
spotted by French site Casa Mac the
benchmark results show a 10% speed
increase for single core performance and
a 5% increase in multi-core performance
when compared to the existing 10 and an
increase in RAM from three to four gigs
even if these results were to be true we
still don't know which one of the three
phones they belong to after all the
cheaper iPhone model could have an
entirely different chips
there's also been a lot of buzz about
Apple finally switching over to a USB C
port for its next batch of iPhones now
this doesn't mean that Apple will be
ditching the Lightning port any time
soon the upgrade to USB see in this case
refers to the wall charger Japanese blog
site Macko Takara published these images
reportedly taken by someone in Apple
supply chain they show an 18 watt fast
charger with a USB C port and it's not
the only one of its kind a few weeks
back charger Labs published these
renders of a USB C to lightning charger
with a slightly different design the
best news about these leaks is that they
both claim Apple would include this fast
charger in the box of its new iPhones a
standard for many flagship Android
devices that has yet to make it to the
iPhone Apple gave the iPhone 8 8 plus
and 10 fast charging powers but then
failed to include the tools to take
advantage of this inside the box instead
you had to purchase the fast charge wall
adapter and cable separately adding at
least $70 to your already insane bill
six years after its original launch maps
still struggles to keep up with Google
Maps and ways and shake off that bad rap
it accumulated when it first launched
but that's not stopping Apple according
to TechCrunch Apple has been busy
building its maps from the ground up
deploying thousands of high-tech bands
to trace every last corner of the
country the results of this four year
effort will come in iOS 12 starting with
northern California and then continues
to roll out to the rest of the country
within a year or so map users all five
of you can expect more details and maps
and faster updates for roadway closures
and construction features already found
in Google Maps except Apple would
prioritize privacy according to the
company it will still collect data but
anonymously and it won't link your
preferences to your Apple ID outside of
your phone enough to sway me to dust off
the app and give it another shot
I don't know all right but seriously
would you get Apple Maps a second chance
if it offered better privacy features
