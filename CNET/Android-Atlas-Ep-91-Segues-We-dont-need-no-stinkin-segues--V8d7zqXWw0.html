Stewart that'll still be on yeah i'll
still be on no but is gonna actually
gonna have Conan O'Brien on it now so
that's that's just a big change there
right on um I don't know if you guys
knew that breaking news breaking news
from Android outlooks weekly yeah you
heard it here first anyway let's jump
right into this we have a new samsung
galaxy tab 7 that just came out yeah
yeah it's a it's the samsung galaxy
tab 7.7 is that right yes it is because
it has a seven point seven inch screen
now is that different from the previous
Samsung Galaxy seven was that was that
one the previous one was called the
samsung galaxy tab 7.0 plus and that was
follow-up to the century yeah it is
isn't it um it was a follow-up to the
samsung galaxy tab just tap which was
which had a 7-inch screen gosh basically
they Justin have a seven um number on
there yeah um so what do you think about
this new one it just came out when now
it came out like this is kind of funny
that it it came out the week the earlier
in the week that the ipad was released
so the ipad was least on a friday i
think it came online like a Tuesday you
guys member estroux or hey exactly oh
yeah I think it's I think it's kind of
weird that I think we got like two or
three tablets in that week that were new
I think like vendors were just waiting
for the ipad announcement was like all
right send it out you know this you know
she's kind of waiting to see what
Apple's going to do or their new tablet
before they release their tablet I think
that's something like that went on but
anyway I came out that week it's uh it's
one of its the first tab that I know of
with an AMOLED screen yeah has a seven
point seven inch AMOLED screen huh bring
it up here let's show it let's show it
off a little bit and show it off is cuz
kind of its kind of camel in now that
means a very bright yes well well it's
not necessarily what it means is it's
was it uh active matrix organic LED ya
light emitting diode wow you know from
that's what the tech heads tell me some
second you know that the lab guys in the
lab that's what they tell me when I go
in here and ask them what's going on um
yeah it's it's an AMOLED screen that
just means that the blacks get to true
black so there's no necessary there's no
backlight um it's just when you when you
look at a black screen and we do our
readings on the backswing it gets like
the black ski really really low and what
that what that offers you is this really
high contrast so the so the whites look
even brighter even though the brightness
isn't nearly as bright as other tablets
the white still look brighter because
that black Isola because the contrast is
so
rate this gives you this really poppy
color um like I said true black some
movies and games especially look really
nice on it okay so AMOLED means very
very bright no jmar messing things up
battery life on that thing just because
yeah the better life is actually really
good because of that lack of lack of
brightness like that the highest
brightness against is like 110 candelas
per meter square which is you know i'll
give you relative like the ipad gets to
like maybe 340 as far as the highest
brightness it can it can accomplish but
this one like it 110 so the brought the
the battery life doesn't suffer as a
result of you know high brightness which
which is the biggest drained the screen
is the biggest drain on a tablets
battery so that's how do you feel about
the size though because I played with
the original galaxy tab 7 or whatever it
was called yeah yeah and I felt like it
was just kind of like a big clunky phone
it wasn't a full-on tablet it didn't
feel like a tablet way I couldn't do
tablet II things on it sure what way
what a tablet tablet ething well I mean
it had like froyo on it I think oh yeah
you know what I mean well this one comes
with a honeycomb excuse me um is there a
cough button yes it's red okay right
there where is it right next to your
headphone jack l which uh let me try it
I'm gonna cough all right they do anyone
hear that that works well I'm in the
room with you so I heard that while not
you um so wait was I saying let's talk
about something I was talking about
galaxy tab yeah the size this is nice
yeah it's about what besides it's really
thin it's like the thinnest small small
form-factor tablet I've ever seen it's
really well-designed has this aluminum
back on here and for me I prefer 10-inch
tablets but what are you smiling at I
just never seen it yeah can I said okay
so uh for me I prefer tenish tablets but
a seven point seven inch or you know you
can round up to eight inch tablet feels
pretty good it doesn't feel like it's
constraining to any tablet things I
do on it like it's pretty good for for
playing some games like I played that
there's a riptide game on there and you
can play that you know it uses the
accelerometer um with a JavaScript or
whatever whichever one it is and uh it
feels right it feels right like I I find
it more awkward playing games like those
types of games they use accelerometer
gyroscope on a 10 inch iPad or a 10 inch
samsung galaxy tab 7 it just feels more
appropriate for that type of stuff right
so I mean there's definitely a market
for the seven point 7 inch tablet I
think so I think so the biggest problem
with this thing is that it they release
it to verizon so if you want to get it
you have a couple options first you can
buy it outright without you can go
through verizon but not sign up for to
your contract and get it for several
hundred bucks oh my god that's
ridiculous for a tablet as 8-inch tablet
that has 16 gigs of storage that's a
ridiculous proposition so you shouldn't
do that I hate that yes you should hate
that everyone at this table should hate
that you're cooling yu lin I hate it
especially okay guys drinking yeah she's
always drinking you know is coming a
problem in approps um or you could buy
it for 500 bucks if you suffer to your
contract which also don't recommend you
sign up for it to your contract with a
tablet this market is still in its
nascent form in my opinion and there's
no you you don't really know what the
tablet mark is gonna look like in a year
and you might be stuck with this thing a
year from now I mean it's a good tablet
but who knows what else is gonna be out
there a year from now so I don't
recommend set up a two-year contract but
if you have to sign up you're like I
really want 4g has 4g Verizon 4G LTE on
it I feel like I really want the 4g LTE
I don't wanna sign up a two-year
contract this would be the one tablet I
would be like okay go for it you know so
so bottom line it's a it's a great
tablet it's got a super bright screen
like you said Banda you're lying to our
readers it is not a super bright screen
but it has an AMOLED screen yeah which
means very sharp and very high quality
images yes um but it is very expensive
yes very expensive right so know that
going in anyway speaking of tablets
beautiful segue
actually thinking of tablets um there
are some rumors out there about a
possible launch of the Google Nexus
tablet which would be you know Google's
vanilla Android tablet people are saying
that it's going to come out at Google
i/o which is in June ok Google i/o
Developers Conference for for developers
google developers Google developer who
like to google right right so so tickets
went on sale yesterday and they sold out
in 30 minutes Wow which is I think a new
record as far as Google i/os go huh but
a lot of people are saying that it's
sold out so fast because they believe
these tablets will be given away for
free to people that go to that do you
know how much the tickets are to get in
I think there's something like 900 bucks
so you bind basically you're buying the
tap for 90 bucks yeah well I mean the
thing is a lot of people that go there
you know their their entrances it's
sponsored by their workplace right there
right it's completely paid for you know
where we had some people go there last
year they history we came back with the
Chromebooks they get in some people came
out with a galaxy tab 10.1 yeah yeah so
yeah so so this one's I mean people are
saying that the Galaxy Nexus is going to
come out of there and you know I i think
i agree with that i think it's gonna
come but what what like what do you what
are you pointing to like that that's
convincing you that it's actually gonna
be there well just basically what
happened last year and then sort of the
rumblings in the industry about rumors
going around yeah about a Galaxy Nexus
tablet coming out yeah have you heard
anything about a Galaxy Nexus I've only
heard rumors like you I heard that the a
sous a sous Nemo that was like our best
of CES tablet this year that uses a
Tegra 3 processor supposed to come out
for about 250 bucks I heard that Google
saw that saw that that tab was coming
out then went to a sooz and was like hey
why don't we turn this into the Galaxy
or the Nexus the google nexus and bring
it out for about 200 bucks yeah so yeah
actually I've heard that will be cool if
we can get a 7-inch Ice Cream Sandwich
Tegra 3 or better
tablet out there for two hundred bucks
that's pretty cool that's pretty awesome
yeah or i think was like 150 to 200
bucks wait if it's even lower that's
even better yeah I mean I'm just excited
about like a vanilla Android something
that you know Samsung doesn't slap its
own its own UI / right I'm excited about
that possibly slapping beans but yeah
like you say ICS tablet would be pretty
cool but one might be even cooler is a
jelly bean tablet oh man said way Segway
Charlie oh yeah you know what I'm saying
yeah wait a second Segway ever a knife
is pretty good awesome anyway jelly bean
people are saying that it might actually
be come pre-loaded with jelly bean and
jelly bean is the latest version or the
jelly bean is the rumored version of
Android after ice cream so five point
LOL i guess each I you see up yeah
android 5.0 yeah yeah I mean what what
confuses me about this is that very few
devices have ice cream sandwich on them
now and now we're already talking about
jelly bean which make them out in June
at Google i/o I mean how many phones are
running ICS right now yeah blend like
natively how many phones in one phone
huh so what I said no very many that
wasn't understanding yeah and we're
heading into April now on they're saying
third quarter maybe for this thing yeah
and I mean how many tablets are ready I
think I see ya maybe two maybe two yeah
two or three may be honest so three
devices are running ICS and then you do
you think Lynn do you feel like ice
cream sandwich has been a failure for
google I mean do you do you use it a lot
to you compare it to what was it guess
what gingerbread was before I think
they're only I think my only concern is
that they just need more ice cream
sandwich native Ice Cream Sandwich
devices and more updates I mean I don't
want to steal your segue but the next
thing I would talk about was the 18 th s
announced other devices getting ice
cream sandwich and it's about six or
seven or plus and everyone's really
excited but it's also kind of like why I
know when you develop you is you have to
kind of develop them months along so
it's not surprising that jelly bean is
oh yeah there I was thinking ahead i'm
sure they're thinking like two or three
versions ahead such a demand like all
these regions is saying we want ice
cream sandwich phones and we want ice
cream sandwich updates and no one's yeah
i mean totally google should be thinking
about and working on jellybean totally
right but i don't think they should be
necessarily giving it to us in June when
they haven't given us you know very many
ICS updates but but you did say that ATT
will be updating yeah there's gonna be
lots like would you say a slew a slew of
our your word a crapload a crapload of
devices everything but it's gonna be a
slew of eighteen t phones that will come
in the next few months and everyone's
kind of excited but also skeptical
because the one reader was like I'll see
it I'll know it when I see it or
something like that but what's that mean
I don't know I guess he wants to see
some phones get some ice cream sandwich
out in here oh he'll believe it when he
sees it okay so yeah it's films like LG
nitro Pantech Burst pantech element Evan
there's also the samsung galaxy tab so
that would be another tab that will have
ice cream sandwich yep and there's like
the galaxy s2 skyrocket and the Galaxy
Note well yeah I mean most of the tablet
vendors are yet salad vendors have been
saying that they're going to upgrade to
ice cream sandwich at some point like
this summer so maybe before jellybean
comes out we'll see so like early jump
to 10 devices like I don't know like I
don't know it yeah I just doesn't seem
like that's that large of a window to
get that in there mean if they feel like
ice cream sandwich is a failure for them
and they really want to move on to five
because man is really cool then do it
but I don't think it's a failure I like
ice cream sandwich I'm like it feels
yeah it's very very second which is what
really matters yes sexiness and
prettiness I don't think user experience
that matters which translates into
prettiness right right I agree so when
you're when you're dating someone what's
all about perience on her face yes
exactly that's what you're that's what
you're asking yeah I like where this is
going by the way yeah we're going to
talk about we're going to three
dimensions I was gonna say something
like speaking of breasts segues gay bar
can you take us to 3d thank you dating
speaking of dating LG and Samsung
are not dating but they're both talking
about 3d devices and I just wanted to
get your guys's take I mean we don't
have to talk about this exhaustively but
LG and Samsung basically they're both
saying that they believe in the 3d
format on phones or on mobile devices
you know whether that be through like a
lenticular lens which kind of refracts
the light I don't know what I'm talking
yeah look don't try to impress anyone
here well no you j ma you know whether
that be through you know special lens or
some other back-end technology they are
doubling i don't want to say doubling
down because that is kind of a big term
to be thrown around but they definitely
believe in it and they say they're going
to continue to develop 3d devices in the
future yeah have you used a 3d tablet
are there 3d tablets there aren't any
tablets with 3d screens there is one
tablet the LG t-mobile G slate that has
a 3d camera 3d camera that uses you know
the kind of the old of that name of the
term but the old red and blue glasses
with Captain EO style yeah exactly the
ad style 3d and wasn't very good as far
as a 3d good anybody purchased that
tablet I'll also no no no no one
purchase that to her jizz that tablet I
don't think it I haven't seen LG tablet
since then I don't think I don't think
about it yeah so I think it was very I
mean I know there's like the HTC EVO 3d
when that came out you know a lot of
people were kind of buzzing about it and
then but you know it's after that first
kind of you know initial buzz I I didn't
really hear much about it and just 3d
phones in general I haven't really heard
much about it so it's interesting to me
to hear that LG and Samsung really
believe in it and they yeah yeah sorry
there I'm Emma below Congress there was
a LG really um announced not announced
but um can I got I forgot who but he got
his hands on a 3d phone was the LG
optimus 3d max and he said it was pretty
cool ya know I guess Anna tell Jace I do
you believe in the 3d on the phones ok
no I kind of said to do you trust hence
word on things yes unless I think you
better say yeah he's watching he's
always watching on that note Kent is
peering through the window no he's me
but we are gonna take a quick break for
advertisers to do their thing or maybe
hello we are back hi ru hey Eric hey are
you doing good how you doing with I'm
good hey Linds gets creeps out she gets
creeped out by that voice so so next up
on her next up on our list of news we've
got however if you heard this stuff Lane
was talking about before the show oh my
not think of her insane anyway so next
up bluestacks have you heard of
BlueStacks I don't know that is what is
it let me explain things let me explain
it to you BlueStacks is virtualization
software that is a very long word hard
to say virtualization software for
windows why are we talking about that
Android outlets podcast well we tell me
that all you're talking about is why am
I talking about what because it allows
you to play android apps on your Windows
computer okay right I don't know if any
of you have heard but Windows 8 is kind
of out in beta yeah it's the real one is
coming out soon and it includes like a
metro touch interface and so yeah this
software will allow you to play your
your Android apps on their it comes with
like some patent pending technology that
you know optimizes that software for the
hardware in your computer it's called
layer cake some hardware graphics
acceleration was shown in last year's
alpha version now it's in beta and
anyone can download it yeah can't you
already do that through chrome the
chrome browser like play android games
amazes just certain android yeah well i
mean certain certain apps have been
developed for the chrome okay come are
they right i guess it was right she's
kind of weird cuz that's just another
fragmented yeah part of i see are you
saying this is uh these are necessary
developed for the chrome browser or
windows are all up for yeah they're just
videos and we can take an actual android
app yeah just play in there you can you
can play the games you can you know use
evernote things like that evernote would
you have a favorite app would you ever
use this no now I wouldn't on your
Windows computer
because I don't play any Android apps or
android games ever you know play any
Android um all I'm testing tablets I
mean I don't go home and be throwing
some Riptide right you know what about
Instagram mm-hmm I use Instagram on my
android phone which I don't have because
it doesn't exist no I use in second now
I use in semantics for a second I was
like doing any more how did you do what
did you get who do you who do you know
uh-huh bet I don't yeah i use it i use
Instagram of course yeah I don't use
Instagram that's because I'm a dedicated
Android user you knows the show's ending
right yeah who uses Instagram in this
room now you yes I do you do everyone
else what kind of an Instagram user are
you though are you like a heavy
instagram user you just kind of I don't
want to do it too much because I don't
want to you know fall into the
stereotype of the adolescent girl who
thinks that she's a photographer just
because she instagrammed like a picture
railroad tracks you're an adolescent
game hotel campus but I like to do it
when I don't have like my DSLR and I'm
out on vacation I just want to pretty up
my phones I mean my picture is sorry
tell us why it's nice because you know
there's another story that is coming to
Android very soon again last week we
talked about it coming soon but now it
is imminent it is it has changed levels
to imminent because is it they opened up
a sign of level is ready y open up a
sign up page I signed up for it I did
not get it yet you know i'm no one
special apparently why why do they even
have a sign up page for I think maybe
cuz it like crash the server if I want
dad was it yeah why can't ya that
doesn't make any sense angry birds came
out and no one had to sign up for that
yeah leasehold 10 million in three days
I don't just put it out and make people
tell people download it yeah no sign of
the other people will come what about
Instagram why why do I care about
Instagram is the thing I mean what does
it do that like another camera app
doesn't do um I don't I think there are
a couple of like Instagram clones on iOS
I don't know well I remember one thing
was like they always compared to
Instagram with hipstamatic and one thing
that they liked more about Instagram was
the social networking experience oh yeah
there's one which I completely ignore
and then it was free that's the other
thing cuz hipstamatic was like 99 cents
or whatever and then the other thing is
like you get it edit photos post so in
hipstamatic you have the the effect of
the pretty effect and the other
saturation was happening as you took the
picture which kind of made it hard to
gauge but Instagram like you do it you
take the picture first plainly and then
you edit it and I don't really like that
much you can do it at your leisure plus
like the 30 million plus users like you
said this social social thing is sharing
your photos to do making you look like
you're okay you can tweet and Facebook
from it too yeah you can like you know
yeah it's on you sold me i'm down to try
it's fun totally try it yeah i've signed
up win again it and you use a lot of
third-party photo editors and stuff like
to do your filters and so you know what
does that mean what do you mean like I
have other apps that will like put crazy
effects on my pictures i don't use
Instagram all the time to do that oh
right right so you don't have to
necessarily use the Instagram the facts
right so then once you you know beautify
your pictures in another app you can
then you can import shares your grandma
share yes something to do that some
people even take like really really nice
pictures on their SLR and then just take
load that somehow onto their phone and
then put it on Instagram because it's
also the community there yeah it's
really big okay so I mean for anyone
well said well said Lynn with a lot of
projects like New York Fashion Week they
signed up specifically with people using
Instagram just so that you could find it
that way it sounds it sounds sounds
exciting to me it's okay you don't have
to know it sounds exciting me I'm just
sour because I don't have it well that's
your own fault yeah but I would sign up
so anyone you know we wrote a story up
on it you can actually go to the
Instagram for Android site i'm not sure
exactly what the URL is on that it's
it's like Instagram / Andrew makes it
easy to him right the girl yeah and you
can sign up to be first in line for
Instagram on Android it's supposedly
better than the iOS version according to
yeah whatever
I'll believe it when I see it like my
one do didn't talk to him Jerry be
exactly the same well I'm I'll I'll be
here waiting one thing I'm not waiting
for though angry birds space because
that just came out whoa have you guys
played it whoa angry you're segways are
blowing mine blow minds being there very
corny what's a good things gonna throw
that out there have been melted yeah my
g-ma jiggly's but anyway I played angry
birds space hey guys have you guys heard
of angry birds I so maybe assumption
that you've heard of yeah so angry birds
what is that so then you are some kind
of an omniscient being looking upon
these birds who are angry at pigs you
want to use us to the pigs stole the
eggs of the birds Wow now you use a
gigantic slingshot to sling these birds
at the pigs effectively killing the pigs
all the point is to kill pigs point is
to kill pigs yeah but everybody knows
that angry birds is now in space yes yes
I'll take a moment to this is to let
that work that's it like because it's a
big mole that over for a bit yeah I mean
what what I found I played it on tablet
which is way better than playing it on a
phone because when I do my my sling
shotting I pull it all the way back yeah
yeah you see my hand anymore he does
asleep champion ladies when he does it
slingshotting that's what I'm saying no
idea yeah I don't talk about but yeah I
mean the thing that I found is that it's
not as intuitive as as the original just
because I've never been in space right
and I don't understand the physics
intuitively what I'm saying so what you
do you shoot you know you sling up a
bird at a pig who's on a gigantic planet
that blenheim ever but that planet's
gravity then affects the oh you know as
well of your rag right right think so
they have like each planet I guess has a
different attribute or gravitational
attribute or something like that right
that that is that what happens with
Jason showed it's um yeah a little bit
yeah yeah I think the bigger the planet
and it might have some stronger
right so is it more fun than angry birds
is does that dimension add up does that
add a large enough dimension that you
should be buying this thing well
androids is free Android it's free well
there's a free version there's also an
ad-free version okay for android phones
okay and then there's a there which
which costs money 99 cents i think and
then there's a 299 version for android
tablets which comes in HD but honestly
just get the free version if you have a
tablet cuz it looks exactly the same
right unless you really want to support
their developers which is fine but you
shouldn't do 19 I don't support them
don't support just kidding confused no
we have enough money um yeah so space 4
space it's well you asked me a question
the challenge yeah was kind of addicting
so that made it a little bit more fun
because let's be honest I was just
killing it on the original I want
original angry birds I was slinging pigs
like crazy you know okay could not last
five seconds when I'm on the board know
what I mean no I don't you mean I hear
you yeah well you won't know exactly
what I mean till you watch me playing
well you know we'll do that after this
okay good yeah I can't wait I'm about
apps if you haven't noticed I review
right and review apps I've noticed that
yeah so I actually have an app of the
week for this show all right even though
we just talked about apps yeah is that
you have for the rink week uh angry
birds it's not angry birds space oh but
it isn't it is another almost as popular
not quite as popular obviously because
angry birds is like you know yeah it's
huge wow it's big but it's a temple run
temple run anyone who uses an iphone or
you know an iPad they may have heard of
it because it is very popular oh it's
like pitfall from that picture that's
what that picture is kind of a pitfall I
mean they say it is dangerous Indiana
Jones like character but to be honest he
doesn't have a leather jacket he doesn't
have a hat yeah those were nothing like
Indiana Jones says he does have an idol
Idol in his hand is it looks rather
throw the idol at that bird though
that's my friend that my friend is a
monkey oh is that a female monkeys look
at my gym that is an evil masked monkey
butt but I mean if you haven't played
temple run yet if you haven't played
Temple Run it's one of those games where
you're
character is always center screen and he
just keeps running the perpetual runner
place like space harrier yeah yeah and
then you you can jump drankin you can
lean to the left to the right you can
slide it'sit's kind of addicting yeah
that you were talking about that early
before the show yeah you run into coins
you pick them up and then after that you
can buy things with these cool also can
you buy can use real money to buy coins
you can do that course you can do that
if you're if you're a child click your
parents credit cards adults and you
probably won't do that yeah that's
ridiculous that we will pay that kind of
money for that I don't I'll get it but
like I was actually before this isn't
like a real game though this is like a
this is like a use you know you go to
the washroom you know you spend you know
10 minutes in there you play some temple
run yeah you leave the washroom you
forget about temporal until you're in
the wash Megan right it's that type of
game is now I oh man the debt for this
game yeah I mean it's definitely not
like a colander story the story of
temple i by is he running so much
because these evil monkeys are chasing
him Lynn is that not obvious is there it
into the levels um I have yet to reach
an end to a level because I am no good
at this game but but it's very fun sure
man looks like it'd be fun yeah go ahead
read about it go to cnet com go to
download cnet com 8301 dash tooth just
go there and find what i wrote about it
because it's a very fun game okay it
looks like graphics are pretty good too
like no yeah they're really good I mean
no 64 I think it's actually one of the
first which is the high water bottle
Spartan yeah i mean what i was going to
say is i think it's one of the first
perpetual runners that's actually 3d
perspective like that's pretty cool it
looks exhausting so its way you don't
actually do the running Lynn huge I'm
like seriously running through this guy
than 6 i'm already feel like I just ran
two miles yeah a little sample yeah yeah
lyndz insane I love you guys same i also
don't work out ever have a lung capacity
of a three-year-old yeah i was gonna say
something about you've been out of shape
she's off thank you for saying it for
the camera on her she's very good 98
pounds of muscle you need hit the gym
need to lose some high exactly 90 pounds
to a yeah that's all I got as far as
after the week you don't have another
segue I like a second to nothing yeah
you know we do have eat an email though
at this part of the show I don't know if
you've ever watched Android atlas yeah
no I know that never I hate you guys but
but at this part of the show reasons do
you watch dialed in i watch it
religiously Oh think anyway onto the
email so this one is from Kevin in
melbourne australia he says hi team i
have finally taken the plunge and
switched from an iphone to a samsung
galaxy note that is a big switch that is
literally a big switch he goes to the
galaxy note which is like what is it
like seven hundred inches Lin 5.000%
know if I point something which is
pretty much seven hundred inches yeah
anyway he he says with his iphone with
my iphone i can customize which apps can
have access to my gps location i cannot
find this option with my android 2.3
gingerbread OS is this option available
upon downloading applications from the
google play shop the app will tell me it
wants to monitor my location but i
cannot deactivate this unless i delete
the app there is no option well well
right off the bat a nap before you
download it it tells you if it needs
your gps location and if you don't want
it to have your gps location then you
can choose not to download that app or
you can while after you've downloaded
that up you can turn off all of your gps
capabilities on your phone but that
would obviously debilitate you in a way
yeah but i did ask aunt goo who is one
of our experts on rooted phones and he
he did say thank you thank yous you guys
don't know anger I million you know anka
Antoine Antoine good oh yeah he does so
tight Thursday with me he does yeah like
you too and that's it yeah it is no
elaboration he doesn't he failed him
last week though yeah but now we're two
for one so he for totally forgot last
and then I had when I was like you know
where spoilers he's like today's not
thursday anyone can it be it's actually
pretty fun but my level of fun this is
not it's actually pretty fun guys thanks
i'm wearing a bow tie i'm also can I
jump in to know that I know that the
galaxy note is a 5.3 inch screen sorry
gonna look at so so in case you didn't
know that Kevin your galaxy note is five
point three inches and back to your
question back to your question um
Antoine did mention that if you have a
rooted phone there are actually apps
that you can download which allow you to
you know deny GPS access piecemeal you
know just app by app one of them is
called permissions denied so you can go
check that out if you have a rooted
phone or if you have a rooted phablet I
should call it because the galaxy note
is Gigantor yeah and I think that is our
last email that is our last long Kevin I
want it more want you to sit there and
read stuff where I look at it in it well
that was the only email that I was
capable of answering why is that a
previous not sure I'm very intelligent
