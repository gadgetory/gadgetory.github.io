we're inside a special Samsung booth to
showcase Samsung's
es 8000 series letv now the first thing
that's unique about this TV set is up
here on the top you'll notice you'll see
a camera it's the first time that
Samsung has included this and this is a
camera with a microphone sure you can
use it for Skype but you can also use it
for their smart interaction and that
includes turning on the TV using hand
motion gestures and face recognition so
what I want to try and do here this is a
prototype right now but we want to
showcase this off I'm gonna talk to the
TV that turned on and we'll talk about
some of the specs in a second alright
let's get this shot hi TV and there you
have it right the tv turns on with my
voice now let's talk about a little bit
about the design a really thin bezel one
of samsung's signatures is really their
design this specific TV series will come
range enos in a size from 40 inches as
high as 75 inches that's gonna depend on
your region it's a 1080p TV with 240
Hertz refresh rate also this will use
Samsung's 3d active glasses so this
supports 3d content as well
now we're also gonna keep on interacting
with this smart interaction because this
is really what makes the TV unique so
I'm gonna take a step back here and
let's just talk to it for a second
alright here we go hi TV alright so you
can see kind of that list of options on
the bottom that I used my voice some of
the cool things you can do is obviously
you can go channel up channel down
there's an IR blaster that's included
with the television set this acts as the
bridge between the microphone and your
controller so you can control this TV
with your voice to do volume up and
volume down now another really cool
thing about this television set in
addition to the voice recognition is
using hand gestures so I can wave at the
television set and use my hand to
navigate it this is either for web
browsing navigating through the menus
also you can do something like closing
your hand to turn the chant to move the
channels up move the channels down and
then hold with a closed fist to move the
channels up really rapidly because it's
you don't want to be squeezing your hand
the entire time over and over another
cool feature about this television set
is it also supports facial recognition
now what that does is
if you have people in your family mom
dad and kids you might have different
settings or different applications you
want them to access so it will detect
your face you can then create an account
and then log in with those specific
settings now the Samsung ES 8000 series
these will be released sometime in the
first quarter of 2012 there is no
pricing yet and we know there's our
large range of sizes but this is the
entry into the home consumer market
really taking voice control and facial
recognition and hand gestures to the
next level but there you have it first
look at the Samsung ES 8000 series</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
