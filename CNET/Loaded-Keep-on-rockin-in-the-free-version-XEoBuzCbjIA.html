Carey on cnet com and it's time to get
loaded Americans Spotify lovers can
continue to rock on with free music the
streaming music service announced it
will continue to offer a free version
with advertisements for users to listen
to unlimited music each month this
limitless streaming was supposed to just
last six months and be cut off in
January as a way to get new users hooked
the plan was to later limit the free to
just 10 hours a month but spot if I said
it plans to keep the free offering going
for an undefined amount of time there's
a new way to send cash to a friend the
makers of bump have released the bump
pay app for Apple devices so let's say
you owe a friend money for lunch each
person opens up the app fills in his or
her paypal account email and password
and with a bump of the phones one phone
can transfer money to another users can
choose how secure they want that app to
be either it will remember the users
paypal password or require it to be
entered for every transaction bump only
works with paypal but it has said it may
add other payment services in the future
if you want to try out Photoshop now is
the time adobe labs is offering a free
download of its latest photoshop program
cs6 it's a beta version for preview but
already has surpassed a half a million
downloads you can find it on download
com or the adobe labs website normally
this software starting price is 700
dollars and sure it's a marketing ploy
to get people hungry to upgrade to the
full version but Adobe hasn't released a
free preview since 2007 Apple CEO Tim
Cook paid a visit to a foxconn Factory
in China where I phones are manufactured
amid criticism of the working conditions
in its factories it's unclear how long
cooks trip to China will last but he has
toured a new constructed facility in
China that employs a hundred and twenty
thousand people and Apple said in a
statement that Cook is meeting with
government officials and there are
reports that he's been visiting the
offices of china mobile the world's
largest mobile carrier amazon kindle
fire owners will be seeing some
improvements in a new software update
one new feature in the tablet lets users
select
switches and quotes from ebooks and
share them with friends it also changed
its video rental rules now the rental
period starts as soon as you start
playing a video instead of when you
download the video and all documents
stored on the fire will get an automatic
backup to the Amazon Cloud Drive and in
other Amazon news James Cameron isn't
the only one making a splash in deep-sea
exploration amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said
his team of seafloor explorers have
found the Apollo 11 rockets that Neil
Armstrong used on his trip to the moon
40 years ago and now he's planning on
bringing those rockets to dry land to be
put in a museum those are your headlines
