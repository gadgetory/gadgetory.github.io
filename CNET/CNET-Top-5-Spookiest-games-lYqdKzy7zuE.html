at cranking out violent games just put
in a gun some guts some aliens to shoot
and call it a day but this Halloween if
you want some games that will have you
pausing and looking over your shoulder
every few minutes you've come to the
right place I'm Donnell Bell and in this
top five we're counting down these
spookiest games of the past year ranked
by cnet resident gaming guru Jeff
Bakalar starting things off at number
five state of decay here's an open-world
zombie survival game that feels like a
playable episode of the walking dead TV
series so I from the inherent spookiness
of zombies popping out from behind every
corner it's the human touch that draws
you in when you're not smashing in the
skulls of the undead you're making
alliances and fortifying your shelter
hoarding medicine or just cruising along
in a car enjoying the quiet almost too
quiet coming in at number four metro
last light five minutes with this game
and the idea of mowing down zombies in
the state of decay will feel as adorable
as feeding rainbows too baby pandas the
game is dark those psychologically and
literally you're shooting your way
through a post-apocalyptic earth where
survivors live in underground tunnels
you've got the human struggle against
famine and disease and Nazis and then
there's the oh my god I just crap the
couch struggle against monsters that
jump out of the shadows if you enjoy a
particularly bleak Eastern European
quality to your nightmares this game is
for you for something a little more
scenic you can try number three dead
space 3 you get to be terrified in outer
space on an ice planet and then
seemingly abandoned spaceships you get
the geek out and build your own
futuristic weapons from spare parts and
best of all you get a whole new thing to
be scared of Necromorphs part zombie
part alien and in the weightlessness of
space they can sneak up at you from any
direction and while it's true that in
space they can't hear you scream your
neighbor will probably have to wear
earplugs just to block out your
high-pitched nerd squeals at number 2
resident evil revelations
if space doesn't do it for you or
underground tunnels how about a boat
apparently that's where the bulk of this
mutant monster shoot-'em-up is based a
titanic like luxury cruise ship brimming
over with ugly infected mutants who just
love to pop out from behind those rusty
boiler room doors when you least expect
it along with the norovirus and motion
sickness here's one more reason I will
never set foot on a cruise ship all
right and now the number-one spookiest
game of the past year may surprise you
at number one limbo this little black
and white artsy indie game is like one
sustained childhood nightmare now a lot
of you will write this off the moment
you see the cute little silhouette of
the main character but it's a trick the
bond you feel with this little guy makes
it so much worse when you see them
staked and drowned and decapitated and
eviscerated set on fire shot with arrows
and pulverize more than anything though
this game is a great reminder that guns
and gore are really just the cheap way
out when it comes down to it with our
reptile brains fear most are those hazy
mysterious things that go bump in the
night limbo taps that nerve so perfectly
it will make your hair stand up so there
you go five games that fully deliver on
the promise of giving you the
heebie-jeebies another big thanks to see
NASA Jeff Bakalar for getting this list
together for more top 5s head over to
top 5 cnet com I'm Donald Bell thanks
for watching
