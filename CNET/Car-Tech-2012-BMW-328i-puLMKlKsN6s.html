it was a two-liter for guess what it is
again let's drive the 2012 328i and
check the tech I love the look of the
new three as I do the new five it
resembles heavily BMW has mostly shaken
off those bad days of some really ugly
cars and delivered a three that it once
presents both upscale and sporty now
let's get a look around the cabin of
this new three a couple of things will
stand out to you it's mostly familiar
but check out the screen that's
different it's not a pop-up it's not a
swivel up it's a different design you'll
see on just about any other car maker it
is a stand-up fixed sort of a sort of a
tablet now what is interesting about
this to me
it's still a widescreen still the same I
Drive interface but notice how high it
is the midline is actually at the top of
the gauges it's the highest thing in
terms of eye line in the car this seems
to dovetail nicely if only by sheer
coincidence with those new federal
guidelines that have been suggested
saying everything in the car
that is interface oriented should be as
high as possible on the eye line and as
centered as possible over the steering
yoke to keep that driver looking where
they're going this goes a long way to
get there
but here's what's really new connected
drive this gets us into a lot of stuff
first of all BMW apps that is a connect
to drive up you put on your iphone that
brings you Facebook Twitter web radio
streaming of kind of a generic sort it's
not Pandora it's not Spotify it's not
MOG and you've got plug-in technology
like iPod out which lets you connect
your iPhone for example here in the
cradle and get a really nice not exactly
faithful but very similar Apple like
interface for accessing it in here in
the console standard aux as well as the
USB for thumb drives and or iOS devices
there's the cradle of course where the
iPhone lives now all we also have on
this car a head-up display optionally
installed I can get my navigation
prompts I can get speed I can see media
info
Meishan I can see warning messages but
the state of the car the thing that's
interesting is in the website materials
and their promotional stuff they show
that being full-color
this one's just either white in the day
or orange at night not sure if I'm
missing something we recognize this
goofy looking BMW paddle shifter these
days it's all pretty standard stuff it
also gets over here to a gate for manual
shifting and right next to that are
those drive profile buttons but look how
they've changed now we've got Eco Pro
and then you've got comfort which is the
standard setting and then you've got
sport the eco ones the most interesting
this gets us Tennille chases you can set
speed warnings limits on speed that you
drive and also tell the climate control
to behave in a way that puts less drag
on the engine now this thing here it
shows your eco potential it's kind of
like what you've seen a lot of the Asian
cars where they'll let you grow leaves
or forward let you do that - as well as
Hyundai and then over here you've also
got sort of a dynamic current eco
driving bar graph at the bottom when
you're not an eco mode it goes to a more
conventional instantaneous MPG display
and finally we have efficient dynamics
that means that when you brake in this
car it helps to regen the battery
allowing the alternator to spend less
time dragging on the engine to regen the
battery and once we start driving you're
going to find out why I love this button
it became my best friend real fast this
is the one that turns off the automatic
start/stop technology okay here's where
things get really interesting on this
car we're back to a four cylinder on the
3-series this is a 2-liter turbo twin
power turbo means a single turbo charger
that's a twin scroll so it can work
optimized at different bands of the RPM
range direct injection that's all the
rage as well this is the combination of
tech that is making the gas engine a
rock star again here are the numbers 240
horse 260 Rorty foot-pounds of torque
it's this 3400 pound car 260 in a very
trim in tiny 5.7 seconds while
delivering 2430
six EPA estimates and one of the first
things you're going to notice when
you're driving this 328 with its
four-cylinder is the start/stop
technology not unheard of in German cars
these days but it was for the longest
time so I'm coming to a stop here and
the engine should shut down there it
goes
okay when it does that the car bucks
back and forth what the hell is that
then when I lift off it'll restart Rome
makes kind of this engine starting sound
and you'd say well sure it should make
an engine starting sound the engine is
starting the problem is I just drove the
Camry Hybrid a few days ago that also
has auto start/stop the difference is
you don't notice it it's quicker than
this quieter and smoother and that car
costs as little as half what this one
does depending on configuration so yeah
I got tired of that real quick and
that's why my best friend is the auto
start/stop off button on the plus side
the comfort mode is very nicely tuned in
terms of throttle response the way the
car behaves overall the whole powertrain
behavior becomes just where I would want
it for everyday driving and then when
you go to sport mode this guy's got some
guts that 260 foot-pounds of torque is
all there with very little turbo lag in
fact I'd almost say none this car stays
on cam really nicely for a turbo when
you do tap into the power of this engine
like this it's kind of a grindy sounding
affair put it this way and they're going
to hate to hear this and ain't no Audi
that smoothness isn't in this engine
it's not characteristic of a 3-series
which has become kind of a mid-level
very nice car finally that interface
screen the one right there in front of
you that is really outstanding ly well
engineered it's now in the periphery of
a proper driving view whereas to have
that a little lower a little more
central in the console takes it out of
your periphery that's a key step toward
reducing driver I off the road
distraction all right now at 2012 328i
this turbo 4 is gonna hit you about 36
bass and they go well up from there this
car is about 50 grand it doesn't even
have every option but here are the key
ones I look at the BMW apps that's two
hundred and fifty bucks if you've got an
iPhone you've got
to get that there's a tech package for
about 2,500 that's going to bring you
their excellent navigation system even
though I'm kind of cool on factory nap
and the head-up display which is done so
well</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
