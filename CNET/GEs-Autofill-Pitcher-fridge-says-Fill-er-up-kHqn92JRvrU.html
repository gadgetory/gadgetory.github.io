and boring but I think GE found an
opportunity to stand out it's the GE GA
s 18 PS j SS and on the outside it looks
like just another one of those boring
top freezers but inside its got a cool
feature that you won't find anywhere
else
that feature is right up here it's a
special dock where GE has rewired the
water line to come out and when I put
this water pitcher in place you can see
it automatically starts to fill up the
pitcher has a special built in floating
sensor there so when the water level
rises high enough up to the top it
automatically shuts off it works really
well and it's a useful thing if you
already keep a picture of filtered water
in your fridge now like I said you won't
find that special auto fill pitcher with
any other brand of fridges it's just in
this fridge and one other GE model so if
you like it that's a pretty compelling
reason to buy in however there are some
shortcomings with this fridge that might
make you want to think twice the design
looks nice with the sturdy stainless
steel build and you get a couple of nice
touches like spill proof shells inside
but all in all it's a pretty plain
looking fridge not unexpected in the top
freezer class the bigger concern is
performance it's really pretty mediocre
if you look at this heat map it keeps
the body of the fridge just barely below
that 40 degree orange danger zone but
the rest of the fridge is all running
pretty warm I think if I had this fridge
in my kitchen I would want to dial it a
little closer to that coldest setting to
help keep things nice and cold but that
would make it less efficient so not
ideal performance wise the other concern
for me is storage space this is only a
17 and a half cubic foot fridge and four
of those cubic feet go to the freezer so
that's 13.5 cubic feet in the actual
fridge compartment that is very low for
a top freezer model that costs around
$1000 also keep in mind that that
picture on the top shelf is taking up
space and space is a pretty valuable
commodity in this fridge if you have a
lot of mouths to feed if you tend to buy
a lot of groceries it might not be the
best one for you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
