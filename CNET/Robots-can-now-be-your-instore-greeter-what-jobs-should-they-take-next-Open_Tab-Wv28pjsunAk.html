customer man four foot for foot high but
it's not a four foot high customer oh no
no no no it's a four foot high customer
customer service it's not like a four
foot person who's really hot it knows
that stone for foot person let's just
get that out of the way ok so this
four-foot tall customer service robots
spent last week greeting customers at
the be eight ta Tek store in San
Francisco the robot is programmed to
talk with customers follow voice
commands and read human emotions to
judge how to react to bed every time I
look at this thing I want to run away in
fear so what's the deal with this robot
do we know anything more about it it I
don't like the way it looks it looks
like it's like scared of me and humans
and I would imagine walking into a
Walmart or summat department store and
this is who you'll see and this past
week in San Francisco that text or
that's what was happening so sure what
was the reaction like I know Lexi's
there what did she say about it uh but
the video I saw only explained it what
it does and that it's able to gauge
human reaction and so if you show up
really awkward is that this is gyrated
are presumably if it senses you're angry
maybe it'll dance to try to calm you
down or directly out of your I don't
know how I don't wind up kicking I once
worked at Macy's for holiday help yeah
and there were definitely a couple times
where you wanted a rowboat you wish I
could deal with people a robot could
have like I could have folded the
clothes when the robot would have talked
to a couple of people write the robots
got endless amounts of patient or the
other way around I guess that the robot
could fold the clothes and I could deal
with the people right okay all right
especially they like high stress levels
high stress high levels of stressful
holiday shopping right the UH but it's
interesting to see how more my robots
could take over jobs more anymore it's
interesting and I guess
cosmically depressing mmm because im sue
well not I know this is not a serious
show but I think like 15 20 years from
now we might be in a little bit of
trouble I blow I believe we had a
conversation prior to a starting where
maybe you would have liked to have had a
robot at the counter yeah yes exactly
maybe robot could work on the mail
that's failing yeah humans can't be
trusted sometimes robots got a bit maybe
robot would have known where your
package may be a robot would've lost my
package after I handed it to him on it
it yeah imagine telling a robot that it
will robot waiter waitress that it got
your order wrong I'm sorry the meat
isn't cooked well enough let me take it
back or just like allow me to zap it
with my break or something like that
that's a different future all right I
keep getting it mixed up yeah hey Mike
do you have any other comments in the
chat yeah if you do a little commenting
on the robot bryan said to remind some
of the Jetsons yeah Ozzy Scott you are
already out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
