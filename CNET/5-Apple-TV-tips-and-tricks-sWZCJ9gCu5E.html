learned a lot of new tricks here are
five tips and tricks to help you make
the most of the new software on Apple TV
if you have homekit enabled smart home
devices you can actually use your Apple
TV to control them just make sure you're
signed in to the same iCloud account in
the home app as you are on the Apple TV
and the Apple TV will automatically set
itself up as a smart home hub after it's
setup you can control your smart home
devices by holding the Siri button and
speaking a command say something like
turn on the lights this also works when
you're away from home
just hold the home button on an iPhone
or iPad and speak a command your Apple
TV back home will control your smart
home remotely
may have noticed after a recent update
that scrolling on to a text field with
Apple TV will trigger a notification on
iOS devices this is called the Apple
remote keyboard and it works with iOS
devices and Apple TVs signed in the same
Apple ID so long as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
are enabled to use the feature pull down
the notification and start typing on the
touchscreen of the connected device and
the text you type on your phone or
tablet will appear on the Apple TV when
you download a new application on your
iPhone that same application can be
automatically installed on your iPad
your Apple watch and in iMessage and
with TV OS 10 you can do the same thing
with your Apple TV this feature is not
enabled by default so if you want to use
it go to Settings apps and click
automatically install apps to toggle it
on also remember that this is not retro
actively installed apps if you have any
previously purchased apps that have
Apple TV components you will need to go
to the App Store and click on the
purchase tab to download previously
installed apps much like on iOS and Mac
OS the Photos app on Apple TV has been
updated to include memories this
memories feature gathers all the photos
from similar locations and dates and
bundles them into collections if you
click on one of these collections you
can revisit the trips you took
throughout the year in order for this
feature to work you will need to enable
iCloud photo library and iCloud settings
on your iOS devices and once all of your
photos have been uploaded memories will
do its magic in a recent update Apple
rolled out its new TV app which acts
like a guy for all your favorite
streaming services on Apple TV except
for Netflix when you log into your TV
provider in the Settings app any
compatible streaming apps that support
single sign-on will log you in then the
TV app will begin
tracking the shows you watch
automatically and you can find them in
the up next section of watch now as new
episodes become available they will jump
to the front of the queue for up next if
the TV app is tracking a show you no
longer want to watch you can remove it
and you can also manually add TV shows
and movies to your up next
