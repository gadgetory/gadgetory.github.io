your guest co-host this week welcome to
Casey and this is rumor has it the show
where we round up the week's biggest
tech rumors and vote on what sounds
legit and what seems like it will never
ever happen and remember that you can
vote on all of the rumors too so keep
your eye out for the pole in the
interactive player if you're watching on
cnet first up as you know the galaxy s4
is probably coming out this weekend
there are a million rumors out there
about what it will look like what
features it will have how much it will
cost I want to talk first about a big
rumor reported by the New York Times
which seems pretty great and is a
feature I think the device of may very
well have an unnamed source who claimed
to have used the phone told the times
that the s4 will have an eye-tracking
smart scroll feature so basically it'll
be a camera that will monitor and track
your eye movements when you're reading
and then the screen would automatically
scroll at your pace this sounds dubious
well it's simply a cool idea in theory I
just am NOT confident that samsung will
get it to work all that well but I do
think it will be part of the
announcement see I don't know I think
that it sounds too cool to be true which
I guess means that we have a game here
sir bring it next up at Mobile World
Congress Samsung and visa unveiled a
partnership Samsung would incorporate
visas payWave mobile payment
capabilities in its future devices
Samsung has been one of the leaders when
it comes to incorporating NFC tacking it
smartphones and with this new
partnership with visa well what could go
wrong well totally the problem is that
just because my phone has NFC and it's
linked to a Visa account doesn't mean
that businesses are adopting this
technology great so basically we're just
going to be at the front of the line
waving our smartphones around at nothing
exactly cool next up in analyst told
Reuters that the s4 will feature the new
bendable screen samsung showed off at
Mobile World Congress and had shown off
at CES for a few years except that it
won't because everything we know about
the development process for these bendy
phones indicates that nobody's figured
out how to make the rest of the phone
work with the bendable screen right
which is a shame because eventually we
want to be able to use our phones as
snap bracelets that is the dream now
this we're pretty sure that the s4 will
have colors why because Samsung itself
is teasing color variety and so on ad
featuring a little annoying rich boy
named Jeremy who tells his dog that the
secret Samsung thing in the box is quote
my favorite color and if we read into it
even further I think the phone comes in
red because of the end Jeremy's mother
puts aside his favorite tie to wear for
the launch event and it is wait for it
red boom for your big day big day big
day moving on images leaked on Monday of
what may be the s4 hiding in a Galaxy
Note 2's clothing photos obtained from
Chinese site 52 samsung show a device
which looks like a bigger s3 or the note
2 although it's kind of hard to tell how
big the phone is in the pictures so it's
possible that it's wearing dummy casing
to throw us off the scent the design
looks different to previous leaks which
have suggested a much square design and
smaller bezels above and below the
screen so this is an s3 and this is a
galaxy note 2 does it somewhere in
between there will it be as big as the
note 2 is this in fact a dummy case to
confuse all of you rumormongers out
there don't forget to vote and then
we'll see what the cnet council has to
say the cnet council is composed of five
editors who cast their votes anonymously
their opinions are not an endorsement by
cnet or CBS Interactive obviously
because these are rumors folks and the
cnet councils verdict is an almost
unanimous no only one lonely editor
thing is that the s4 will in fact look
like the note 2 that's our show
everybody please share your rumours that
rumor has it at cnet com or call us at 1
800 750 cnet and tweet us and thanks to
this week's co-host Casey Newton thanks
tune in next week for more tech rumors
