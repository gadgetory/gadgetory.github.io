Alfred Aang Samsung unpacked is tomorrow
and it seems like we've got a handle on
some of the big stories coming out
there's a lot of products to unpack here
haha
various leaks point have to at least a
mainline Galaxy S 10 phone a Galaxy S 10
Plus this rumored budget for the Galaxy
S 10 e we're hearing and potentially a
5g model and we'll probably hear more
about the the foldable phone which this
morning Evan blasts put on Twitter
saying it'll it'll likely be called the
Galaxy fold very creative it's
unfortunate that the foldable phone is
not the main event here I really wish
this was an event for that I I'm sure a
lot of people are more buzzed about the
foldable phone than they are about the
s10 itself considering all the leaks
that have happened yeah I think I think
you make a great point it's a little
weird that you know the foldable phone
will likely be jammed into the s10 event
because Samsung will obviously want you
to focus on the s10 and the phone that
you can buy now but I imagine a lot of
folks will be more captivated by the
foldable device yeah I mean everyone's
talking about foldable phones this year
this is like the big piece of gadget
innovation that everyone's been looking
for and to see it being tucked away and
this kind of event is kind of you know
discouraging for me but at the same time
I mean we'll we'll see how they
presented maybe it'll be there you know
one more thing maybe it'll be maybe it
will get the the kind of spotlight that
it deserves but you're right it's a
little weird they're jamming everything
in we've got rumors of wireless earbuds
as well there was a leak about their
smartwatches from from Friday
I mean it's they've got a really big
show coming up is Dec still a thing that
senseless decks is a thing okay I mean
what we don't know if they'll talk about
it tomorrow but the last several
presentations they Dex has made an
appearance yeah I'm curious cuz I
haven't seen any leaks for four decks or
anything like that but I I'm always
surprised when they bring it back is
like hey check out this thing that we're
really really into that no one uses but
Scott Stein big fan of Dex I loves using
it I mean I wish like
where people use it it seems cool but
you know for for that to be somewhere
like popular I don't I don't really see
people using it or anything like that
yeah that's definitely more of a of like
a workplace yeah type feature so it's
it's not it's not quite as sexy as are
there any rumored prices on this budget
phone yep like is it how is it like the
iPhone 10 are where the budget price is
750 no I mean there are a bunch of
prices floating out but it's I imagine
somewhat in life now the little bit less
than the the 10 are Samsung kind of
likes to keep parity with apples pricing
scheme so I don't see and this 5g
monitors is like 5 g 5g or is this like
it's 5 g LT yeah no I mean you know
Qualcomm and Samsung back in December
made a big deal of having one of if not
the first 5g phones
I think Samson is gonna do this right
this is gonna be a 5g device we've had
you know I talked with Verizon CEO who
you know who claims he's got the first
Samsung 5g phone this is likely it so if
you just sort of parse the warning
chances are this is a phone that will
have will be exclusively a verizon phone
for a couple of weeks months we don't
know and they don't it'll go to the
other characters and you've talked about
5 G's capabilities a lot you know people
using it to do like surgery with VR yeah
but something like that I mean is this
foam really gonna unlock those
capabilities or is this one of those
things where it's like everything is
just faster for no reason surgeons will
be able to perform their operations with
the phone I'm gonna be a little clunky
at first but 5g won't really make no
this is a taste of 5g presumably if
you're in the market to take advantage
of those 5g speeds your connection was
going to be blazingly fast but in terms
of all those big revolutions the big
stuff with 5g that's gonna come down
line yeah a taste of 5g sounds like the
worst Restaurant Week ever but I'm
looking forward to seeing it tomorrow
yeah for a full coverage on Samsung
tomorrow because I've seen it I'm Roger
Chang I'm out for dang thanks for
listening
it's got four stars of yep it's okay I'm
with Alfred on this one taste of 5g is a
terrible idea but then I've always hated
five g's we're on determined reasons you
order the food and then it comes out
like a year or two later so you just
gotta sit and then you get like some
appetizer that's not really we are
getting in some some deep concepts here
but a everybody out there still watching
and listening for whatever reason is
wrong with you thanks for joining us go
ahead and send in questions in comments
so we can keep the conversation going
a little bit of trivia today before we
move on to the rest of the show where we
take your questions today is the
nicolaus copernicus birthday yeah that's
kind of cool yeah and as a reminder
there will be no show tomorrow since
we're gonna be live covering Samsung's
unpacked so we'll see you again on
Thursday for regular 3:59 coverage so
anyways you guys can take the day off
tomorrow I mean come make sure to watch
the Samsung show but in the interim
let's go and take some questions and
comments from mass Killa 469 great name
get rid of the big speed button please
yeah we don't think that's probably
gonna happen yeah I imagine the big
speed button is is here to stay I mean
they really really want to use big feet
same reason they want you to use Dex I
mean Samsung just wants people to use
like there's content even though no
one's using at the time TouchWiz is
still a thing it's still the thing on
their devices yeah I guess they call it
touchwood I mean it's not TouchWiz it's
not as bad as it used to be sure sure it
used to be terrible
just wish you were able to get rid of at
least at least give me that option yeah
all right here's a great question from
our old friend Michael Brown do you
think Samsung has been the most
innovated company over Google and Apple
at scale ooh
that's a good question at scale I mean
yeah you can make the argument for it
I don't has a fair question though only
because like Samsung I mean are you
talking about just phones or are you
talking about if you're saying at scale
that would include like everything right
so that would include big TVs and I was
thinking when he meant at scale like
volume phones like sewing hundreds of
million
as opposed to like so Wow you know like
a nice player like an oboe or like a 1
plus yeah I mean yeah you can be like I
guess really there's only a couple
players like that right that you've got
Huawei Apple Samsung maybe LG no I mean
if we're talking about just phones I
still think Google it has been doing a
really great job the last like few years
since coming out the pixel I mean like
they like historically have not made
devices and then they come out with this
focus on software instead of hardware
and like their cameras are already like
some of the better cameras out there
without like medicine yeah that's true
the camera tech is hard to be for Google
I would say Samsung has an edge at least
in hardware the devices look great I
mean the the curved screens now this
foldable thing like if they're able to
actually execute upon it I mean you
could you can kind of give them a lot of
props for their ability to innovate yeah
I wouldn't say that that's Samsung doing
that though I mean isn't that like
what's that random Chinese company that
like came out was like we're the first
one yeah yeah they're the most
innovative well here's a thing it's so I
tried it and it does work it's like
awful is it it's not great yeah so
that's the thing we're we're still not
sure how the Samsung photo things gonna
actually yea work but then there was
Shara and Jessica dual quartz scoop over
the weekend with TCS yeah yeah there's a
watch they're not working on I mean
those those products aren't gonna be
coming out to at least next year mm-hmm
so they're yes the the scoop from Shara
was a was a nice piece that kind of
showed that everyone's doing phones but
Samsung's the first actually get it to
market in a bigger way yes there's the
the flex Python yes but that's actually
also not quite available yet you can
order it it's on sale technically didn't
show me try something at last year's CES
with that other foldable phone or a
little screens or something yeah they
well they try to pop out just yeah yeah
and then ZTE has that weird dual screw
down yes you're right there are a couple
others that they're trying this stuff at
I don't fit that scale but they're
definitely trying different things but
in terms of like innovating and making
like a polished product I think Samsung
yeah you could make an argument so
they've done a pretty good job with that
we have some questions and comments
regarding the design and over
ascetic of the new phones Ironhide said
that phone suck and ugly Zac boxer
though as a really good point says that
the pill shape notch on the new note is
hideous at least put it in the middle
instead of on the right I don't mind the
shape of it but symmetry come on Samsung
I imagine that's for a logistic purposes
he usually has to know the note rumored
he said the note but cut out okay well
look I mean the cut out that's rumored
for the s10 is the one that sort of kind
of floating there on the right or
something that's not a notch it's just
like kind of yeah I think that's what a
pill yeah yeah yeah I think that's what
they mean but I think the idea is like
instead of having it on the right like
they want to like get in the middle yeah
I don't know like I'm like looking at my
phone right now with the with the little
like notch there and I'm imagining if it
was in the middle I would kind of hate
that look even if it was symmetric yeah
also I feel like yeah maybe it's better
that way like if it's like it wouldn't
block like your time or anything like
that or like your notifications I don't
know yeah we'll see I will to see how
they actually implement that like if the
status bar is above the cutout I think
that's the general logic of companies
though is we don't care if you hate it
you get used to it kind of thing where
yeah I mean that's definitely been
apples yeah right yeah everyone hated
the notch and now everyone's copy yep
yep although a few companies are able to
can't do that right Apple was able to
shift the industry when Samsung went to
curved displays or like the curved edge
displays no one else decide to fall
right yeah but I still look at that
curved edge display and I just think you
know what is this like extra space for
nothing it just looks cool yeah
iconic Joseph asks do you think that the
Galaxy S 10 will be more expensive in
terms of retail price and will the
retail price of the S 10 be retail
retailing more than the original s9
price oh good question I'm not entirely
sure but the fact that there is a budget
like a rumor budget model suggests that
the prices are probably prices for like
the main line phones are probably gonna
be a little bit higher I imagine like
the plus will be higher if
they could be around the same level they
were pretty expensive last year the plus
it's a top tier right yeah the plus is
top tier well there's a beef there's
also the rumored 5g phone which would
probably be more expense I am so mad at
this industry trend of every phone
getting more and more expensive people
just go out and buy it and it doesn't
stop them because like people are paying
for it you know they're just gonna keep
raising the prices stop buying really
expensive phones and ruining at first
cheap wads that budget phone is not
gonna be cheap I'm like willing to bet
on that sheep is yeah it's gonna be
somewhere like the $700 range I'm sure
yeah what you think it's cheap anymore
though yeah I hate everything there you
go
all right more questions hang on I'm
digging them up right now Mohit Bansal
says what is expected from samsung's new
rumored OS oh they showed off the OS
during their developer conference I mean
it just seems like it's a little bit
more streamlined so hopefully not
TouchWiz esque but yeah well we haven't
really had a chance to get like a I
haven't had a chance to get that
hands-on so I can't really all bixby all
the time baby let's go every button is a
Bixby button now the entire screen is
just a giant every time you touch it
Bixby's like hello how can I help you
hunter Lee asks will there be any other
design compromises with the budget
version oh it's I mean you look up the
rumor roundup in terms of I think it's I
would imagine things like camera memory
the you know there's certain
configurations that are available to you
and the higher end specs the easy places
to kind of cut the corners on it but as
far as design and look go they're pretty
uniform yeah I'd imagine aesthetically
it's gonna look very similar uh here's a
really fun one one night tonight asks
how much to repair that folding screen
I'm interested in this too just because
the one thing I noticed in some of the
demo videos of the concept and all that
we've got floating around when they fold
it if somebody touches the screen it
still messes with the UI there's no
disconnect there so you could
accidentally tap something activate
something yeah and that's one of the
things I hate most about my edge-to-edge
screen phones I've know where to safely
put my fingers you know like to handle
the thing what happens if you start like
activating crap accidentally locked the
phone
you know what if they sell phone cases
to like block out that area so you can
put your hands there you get like a
little finger tab thing you have to put
on nullifies your finger so it can't
feel it so it's like a dead space so be
so awful but yeah it's great Samsung
accessory right now $19.99 no I look I
would say the in terms of like the
repair ability of these things I think
that's gonna be a real issue a real
question most of the handset makers I've
talked to still haven't really got a
handle on the wear and tear samsung says
they've got you know special proprietary
technology that allows their device to
fold and been thousands of times without
that kind of wear and tear issue but
it's gonna be it's gonna be a challenge
the particular because at least the
concept they showed off the screen folds
inward mmm like a clamshell and from
everything I've heard that because the
radius of that is tighter than say the
screen being on the outside that is
there's a lot more wear and tear
possibilities so I mean we're not gonna
know for a while whether or not these
break down but it's definitely something
I that's that's a question for me that
that and I'm pretty sure the replacement
material for a lot of like repair shops
yeah like that is not going something
easy to get your hands on especially
like that type of class that they've
been experimenting with I mean right now
like if you try to get your phone at
least for me my phone screen repair was
like 80 bucks right it was like a static
screen you know for that kind of
material I imagine it'd definitely be
more than that I mean it's probably most
things where you have to send it back to
them right yeah it's not you just can't
go to a repair store and get that thing
fixed anyway let's take a leak for a
second do you think that the leaks have
ruined the excitement of new products
that's from Kenneth Timothy branches off
says why are we still surprised by the
leaks before the phones announcements
nowadays you know it's their marketing
department that's leaking it just to
drive up the height some of it is some
of it I think is incompetence you know
and some of it is just you know
journalists and bloggers like doing
their jobs and and uncovering stuff that
they you know that Samsung didn't really
want them to uncover yes I would say
that does suck out some surprise
I would imagine given just how
jam-packed this shows is shaping up to
be there's gonna be a lot to it and I
think even if you've seen the products
you know and these screen caps you mean
if you've seen the leaks getting the
full story game the context behind some
of these products is just as important I
I disagree with the getting rid of the
excitement part of it like leaks was I
feel like more devices should go through
with this kind of strategy that like
video game companies do a lot where it's
like you know short updates every few
months like what Nintendo did with like
Super Smash Brothers right where I think
that like by providing more information
as it gets closer to the release date
like you actually build up excitement
that way as opposed to you know
everything just coming on like one day
all right well yeah
the third point and these leaks have
actually helped me build up excitement
for the s-10 because it's like oh cool
they have like this feature in this
feature and this feature which I haven't
seen before okay so there you go I only
trickle more thing else it definitely
helps Samsung stay in the news yeah like
if there was nothing else you know we'd
have there'd be preview storage or
whatever but the fact that these leaks
have come out in a fairly consistent
flow I'm sure some of it is is marketing
controlled but some of it is again
incompetence but either way it sort of
helps Samsung stay in the news cycle
here's a question coming in from Brian
that's me you say that the show's gonna
be jam-packed we have an idea what the
rough run time is gonna be considering
I'm gonna have to camp here and push
buttons for like four hours
oh I don't know these things usually go
about an hour
I'm guessing this one will be like 90
minutes or so okay that's a fair
assumption
back onto leaks mark dybul asks have any
leaks resulted in legal action none that
I'm aware of has anyone tried it alone
not just Samsung you like in general
yeah yeah I mean I know there were leaks
what was it take two didn't they thin
they sued they suit some this is a video
game leaked though I forget which UK
publication like released information on
a rockstar Rockstar yes not take too
doesn't take two : rocks that could be
out on them anyway I did I mean I know
that happened in the video game world
just last year which is kind of bad
precedent generally I would say it's
pretty rare unless it's something really
egregious but I think for the for the
consumer electronic company trying to
try to sue a news outlet it just it's
bad it's just gonna blow up in their
face actually if it's true information
yeah right I mean they I mean the the
Rockstar case that I mean it was it was
true right they got proprietary
information ahead of time it's just in
general its it sets a bad precedent
in terms of freedom of speech and it's
really just bad PR for a company to go
after a news outlet for reporting the
news so regardless of the circumstances
behind it so we don't see a lot of that
coming in from mouse' sefar do you think
they will go with a 4k resolution
display ooh my guess is no but then he
asks why not
well 4k really works well if you've got
a big display if you've got a look at a
tiny one the the benefits are pretty
minimal for the costs are putting in to
to have a 4k display I know Sony does
this with some of their phones but you
know they they really push 4k across a
whole library of product so it kind of
makes sense but I don't know why would
need it though to watch the 3:59 in 4k
on your mobile device
all right I really actually would prefer
they watch it in low res then over 4k
cuz you can see all that we don't do
anything here's no makeup this is all
natural better worse so this is the real
3:59 no res please okay we got just
enough time for a couple more questions
Michael Brown hey Roger
what would it take for you to switch to
a Samsung phone take a lot of like am i
I did actually have this thing I had a
Samsung phone I had a s6 edge and it
wasn't the greatest experience so I've
kind of opted away from using Samsung
phones they're fine hardware wise are
great software wise I think I before
prefer a cleaner Android experience like
something you'd find on a pixel or even
a one plus you know I like the hardware
just sometimes the the software are you
only using iPhones now no I've got a
white console yeah I was wondering what
your wait seriously running free at the
same time like not right now but yeah
usually Jesus all right
let's take a couple more if you're to
pinpoint the reason behind smartphone
prices rising who would you say is truly
at fault here
Apple yep now you've got it yeah it's
definitely Apple Apple came out and
Samsung said well if you're opening the
door that we're just getting again I
mean like think about before the the 10
was announced there all these articles
on the rumored pricing you know Apple is
gonna sell a thousand dollar phone and
then all these annals like no one's
gonna buy that it's gonna pay them and
then their earnings came in is like Oh
everyone is behind that and then you
know that's when it really like started
skyrocket I mean look there is also
something we said about the more
sophisticated equipment being thrown
these devices you know Samsung is
rumored to have this ultrasonic
fingerprint sensor obviously with Apple
there's a face ID although the infrared
camera that technology at least
initially it was expensive but maybe
have just opposed justified some of that
price point but now it's at this point
Apple's open that door and everyone's
just taking advantage when we see the S
10 come out how much do we think the
note 9 is gonna drop oh um they're gonna
drop by that much like their old models
yeah I mean I imagine they'll be deals
yes like 100 or like $50 yeah well I
think it's especially for the note 9 and
for the note line like you kinda have to
wait for that note cycle yeah and before
you get the discount they're like I'd
imagine the GS 9 will get a decent
discount in their coming months but the
note I just came out of the summer
and/or the fall and you know it's it's
still several months before we get a new
note
okay we're closing in on the end here
from Mohit is this the right time to
upgrade to a new phone seeing that there
are so many new design upgrades
especially in the last year when we went
to from the knotch or to the notch from
the slider what if I invest now and it
immediately becomes outdated I feel like
that's the
question of the decade right now with
the way everything is gone I think if
you think like that then you're never
gonna update your phone just because
yeah there's always gonna be some new
thing that comes out within the next
like four or five months I mean
especially if you're an Android fan
there's just a new better phone out
seemingly every other month so you know
after a Mobile World Congress is sort of
a good time because at least you get a
sense of what some of the flagship
devices are but keep in mind you know
always launching their phone after
Mobile World Congress you know one plus
usually has their event a little bit
later in the the year so you know it's
like I said at some point you just have
to make a decision on the phone you want
to buy you just have to be aware that
like a newer better phone is gonna come
right around the corner how does it feel
like it depends on like when the last
time you upgraded was like if the last
time you upgraded your phone was like
four months ago yeah this is not a good
time don't do that why why I have an
upgrade in my phone since the s7 so like
I'm you know pretty much in position to
like get a new phone now so yeah it
really is all about timing and what
you're looking for
I implore you to adapt my philosophy
which is to wait until the device you
have starts belching fire and then throw
a dart at whatever is currently out on
the market and then wait till the next
time it belches fire you literally did
that yeah like that's not a joke no I'm
not exaggerating in the least okay we
got time for just one more
mohit asks is buying 5g actually useful
and let's go ahead and take that from
the perspective of a consumer um I had
like five five g's please I would say at
least this year it's gonna be mile your
mileage may vary it really depends on
whether or not you're in one of those
initial 5g markets because the rollouts
gonna be kind of slow and it's gonna be
selective and even if your market has 5g
your particular neighborhood may not
have it so
but 5g is great to have for early
adopters and folks who want to be on the
cutting edge but just keep in mind that
like it's gonna be buggy it's gonna be
buggy it's gonna be spotty it'll be like
one four
kind of rolled out initially it's it's
not everywhere there are issues with I
suspect there will be issues with size
with battery with keeping a connection
to 5g and so it's the early experience
may not be as smooth as you you know
you've had with 4G LTE early adopting is
always a roll of the dice but without
you early adopters the rest of us don't
get to reap the benefits so thank you
for that let's read our reviews on it or
that there you go that's probably a
better answer frankly and ingredie net
reviews and in closing thoughts this is
a bit off topic but I thought this is a
nice one to go off go out on Michael
Brown asked uh what does Roger and
Alfred enjoy most about doing the 359
show whoa
well obviously taking quite meta you
guys yeah that's my favorite part too
and all in all seriously I don't know
what's your favorite part Alfred I like
going back after the show and just like
doing like mashups and like cuts of me
and saying like ridiculous things have a
lot of water this shows all about me
basically so I'm looking forward to
seeing like fan versions of it sometimes
where it makes me say things that I've
definitely never said oh my god that's a
challenge get out there plenty about
from clips to work with definitely but
as we mentioned before no show tomorrow
but make sure to stay tuned to see net
for the Samsung unpacked live coverage
thank you for joining us today we'll see
you back here for the 359 on Thursday
Roger the 39 is available in iTunes tuna
