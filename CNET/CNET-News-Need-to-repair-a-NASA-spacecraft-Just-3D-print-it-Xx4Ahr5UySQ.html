after all it is rocket science to help
with the design process NASA is
borrowing from a popular tech trend
space shop is our attempt to take the
best practices and lessons learn from
what we call the maker community trying
to take that spirit of entrepreneurship
and bring it into NASA space shop is a
newly opened workshop for engineers at
NASA Ames Research Center filled with
state-of-the-art equipment there's a
laser cutter for sheet metal in wood
allows us to rapidly cut very complex
geometric shapes we've got the
traditional drill presses and band saws
and all the other things you would
expect in kind of a high school class
machine shop and a few things you
wouldn't expect like these 3d printers
which engineers can use to improve their
designs if being on a television or a
computer monitor is one thing but seeing
it in real life and seeing how its put
together really can be highly impactful
to the design and help us make it better
cheaper more efficient than you
otherwise would the tech holds so much
potential that nASA has commissioned a
company to build a 3d printer that can
be launched into space if you're going
to explore Mars or work on station or
just go somewhere far out on the planet
Earth you need to bring your own
materials then you really create a
sustainable method of constructing a new
habitat a brave new world where you can
just print what you need when you need
it in Mountain View California I'm Sumi
