world in VR video video that you can
step inside of and make it available to
everyone has three parts a camera rig
very specialized geometry an assembler
which turns raw footage into VR video
and a player sort of the camera so the
rigs that we've built they include 16
camera modules mounted in a circular
array you can actually use off-the-shelf
cameras for this if you want and you can
make the array out of basically any
material we made one out of 3d printed
plastic one out of machine metal and for
good measure of course we also made one
out of cardboard what's critical is the
actual geometry and we spent a lot of
time optimizing everything the size of
the rig the number and placement of the
cameras their field of view relative
overlap every last detail now what we
want to do is share what we've learned
with everyone so just like we did with
cardboard we're going to be opening up
the camera geometry with plans available
to everyone this summer so anyone who's
motivated will be able to build a jump
ready camera and today I'm excited to
announce that GoPro plans to build and
sell a jump ready 360-degree camera
array and they're bringing their camera
expertise to the jump Ready rig which
will include shared camera settings
frame level synchronization and other
features that will allow all 16 cameras
to operate as one next up it's what we
call the assembler and this is where the
Google magic really begins the assembler
takes 16 different video feeds and uses
a combination of computational
photography computer vision and a whole
lot of computers to recreate the scene
as viewed from thousands of in-between
viewpoints everywhere along the
circumference of the camera ring and we
then use these in between viewpoints to
synthesize the final imagery
stereoscopic VR video now assembling
footage like this takes thousands of
computers and we want to make this
processing power broadly available so
how are we going to make it so that
anyone can experience it starting the
summer YouTube will support jump so if
you want to experience vr video all you
need is the YouTube app you're
art phone and some cardboard</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
