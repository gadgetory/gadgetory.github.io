with cnet.com and I'm behind the wheel
of the 2013 BMW x1 xdrive28i now that's
a mouthful but I'm not here to talk
about the engine or actually the rest of
the car what I want to talk about today
is the infotainment system and
specifically the radio preset buttons
now before you go rolling your eyes
about presets I know they've been around
for about as long as radios have the
preset buttons in this vehicle have some
pretty interesting functions that I'd
like to show you today now for purposes
of today's demonstration most of what
will be happening will be visible on the
screen but off screen I'll be touching
these preset buttons down here they're
interesting because they actually have
sort of a hover over function that gives
you the ability to just sort of touch
them without actually depressing them
and still have something register up on
the screen it's gonna come in handy in
just a second now back here on the
screen you can see we've got the map up
we've also got a split screen thing
happening here showing us what audio
source were listening to right now it
happens to be a Sirius XM satellite
radio station but if I just hover over
the buttons like I said I would a second
ago
you can see at the top screen there's a
top of screen of the status bar it shows
up that shows you what preset is stored
underneath that button so you don't have
to go clicking around you can just kind
of hover over find the preset that
you're looking for hit that button and
you're ready to go but it doesn't stop
there if I just tap the media button
here I can jump over to the hard drive
that's actually stored inside of the
BMW's dashboard and from this menu I can
actually see a couple of playlists of
rip CDs that I've got stored here now if
I select this album for example and hold
down a preset button I can store that
playlist right there with the presets
alongside my radio stations now from
driving along and I want to hear this
album I just tap the appropriate button
and it starts playing but it doesn't
stop there either
now I've jumped over into the phone menu
and I've selected a contact here Optimus
Prime he's a really good friend of mine
and if I want to I can again hold down a
preset button and store that phone
number under
pre-set as well now if I'm driving along
and decide I want to say something to
the leader of the Autobots I just tap
that button and the hands-free calling
system automatically starts calling him
it's a really cool way to not have to
deal with a long list of contacts if you
only really talked to a couple of people
now I've jumped over into the navigation
section again to search for a
destination and we've got this kind of
cool knob thing happening here but you
don't want to fiddle around with that
while you're driving so I've taken the
liberty of selecting one of my favorite
restaurants in the Bay Area and just
like with the radio stations
I can select a preset by hovering my
finger over it and then holding down the
button to save that destination into the
preset button now just like with the
radio presets and the music presets and
the phone presets I can find that
destination tap the button and
automatically start routing to the
destination the highlighted route now
the beauty of this system is that pretty
much anything you see on the screen and
would navigate to normally using your
voice commands or your rotary controller
you can also use a preset for now if
you're the kind of person that just
really likes to spend a lot of time
looking at the trip computer in your car
you can actually pop back into the menu
select the trip computer option let's
save it to a preset now let's say for
example you're driving around you just
want to get a pretty quick idea of
what's going on with your fuel economy
boom I'm Ashwin Goodwin witthe Netcom
and I've been sitting behind the wheel
of the 2013 BMW x1 xdrive28i showing you
how the radio preset buttons work</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
