welcome to tomorrow daily the best talk
show in the known universe
I'm your host Jeff kanata and you are
watching one of our mini episodes on
Thursdays we deep dive into these
stories so be sure to check back then
for our longer show but right now let's
get into the headlines Amazon has a new
video demonstrating their updated drone
delivery prototype and they got Jeremy
Clarkson formerly of Top Gear to help
show it off Clarkson sets the stage
telling the story of a future little
girl who needs a new pair of soccer
shoes her family places an order on
Amazon and over at the local warehouse a
robotic arm loads up the package into
the drones fuselage for safekeeping the
drone then takes off vertically and
after reaching a certain height switches
to a more plane like mode the video also
describes sense and avoid tech on board
to make sure the drone doesn't hit
anything and multiple designs for
varying types of environments so your
precious cargo isn't ruined by a little
bit of rain or heat a landing pad placed
by the customer tells the drone where to
land and can be rolled up and stored
when the drone heads back to Amazon's
warehouse but a big piece of that puzzle
is the US Federal Aviation
Administration deciding exactly how it
will regulate unmanned aircraft for
retail companies I love this idea I'm
ready for this but can you imagine a sky
full of drones it will blot out the Sun
then we will shop in the shade it's
being of shopping
do you have 60,000 bucks lying around
then I got a deal for you that's how
much Nokia's ozo camera will cost if you
want to take one home that's right Nokia
is officially in the VR game with its
360 degree camera it's an orb shaped
device with eight cameras onboard which
record stereoscopic 3d video while
integrated microphones simultaneously
capture spatial audio Nokia hopes the
device will be a boon for them on the
film and gaming front giving filmmakers
and game developers the opportunity to
create
high-quality content that can be viewed
in various VR headsets it's a big bet
for Nokia especially considering
flagship headsets like the HTC vive and
the oculus rift haven't hit retail
shelves yet but they seem pretty
confident the ozo is worth Creators time
the big competition for Nokia is GoPros
collaborative effort with Google The
Odyssey which has 16 GoPro action
cameras and is part of Google's jump
hardware and software suite also it
doesn't hurt that it costs a quarter of
what the ozo cost and only $15,000 that
definitely sounds like a lot for
consumers like you and me but in
comparison to something like the red
camera it's actually right in the same
ballpark so we'll see if this catches on
now it's time to talk about Holograms
touchable Holograms according to Reuters
Japanese researchers at the tzunami a--
university center for optical research
and education have unveiled what they're
calling fairy lights the system uses
femtosecond laser technology to fire
ultra quick high frequency pulses in a
specific shape those laser pulses can be
interrupted by touch so when a person
interacts with the shape it changes
before touchable Holograms used laser
beams that scorched a user's skin ouch
but now the laser they're using is safe
to interact with the lead researcher on
the project thinks the tech could be
used for a variety of industries like
entertainment architecture and medicine
currently the Holograms are very small
but the team appears to want to scale
the size of the laser used and the space
it's utilized in overtime
science website pulse headlines
mentioned the possibility of a be mobile
hologram keyboard and also video where
the people communicating could
experience their touch we all know which
industry is gonna run with that idea
right greeting cards you perverts come
on get your mind out of the gutter
speaking of entertainment it's Tuesday
so it's time for new releases
the videogame releases just keep on
coming including Just Cause 3 just cause
is the new game from Avalanche Studios
about chaos on a grand scale blowing
