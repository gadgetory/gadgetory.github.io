your internet connection and share it
wirelessly but there always seems to be
one or two rooms in your home that don't
get great Wi-Fi reception I'm gonna show
you two inexpensive ways to get your
internet spread across your home the
simplest one-stop solution is a wireless
range extender I got this one from
tp-link for about $30 online it may look
like an air freshener but what it really
does is act as a relay for your Wi-Fi
router we broadcast a signal and rooms
in your home that aren't getting great
reception here's how to set it up first
find your Wi-Fi router and plug the
extender in to a nearby location next
find the WPS button on your router WPS
stands for Wi-Fi Protected setup and
it's an easy way for routers to pass
along their login information to other
devices automatically press the button
until it registers then then go back
over to the extender and press the
button on the front after a minute your
router and extender will find each other
and perform a little virtual handshake
you'll notice that when you can see the
rest of the lights on the extender all
lit up which indicate the signal
strength
now that the extender is configured to
act as an extension of your router it's
time to move it to another room plug it
in and after a minute you should see
everything light back up on the extender
and if you don't you might be too far
out of range for the extender to
communicate back to your router so try a
room that's slightly closer and see if
that does the trick to test it out take
out your phone or laptop and connect as
usual you'll see your Wi-Fi routers name
listed you'll select it and you're up
and running now in some unique cases a
Wi-Fi range extender might not be the
best solution maybe you're trying to get
internet out to a garage that's not even
attached to your home or you're trying
to get internet down to a basement that
seems to just block out any kind of
Wi-Fi reception in this case I would try
a powerline adapter these things work by
sending your wired internet connection
over the copper wiring in your home they
come in a pair and you plug one in your
router and run an Ethernet connection
from an available port on the back of
your router to the connection on the
adapter plug the second adapter into the
room where you need internet and you can
basically treat it like a wired Ethernet
or connect to it directly or set up
another router here to make it Wireless
so there you go two tricks for extending
the Internet to every corner of your
home</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
