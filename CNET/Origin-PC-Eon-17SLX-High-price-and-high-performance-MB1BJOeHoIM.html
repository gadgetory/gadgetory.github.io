look at the origin PC Aeon 17's LX now
all those random characters and letters
strung together means this is a big
17-inch gaming laptop pretty much the
kind that we don't see too much of these
days because everyone goes for thinner
slimmer ultrabook style systems even a
lot of the gaming laptops that we've
seen this year have been smaller more
portable 13 and 14 inch models there's
still room however for these big desktop
Busters this guy is huge
thick it's a big boxy black slab that
just sits on top of your desk now some
other companies like Alienware make big
gaming laptops that frankly look and
feel a little bit better because they
can afford to develop these custom
designs from the ground up a boutique PC
maker like origin PC they get kind of
off-the-shelf chezy's and they fill them
with their own parts and they do some
customization there's a custom a panel
which is the back of the lid and now
they have a backlit logo on the touchpad
here and some cool lights and everything
but I always get the feeling that let's
say like the keyboards for example are
not really custom built for gamers so
what you're really buying here and and
buying a certainly the right word
because things start to $2,000 but a
really nice configuration like this is
closer to 4500 which are really buying
is that expert construction would they
make all these high-end parts including
in this case a very high-end CPU and two
graphics cards together in an SLI
configuration they put all that in there
they tuned it well they tested and then
if you have a problem with your system I
feel very confident calling these guys
up and you're gonna get to talk to
somebody on the phone or online who's
actually a support expert and who knows
what they're talking about and if you're
investing this kind of money in a gaming
laptop you really want to feel that
comfort level that you're gonna be taken
care of if you ever have a problem the
17 inch screen it's a 1920 by 1080
screen
I like that Origen gives you a 45 day no
dead pixel guarantee by default and that
means if there any like dark spots or
light spots that are stuck or dead
pixels they'll replace that and that's
not something that happens too often but
again big investment you want to make
sure that's taken care of when we tested
games on here compared to the Alienware
18 which is an 18 inch laptop with a
very similar configuration same do a
video card slightly different CPU you
know
alien where did better in one game test
this did better the other game test but
pretty much you're looking at the top
level for laptop performance there no
matter which way you go if you built
your own gaming desktop yes you could do
better with performance but frankly I
think a laptop is a lot more flexible
even if it's one like this that's not
gonna move around all that often
especially because there's a price to
pay for all that power and that's your
battery life little more than two hours
on this guy and probably a lot less if
you're actually gaming on it with the
battery instead of just watching movies
like we do I'm Dan Ackerman and that is
the origin PC Eon 17s LX</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
