Note at 7:00
well Samsung hopes to wipe those
memories away with its new phone for
power users the Galaxy Note 8 and it
plans to do that by introducing
top-notch tech and tricks that you can't
do on any other phone using the dual
cameras on the back this is a first for
Samsung and the nodes trademark stylus
the note eights to 12 megapixel cameras
have a portrait mode that artfully blurs
the background this isn't new it's on
phones like the iPhone 7 plus but what
is new is that the note 8 goes a step
further and it also saves a wide-angle
version of the image so you get two
shots for the price of one and then
there's the S Pen Stylus which you use
to write draw and navigate around the
note 8 lets you write yourself a note on
the home screen this is called
off-screen memo and you can also pin it
to the home screen without ever
unlocking the phone if you remember this
from the note 7 before it was recalled
what's different is that you can now
make this up to a hundred sheets long
you can also use the stylus to create an
animated gif of a picture or word that
you can then share with your friends and
any app that supports gifts including
Facebook Messenger and whatsapp look
it's not essential but it's pretty fun
finally if you like using two apps at
the same time say YouTube and Google
Maps then you can ramp up your
multitasking by pairing the two together
you start from the app edge tab on the
side of the screen that's not all that
the Galaxy Note 8 is plying you with
it's also got an 8 megapixel selfie
camera with the usual filters and a high
resolution 6.3 inch screen there are
curving sides with barely a bezel and
Samsung's Bixby voice assistant that you
launched with that button on the side
the whole phone is water and dust
resistant to even the s-pen there's
wireless charging fast charging through
the USBC port a powerful processor and a
headphone jack that comes with a pair of
AKG earbuds in the box now the Galaxy
Note 8 runs Android nougat version 7.1
0.1 but Samsung says it will upgrade it
to the latest version later on all of
this sounds good but the biggest red
flag for the note 8 is that the
fingerprint reader is just like on the
galaxy s 8 to the far edge of the camera
array the note is a big phone which
makes this placement very awkward to the
unpracticed finger on the other hand the
iris scanner on the front is another
alternative if you own the note 7 which
was a really beautiful phone then the
note 8 looks and feels very familiar but
the battery on this model is actually
smaller which is good if it makes the
note 8
susceptible to exploding however apart
from the addition of a second camera on
the back and the Sears new stylist
tricks the note eight doesn't seem to
push too many boundaries especially
compared to the Galaxy s8 and si+ but
from what we've seen so far it has all
the ingredients to be Samsung's most
powerful capable phone for 2017
