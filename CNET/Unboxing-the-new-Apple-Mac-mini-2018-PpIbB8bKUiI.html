way to get into Mac OS the previous
version $4.99 the new version very
souped-up on the inside $7.99 they've
got the Mac Mini here and some of its
accessories let's open them up and see
what they look like obviously we're
gonna start with the main box here the
Mac Mini and I'm gonna very carefully
cut the plastic the Box style here is a
little bit different from Apple's
laptops and let's see does it slide out
does it open from the sides here it
comes
now I've got and there it is obviously
looks a lot like the previous Mac Mini
with the exception that it's now in
Space Gray which actually looks really
cool oh look there's a little protective
cover here over all the ports I'm gonna
peel that off and here's all of the
ports and connections
if you're a Mac fan and you want a lot
of ports and connections don't look at
the laptops anymore look to something
like this because we have got Ethernet
we've got four USB type-c Thunderbolt
ports we've got to traditional USB a
still alive and of course HDMI which is
super handy and a headphone jack
don't forget the headphone jack still
important and in the box we have also
got power cable black power cable not a
white one like you get with all the
macbook so that's interesting and no
power brick required it just plugs right
in and I have matching this Space Gray
Mac Mini a space great magic touch pad
and magic keyboard to go with it it's
even the magic keyboard with a
number-pad on it so that's gonna make a
really nice match set once I get them
all open
the Space Gray versions of these Apple
accessories were originally released
with the iMac Pro and they were not
available separately now they are after
people said these look so cool I wish I
could just get them for whatever my Mac
setup is our space grey magic keyboard
it's a wireless of course and connects
to charge and sync by a lightning and of
course the Magic Trackpad if you gave me
a choice between a Magic Mouse or any
Mouse with a Mac desktop and and the
standalone trackpad I would go with the
trackpad I find it's a lot more useful
you can do a lot of the multi-finger
gestures that you do on a macbook with
it and of course the trackpad works so
well on Apple laptops to have the same
ability on a desktop is great and again
you get a lightning to regular USB
connection on the back here that'll
charge it and of course you can set
these up as as wireless accessories or
you can leave them plugged in if they're
not charged so here's my super nice
Space Gray full Mac Mini setup all all
in matching space grey color and I'm
gonna show you just a quick comparison
right here I've actually got the last
Mac Mini right here in silver put them
side-by-side really for the most part
identical obviously the color is
different that too it shows you this is
the new version but the size works so
well for people and people have built
you know rack equipment around this that
they really did not want to change the
size and the shape so I'm gonna plug
this guy in boot it up and start
checking it out along with our MacBook
Air so I hope you come back and see us
later when we tell you all about how we
actually use these devices</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
