want to ASAP Apple just introduced its
new voice controlled speaker but here's
the thing it could be better here's what
Apple could do right now to enhance the
home pod by the way we're focusing on
software changes which means this stuff
could be addressable immediately let's
get to it
at number five is Apple TV control so
remember how you can search for things
using your voice with the newest Apple
TV well you can't use your home pod to
directly access your Apple TV
why on earth would Apple not reward you
for buying its set-top box and its
speaker because I have no good answer
for you if you want to search for things
on your Apple TV with your voice you
better grab your Siri remote number four
open up the setup process spoiler get
use of the phrase open up in this top
five want an Apple home pod guess what
you cannot even set it up unless you
have an iOS device look at the system
requirements iPhone 5s or later iPad pro
iPad fifth generation iPad air or later
iPad Mini 2 or later or iPod Touch 6th
generation this is a requirement not
optional do you have an Android device
with Apple music well forget about
setting up an Apple home pod unless
you've got an iOS device running
11-point 2.5 or later somewhere else
coming in at number three open up
bluetooth the Apple home pod has
Bluetooth 5.0 which means a longer range
and it's faster direct transferring data
than previous versions of Bluetooth
that's great you can use your Apple home
pod as a Bluetooth speaker from further
away right
no while there is Bluetooth hard work in
the home pod its function is to talk to
iOS devices only number two advanced
multi-user support imagine a world where
your Apple product is locked down to one
user like the iPhone or iPad or Apple
watch ok so it's not that hard to
imagine the home pod does allow anyone
to ask a serious question but the
speaker does not support voice training
meaning it does not know the difference
between two voices Google and Amazon
both let you get customized responses
based on your voice which makes the
investment in a smart speaker
a little easier to handle before we get
to number one let's talk about some
hardware changes to the home pod that
could be useful in the future
Apple is embraced wireless charging it
could be nice if the home pot itself
served as a wireless charger for an
Apple watch air pods or an iPhone also
the home pod has a non removable power
cable that means the home pod can never
have a simple battery accessory that
makes it more portable lastly how about
a 3.5 millimeter input jack so you can
attach other devices to the home pod
easily I'm laughing because that's never
gonna happen coming in at number 1 is
opening up music choices Apple has been
positioning the home pod primarily as a
great sounding speaker for people who
love music and a smart speaker second
the thing is if you want to get all
music functionality out of the home pod
you better have Apple music I'm not
making this up that's Apple's language
in its system requirements for the home
pod Google and Amazon both allow you to
change your default music service if you
want now you can air play audio from
your iOS device to the home pod so it is
possible to listen to other services
from the home pod but it's less than
ideal there is plenty to like about the
Apple home pod by the way check out our
full review at sea Netcom big thanks to
