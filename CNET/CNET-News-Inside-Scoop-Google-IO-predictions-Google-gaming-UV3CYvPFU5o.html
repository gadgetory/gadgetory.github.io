is Google's big event in San Francisco
at the moscone center to bring
developers and fans in to see what's new
i'm dan farber from cnet and i'm joined
by our google correspondent says
rosenblatt Seth what do we expect that
will be new from google at this event
sure well let's recall last year's event
where they demoed the then new google
glass with an extreme sports demo they
had some some guys jump out of a
dirigible and a wingsuit down and
parachute down to the roof of the
Moscone Center it was high drama nobody
knew what was happening was all done
over google+ hangout it was crazy is a
word that I think you can use to this so
are they gonna go crazy again this year
was something I don't you think that's
gonna happen I think that was I don't
know if it was a one-time thing but
there's no way to really top that and
this year they're not even going to try
I don't think we do know that they will
be giving away some swag as they have in
years past and that swag will probably
include at least one Android device it's
not really clear from the rumors whether
it's going to be a new version of the
nexus 4 or whether it's going to be an
entirely new phone we do know that there
will not be a revamp of the Nexus Q the
strange little media ball that they
debuted last year and bombed just as
badly as Google glass sword what about
the motorola acquisition isn't there
supposed to be some niall motorola
phones and lenora x mm-hmm there are
they've been rumored there's been no
indication if that's going to be one of
the giveaways or one of the
announcements it would be a great time
for Google to do that because for the
past 12 months people have been
scratching their heads going why on
earth did Google by motorola what have
they done with them it's been a very
uncertain acquisition for the company
now Android is I don't something like
750 million phones out there something
like that there is the operating system
there's something called key lime pie is
that going to be shown at this event we
think that there's going to be key lime
pie shown at the event but it could also
be a
simply a minor point update to the
current version of Android which is
called jelly bean so we could be getting
android 4.3 or we could be getting
android 5.0 which is key lime pie what
about google and its competition with
the ipad all the different kinds of
nexus and applets the android running
Nexus 7 tablet could receive an update
as well one of the problems with
speculating about Google is that they
could really take things in so many
different directions because they have
their hands in so many different pies
not just key lime now that's a good one
what about gaming I've heard that
there's a rumor going around that that
multiplayer gaming is something that
Google is now going to get into yeah
it's this is probably the worst kept
secret about this year's google i/o if
you look at the schedule there are
gaming developing development events all
over the schedule there is definitely
some kind of Android Play gaming a thing
coming we don't know exactly what form
it's going to take but it looks like a
massively multiplayer online gaming
network will be coming to Android and do
you think that they would be doing a
console of any kind or just kind of
stick with a kind of hardware they have
now that's a great question we have no
idea they could be doing a console
Google really surprised everybody last
year with glass with the nexus 7 with
the Q even even though it was a failure
so they could be doing an Android
focused hardware console they could also
just do something where that allows
current android phones and tablets that
are out there to be turned into the
console itself google now has been a big
hit as you just said and it's on iOS
it's on android didn't you see it moving
to the desktop absolutely a few weeks
ago Google surreptitiously released an
add-on only in Russian that turned
Google now into your Chrome's homepage
something like that could very well be
coming it wouldn't surprise me if they
announced it Google now has been a huge
success for the company people have
responded very well to the cards layout
and it wouldn't be surprised me to see
more card style action
in other Google services so what's
coming up tomorrow Wednesday when Google
i/o opens well we've got some Cena TV
editors doing a pregame before the live
blog and at 9am we are launching our
annual live blog of Google i/o this year
it's a three hour keynote format as
opposed to separating the keynote over
two days so it's going to be a long one
but it should be a lot of fun thanks
Seth thank you Dan for cnet i'm dan
farber thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
