and an arrow appears but the magic of
the app is that you don't know if the
arrow is going to point left or right
check out this video by tdawg II that my
friends is the TSA s new randomizer app
that it supposedly paid forty seven
thousand four hundred dollars for the
purpose of the app is to tell you which
security lane to go to so you walk up to
the TSA agent he or she taps the screen
and an arrow appears if you think that
sounds like something you code in a
group project for coding 101 you're not
alone youtube user Chris pacia uploaded
a video last night showing him code this
very app in about ten minutes he notes
that since he usually charges about
hundred dollars per hour for coding the
TSA overpaid for its app by about 47,000
383 dollars that was designed by IBM
which sold it to the TSA as part of a
project totaling 1.4 million dollars
that's according to developer Kevin
Burke who filed a Freedom of Information
Act request to find out how much app
actually cost at this point it's unclear
what the rest of the money was used for
but it's possible that the purchase of
tablets and device training was a part
of the deal</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
