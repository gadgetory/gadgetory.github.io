Drobo medius Thunderbolt Drive but let's
talk money first I'm gonna come to money
there's nothing more near and dear to me
than my Oh will it so let's very
randomly here check out how much I have
there now oh I'm see here well of the
bad I have a $200 and some more I'm not
a brag or anything but they have to
admit that that's a lot of cash but that
is not enough to even buy one third of
this drive yes the Drobo mini costs 650
dollars and what do you get for that
well a few things number one you are
guaranteed to spend some more that's
right
because the drive here come with no
storage instead it comes with four Drive
a right here for you to put in the
internal drive fast high speed again
fast and high speed internal drive like
this one right here you see how easily
is goes in like just like this there you
go form them and on the bottom here is
also a small slot to put in a small SSD
so all you know it can spend about three
or four or even five hundred dollars
more before you can take advantage of
the Drobo that is all glories now the
second thing can get from a Drobo mini
is the bragging right that's right
because we beyond red Robo gives you the
option of making a volume up to 16
terabytes regardless of how much storage
actually you have in the drive the idea
is that you aim for high and then later
on add more storage to the drive is the
viewer mode rise or higher capacity
drive and the problem is that currently
with one terabyte hard drive being the
largest 2.5 inch hard drive high-speed
on the market the Drobo can give you 40
by abroad capacity at most the thought
that you get from the Drobo is a very
cool drive a cover right here it stay on
very firmly and strongly actually some
time to fully to strongly because of
strong and mag
but hey it looks really cool and finally
the dry come with an amazing amount of
size it's like wrapping around it phase
right here they probably have to keep
you up at night
and if that's not enough to keep you up
at night on the back here the dry come
with two fans that is very loud there
you go now the Drobo come with both
Thunder ball and USB 3.0 making it a
very versatile sort device in my testing
however it proved to be one that tries
to teach you patient because first it
take a long time to boot up in my tests
up to a few minutes and secondly is slow
in fact is a model slow with Thunderball
and USB 3.0 drive i will revealed and
even worse is seem to progressively
slower the more data you put on it
although the Drobo is unique to say the
least whether or not you want to pay for
that it depend on how much dough you are
actually rolling in personally I would
go for other Thunderbolt Drive that
offer more stories faster speed and
cheaper now for more information check
out the full review at sea calm and to
find out how rolling VIP I really am you
can follow me on my Twitter
I'll check me out on my Facebook page
once again my name is Domo and this has
been a very quick lesson on Finance with
the participation of the Drobo mini
