coming up how the galaxy s3 turns
Samsung from imitator to innovator
Samsung used to have a bad rep for
copying Apple but today it's making more
bizarre original tech than anyone else
out there that changes best represented
by the Galaxy s3 but to understand the
transformation you have to go back to a
time when Samsung had less to be proud
of spring 2011 and Samsung was two
phones into its Galaxy S series which
aimed to capitalise on the smartphone
boom that Apple's iPhone had triggered
for Apple however the Android powered
Galaxy devices were a little too similar
it wasn't long before Apple brought down
a reign of legal fire upon Samsung Steve
Jobs and pals
accused the company of slavishly copying
the iPhone and iPad pointing to
similarities in design icons and even
packaging CNET's has advised me to have
a lawyer present for this next bit but
let's be honest Apple had a point these
phones were blatant claimed with the
patent war ballooning into a global
conflict Samsung was under pressure to
prove that it had some ideas of its own
with the Galaxy s3 in May 2012 it did
just that
the s3 was different to smartphones we'd
seen before with a glossy oval style and
a screen so big it could tear your palms
in half Samsung's design choices made
that big screen work Apple was all about
steel and glass while HTC had
traditionally gone for an industrial
weighty feel samsung's choice was
plastic and lots of it the oil-based
construction of the galaxy s3 meant it
was very thin and light and just didn't
feel as massive as it was the final
ingredient was something that's come to
define Samsung crazy software s beam s
planner s voice s memo smart stay social
tag smart alert best photo all share
play pop up play direct call the galaxy
s3 crammed in all these bizarre apps
that are so weird
you'd have to be the kind of person who
eats breakfast with their toaster to use
them all
you know I've never loved you that
wealth of crazy features has become a
Samsung hallmark and proved that in the
s3 Samsung had finally found its own
groove and we loved it
Samsung sold 20 million s threes in the
first 100 days and by nine months had
shipped 50 million despite production
problems with one color option which
samsung said featured a newly invented
kind of blue now I've never invented a
new color all sold 50 million phones but
I imagine it's a real confidence booster
and if you look at what Samsung has
built since that self-assuredness shines
through there's the gigantic Galaxy Note
and Galaxy mega or bizarre experimental
gadgets like the curved Galaxy round the
galaxy s4 zoom or the galaxy gear
SmartWatch
samsung's gadgets have become
increasingly diverse but they have a
common ancestor in the galaxy s3 with a
eccentric apps and just the right amount
of crazy you have to wonder whether
Apple made a big mistake in attacking
Samsung in the first place apart from
drawing loads more attention to its
smartphones perhaps that legal assault
encouraged Samsung to release something
significantly different history will
remember the s3 as the phone that saw
Samsung turn from imitator to innovator
do you have fond memories of the s3 and
what do you think of Samsung today let
me know and check back next time for
another adventure in tech
