iOS device to your TV you have a few
wired and wireless options the method
you choose will depend on how new or old
your devices what kind of video quality
you're going for and of course how much
you're willing to spend let's break it
down if you have an eye device that uses
the new lightning format you have two
options
the cheapest is to use Apple's digital
AV Adapter
which mirrors your device's screen so
anything you see here will show up there
just plug it into your device like this
iPhone 5 then hook up an HDMI cable you
can also use this slot to keep your
phone charged while it's mirroring but
here's the catch this adapter mirrors up
to 1080p but most times you'll notice it
looks more like 720p part of that is
because it doesn't transfer raw video it
converts it on the fly so if you look
closely the image actually looks
compressed still though it does the job
now if you have an older iPad iPhone 4
or 4s or a fourth gen iPod Touch there
is a digital AV Adapter for you - it's a
little different though because
mirroring is only available for the
iPhone 4s and the iPad the other eye
devices that use this dot connector can
only use this adapter to play media on
the device and some applications with
video like YouTube or Netflix now if you
want to get rid of cables altogether and
you're willing to spend a hundred bucks
grab an Apple TV once your eye device is
connected to the same Wi-Fi network as
the Apple TV you'll see a new button
show up next to music and videos just
tap it and your media will be beamed to
your TV a bunch of apps are also airplay
enabled like Ted and PBS and it gets
better
some games are airplay enabled too
letting you use your iDevice as the
controller while playing a game on the
TV sometimes you will get a little lag
but give it a try with a game like
Ducati challenge to see how it works the
library of airplay enabled apps and
games isn't huge right now but you
should see more dev supporting it over
time you can also see my list of top 10
airplay enabled apps on CNET if you want
to read up on all of these video
connection options check out my full
written tutorial on CNET how to and as
always hit me up with any of your
questions on Twitter for CNET I'm Sharon
