of the 404 show it's Friday November
20th 2015 we are so glad and happy and
grateful to be able to welcome back once
again to the program it's been a while a
long time aunt Jill schlessinger how are
you Jill fantastic so great to be here
how come your dogs are in here I know I
thought about it they turned eight
months yesterday and I said to my
girlfriend maybe I should bring the
girls down to the 404 and she's sort of
like uh has that going to work I hadn't
gotten that far but I just knew that
Jeff would have such a great time I so
I've thought about bringing my dog to
the office and you know like like how
you probably were thinking on paper
brilliant in practice terrible the
logistics are kind of horrified as with
two dogs to be one if it was one dog for
I live nearby here right now I think you
would have been crazy you've been
freaking out the whole time Charlie stop
 on the rug it's so funny
because I should show Justin these have
I got these like wireless bluetooth
headphones because I when I would go out
and listen to podcasts while I was
walking them I'd lean over cuz I keep
eating so much stuff on that I feel like
they're biting it there but I can't do
anything so now I look like you know
people say oh where'd you get those
headphones yeah so cool i'm like 'oh
their dog had fun that's all about has
nothing to do with technology have you
so in your life have you ever had dogs
before yes i met with my ex I had two
dogs two cairn terriers oh we got
different times they look pretty similar
to the doctor but one was insane like we
adopted them when they were older yeah
so like one and two years old and I
don't no one was really always insane a
little bit yeah and so that was fun I
had those two dogs and I grew up with a
Yorkie like princess dog we had like a
fat your key so she had like at it so my
closer to a terrier in terms like a
large my girlfriend all about the labs
like gray black lab I to go forever so
that's like how did James inter to get
the think it's a good middle ground I
think that's what i said to her i said
you know the thing is about a terrier
it's not like she really doesn't like
lap dogs so i said you gotta have a bowl
personality in that little dog so I said
it has a big dog personality in a little
body and then we ran into one on the
street maybe five or six years ago she
says on men yeah just to this five or
six years its like you with kids just
took you five or six years was is that
what happened you ran into a baby on the
street yeah we ran to a baby uh who was
who's asking us for directions and then
it was weird just after that I was like
show my god you're charming that kid is
cute eat my babies kid I just so for
everybody i had seen I'm not following
your daily trials and tribulations with
your child's so Jeff just showed me a
video baby yesterday and I immediately
sent Stacey know like oh my god this kid
is ridiculous it's he is so cute it's
getting to the point yeah I mean I can't
detach myself from being his father and
you know sort of like say okay
objectively this child is yeah but I can
but you can I can I'm not even you could
say he's a jerk or are we he was a jerk
but it would be like oh nice you know I
wouldn't have necessarily gone over
bright i feel like i have sat through so
many peoples pictures jerk kids yeah and
there are times where you're like that
kid is not cute and by the way not a
good athlete i might come on like I was
an athlete in college so people like oh
look at my kid played this I'm like that
kid can't throw like whatever like her
elbow is not above her shoulder it ain't
working like sorry mom not happening
sometimes it just doesn't work out and
you got him face facts early in life
yeah here's what I think the best way to
do it you have a tumblr or something
that you can lock down and you give
people the password if they want to look
they can if they look they totally
brilliant and that's what we do Facebook
is just like yeah can I tell you the
funniest thing one time this is like old
school we're out to dinner with this old
old friend of my girl so wait old friend
or they were actually old like 70 well
knew them from a while ago new from the
from a long time ago that's like you
know just like your partners like your
partner's old friends and some of them
you really like it's like whatever it's
whatever hadn't seen Rowland so uh she's
a lesbian with these three kids and
somehow she thinks that because I to him
a lesbian that I really wanted to look
through a stack which was like two and a
half inches thick of photos like this is
before we had iphones sarah so evidently
i didn't even
realize this but in the middle of like
looking at them I must have completely
zoned out cuz Jackie kicked me so hard
on the table but I was like duh she said
these are just kid photos know what they
turned into something else they just
were so many of them yeah but that's not
a lesbian thing that's on everyone okay
but I felt like it was one of those like
I mean may have been earlier before many
of our contemporaries who had children I
just was weird I just was like why I
don't care about your head I care about
like my sister's kid yeah I mean and and
Jackie's so good cuz she feigns interest
in everything or like people just think
she's a nicest person ever and I was
like how do you even do that was sorry I
don't know how she did it but I I was so
bad that I couldn't even really like I
was just like oh yeah around doing this
attention there are limits so you were
just looking through the photos I was
like you were just so young again oh
here's this kid and they're not even
they weren't very good-looking kids
again I think now it's fine because
everyone just puts on facebook and you
seen on facebook and maybe you'll get
like a phone shot world someone will be
like hey here's a picture but that's the
extent of it no one can you is how
here's how I've decided to navigate
those potentially treacherous waters
brutal honesty yeah this brute I mean
look I I am bombarded and annoyed /
nauseated by how many baby photos occupy
facebook yes too much yeah um I don't
like where Facebook's become that's why
I'm not on it that much so what Stacy
and I wanted to do and this is our
choice and we're not exactly you know
we're not we're not we're not judging
people who / share with their and maybe
were just a second i was gonna say come
on we judge overshare you just have to
you have to figure your own to
yourself right so what we do is maybe
there's like three dylan photos on
facebook total emo on and they're primo
and we're just like look this is what it
is hot here we have like raw suggested
with the private tumblr we have a viber
channel yeah uh texting banking and I
have that Viper by the way whether
you're shocked about that I'm not
shocked at all do you want in on that uh
yeah group yeah so anyway Jackie would
want that
where we post all the videos great
that's a good thing I like that it's an
opt-in I feel like Facebook with all
their technology could be like you're
posting a lot of baby photos mute it for
everyone else it's funny I think I don't
know it's a babyface radio they
definitely know so I did a story on that
a while ago where uh they were talking
about sort of offering this off like
side-loaded section of the site where
you could upload all of the photos that
nobody else wants to see your stupid kid
right and give selected friends on
facebook access to that I'll be good
which is smart yes then you're uh you
know you're you're not annoying everyone
else yeah I I feel like I'm starting to
see things on Facebook that I should not
be seeing like I should know not like
graphics not rare tell me your birth but
like what do we like the fourth you know
level connection stuff I was like like
below never your friends as in here's a
fat I'm like I don't give a sh I mute
all the time I'm very I did something
very aggressive this morning okay i'm
facing defriended a thousand people know
I should have but you know I have a
public I have like a just a public page
and some I don't put that many personal
photos in that public page a few times
here and there because i'm not
interested in maintaining two different
things so last night I took my nieces
and my nephew to see colbert and I mean
since I put just a picture of like the
Marquis of the Ed Sullivan Theater in a
picture of the four of us together was
just totally fun yeah and and I posted
it I'm like totally fun loved this like
great night so some dude oh I can say it
actually i was about to think i was on
broad yeah i was gonna say that some
d-bag yeah says colbert sucks what okay
i literally would saw was it whatever
and like we're end of a friend of a
friend basically and I was like I said
dude I literally wrote a reply i said i
would really prefer you not make a
remark like this on a post that i just
put up here it's obviously my family
with job then I remove the post yeah
after he saw well you could can't remove
just his comment so i removed his i
removed his column was not Europe but
then I almost defriended him but then I
was like this is one of these lunatics
is gonna come like chase me down have
you experienced anything like that
before uh read a lot like the shades
land no no in terms of like negative
Annette stuff yes ok I have I mean like
because whatever i'm on the broadcast
right so I had like somebody like like
every time I do a segment on ctm I get
some asshole who like says something
horrible to me and I'm like whatever and
one guy I he like totally picked a fight
with me and I decided was gonna have him
on my radio show oh my god why'd you do
that I'm an idiot because I was like oh
you know what like maybe I'll just give
him a voice yeah there's a few note I
mean like like so I said to him offline
so then I have him on the radio show he
was horrible he tapes it and then he
puts it up like on youtube or something
like the audio of was a terrible thing
because we never put it up on our show
yeah because he was such an asshole
about like he said something he sends an
email to david rhodes the president of
CBS News saying like your business
financial advisor analyst is you know a
fraud and I was just like oh they say if
you guys miss a cookie well doesn't I
got a lot to do before you started
running for president yeah I mean I see
something oh my god so yeah I mean and
you know by the way I just got a letter
from someone in prison which was very
nice yeah like prisoners have a lot of
financial advice watching ctm yeah so
what I was a little bit nervous though
and also by the way when you get letters
that are sent to CBS they like they scan
them and check them that they're no
one's trying to tell you it was amazing
and and so I I open it up and I said I
can just throw this out why am I going
to read this and then I thought oh my
god that's so mean like what does a
person just wanting to like say like I
liked your segment but what it was was
something between a nice note and a
creepy note because it was like I think
that you should wear tighter so everyone
in Block C hoping for this so I was like
okay that was injured because it started
off with like I really loved the work
you Jerry was from a guy yeah tummies
barking up the wrong tree hey I'm back
wrong wrong footed pneus but uh so weird
remember Jeff when i was on a one time
we're i was on the show and then someone
said I just saw aunt Jill in the subway
like tweeted that yeah
is so weird to me and then I saw someone
like the indian restaurant if I hope
you've come up to you right yeah but not
like a ton sure yeah someone came up to
me in the dog run on the Upper West Side
and was like Jess you on TV this morning
I'm like yeah yeah stay away keep your
dog like my dog you'll get along just
fine I've had a couple and it's usually
fine and people are actually cool very
nice um weirdly the most i've ever been
a bike mentioned is when i was in a cab
TV thing oh really I'm so cool everyone
saw that's awesome because everyone yeah
I have nothing look I just telling
general turning you off yeah I just told
Jeff that I had done some spots for
American Express I did some voiceover
stuff and I said you know like someone
was like dude you see ya Joe lot of TV
spot of radios but whatever and it was
so funny and I was like yeah you did
it's okay yeah not a big deal but it's a
weird thing to go like from having a
more anonymous life short having this
life where you actually sort of have to
be public like honestly I said to
Anthony Mason so he's the economics guy
the evening news and he does a ton of
stuff he's like you know what before the
world of social media like I didn't no
one really recognize me on the street
normally commented to me so it's almost
like he had this huge job and people
were like you look familiar but I don't
exactly know who you are I kind of dig
that idea yeah I would have been a cool
thing to live in that time I mean it's
still I think there's certainly limits
like obviously Angelina Jolie can't walk
on the street or like Aziz Ansari
recently wrote about the fact that each
I can't walk down the street but like us
I know I know it's like a lot of
athletes have a two were like yeah
unless you're a super concert unless
you're a hockey player yeah or a hockey
player which by the way I've talked on
that's a great and they're like it is
the yeah yeah take the helmet I
like you know yeah nobody knows the best
thing like if I'm in you know the arena
forget about a second I leave no Joe
Schmo I can I go on my right you know
that you know where in jersey with their
name in fact I got a my buddy Mike uh
who's a huge devils fan as well was in
hoboken last a couple weeks 0 NE sees a
devil and the devil was so shocked that
he knew who he was at that was like wait
a minute that's very
I am he's like yeah you lee stempniak
what's up like score tonight that's all
that is so good like and you know
obviously once it happened they they're
not ungrateful that's coolest thing a
photo like that's or even Aziz moment
though for a second you like the show
you know watch the first two episodes
when I am so I've only heard free I've
heard reaction from about three people
who all love it I thought I mean I even
while I watched first 5 i'd seen watched
five yeah I really like it I don't
really like it I'll and the first
omeprazole and I like the pace of it and
I think it's totally cool to hear a guy
talk about things that just aren't
talked about on television which I think
that's sort of the gift I mean he
actually annoyed me on Parks and Rec a
little bit I was not the biggest disease
fan I don't want to say I am I'm just
not a fan of his standup yeah but I
don't think he's I don't think he's
unfunny i will give you show a chance
yeah I do think I mean Louie was
obviously the progenitor of that format
of show and I think he's definitely
following that model but it obviously is
shot completely differently and his
style and his like youth is obviously a
totally different vibe from the Louis
show but I think it's great and I think
until it's sort of little bit less angry
than Louis yeah which I again I think
goes to the age yeah his style yak you
know obviously comic uh comedians get
older and there's like more of an edge
to them but Aziz is sort of he's 30 he's
our age Jeff and I and he just doesn't
sorry I'm sorry that was really bad uh I
a man chill for a mere much younger than
I ya know I have a big birthday coming
up next month don't say a word yeah
again uh so I'm just saying do it's next
month uh-huh no way ha yeah how do you
come on give it a me you can be 45 50
shut up you're not supposed to say my
agent is gonna kill Nate down you know
what's funny my agent says he's like
don't tell anybody you're turning 50 I
was like okay there's this thing called
the Internet yeah and fill it doesn't
matter because even though there isn't
internet people still don't look
right okay that's probably true but I
mean anyone who went to my facebook page
would just look at every single person
that I'm friends with from high school
you could do the exact same thing I'd be
like
look at every single one of these people
in scarsdale high school oh how
interesting okay and just figure out the
year obviously but um but that said
Young turning 50 yeah I'm sorry it's
awesome except my body's breaking down
but no why what's wrong your body cuz im
an aging and apparently it's
fantastically your writer prisoners want
you to wear shoes yes exactly running is
not good for you it is not it really is
it so I was do you run well I'm sort of
on hiatus what about like elliptical
it's old Jewish lady like oh my mother's
on the elliptical is that exactly see
what I'm saying did you hear what I'm
saying like okay so here's the deal so I
played soccer and lacrosse in college
yeah yeah and so you know whatever I had
like a I did a lot of damage to my body
Shirley and I have been a runner later
you know throughout my life and I was
down to two days a week you know 25 mile
runs a week something big nothing crazy
okay and and things are just happening
yeah bad hip yeah the hip gets better
that's the right hip well now the webcam
the machine is breaking down ladies and
gentlemen I mean you're still physically
fit and you're still active and get the
issue is the second you get an injury
you can't run anymore or yeah it's like
really and then so it piles up on you
right and running is so brutal on the
joints cuz you're putting someone to
wait so I'm a bike bicyclist my team I
like to bike you fall yeah and then I
had one of those did I know you when I
blew out my shoulder in Central Park oh
I don't think so yeah that was in two
thousand I literally like just started
CBS yeah and I got into a bike accident
in Central Park and pulled over my oh
why'd you do that it was bad it was bad
and it was just it was an accident i
would not would blame it on anybody
doing anyone Brad suing anyone um so uh
it was you know what I was riding close
to a guy and I said tailgating on your
right yeah and he moved right he moved
right yeah and weird brand thing yeah
and it happens with skiing all the tab
salute like now so it was an accident he
felt so bad and I flipped over and I was
just Adam hope so i blew out my shoulder
you know I had a and so like then I was
like I'm very
I'm much more careful about but now that
I the dogs I don't care because I walk
like five miles a day and as long as
you're active while we're on the subject
of self diagnosing yes um I got know if
I broke my thumb right let me see it
there it is that's kind of fat did you
get not compare compare the two thumbs
okay so i had the same injury on this on
my left phone another both see this bump
yeah yeah that happened right when the
injury happened this is perfectly fine
okay yeah this one didn't get the bump
but I have the scene pain it goes away
what I'm just doing now right this is uh
when Tuesday night I say this if it
doesn't feel a lot better by money
already feels a little bit all right
you're gonna probably fine it just hurts
yeah didn't I tell you when I broke my
toe of chasing the dogs when I first got
them it was a funniest thing I broke my
toe reason is it kill it kid fall to the
floor yeah and they can't do anything
and I did in the street oh they was
there but still like it was bad it's
it's like the worst thing and they're
like tape it together and oh right
there's nothing you can do now eight
weeks your son all right Oh back to my
thumb like whatever it's gonna be fine
what did you put ice on it when you
first have did alright so should I keep
icing it no it's done now so yeah I know
there's nothing you could do yeah I take
some valium look fat right it's a fair
oh I see like recreationally it does
look fat it's swollen for sure is it
swollen damn it yeah I just bruised the
bone you think maybe add my father would
say it was a deep bone like the day
viest hockey injury could possibly get
like lose some teeth bro I weren't cage
I'm smarter than that okay come on I
lose some teeth brother yeah you know
man how about our Mets we haven't even
had a conversation it's all of our men
oh yeah you too I was that don't game
they won at least oh it was a rough go
but you don't have you so in my mind I
feel I don't feel so bad about the loss
because I really even though we were
close in every game they say we could
have won I think they could have but I
felt like they just didn't have it in
them while I tell you the truth after
the first game I was in a car driving
from New Jersey to DC and should have
won that first game and when they didn't
win that
like their dad that's exactly where al
yeah took a lot I don't know though I
mean that teams I'm not taking anything
away from royals are really good the
problem the Mets had no answer for was
like you put enough balls in play yeah
back Cory right and that's where my name
they why they blew him out but yes you
put the ball in play enough times
against the Mets in their defenses have
said they lose the game yeah all right
we gotta take a break when we come back
I know this is like an ass like a
fantastic Jill and Jill Schlesinger
homecoming I love it probably get to
some topics that are current relevance
but if we do if we don't so what okay I

Jill Schlesinger is here it's been a
very long time because she likes her
dogs better than she liked being goes on
the road it's really not my fault you
know you're starting to remind me of
like George Clooney in the air up there
now up in the air wait here's the
basketball the dog no no air bud air up
there i think is with Kevin Bacon and
like that I haven't I African guy yeah
yeah uh so you're not that guy but
you're George Clooney in up in the are
you like you're at status with like
you're like mega status at this way yeah
well you know last year my girlfriend
was in London okay and so I did nine
trips to London in seven months oh my
god so all those miles we use when we
went to Turkey right
for how was turkey phenomenal yeah so I
would have been happy if there was not a
bomb um attack you while I remember
writing you we emailed while you were
there I was like hey are you awake on
that don't go to Ankara we weren't near
there yeah of course I said to my mother
like Jewish mother alert she's like
everything okay yes don't worry were on
the other side of the country it just so
happens we travel a lot around the
country at the point when that bomb went
off we were as close to anchor as we
could have been which was what a hundred
eighty miles oh yeah but brief so far
away here but you know I think uh I got
a ton of emails from people at CBS
because they saw it come across and they
didn't know if I was transferring
through and it happened that a train
stations everyone was freaking yeah but
it was in an it was a phenomenal trip
Jeff Bakalar is a huge name and in
Istanbul yeah so are you I do have
Turkish roots the back of our ancestry
does take us to the to the country of
Turkey and yeah I do not know how close
that lineage is like in terms of
generational yeah but I i dunno i have
some turkish on the tree okay i have to
say it was a phenomenal trip it's
istanbul is a fascinating city yeah
crossroads of antiquity basically
everything is there and also I've never
been to a Muslim country right so that
was kind of wild you know that I was
like wow okay I mean literally I said to
the travel agent I'm like just be clear
a lesbian Jew traveling in Muslim
country am i okay she's like yeah I'm
gonna tell you where you can go where
you can't though so um what get a little
more descriptive about that like what
and so in Istanbul is a very westernized
city it is a beautiful city and you know
frankly if you look at the path of like
what has happened in Istanbul it there
was a time where there were many
cultures living together very peacefully
there on you know when the the Ottoman
Empire was kind of an interesting period
because there was you know this idea of
a pan muslim state right and the ottoman
empire and but what was tremendous to me
was the people were so great
there was a I mean I never felt like any
anti-americanism anything anti-women and
in fact I mean the change it has
occurred in Turkey in the last 12 or 13
years is because they had a far-right
they have a far-right leader now so if
you talk to people who went to Turkey 15
or 20 years ago it was like totally a
westernized place this Iran has really
brought them farther to the right more
women are wearing scarves um when you I
mean it was so funny because our guide
who I adored she was seventh generation
he stumble and she said you know should
we look at somebody and she see a woman
like full-on burka head-to-toe
everything and she's like not Turkish
how do you know he's like no she's like
Saudi Arabian interesting and I say wow
she was in fact like and she would like
point at she's look at these girls see
this girl in the scarf she was look at
her shoes we're in like Gucci loafers
yeah and a Rolex hood and she said this
is a way that many of the families who
want a curry favor with the government
they sort of play up like oh I'm gonna
dress up and be more as I want to get it
warded that contract as my husband owns
the concrete company yeah yeah so I've
got to play the part is they're American
pin in flag pan actually it's cleaned up
you know and it show is really a rolling
country by the way I went to a Turkish
bath I had like 10 you actually went oh
yes it was phenomenal dude what is that
whatever STUV all we went so you go to
this mosque and you go next doors
there's where the Turkish bath is this
one of course was totally redone because
I you know I could ya tell my god i want
to go so I'm like I don't want to go to
schvitz I want a nice place Wi-Fi and
everything he was gorgeous yeah it was
beautiful and then these women come and
you go to like sort of a communal place
you go sit down there like soap you up
yeah they wash off me massage you they
do this it is awesome it was fantastic
it was that and then after you go sip
some tea and have some dates wow that's
cool I felt like they're pretty amazing
yeah that's wow you're like it's like
some cool Indiana Jones scene I'll show
you when we get up I'll show you a
picture but you know then there's like
pictures of me and Jackie in a mosque
with the scarves on yeah I'm others like
I don't like that picture
and whatever does that happen I what you
doing on vacation it was really amazing
yeah and then we went to the middle of
the country where we saw kapadokya which
is where they're these caves that were
inhabited oh I don't know from the first
and second century holy yeah it's
amazing what's in there I'm really cool
work artwork on the wall but tells
stories so like in the first century
like literally a story of Jesus Christ
is like depicted on the road it is
insane and then you see like sort of the
all the things that happened after that
right so and that was so cool and then
we went to the far west coast which is
Ephesus and you're seeing like Greek
antiquity wow yeah that's crazy it was
awesome so just real quick tell me an
example of why Bakalar is so popular
there well I would buy you like I saw
some well first of all you know I
meanwhile in Turkey and I said to Jeff
look at this cuz I was like I saw
something that said 404 yeah like I'm on
the street in his mirror turkey bizarre
and so on my giveaway I noticed it when
we were in Istanbul and I should have
taken a picture of it but it was it was
a family owned business and I said to
the guide I said that's so fun i have a
friend buckle are in in the united
states and she's like oh it's a very
common name Jewish name here in Istanbul
very weird that I'm starting to find me
it is probably more because of the
internet but I'm starting to notice
there are like a lot more bakal ours in
the US mmm what not Jewish backlog
that's in concern like they're just not
yeah there could tell you could tell
like nope jo Jo HN yeah yeah my cousins
Joh Shannon he's Jewish that's weird
yeah no but like I could just I could
just tell like they're just not you know
that yeah I don't know maybe that sounds
terrible oh but I here I get it you know
what I mean um but yeah and then I've
also found there's one that writes for
The Times Nicholas yeah yeah yeah
mcnicholas is not a very no it's not not
um and I get google alerts every time
this guy decides to write out what is it
ever he covers like science and medicine
yeah arm and he's always just like
coffees gonna kill you and I'm like I
didn't write that certainly not uh and
and then imma and then someone sent me
one time I went down I really you know
deep rabbit hole there's a there was at
one point in American history a Bakalar
Air Force Base oh yeah so who's that
definitely related yeah unrelated just
uh somewhere like Illinois I think yeah
I don't think I'm related I don't think
related right now just yeah we it's just
very weird what are your roots dress so
rustic is Austrian oh hi all my cell I
think I'm Austrian to a little bit yeah
we're on it yeah neurologic Anansi can
we got some English in there too but
it's weird so first of all every fresh
stick on the planet is related to me
which is kind of interesting so mostly
because they changed the name at Ellis
Island so obviously all the fresh sticks
do not have the exact same name but you
know what would they change it to I
think well they just short and so they
probably came in at like as like fresh
ticks and gaba where the extra yeah
please give you another so well you can
only imagine how they shortened
schlessinger right yeah anyway uh I want
to say something Jeff no I do i do I you
have got to have a second child I'm
going right on them just shifting right
is yo because so before the show Jeff
and I are talking and you know telling
him right now cuz i said uh aunt Jill
wants have another child cuz it's your
cuz it's up to you well I did put my
whole spiel in I mean you have to admit
that when i called myself aunt Jill on
the show know somebody wanted the fans
actually called made my hashtag but on
but when we were talking about you
getting married and having kids you were
first like I don't know about kids we're
not ready and they did you did wait and
I thought that was great but I always
felt like obviously you're gonna have
kids and I just want you to know that I
think that it's so great to have a
sibling and you love your brother I do
hmm I do it's not about I don't know why
are you worried I'm not worried you are
a little bit have you had this comes
issues with Stacey he will tonight no I
mean uh no we've had we've had a
casually my thing is that you know maybe
I'm just not thinking uh forward enough
it's so soon so soon and if we did we
wouldn't for a bit ok ok I just don't
want you to shut the door on it I don't
know shooting that door I don't want
there to be even a bubble thought
they're fine but I was shutting the door
on the kid until I was ready right or at
least I was until I was told I was right
you're right act like never yes this
wait till i'm told i'm ready about
gallon or two all right and i think you
would be oh yeah good job with this one
you did you're gonna have another great
one what one of my parents just stopped
after one I wouldn't even be here man
well that's an existential bragging
versation you have with yourself I'm
just saying also only children are kind
of douchey now oh yeah that's so awesome
i love that I love that he just said
that no those are different they're
different a little douchey okay no
because I think I shears not fair well I
think what's hard is first of all I love
my sister so much and we are so close
the idea of not having her in my life
freaks me at the whole reason we got two
dogs is that I love my sister so much
Jackie's an identical twin she loves her
sister so much though when we found that
there were only two girls in the litter
we're like we'll take them both yeah
who's why you couldn't break up sisters
can't bring up a service can't do it but
now so the idea that you don't have
anyone else is such a bummer I'm not
trying to break up brothers no but I'm
just like not having that relationship
is so i wantam and i would also say like
obviously the only child I mean they you
just like lived your entire life being
the absolute 100% focus right of your
parents and that kind of I think messes
with people know it so here's how you
resolve that just leave them at home
right by themselves don't give them a
hundred percent you give no you say that
yeah I think it's hard you can't yeah it
is it's really hard I agree so I feel
like I have a you know like I have
someone in my life who is not a like a
child but sort of a ward of the state
of Jackie and Jill which is Jackie's
very first girlfriend which jeff freaks
out about a minute okay so let me just
get to this fest so I can do this fast
okay Jeff not speaking for all lesbians
however yeah I will speak for all I
misspeak for a vast majority I'm not
even for me but many the culture is that
many women remain friends with their
exes many okay okay not everyone I'm
sure yeah like for example look at me
like my ex would scratch my eyes out so
I don't think that's like that's not me
which one exactly yeah they they would
like the man and a woman who but I'm so
so so yeah he was with this woman a long
time ago when they they had obviously
had a bad breakup then they time went by
like not like there and then they became
friends and you know what they they were
together so long ago that how long ago
um let me think about it 25 years ago
was the last time they were together all
right hold on a second maybe not 20 okay
22 years ago and you say ward when I
when you say ward i think ward of the
state no I think Burt Ward laughing like
Rob Robin but Robin was the ward Batman
as well nobody here's what I mean is it
like swollen I care for her so much like
or but like our friend Jackie's accident
cuz I feel like she doesn't have a great
family yeah she doesn't come from any
money shut up idiot chicken idiot such
an idiot tell me how much you love this
girl you like no no no because what I'm
saying it's a it's a what's the opposite
of a funkier the ant version yeah i mean
i feel ya i feel like she has she has
just moved to the west coast yeah I
ideal like her deal is that she was a
professional photographer and she is no
and it's really hard to be a
photographer in this day and age because
everyone has iphones and stock
photography okay so she struggles a
little bit and so i feel like because
she doesn't have a family and a support
system her friends are really her
support system excite and so on so why
do I bring this up i bring this up
because i feel like i have this almost
like on parental
feeling of anxiety that she's out in
California she just moved out there and
I literally just said to Jackie this
morning I'm I'm worried like is she okay
is everything okay like just send her a
note and then I said you're this must be
what it's like to be a parent always
worrying I'm not worried about the dog
fun it's scary like that's what I think
so I mean now you have one is no
different to worry about one or two it's
that get a five it's gonna be worried
and I said that point yet but I'm not
like driving yeah i know but like that
that i don't know i feel i find that to
be very powerful like the second you
sent him off to kindergarten or whatever
even then like you'd be where is he
making friends is he miserable is it
getting picked on yeah do right now i'm
sad but is it do you find I mean you
don't have children so if I'd like I
thought that I do for my I mean that
worried for my fiance like if she's late
from work or it's gross out or whatever
but you know what this is a problem
among Jews because we are worried worse
yeah there we as we look at like a lot
like all the variables at once and are
constantly considering like oh this
could happen this could happen is gonna
happen this cuz that's how I feel way of
thinking to the unity you don't think
the Jewish people are slightly more
neuron about these things I'd like you
inhaling the stereotype dictates that ok
well im talking about damn time
necessary time like that i embody it i
feel like i'm like oh it's in my DNA i
mean i don't know like someone said to
me this was terrible there was a guy in
when i was up in New England and he was
talking about I'm investing or something
he's such a blowhard because yeah
schlessinger she really was talking
about me and another show like she
missed that train has left the station
so I could come on my radio show at the
time and I said you know what I'm a Jew
when the train leaves the station you
want to be on that goddamn train okay
that's how I think I think like
worst-case scenario first yeah and
that's why it's great for me to be with
someone who's not Jewish because I feel
like she looks at me sometimes she's
like why would you think that yeah I
have a pain in my neck I must have
cancer yeah okay let's move back from
the cancer and try to figure out like oh
I slept funny on the pillow sure i would
say though like my fiance is not that
way my mom's not that way they're both
Jewish bike what do you think your
mother's not that way that's amazing yet
well my dad was much more the like super
erotic cuz you got that from hell yeah I
got so that's neat your mother's a
little neurotic isn't she I am pleading
the fifth yeah I love your mother when
are we having dinner you know I did and
dinner with Jess parents know it is
awesome is lovely my parents uh I think
maybe briefly oh yeah I did I went to
your house oh right you went to the
house and injures yeah but i have to say
i mean i really think that like that's
the I'm worried about me dumb dogs i
love them so much I'm so uptight about
them and so when I think about like
little baby humans it really does freak
me out uh so I I mean I used to feel I
never really feel that way about da like
I love my dog I know you have for Dylan
like I really love Marty's a dude but in
the back of my head is a dog yeah he's
pretty self-sufficient howdy he's a dog
yeah we're not like that we're crazy you
are crazy yeah and Jackie is also little
by get it no I get it but like when push
comes to shove I know it's a dog it's a
dog I know I mean like my father died
two years ago and i'd like more anxiety
about my dogs yeah no tell me now I know
yeah we've had this thing you know it's
it's weird cuz you guys have both you
both have your parents and and so when
you lose a parent it's well I lost my
dad earlier I'm so sorry I had the
weirdest thing around that because like
these things these milestones occur yeah
and then they're not there and then I
will randomly start crying in a weird
time not like oh it's daddy's birthday
mr sure no but like when I am at the
beach and the dogs are running and I
start to cry and Jackie's like why are
you crying I'm like I think my father
would just love the scenes yeah sure
interesting so weird I just had it in
dreams like a ton in LA like non stand
I'd never had anything like that before
we're like constantly like he's in the
dreams or whatever and it's just been I
mean again Mike never had to deal with
that level of grief before that's it's
been interesting you know what I think
that that dream thing is awesome I think
it's a kinda totally a coping thing I
had a shrink who once said dreaming is
free therapy yeah it's like your brain
and your emotional state is processing
say I thank totally and maybe you wake
up and it's weird do you think about it
but that's awesome yeah I'm sorry for
your lying
that is a beautiful weird when people
say that to even like no no it doesn't
feel weird I mean I guess I feel weird
with other people dealing with grief
just cuz like you everyone feels the
same way which is what can you say
really beyond that cuz like you know
it's like a super drag and its really
tough obviously for the person but you
can't really can't make it better all
you can do is be nice to them like yeah
yeah we I have a friend at work at CBS
who's um like 11 year old son was
diagnosed with leukemia recently and we
are having this like intense
conversation like in the hallway and and
it was interesting because he's like you
know people just don't know what to say
to me yeah and they said can't they just
say I'm so sorry he's like no they say
other dopey thing well like that's
curable like oh god no that's much
better science is better now shut eye
but even like the sorry thing to me is
just like that's weird doesn't but I
said not saying something weirder I
don't know I think that just like these
impossible situations that we have yet
to as a culture figure out whenever I
visit anyone that's like terminal like
really not in a good way terminally or
whatever i generally am like very
cautious to like talk about anything but
that if only because I feel like
everything they're hearing is like
you're gonna fight it or I'm so sorry
Alex all like hey the Mets or hey this
movie I you know what I don't know if
that's avoiding it but I don't know it
can be but I just think that not saying
something is so bizarre yeah yeah an
ignore right and i had a like a pet
peeve because i don't like the I don't
like euphemisms so I'm really am a
literal person right so I'm just so
sorry to hear about your father's
passing a hint bass he died right like I
don't know where'd he passed you like I
just D hate that term is that a
euphemism yes yeah passed away like he
died okay yeah i think this culture we
not say dad died I think people when
they're dealing with another person's
grief doesn't want to make that late to
say oh they're gonna be comfortable me
saying I'm sorry he died yes a very like
I'm so sorry that you your loss is like
a euphemism is is like gracefully
terminated
no yes yeah like passing away it's just
a change of like phrasing you know it's
uh you i don't know i have like is just
weird i said i find that like our
culture is so like let's get back to the
beginning of this conversation like so i
gotta look it through five thousand
pictures of dopey kids not yours i love
your kids yeah but you know Dylan's cute
I gotta look through that like we have
focused so much on birth but we can't
talk about death and grieving I mean
it's amazing have you watched that show
the leftovers no I haven't okay wait
don't watch it for a while seriously do
not watch okay because I watched it last
year and was just like a year after like
what less than a year after my dad yeah
it is the entire show is about loss in
grief I know the process freaking
intensely if you're in that place yeah
it was therapeutic in a weird way yeah I
just sort of like hearing and seeing
Mike things where it's like uh you know
related to what you're doing with how
did your father died it was just a heart
attack what I'd always say he was 65 get
out and he was all right he ran nine
marathons oh my god horrify areia Lee
pretty crazy Jesus and sucks yeah that
just sucks this a downer of a show it
was really dark dividend I was gonna say
it is nice too for me at least to like
see even TV shows and stuff like that
did deal with that stuff just cuz it's
like this is a very cuz that was the the
moments that were best for me or when
people were like you know I lost my dad
at your age or whatever was and like
hearing that and getting that
perspective is really helpful cuz
otherwise you just feel like I'm alone
yeah the only one yeah how old your
brother uh he's three years old he's 33
35 I'm keep forgetting all die for you
you suggested to idea oh yeah just do us
two boys two boys two girls yes it works
we're going together to take one where I
love it uh pivot matter yeah yeah I live
here next we are now leaving the death
section and coming back to something a
little more fun okay this is like this
is a show that's all over the place yeah

great ok I don't know I gotta tell you
something you don't know just want to
flip it you want its flip switch slow
exactly i'm in there i totally i have
nope you know Jeff you know me google
photos let not only backs up everything
for free at a very generous resolution
they also make all of your photos
searchable so that's another ad that
we'd slip the right information so using
your head voice like whatever I want to
use google whenever I want to search
like hot like photos of me playing
hockey yeah just type in hockey yeah
okay no so maybe when you why don't you
come to my house and then you'll see the

it's not recommend the windows I'm not
getting a windows laptop i'm in my
ecosystem relax it's not happen well
that is such a excuse it is
sweet I'm you know its a 50 year old
woman's excuse not yet it's sunk cost
you've already made this Marty and pot
committee right paw committed exactly so
i'm in i think alright so what are you
gonna get a macbook air macbook air yeah
that's what i have right here i love it
i got it last year it's fantastic it
didn't they just come out with new ones
yeah just five four or five months ago
here's that I an end I really like I'm
the guys like are you really worried
about this whole music thing mind you
like who cares right he's relaxed
modified he did literally was like what
are you talking about you've like 4,000
songs there's no way you listen to all
these sites and no one finds music and
so now i'm really at the point where I'm
like maybe he's right well here's the
thing and what r us just said like no
one holds onto physical media or or or
even like downloadable music right no
screams austral i know i'm so old you're
not all just changes so fast like I had
all my physical media as a five years
ago then what did you do I just use
Spotify and you don't have it on my
computer I just never every never touch
it yeah that's the thing like I so so
for me whenever uh a new record comes
out from maybe like 20 bands or so where
i'm like i need to listen to this record
in uncompressed audio yeah I can't hear
that I I line you buy that audio file
you buy that I by then at the flat
version were like super high up yeah
clock but like for the foot fungus
listening casually yes Spotify totally
same quality Spotify is pre have to
worry about storage you just like maybe
I'll do it I could I think I think I'm
gonna do it I feel very freed right now
don't don't do Apple music no I don't
know all right we did you Spotify uh
what else did I have to ask you there
was another thing uh so I'll get my
computer I'm not gonna screw the music
yeah just let it be but if you will the
Beatles I think they're us
just let go I'm gonna let go let go let
it go let it go let it go yes and you
can stream that all right on what about
the what are you telling me about like
the what do you think about the square
IPO like you think that that's like 0
square the company yeah yeah well I
should really ask you about the Haitian
stuff but I was just gonna say that it
was like are we at the like this whole
unicorn thing like all these companies
that are so fully valid they really
messed up this IPO though because you
know what happened was the range was 11
to 13 they priced the IPO at nine then
the singles and in public no no they
just went public yesterday and what and
what it was dope you know how an IPO
works is like they set a range and they
go out and they say okay here's the
range we're trying to get this and then
they go out and do a road show and they
say which big companies will buy shares
right and institutions we're not showing
that much interest hmm 7 school doesn't
square aren't they tied with Starbucks
somehow no no no okay so you know it's
like Jack Dorsey's companies like second
of the guys gazillion or twice I hate
him I'm so they pricey IPO at nine
instead of like between 11 and 13
everyone's like ah you see the tech
world is overpriced the unicorns are
coming back down to earth blah blah blah
blah then the thing goes public
yesterday and what's in it was up forty
five percent of the first day of trading
easy they left so much money on the
table was crazy crazy time it just shows
me jazz me I need to start playing what
do you think it was defined by like
Twitter well you know what I think that
the the public wants a way to access
technology and they don't like for the
vast majority intervention yeah and the
vast majority of investors they know
like what do they know like if I had
bought apple and I'm teen years ago if I
had bought this one this many so we look
back and we only take and it's a it's a
survivorship bias right cuz you don't
talk about all the ones that went broke
and you don't talk about all I wish it
but but pets.com well but look but look
at twitter i mean Twitter's lost a ton
of value since it absolutely and you
know so i think what are gonna do I
don't know they're like I would hate I'm
sorry like I I know that they were
looking for a CEO yeah
and I just I is not a job that I was is
oh my god who wouldn't want that judging
a hard hit on 72 years you make millions
of dollars and if it doesn't work out
you admire she takes over yahoo's hasn't
done anything with it is gobs of money
you're saying like it's a credit kind of
I don't know I feel like it would submit
your legacy now doesn't not the tech for
me it's like I don't know how that
companies is going to make money well
that well I think that what's
interesting is that they had this very
loyal interesting user base and to think
that you're not growing that's not
growing but they you cannot figure out
how to monetize that here's a question
would you pay for a Twitter membership
all right even ok one of my paying I
don't know let's make up a price let's
think we gotta figure out how to make
money with this I nine bucks a month
let's say ten bucks a lot i don't think
you go by paying for it people are
automatically like your you
automatically appear in this list of
like premium users that you should
follow when people sign up no because
then you're compromising I understand
LSU cheap it let's do it cheap ok how
many active users do they have these two
hundred million yeah alright so but even
200 mil that's a hundred million sure on
what if you charge three dollars a month
don't think it's enough money why not
you're making an effect now they're
making way less now yeah I think three
bucks all right but I mean like would
you pay three bucks a month for tours i
cost them nothing like that's the
important pressure overhead right that's
so that was the host right no overhead
no for doing good doing that in other
words that money would flow to the
bottom line right sure so why not and
then maybe there are different there may
be there is a premium service I don't
know the premium service but the fear
for them obviously is that they do
something like this and you have like
flocks of people leave and then a new
startup unicorn shows up it's like we
have it for free right I mean you look
at my paypal competitors that eventually
got bought up but like venmo for example
didn't charge anything right was a total
deal yeah and and then my paypal
eventually bought them but paypal bought
them i'm pretty sure i don't believe
that happened there look there bought by
someone i let me ask you something
though I mean twitter has yeah even 200
million people who use you oh is it yeah
yeah you go eat a second so how that's
the best
in the world of empty pockets you can
buy your competition so so so amazing us
maybe a news you know someone should by
then then the the argument would be
someone should buy Twitter and what what
business could buy twitter and use that
a news agency I examine your company
right but no media company spending
money right here's the thing Leslie
Moonves could buy Twitter although sadly
no I can see is like a comcast coming in
buying them and then you have a platform
for your you're a bitch right exactly
but again you're also compromising like
people would I feel like people might
but it may be needy but it who cares you
losers annual is your end goal fifty
yearly pages figures now murder is right
now hanging on by a thread no it's not i
think it's just like a public domain
thing now already made like wiki yeah
like no it's not i understand that and
there's people use it as a tool but i
think it'd be it changing would
compromise it the same way did got
culture eyes in the same way reddit is
flirting with being compromised I mean
you know I'm saying like yeah there are
these infallible things that just work
on knowing where that line is is the
hardest all right and that's and that's
the problem right because they don't
want to destroy their business on the
other hand the business is being
destroyed what they can't sell the data
like the data they can I don't know what
data there what is it what's the data
the transcribed lifeline of the entire
human what do I in other words like
what's the algorithm of the people i
follow or like Who I am how would you
shoot an ad to me like I don't know I
feel like they have some sort of ability
to like predict stuff because they know
what every human is doing yeah I mean
look you know they've been people have
been trying to use Twitter like to
predict market moves yeah yeah it's
completely useless it's ridiculous cuz
it's like basically saying oh that's
rumor-mongering great pleasure you know
and then it's and then it's manipulated
right but you can drive like I know
people who use Twitter for you know
content creation yeah and there's money
to be made there I think what you need
to do is sort of use your user base if
you have to Twitter people as your user
base and then you keep in mind like okay
I'm going to do a revenue play so I need
something that's not tax base cuz text
doesn't make money right that I can then
vert all those users into so they've
certainly try doing that periscope yes
we being the example and but they have
really figure out a way to make money
there but that's the right idea which is
you look at um what Instagram is done in
terms of making money and and snapchat
everything like that and you try to
essentially follow something like
sponsored tweets is a thing there's no
today there you have it stacked not in
line and they're not getting the click
throughs right money yeah they are line
are they some of them are okay I totally
have never clicked on any one of them
and only by mistake and it's not images
so you're not really getting anything
yeah so South Park is doing a really
clever play on all this oh really where
their base their talk about sponsored
content yeah vs advertising here and
they're basically saying that like
people don't realize it but people are
turning into a de like the ads had to
evolve first and now and it's just a
really brilliant way to sort encapsulate
don't think but I I think Twitter is
just one of these things that can't
really change too much and I understand
like people have to get paid and I
understand like look at Google man
Google's renders yeah there are ways to
evolve we took a one company to Google
was one comedy there is a monster I mean
they had 200 million people it got to
figure out how to make money from them
because what why why should i buy that
stock what are you doing is not sure but
I think about this why does someone buy
a stock or why do you make an investment
you're making a bet that company is
going to earn money in the future except
amazon but then you're just you're just
actually making a bet that amazon ruled
the world that's not a money-making but
yet on but the doc hasn't done well know
that stock is done incredibly well and
has like a crazy valuation so why but
because the thought is that he could
turn on a spigot and make that company
profitable in about two seconds yeah
wait would reason visa sorry okay and
that he that because he is choosing to
reinvest all the money that's coming in
and do building other things out by the
way those web services like in the last
earnings report with crazy that much
money they had um but you know that you
only buy something if you think it has a
future to make money promise you're
honest and I feel like Twitter is
squandering and up
tunity without giving people that vision
right but it's very obvious that they're
paranoid about upsetting their user base
maybe I mean look it's always a delicate
balance rightly more at this point more
upset and worried about their their
revenue you know so think about this
like I am such a capitalist sometimes
that like I think things that are free
or fine like if you want to get pandora
and listen to the ads good you want to
get spotify and listen to the ads great
but if you want to pay up and have it
without ads that's even greater if you
can't afford it sure so the idea here is
that like you have this thing called
Twitter it's free well maybe of some
baseline service that's free and you are
limited to how many tweets you can do in
a given time frame I don't know but if
you want unlimited access to this
unbelievably beautiful platform it's
going to cost you some money hmm life's
not free my man said the 404 spring
Facebook's free it's easy just say sucks
Facebook does suck but they've also had
a monetized billion points I know
because they figured i had to monetize
though because people will spend you
know companies will spend so much money
on advertising they did the ad world
it's ridiculous it's like Google and
Facebook or expanding exponentially and
everyone's flat everyone else it's crazy
yep so by Facebook stop I'm not buying
what you know me I don't buy individual
stocks yeah you just do like I do you
know index funds I'm boring boring is
beautiful baby it's true uh um should I
let's try it maybe I can come back maybe
maybe I'll do it by ISDN and you can
hear the dogs in the background okay
