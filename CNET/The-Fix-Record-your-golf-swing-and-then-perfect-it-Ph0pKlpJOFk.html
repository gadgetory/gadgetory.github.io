would love to get better so I was
looking for something that will be
efficient with my time but really
effective as far as helping me improve
my golf game now there are plenty of
apps out there but one I found that
really works for me is called uber since
ruby sits as an app that allows you to
court video of your golf swing and then
directly compare that to professionals
or just a community of people that are
way better than me so first off I'm
going to start the app tap record
alright now I can use this kind of
outline of a figure to line up the shot
I'm gonna do a face on shot so this is
perfect for me I can also choose to do
it down the line shot but face on allows
me to analyze the video a little bit
closer in my opinion so I get a few more
options here I can start it with a 10
second delay and when that countdown
ends I get a nice flash that lets me
know it's time to swing also I can
choose to trim after recording that
allows me to immediately edit the shot
right after I'm done all right let's get
it set up
she was the start of my swing probably
about right here and shoes where to end
it right there
shoes trim there it is that's my video
she's done and not saved but I can
compare my swing to the community of
swings and some professionals plus since
I have an expert here now I'm going to
film him compare my swing directly and
maybe pick up a few pointers so now that
recorded my video and we've recorded
your video we're gonna compare the two
to see just how bad I am really and see
how good you are maybe you can give me
some pointers maybe I can improve
absolutely alright so I can look at them
side by side one on top of the other or
I can superimpose them I'm gonna do this
side by side first so I'm gonna go ahead
and play it here super slow-mo look at
me I look like a barbarian trying to
chop off someone's head look how your
body rise yeah then you go back down
have to do so much work and look at you
in comparison you're so efficient which
your swing looks like you're doing it's
like no effort at all efficiency is the
name of the game and a good golf swing
yeah this is where you'll really see
your body moves yeah look at my eyes I
hit my Leon Leon and the drop down and
look at also a how level everything
looks with me
so what you're gonna try to do yes just
keep your chin up a little bit tilt
forward and then just make that great
swing all right
there you go play so I have me up there
you need out here if you look at the
difference on how much less you rose up
on the top one definitely
so that center of your body didn't move
up and down anywhere near as much as the
one on the bottom yeah when I look at
those two just the idea of having your
upper body not lifting up and down so
much I can see a real improvement you
were able to get the club head back to
the ball more easily and then if I want
even more pointers I can upload my video
to the community and get even more
feedback if you want to get better at
something thinking about what you're
doing while you're doing it that can
definitely lead to improvement by having
an app that can record you and you can
go back you can analyze your performance
that can be even better
