a look at the toshiba portege z8 35 now
that is an ultrabook and it looks pretty
familiar you might go what did we
already look at this laptop we did that
was the z 8 35 p330 model this is AP 370
model and the difference is that first
one was eight hundred dollars a
fantastic value considering it had a 128
gig SSD and was really the least
expensive ultrabook that we have seen to
date this more expensive version is
about a thousand and fifteen hours we've
seen it for a little bit less the big
differences the original had an intel
core i3 cpu that's how they managed to
save some money this version just has a
mainstream core i5 cpu very similar to
what we've seen in other ultrabooks so
how does this new version stack up
against the competition and there is a
lot of ultrabook competition now
performance wise it's just fine it's got
the same core i5 CPU as a lot of these
other ultrabooks it actually has six
gigs of ram vs four in a lot of other
models but at the same time we forgave a
lot of the design things that we didn't
like so much about this particular
laptop in the eight hundred dollar
version because it was someone expensive
when you have the same exact body with
the same problems and it's a thousand
dollars well then you say to yourself I
could get the HP version of the dell
version for even less and that's
actually a nicer overall experience I
think our main complaints here are that
is that the lid a lot of flexpay on the
lid keyboard very shallow keys
especially the space bar very short
there I missed it a lot while typing and
the touchpad did multi-touch gestures
okay but these left and right mouse
buttons very plasticky and colac e a lot
of the other ultrabooks have a a click
pad where they build the mouse button
features right into a big pad they
didn't however throw in bluetooth so
you're also getting a little bit extra
for your thousand bucks vs. your 800
that said as a bargain-basement
ultrabook we liked the z 8 35 a lot as
one that's priced the same is pretty
much all the other guys I think there
are a nicer looking ones out there i'm
dan ackerman and that is the toshiba
portege
