271 of the 359 podcast I'll be your
producer today BBG and in the house
we've got you so much more bran elver
ting gonna say early I was gonna say
host and I'm like wait that's not right
at all I kind of you're the host you're
the MC producer and the heart of the
show that there's so much more just
because I have to be here every day
well yes I left that little detail out
guys what's on the docket for today's
show two Biggie's when we're talking
about Android Oreo which Alfred got to
go and check out here at the event in
New York they gave me these cookies that
I never ate yeah I mean there at this
point you just keep them um actually
this is how you get the update oh right
like the automatic download on your
phone yeah okay we'll be talk about that
as well as tomorrow's big Samsung Galaxy
Note event we'll talk a little bit about
what we want to see yeah as always if
you have any questions leave them in the
comment section
I don't think up the best and we will
get to them in three minutes and 59
seconds and here we go for the recording
in three two
welcome to the 359 I'm Roger Chang I'm
out for dang it's a big week for tech
yesterday Google finally confirmed the
name for Android Oh Oreo which we all
kind of figured it was anyway Albert you
were there at the big Eclipse themed
event in here New York what was it like
yeah it was pretty cool I mean there
weren't that many details as far as like
technically on the you know Android Oreo
because we kind of had already seen most
of it at Google i/o this was more of
like a celebration for them where you
know they timed it around the Eclipse
they put it right across the street from
the original Nabisco factory where they
invented the Oreo that's why they do
here cuz they always do in Mountain View
yeah the first time they've unveiled one
understands outside I got to a point
when I arrived it was fairly obvious
that it was Oreo I mean you know even
when we got the invite that it's gonna
be timing around the Eclipse oh you know
what looks like an eclipse and Oreo
right but there still were some doubts
and then the moment I walked into the
event and there they had the statute
covered but it was in like a circle
shape that's an Oreo like me not
like right you're not fooling anybody
with that so what is reminded when is
this available for download to pixel and
it should be available within the next
like few weeks or so there's no specific
date yet from them and I have been
badgering them about it like when when I
get this on like a pixel device you know
because I think our viewers and readers
want to know like when they can get it
but I do know that the pixel devices
will probably be the first ones to to
get that they said they're working with
OEMs and major you know producers to
basically get it out on their devices
either when they release right or you
know at least before the end of 2017
yeah I have to wonder for you know
phones whether it's Samsung LG like how
quickly they're gonna get to especially
once sold through carriers and I didn't
get to try out a lot of Oreos like main
big features because a lot of is like AI
based right so you know you have to
spend a lot of time with it for it to
really show like how powerful it is or
anything like that
but all I can say is like you know as
far as like speed goes which was a major
like point for them on this is that it
does seem a lot faster than the phone
that I'm using currently yeah but that's
the other night you can test yeah it's
not like I was gonna hold on to it for
like the whole day all right next up
we're hoping that the Galaxy Note 8 will
eventually get Oreo it will get as big
unveil tomorrow also here in New York
comes obviously after the a year after
the whole note 7 debacle however what
are you hoping to see from this phone
from Samsung I mean other than the whole
battery issue like you were talking
about I you know I don't want to beat a
dead horse there but I'm gonna go and
beat another dead horse please have a
headphone jack on this that's
interesting to see you know what phones
are going like we're gonna get it right
over the headphone jack for good now and
yeah phones are you know we know our
users still really want this and still
value this right I really hope that you
know the headphone jack wins out on this
GSA doesn't have a headphone jack right
so that does not bode well for the note
yeah but you know maybe this is supposed
to be like a better phone than the GSA
that's what I that's true it's a bigger
phone and also just the the whole like
full screen like being able to unlock it
without having
a physical button on the front you know
that's something everyone's been pushing
for right hopefully we'll see it by the
no date
you mean with in terms of like the
embedded favor yeah pretty much yeah you
know right now they're I think the
rumors point to it having be like a
bezel in the back no well just like the
GS yeah if that's true then they should
have it in a better placement cuz I know
there were a lot of complaints about the
GS a was I don't really awkward stammer
I was kind of annoying yeah all the time
alright that's all the time we have for
these stories and more check us on CNET
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Alfred hang thanks
for listening so why are you not gonna
eat your delicious Oreos I feel like
they're like Twinkies show that show
them show them to the crowd I actually
had one yesterday they gave us they had
them on top of an ice cream so look at
those cookies delicious there's an
Android symbol on the right they're both
both of them yep right well one is just
Oreo but it might be flipped
yeah mitts oh and it's got green filling
what's the green filling probably mint
or Android flavor yeah there's a flavor
of ones and zeroes so give us a more
personal take away what did you enjoy
how fun was the Eclipse in that oh yeah
it was super fun yeah I I had been
making fun of the Eclipse this whole
time but I wait for the Eclipse because
people are making this whole big to-do
about especially in New York City when
you didn't even see that's true like the
shebang totalities and it was like
cloudy's for a bit of it but I mean
seeing it from there was really cool I
mean the whole unveiling of it was and
then they had like this like ice cream
bar there that had like a bunch of Oreos
on it that was the other giveaway twos
like fairly obvious that this was gonna
be Oreo oh that you'd be able to see the
ice cream sandwiches ahead of time I
mean like I kind of I like they didn't
have them out but like you can see being
a decent reporter it kind of worked
around right and I saw it now I Oh I
mean at that point but when they kind of
leaked it out and that that style name
of the weekend like that's kind of well
they also had a bunch of other dummy
file names in there too they had like
Android Under
school or like orange aina whatever all
the stuff so they that was like another
Conner everyone it was fairly obvious
it's the right name frankly yeah just
feels right I didn't see it coming
originally when they sent Andrew oh I
thought Oreo but then I was thinking
that's a brand name but exactly and I
talked to some what some of like the
Oreo like reps that were there and they
are doing some kind of partnership with
them I'm not sure what it is yeah really
but yeah they are partnering with
Nabisco on this the same way they did
with you can you buy the update think
about it no no like there'll be codes
for the update inside you know bypass
your carriers phone yeah I mean the only
thing that was a little bit disappointed
about is not knowing like what like the
exact date yeah frustrating that they
didn't actually offer a date yeah but I
mean I feel like that's not something
that they can control though because it
is like up to the OEMs at the end of the
day right well no the updater pixel yeah
right they can they can control pixel
and Nexus phone updates you're right om
have a little bit tougher time it's even
tougher when you incorporate Verizon
AT&amp;amp;T t-mobile because they have to
approve that stuff too yeah but in terms
of like their own phones they can
totally yeah because because the
annoying thing is is you know that the
event it was this whole big to-do and
it's basically here's all these like
cool things you'll be able to see except
we don't know when exactly you're gonna
be able to get it right and it's just
frustrating it's also like but you also
the majority of our users even though
we're the most used like you know
operating system on the planet also
aren't even gonna get this yeah that's
true
all right so props to everyone in the
chat submitting your questions and
comments yeah that we're gonna hit those
right now on a glance there's a pretty
fair balance of those who are excited
first of the the Samsung phone versus
the Android operating system however and
I could easily be proven wrong on this
at a educated guess glancing as I'm
skimming through hundreds of comments
thank you again by the way it looks like
a few more people are kind of excited
about the operating system you've got a
few questions
it's hella cool it can be applied to
more phones than exactly so let's answer
some questions around that
dad dad wants to know if the lg g5 is
gonna get Oreo and a number of people
are asking is the Galaxy Note 8 going to
ship with it
I don't know yeah that's still to be
determined we'll find out more details
tomorrow it would be a little tough I
think cuz they they just announced it so
it's Samsung immediately come out with
it but who knows yeah Android did say
that they were working with major
manufacturers and you can bet that
Samsung's one of them - yes their phone
shipped out with it they did mention on
the list of brands that were that they
were working with to get it shipped out
with it
Samsung was one of them essential is
gonna be one of them so Andy Rubens
phone won't be this outdated yes GOG is
on that way imagine the g5 will get it
yeah I was very surprised to see Kyocera
on that list because they're more
they're not like a major player but at
the same date I mean they're they're
eligible for good note for making more
budget yeah exactly
so I mean I'm hopefully that I'm hopeful
that this is a sign that Oriole will
make it to way to more devices it was
just a list of OEMs that were committing
to using it or we're committing to
actually updating their existing phone
that no this was a list of volumes that
Android said they were gonna be working
with - just in general yeah so that
could mean it doesn't mean new specific
phones right yeah right yeah
alright so jiff it brings up a good
point in the chat he says the note will
have a headphone jack because it holds a
stylus so room is not an issue that's
true now but do you think that's enough
of a basis of a foundation for them to
make that decision
well yes no because I know that the idea
of like using a USB C port is thinner so
it allows the phone to be thinner but
because the note has a stylus it has to
be a little bit thicker part of the
problem with that argument is the stylus
is this one thing here and it's sort of
like along the xylophone whereas the
centre of the phone is where the
headphone jack use yeah so there's a
bunch of components there so I don't
know if they can actually squeeze all
that in and remember the note 7 squeezed
in just a ton of stuff components chips
batteries everything into a priest in
phone and I can't imagine that
make the same mistake the essential
phone doesn't have a headphone jack
either right no should we have concern
about the stylus being located right
next to the headphone jack so you
accidentally miss and get the wrong hole
per se really gonna leave me hanging on
that one yeah we are there's only one
hole fine I can't pronounce his name and
I'm sorry for this but it says Apple
guys how do you feel about the Galaxy
Note 8 and the fact the touch ID is gone
maybe he's calling out other commenters
as Apple guys he's asking entirely
possible either way let's get your
responses how do you feel about the mi a
touch ID well we don't know yet if touch
ID is completely gone right that's still
to be determined this is for the iPhone
it's for the iPhone like there was a
bunch of code that came out there was no
mention of touch ID with a led to people
assuming that there isn't gonna be but I
still don't know if that's gonna be the
case I mean I don't really support the
move to facial recognition I'm like not
very into it yeah I wouldn't if that was
the only means for biometric security
I'd be a little knowing do you mean like
going up to the cash register and like
doing your Apple pay and they're like
positioning your face in front of that
and you know they're theirs they're like
not really all that secure right and
they're like kind of known to like
glitch out a few times like although
this doesn't apply to Apple but I know
that with like Qualcomm biometric
security you know they they have trouble
sometimes if you're wearing glasses
that's like the first thing I do when I
wake I was like I grabbed my phone cuz
the light helps me wake up and if like I
just woke up and I look like crap and
it's like you know I don't have my
makeup on right and it doesn't recognize
a register that then like that's gone by
the way Alfred goes to about an hour of
makeup yeah the show morning luta
program that's true alpha rakes up every
morning to meme o'clock Michael Brown
our friend old friend Michael Brown and
Michael Brown throwing some shade and
Oh new emoji update or the it's the most
exciting thing about Android Oh to me
and I think that's a little set to be
fair that new emoji update is super
exciting they're getting robots all
right yeah they're little weird like
you've seen the Android yeah it's super
embarrassing when you're snapchatting on
an Android like phone and they can tell
that it's an Android phone because you
you can only put those emojis in yeah
and it's like what is this little mutant
like emoji that you've got going on
imagine if the emoji movie which is
already terrible was done with like
Google's blobs and do pretty well though
it's like it did decently okay well I
mean I didn't watch money-wise yes but
critically oh yeah well look a movie
like the emoji movie was never going to
be well critically though so let's just
but it could have there's so many
storylines it was annex Citizen Kane
yeah chipper is the champion of the chat
today is this update double stuff
because if not I'm out of here
nice okay yeah as much as Android and
Google will want to tell you that
there's so much packed in it the same
stuff I mean not the same but it's like
the same kind of updates are all very
incremental right I think visually
you're not going to see anything like
insane I think copy and paste yeah this
update this update was more about like
changing like the little things and so
like if if it notices that you're like
copying an address like it'll it'll
allow you to go to maps directly from
that as opposed to like copy an address
and then go into the Maps app and then
pasting it which is like nice to have
but not doesn't blow your mind yeah
that's the thing it's a lot of like
small updates it's not it's not like
this whole like massive overhaul kind of
thing but I do think that these small
updates are like pretty convenient yeah
from Michael Brown and Danny Green
combined Danny Green says what are the
biggest new things with Oreo and the
Michael Brown says question for Alfred
do you have an Android phone and what
are you most excited about an Android
Oreo on that I think both of you should
get your top three takeaways from
Android Oreo and what people should look
forward to or at least what you are
going to look forward to from one I
think battery life speed sort of the
more general experience and then the
little things that Alfred mentioned that
like sort of like little con pace the
the fact that
knows that your your your copying an
address I think I'm looking forward to
that just in general because I mean I
feel like especially on the battery side
of things that's always been a big
hang-up for me that's any mobile phone
yeah yeah yeah I do have an Android
device actually it's the galaxy s7 and I
can't upgrade from it for another two
years but I'm mostly excited about the
security additions that they have for it
so this has like been severely
underplayed because it's just not that
interesting but it's this thing that
they have called Google Play protect now
where there's a lot of apps in the App
Store like you wouldn't you and I
wouldn't download them just because they
look really sketchy but a lot of people
do download like subway surfers like
version 2 even though that game doesn't
exist
you know like they think it's something
and it's like some bootleg version of em
and they've met with a Schmo yeah so
play protect and this is something that
they're putting out with Oreo that's
gonna be implemented across like just
like the Play Store in general so even
if you have an older version you're like
like lady bucked it and it basically
like it tells you when like this app
spent blacklisted from like all these
other antivirus companies are the things
like I think that's super important for
Angel only because like it it's so
fragmented as so many security issues
with that that's too bad they can't
implement that pre store submission know
if there was a better process but at
least this is a step back direction
following major malware up since last
year yep yeah and then I'm also really
interested into seeing how they're
implementing like AI and all their like
machine learning things into with one
with Google assistant and two with an
Android Oreo update on this that's like
part of the the big thing that they're
doing if you notice a lot of the Oreo
stuff that they had it's like the
Android Oreo but he also has a cape he's
supposed to be like a superhero thing
now and they keep on like with super
sweet updates whatever but but you know
they're but part of that it's like part
of like the superpowers is like it's
like AI and how it's like able to like
predict a lot of things based off like
the assistant on your phone I know a lot
of privacy advocates that you know would
be would just burn their phone after
seeing something like that but I think
it's interesting what they're like
planning on doing with that I mean if it
adds convenience people will yeah we'll
do it right
yeah we only got a couple minutes left
Dale Kurt Mary asks how long do you
think it will take for Android devices
to get Android Oreo this time around
we're gonna speculate on this one yeah I
mean it's always tough out there their
timetable is really bad because they're
saying like before the end of the year
and that's like that's four whole months
that's even that might even be ambitious
yeah it really I think for all in fact a
lot of budget phones forget about you're
not getting any of this yeah that's the
unfortunate part of it that you know
they have this like massive reveals all
these new features oh yeah but guess
what yeah if you have you know if you if
you bought at $300 $200 Android phone
honestly honestly I'm skeptical if my s7
is even gonna get it why because it's
too old yeah that's how I feel
it's not old yeah but that's what that
like even if it's like more than a year
old sometimes you don't get the update I
have a Nexus 5 at home and I still feel
like that poem will get the update
before this one well well that's
probably true yeah that's definitely
true I think you'll get it you'll just
get it like months and months and months
late because again it's you've got
Verizon right this one this one is
horizon yeah so you know basically
Samsung's got work it through its own
systems and they've gotta go to Verizon
for an approval Verizon gives it the
okay and finally like eventually shows
up but that can take just several months
way past their their projected time yeah
I really do wish there were some Android
update that lets you like delete like
bloatware that's like defaulted on your
phones that would be most incredible and
track update for me they could never
because they could never yet cuz no
carrier would approve it right but that
would be so great that would be
incredibly true Verizon whatever message
well go 90 can delete right I didn't
know that I think you can do like I was
trying to and then like no not the hero
Android needs right now with the one it
deserves
there you go hey we all had fun with the
Eclipse yesterday right I did not you
didn't know I was walking around
downtown Toronto trying to keep my head
down and not stare at the Sun good that
was a smart decision that was basically
you don't have glasses I went I was shot
a little bit on my smartphone just her
for kicks and giggles did you use a
filter for the cloud for the thought no
I had just
adjusted the ISO and the aperture I was
told for higher-end phones your fly-by
think for a lower one and there's like I
mean exactly it's if you angle it right
like any piece of glass the mirror could
amplify the the Sun and damage the
internals but yeah it's not like it's a
guaranteed thing a lot of people got
fantastic shots they saw a lot Oliver
edit your own filters no in every time I
saw Mike Sorrentino building his own pin
boxes I thought so a lot of pin boxes
out on the street yesterday actually
when we all the whole office kind of
liquidated to go out and check it out
yeah and the clouds opened up just
enough yeah get something I enjoyed
seeing it reminded me of how small we
all are in this in this fashion yes yes
you know and that there's things more
important than me I can remind you that
every day if you want alright so before
we wrap it up we should plug tomorrow's
