June google announced updates to its
google+ app and said that the features
would student come to iOS today those
new features are ready for iphone and
you can even use the app on your iphone
hello everyone i'm jason parker and this
is a first look at the Google+ update
for iOS Google+ version 3 point out adds
new features to the iphone app and is
the first version that is made for the
ipad with it's very own unique interface
features in may the iphone version got a
major upgrade with a completely
redesigned interface and photos that
bleed off the edges for an overall
better browsing experience but today
google added the features promised at
the google i/o event with the ability to
create and manage events on iphone only
and to create hangouts with up to nine
people on video chat at one time on any
iOS device the new version which works
on iphone and ipad takes advantage of
the larger screen real estate on the
ipad immediately upon launch you're
greeted with great big photos in posts
from people in your circles in portrait
view you swipe vertically to browse
through and in landscape you can browse
horizontally i really like the
animations as the app loads new stories
in the upper right you have your post
button where you can choose to enter
text add a photo or to post your current
location when you touch the button in
the upper left you get a slide-out menu
that lets you access all the main
functions of the app the profile page
shows all your current info and lets you
browse through your interactions with
the service on the right showing the
info at the bottom touching the post
button for example lets you swipe up to
browse through all your latest posts one
of the new features to iOS google
hangouts lets you browse through images
of your friends and touch them to add
them to a hangout once you have all the
names added you can hit start hang out
in the upper right corner and start your
video hangout Google events another new
feature that only made it to the iphone
version lets you create and manage
events with your circles touch the
events section in the iphone menu and
you'll immediately see the events
already created touch the button in the
upper right to create a new event here
you'll be able to create a title for
your event add a short description and
then you can use the buttons below to
set the time
a location finally you can add people to
your event to let them know they should
come it's unfortunate that the ipad
version didn't receive the event
features in this upgrade but you can bet
Google will have it in a future version
Google+ is available now for free at the
iTunes App Store and with the feature
upgrades to the iphone and support for
the ipad this update is a no brainer
thanks everyone for watching this first
look at the update for google plus for
iOS i'm jason parker percy net see you
