my first look at the all new volvo xc90
this is an updated version totally
redesigned from top to bottom of Volvo's
top SUV now as you can see behind me
it's garnering a lot of attention at the
show a lot of people are very interested
in this car but it's kind of hard to
figure out why you just look at the body
it doesn't look that exciting it's a
fairly standard SUV there are some cool
volvo design touches like what they call
the hammer of thor in the headlights
their parking light configuration but
there's actually two very revolutionary
things about this car the first
revolutionary thing I want to tell you
about the volvo xc90 is this new t8
twin-engine powertrain this is actually
one of five engines they'll offer for
the car but this is the top one and it's
pretty exciting driving the front wheels
we have a 4 cylinder 2 liter engine it
uses a turbocharger and a supercharger
it just drives the front wheels but now
we also have a hybrid system this is
actually a plug-in hybrid powertrain in
the center of the car we have this
battery pack and it powers a 60 kilowatt
electric motor that drives the rear
wheels that gives the car 25 miles of
pure electric range with the engine at
the front wheels and the electric motor
at the rear wheels we have an all wheel
drive car and the drive electronics will
allow a unique mix of torque depending
on what the terrain is like whether it's
slippery I see snow whatever you'll get
the right kind of torque at each set of
wheels this power combination also
allows for really good fuel economy as a
plug-in hybrid you could be driving
under electric power for a lot of the
time which will minimize your gasoline
usage as you can see behind me in this
open cockpit version of the xc90 that
Volvo has on display here it's a three
row seating car but that's actually not
the revolutionary thing about the new
xc90 the second revolutionary thing
about the new Volvo xc90 is this new
census connect touch system this is a
7-inch touchscreen in portrait style you
don't really see that in many cars
except the Tesla Model S
and on the main screen we get four tiles
we get navigation media phone and this
is also showing whether these are all
changeable I can slide this to the side
and get a setup screen or I can slide it
to the other side and get all my
different functions that I can move some
of these to the main screen but go back
to the main screen and touch one of
these tiles such as navigation I get to
see the expanded view in this case the
maps these maps come from the Nokia here
navigation system and this is a fully
connected head unit system and this is a
fully connected infotainment system but
these maps are stored locally although
they will update over the connected
system when i touch the tile again I
reduce the size and get back to the main
screen if I touch the media screen I get
all my different media sources and as
it's a connected system I'll have
Spotify and Pandora available also
80,000 internet based radio stations
will be accessible from this media
center the volvo xc90 with that t8
plug-in hybrid system and the speed
sensors connect infotainment system
comes out next year around the world but
we're seeing it here first with the
paris motor show</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
