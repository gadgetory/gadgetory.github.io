I'm Lexi civilities for scenic taking a
look at the in motion r2 this is the
second version of the people mover from
in motion and it's really fun to use but
there are a couple of things that you
need to get used to before you start to
the plunge
now when you stand on it for the first
time you might feel the need to balance
yourself but you don't need to this
balances up all for you to make a
forward moving you just need to sort of
bend in from your ankles and then the
same for Reverse you just lean it back
ever so slightly you turn using a
joystick like configuration like sorry
you can do wheelies well you probably
can't do fast enough for wheelie this
only goes around 15 kilometers an hour
but it's really fun to turn around and
you can even go over a whole bunch of
different bumps and surfaces as well
now the artery comes with a bunch of
different connectivity features
including an app that lets you geo
locate where you are and also sets up
what's called geo fences so if your kids
are around using the emotion r2 and you
want to know where they are you can stop
and going outside a certain boundary by
setting up geo fences this is also a
portable package you can detach the top
handle lift up like so and carry it
around with you
you go there's an assist mode too so it
can walk alongside you black kind of
like a puppy on a leash if you'd rather
not write it everywhere you go
the in motion r2 is available for 2499
US dollars and will be available in
March my name's Lexi civilities
