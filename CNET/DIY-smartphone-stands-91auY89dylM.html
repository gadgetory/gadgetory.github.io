that can prop up your phones but if
you're on the go or just want to save
some money you can actually create your
own the best part about this is that we
will be using items you can find around
your house or the office for the first
one you will need a paper clip and a
pair of pliers start by straightening
out the paper clip and place your finger
in the center of the band and then bend
the band around your finger at the
bottom bend up to little feet
make sure to bend it forward a bit to
keep the phone balanced all you have to
do now is spread out the legs about 45
degrees and place your phone in pretty
simple but if you are nervous about
scratching your device you may want to
try the second stand this one is even
easier all you need are two binder clips
a larger one and a smaller one on the
small clip clap the two arms together
and then while holding them bend the
body upwards then insert the arms
halfway into the mouth of the larger
clip then just place your phone in and
begin watching your favorite movie the
reason I like this stand is because you
can use it with either your phone and
landscape or portrait for the last stand
all you need is a small paper cup and a
pair of scissors or a box cutter I will
be using this four inch special CNET
Edition Cup to start cut two lines
across from each other down about an
inch from the bottom of the cup when
connecting the two lines cut a curved
line this will help your phone stay in
place you can also cut a small hole in
the back and run a charger through it
these are only some of the ways that you
can make your own smart phone stand but
really with a little creativity you can
use just about anything
