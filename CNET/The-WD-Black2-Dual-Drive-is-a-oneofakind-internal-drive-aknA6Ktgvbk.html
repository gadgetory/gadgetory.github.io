me how to make your computer a lot
faster for cheap my first answer is can
you sell a small SSD like this one right
on 20 gig and another hard drive right
here that way you put the optic system
on the SSD and data on the hard drive
you have both performance and capacity
now of course you can only do this with
a desktop computer that brings me to my
second answer which is this all-new like
to don't drive from WT I take a look
here this is exactly a standard laptop
drive which it is but on the insider
we'd have to separate drive one of them
is a 120 gigabytes SD and the other one
is a one terabyte hard drive basically
it is the other solution here crammed
into one small standard box now it's
important to note that this is not a
hyper trying and that's because the two
drives on inside I never meant to be
most together into one partition they
remain two separate drives in other
words in Windows computer it will fire
the to drive on inside as two separate
drive letters such as C and D it's not a
hyperdrive also because it offers you
real SSD performance let me show you all
right i have here an old laptop your
five or six years ago there was a beast
cutting edge but now it's kind of too
heavy and too big and cut it too slow if
you notice there's a stain on top here
and that's because we'd use a lunch tray
for a while now this computer come with
a 100 gigabyte hard drive and it take
quite long time to boot and everything
is quite slow now notice the windows
experience index here for storage is
five point oh that's five point out of
five point nine which is the cap in
window vista now let's put some new life
into this by swapping the harddrive out
with this black to not going to show you
the entire swapping process you can
check that out in my other how-to video
baidu tell you that the black to here
comes included with system clone
software and this very handy you speed
through point go to
SATA cable just make sure that your Oh
hard drive has less than 120 gigabyte of
data on it and that's because out of the
box only the SSD Drive of the black 2 is
recognized this is to make sure that you
win clone or install the office system
on it when that's all done it's a
download install and run the black to
participate affair that will unlock and
format the one terabyte hard drive has a
new petition now there you go you can
see you have to drive now the 100
gigabyte see drive at a one terabyte D
Drive now note that the window explain
index now is 5.9 a huge improvement
again 5.9 is as high as can be in window
vista now in my testing the black to
don't drive was indeed very fast about
as fast as any entry level SSD and it
offers a lot more storage space than any
SSD on the market for that reason is
totally worth the three hundred dollars
prior tech now for more under don't
drive here check out my full review com
you know it's pretty great not as great
as a single high and high-capacity
solid-state drive though or better yet
two of them together if you can afford
that which I do I have them right here
750 gig 400 cake together that's only
because I'm don't know and this has been
the first look at the black too don't
drive 4wd
