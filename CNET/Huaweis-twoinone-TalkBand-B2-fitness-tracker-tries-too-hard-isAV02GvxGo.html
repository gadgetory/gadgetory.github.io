world but that's before I got my hands
on the Huawei talk band b2 this device
is part activity tracker and the other
part is a bluetooth earpiece for making
phone calls when you receive a call on
your smartphone the talk band will
vibrate and either display the name of
the contact calling or the phone number
you can then pop out that your piece
place it in your ear and begin a
conversation on my end things sounded
pretty good but for the people I was
speaking with it sounded like I was far
away or was talking to them on
speakerphone but this is only one of the
features the talk Dan can do it's also
an activity tracker that's capable of
measuring the steps you take distance
traveled calories burned and your sleep
at night there's also a vibration on
board that can be used to wake you up in
the morning or remind you to get up and
move unfortunately battery life is a
problem Huawei claims you'll get around
six days depending on how much you use
the device but I got only three and a
half days and that wasn't with many
phone calls this is a lot worse than
other activity trackers most of which
can last at least a week I'm also not
the biggest fan of the overall design
the earpiece makes it bulky the screen
is hard to read outdoors and the device
is only splash proof so you can't wear
it in the shower or the pool the one
shining feature about the talk band is
that's the first third-party device that
can sync with Jawbone's powerful up
software this opens the door to jawbone
smart coaching and insights that I find
really helped motivate me to reach my
health and fitness goals syncing wasn't
always smooth though because you still
have to sync with Huawei's mobile app
which will then sync to the jawbone app
you're just better off buying a cheaper
and in my opinion better job on up to or
the Fitbit charge the talk band b2 is
available now in the US for $180 for
more information be sure to check out my
full review over at cnet.com I'm Dan
Rydell prasena and that was a first look
at the Huawei talk band v2</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
