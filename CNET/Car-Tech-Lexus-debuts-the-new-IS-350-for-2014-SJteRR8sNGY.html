detroit auto show and i'm looking at the
new Lexus IS lexus they viewed this car
here it's an update from the previous
model big update tooth alexis has this
new design language would sit ruled out
on the GS the ES and the LS and we see
it on this car especially in the front
end the grill we have the spindle grille
that lexus has got on those other cars
also the headlights are very distinct
they've got these sculpted headlights
you see them kind of form around their
projectors and also a separate LED
parking strip just below that in a
totally separate area now the side of
the car also shows more sculpting than
some of the other cars it's got this
nice little kick contour line up towards
the back now this is the is 350 model
that means it has a 3.5 liter v6 this
engine has not changed at all from the
previous version they just carried that
over but it is a pretty advanced engine
it has port injection and direct
injection this interesting dual system
that they rolled out then still good
it's good for over 300 horsepower
six-speed automatic transmission
standard in fact that's all you get more
interesting is Lexus also debuted a
hybrid version of this car at the show
the is 300h that's a 2.5 liter direct
injection four cylinder with an electric
motor for extra boost I would expect
that to come in at over 200 horsepower
that should be a pretty good mix for
spirited driving and good fuel economy
but lexus is not going to sell that car
in the US at least not yet they've
earmarked that car for Europe and other
markets cabin tech also gets updated in
the new is they've actually gotten rid
of the previous touchscreen and gone to
their Remote Touch system which works
kind of like a computer mouse they also
get traffic information through HD radio
that means it's free for
I'm when cutting i'm here at the 2013
