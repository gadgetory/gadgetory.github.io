standing next to the hoover windtunnel 3
performance bagless upright vacuum this
vacuum surprised me a lot it's a hundred
and seventy nine dollars and I expected
it to perform on par with other 179
dollar vacuums that we had in this test
set like the Bissell power glide deluxe
Pat vacuum which retails for the same
price the Hoover did perform really well
with fine particulate on carpet on low
pile it performed the best and it was a
close second place on mid pile carpet it
didn't do very well with pet hair or
large particles so this vacuum is
definitely not for pet owners or people
with small children always dropping
cereal all over the floor but if you
just want something that can manage dust
and fine particle that gets in your
carpet this would be a decent option one
of the things I really like about it is
how customizable it is and I know I keep
talking about this in vacuums like the
Electrolux precision brush roll clean or
the Eureka but I really like when
manufacturers give you options
recognizing the fact that you will
probably have more than one type of
flooring in your home no one has carpet
wall-to-wall everywhere you'll probably
have some tiled areas or some hardwood
and Hoover recognizes that and give you
this dial that allows you to adjust
different settings on the height of the
vacuum and the brushroll based on what
kind of flooring you have in your home
the tools work really well it's got this
awesome pet tool that powers through
it's got rubber plastic type blades that
scrape pet hair off of your upholstery
or carpet and the crevice tool is shaped
really really interestingly so that
it'll get not only against the crevice
between your baseboard and your carpet
but also really get down into that crack
so again it's a great vacuum for fine
particulate and being in the sub $200
category it's also a little bit
friendlier for your wallet if you do
have pets or you're looking for
something that's in the same price range
that performs a bit more consistently
across different categories I would look
at the hundred and $79 Bissell
Powerglide deluxe pet vacuum but if you
like Hoover and you
is the brand before and you just need
something to help you with day-to-day
maintenance and aren't going to put your
carpet or floors pet hair or large
debris the Hoover would be a decent
choice for CNET I'm Katy Pilkington</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
