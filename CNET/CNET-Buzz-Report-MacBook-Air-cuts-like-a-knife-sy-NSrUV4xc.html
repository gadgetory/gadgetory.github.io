report the show about the tech news that
everyone is talking about this week
Apple freak-outs the tablet wars begin
for real and hey it gets better but
first it's the gadget of the week the
gadget of the week is the new macbook
air it's got roughly the shape and sharp
narrow edge of a butcher knife and the
guts of an entry-level macbook except
the graphics those are pretty good
there's a 13.3 inch and an 11 inch model
in the prices range from 99 to 1599 all
the new airs are flash memory only so
Steve Jobs promises instant on
performance like the iPad super long
battery life like the iPad and he also
said that Apple is opening up an app
store for the mac which would mean you
could download apps on your flash memory
super thin super sexy laptop kind of
like the iPad except for two to three
times the cost so i gotta say i'm going
to the ipad on this one now speaking of
Apple the company also held its earnings
call this week and Wow here's a surefire
way to pep up those boring earnings
conference calls have Steve Jobs show up
unannounced and let him go ape nuts
talking smack about the competition
Google loves to characterize Android is
open and iOS and iPhone as clothes we
find this a bit disingenuous and
clouding the real difference between our
two approaches in a five-minute rent he
talked about how 7 inches isn't enough
for a tablet screen because the app
experience is terrible and you'd have to
file down your fingers to use it maybe
he forgot that his company also makes
the iphone has apps on it little and
also that Apple is probably working on a
7 inch iPad I mean come on you know it's
coming and what it does he's going to
tell us all about why it's the bee's
knees all of a sudden jobs then went on
to extol the virtues of apple's
consistent user experience as opposed to
the fragmented nature of android and
then he took some potshots at rim along
the way which caused rims co-ceo to
shoot back that hey maybe people like a
choice of different tablet sizes and how
about if Steve Jobs stops trying to tell
consumers what to think from up there in
reality distortion land he really said
that
CEO fight then I kind of wish that Steve
Jobs would have an earnings call hissy
fit every week because it was awesome
and actually we're about to see whether
people are digging the 7-inch tablet
after all because the first serious
7-inch tablet the Samsung Galaxy Tab
finally has a price and a release date
it's headed to verizon november 11th for
599 bucks a verizon data plan is
available for twenty bucks a month but
no contract required plus you get
android hdmi a front facing camera and
that smaller lighter footprint so let
the tablet games begin and finally let's
have a look at what's clogging the tubes
this week it's the It Gets Better
Project after the recent rash of gay
teen suicides the Internet has been
coming together as only the Internet can
it started when columnist dan Savage put
out a call for people to post videos
then a YouTube video of a Texas City
Councilman tearfully telling teens that
it does get better got more than 3
million views now gay and lesbian google
employees have recorded a video even
Hillary Clinton is doing one and you
know it's rare that we can stand up here
and say that the Internet is saving
lives but people at the it gets better
and The Trevor Project say that they
have seen an increase in calls to
suicide hotlines so in this case it is
and good job internet and yes everyone I
promise it does get better and that's
the buzz report for this week everyone
i'm molly wood and thank you for
watching
and you feel like there's no hope that
there's no one who will ever understand
you I'm a software engineer now at
Google I'm and I just want to tell you
straight forward that things get so much
better as you leave high school you are
not going to be under the control of
those bullies anymore you're going to be
in control of your own life</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
