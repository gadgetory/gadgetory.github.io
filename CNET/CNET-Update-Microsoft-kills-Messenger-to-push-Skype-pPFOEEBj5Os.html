away message forever I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your scene at update Windows
Live Messenger is a goner microsoft
announced that it will kill life
messenger early next year in order to
get everyone using skype for instant
messaging users will be able to transfer
their contacts in the latest version of
skype and this Skype app does work with
more devices like the iPad and Android
tablets there's a windows phone 8
version of skype on the way but there's
no word on when it will arrive in the
windows App Store the goal for Microsoft
is to have you run skype on your machine
all day long and use it as your main
chat service not just for video and
voice calls the new Xbox SmartGlass app
is now available for Apple devices the
app turns an iOS device into a second
screen for navigating the xbox dashboard
you can use the screen keyboard for
faster typing so you don't have to buy
one of those keyboard accessories and
some games have extra features for the
second screen like halo 4 and dance
central 3 and if you're wondering about
when we'll see an app for Microsoft
Office well it could be early next year
that's according to a report from the
verge it said the app would launch for
Apple and Android devices but you might
need a subscription to office 365 iOS
users can also get a sony reader app for
the first time there's no word from sony
on why it took so long to have its own
reader app for apple amazon has the
kindle app and there's the nook and Kobo
app so yeah anyone with a sony reader
account you can finally access your
books on an Apple device and speaking of
digital books DC Comics pants can now
read weekly digital issues in more ways
besides the comiXology or DC comics app
for the first time you can get weekly
single issue comics in the ebook stores
readers can find new issues for 70
titles in the kindle store apple
ibookstore and the nook book store one
comic you can see now is Action Comics
14 where astrophysicist Neil deGrasse
Tyson makes a cameo to help Superman
find his home planet of Krypton but he
did actually find and track down a
Krypton like system in our universe if
you have a telescope you can check it
out it's a red dwarf in the
constellation Corvus just
you know 27.1 light-years from Earth
