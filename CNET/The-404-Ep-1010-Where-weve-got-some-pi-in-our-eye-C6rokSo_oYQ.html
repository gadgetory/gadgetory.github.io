geeks out there that's pi day yeah 2012
it's the 404 show on Sina TV I'm Jeff
Bakalar and I'm Justin you this is the
show where got some pie in RI little bit
just a little bit towards the outside
their type that out it's rhubarb I love
rhubarb pie the best we got a great show
today just we went really late yeah
yearning the show because we got
distracted by the walking dead we did
and that's like one show that Jeff and I
watch pretty much every week yeah we
watch that you know it's it's okay um if
you ever want to get into a conversation
like that make sure you join our live
chat room that's every day Monday
through Friday roughly 12 noon eastern
time area that's at cnet accomplished
live I just like the idea of speculating
about what would happen to me and you
know like what friends I would choose to
walk around with if there was a zombie
invasion you ever think about that like
oh if I could choose like maybe 10
friends to be in my camp like The
Walking Dead yeah who would you choose
and what skills would you base that off
of you know I mean like I would choose
you because to think like that what
because I still as realistic as The
Walking Dead sort of appears yeah it's
still not like I just don't you can
never know what the world would be like
and what I mean you could speculate on
what you would pick up to put in your
duffel bag if you happen to be like in a
home depot right when the zombie
invasion happen if you mean like what
would you fill your bag with like food
would you get a crossbow or me just
gotta get weapons I just gotta get like
what guns like freaking brought you the
wrong answer J but that's stupid because
you don't know what kind of zombie world
you're entering well it was there a body
shot to the head evil would have all
these zombies are deaf and you can shoot
as much as you want right and you got it
you got to think about like whether the
zombies are fast or slow it's a lot it's
a lot to digest I like a fan zombie I'll
tell you that I like 28 days later
zombie oh where would you go we've
talked about this on
show before like what would be a good
zombie uh fortress freaking oil drilling
uh but island in the middle of the ocean
yeah where there are no supply about two
miles around you have a cruise ship you
know Bruce a cruise ship in the
middle of the Atlantic we're not no
zombies and you're fine no see I would
choose a schooner like what would you
schooner who drive this Krishna captain
the zombie kept the zombie captain you
know what wise that's a job far-fetched
concept and how could the zombies in
these TV shows like The Walking Dead
never pick up guns they always rely on
their bites but how come there's no
smart zombie someone should make a TV
show well highly developed intellectuals
on both offense I think walk up 28 days
later zombies did a good job at sort of
feeling out the world and sort of you
know I don't know The Walking Dead
zombies have intelligence they are
intelligent enough to sort of rip
through caught like your enemy right it
was like intelligence in its most basic
elementary form right is like left right
left foot right foot right yeah then
they realize okay you're in that broom
I'm gonna try and you know scratch away
you would imagine how many more steps of
intelligence does it take for zombie to
be like pick up his gun now yeah exactly
more something even as uh even as small
as like you know holding his hands out
to allow another zombie to step on it to
get over a gate you know like that would
be terrifying one zombie start giving
each other a boost yeah that's when
you're in trouble the apocalypse is
coming that's when you know it's all
over I'm serious you're when they start
talking I'd be terrified now all of a
sudden urges they just don't talk
intelligence is scary like hey Bill yeah
I know your jaws you get that guy I'm
gonna get this one over here yeah and
his color come back together case closed
right you're right it's time for a
smarter zombie movie I want a zombie to
turn to another zone and be like dude
I'm so hungry right now where's the new
pin I'll be honest gerald hi I'm park
right now you saw me to zombie need
human meat is there a Burger King close
by yeah I will settle for white castle
right that's how freaking hungry
haha man I could go for a big gulp yeah
you're right we're right dude yeah just
you and me baby I would choose you to be
in my zombie camp ok let's talk to the
cop I would fashion a hockey stick with
some sort of blade right and it would
just be game over yeah that's that's the
zombie movie maybe we're heading towards
an ice age zombie movie where it's like
a hundred years in the future right a
climate change has resulted in a new ice
age and it's only the ice skating hockey
players that are able to survive get
Kevin Smith's direct that me he would be
all over that would he not be yeah let's
change gears for a second man we could
go on about zombies all freaking day I
just want to kill one with you just want
to have that ability I feel like the
best zombie weapon would be a solar
powered chainsaw right someone needs to
invent that that the author be singers
with guns bullets run out right with uh
you need power to run a regular chain
saw but a solar powered chainsaw you a
wrong brother you ain't wrong perfect
weapon uh let's get do a few of the
stories that we've carved out today not
a lot going on the world attack really
know is there I mean let's be honest
there's some stuff I mean this is kind
of a depressing day for tech because we
got a few stories here about companies
shutting down so we talked about this a
couple weeks ago we've been noticing a
drop off in a IM support right like you
were you were saying that for some
reason you just couldn't log on to your
aim account anymore on meebo there was
one day my my handle that I've been
using for literally 15 years yeah
stopped working it did get it did come
back though okay I haven't updated yeah
i sent you i am with it oh that's right
that's all right i have several of your
counsel sherry bow sure but regardless i
think the reason for that drop-off might
have been because AOL is slashing
support on aim officially now and this
happened last friday so AOL has been
laying off a lot of people 40 employees
from its West Coast office and the
majority of those cuts were in the aim
division press release titled you're on
your own yeah done that's it the end of
aim support as we know it yeah I mean
this isn't very shocking yeah to have
that many people devoted to a to
a year old instant messaging platform
yeah I'm not saying it's not worth it I
guarantee you there are people in the
millions that still use it right right
well I think a lot of those people are
the older generations like us then used
an AOL account then transition to a man
just haven't gone off this year think
young people now are using facebook chat
King I'm gonna sound there's no reason
to have two websites open at the same
time I agree I agree can you does meebo
allow you to use facebook chat yes it
does it does yeah there's a facebook
login there's an a la terre really yeah
man I'm an old piece of crap you know
why too and I think this is a huge
reason that people use facebook jazz
because it logs every conversation you
have which is important when you're
trying to figure out you know this link
someone sent me two months ensure you
meebo does that as well you have logs
right regardless of the platform you're
using right right but I mean I think
people would prefer to just use facebook
cuz they already have it open right and
why not all your friends are already on
facebook you don't have to sign up for a
separate account for sure and it's an
end of an era it is an end of an era
sort of depressing but uh I mean it's as
long as it's still gonna work well I
mean yeah so then they cut a lot of the
employees that work at AOL and uh in the
aim team I guess they're only keeping
the support staff okay so hopefully you
know if something goes wrong with your
account maybe you can still talk to
somebody about troubles right and you
can still create a McCown stew to lurk
on your friend you can i have about let
me let me just flip a 75-70 activated
they're all kidding aside there was a
there was a brief period of maybe two to
three months where I just read nuts yeah
sometimes you'll come up with a good
idea for a handle immediately register
it on aim for sure it was just it was
like it was free for all yeah it was
like the early days of Napster what
would you do with those are countless
I've learned there were people totally
worthless I want to talk about this
we've been giving Apple a lot of
attention while it might not be positive
attention we've been giving Apple a lot
of attention lately I just wanted a real
quick go over a few things that HTC has
just come out and said they've confirmed
a bunch of phones that will be getting
ice cream sandwich okay so I just want
to run through this list real quick it's
uh it's kind of cool
that they are still supporting all of
these phones my old evo 4g would not be
included in this list of phones
unfortunately but check it out 16
devices called out by HTC ice cream
sandwich is in the works for the droid
incredible to amaze 4g EVO 3d so i got
jacked on the old the old vivo the old
evo ah let's see we got that up there
the evo design 4g sensation 4g the
resound will also get one as well as the
rhyme hmm um let's see and the
Thunderbolt it sounds like we'll be
getting it as well along with the HTC
Vivid right so there you go we talked a
lot about iOS ice cream sandwich I am a
big fan of I use it I love it I
encouraged to hack your device if you
could somehow support Ice Cream Sandwich
run it in my opinion is the best thing
android has done yeah so it's pretty
cool you know I haven't really updated
myself on the ice cream sandwich uh
upgrades either one killer app that's
going to come that everyone's really
looking forward to on ice cream Sam I
think that it is gonna be crazy sure I
think the big thing about ice cream
sandwich is the fact that you can oh it
just basically read you know redesigns
the entire interface okay so any i think
it's a it's a total you i think you they
don't even look anything alike you go to
gingerbread 2 to Ice Cream Sandwich and
it's just a complete and total design
change even logically to there's just a
it's just different it's like going from
you know night totally different uh so
yeah that there's not really killer app
they you know everything just natively
works better it's quicker right up so
yeah I'm loving it I'm reading some
features here that have come in Ice
Cream Sandwich panoramic camera support
built right into the camera app i think
is really cool i've been using a photo
stitch for iphone and was sure i came
natively yeah Android Beam that's kind
of crazy so near field communication for
things like bump or whatever if you want
to its cool contact information I have
yet to use the NFC chip in my phone yes
in the battery of my phone yeah it's
weird that's something you never think
about being embedded
does the iphone have that natively
builtin I don't I do not believe so yeah
no Andrew face unlock to I forgot about
that yeah but that's I mean come on is
it is like look are we clamoring to be
like hey yeah I'm not like it is that
you know me is it faster than a finger
swipe I guess exactly exactly it's it's
the great debate so there's little news
about ice cream sandwich uh what else we
got going on today this is on speaking
of end of an era yeah the Encyclopedia
Britannica going on the line there stop
there going to stop printing books I
think the bigger story is that they were
wise renew books yeah yeah for sure it's
amazing i if you asked me like oh when
was the last prett anacapri i would have
been like 98 yeah but no they've
actually continued to print books right
up until now it's active feel like
instead of actually printing the books
which they've done for I guess the last
two hundred and forty-four years they
come out to new versions every two years
240 for years even instead of doing the
like printing the real books with pages
inside they should probably just come
out with a set that looks like a set of
encyclopedia tanika's like made out of
cards or something sure no one ever
actually use these books they just put
them on their shelf to look smart this
you know what the thing is in like or
hide a gun in right like a whole line of
like secret you know hiding place
exactly now just stop me from wrong I
I'm gonna like you know philosophy you
know fosters a little bit here why
didn't protonic ax sort of see them I
mean they've been in business they
claimed two hundred and forty-four years
right at one point they had to have seen
the writing on the wall even when
something like in carta came out why
does didn't Britannica be like okay
let's get a jump on on what's happening
right why don't we maybe digitize our
entire encyclopedia collection keep it
dynamic where it can be updated yeah and
then license it out to like schools
around the world well they do that yeah
but but do they do that yeah yeah they
do that so it turns out that i did a
little research on this the freezing
what using wikipedia uh turns out that
the printed version of the books only
account for about one percent of which
makes
surely revenue sure right because no
one's freaking buying these leather
bound books right anymore 400 pounds of
books yeah as attractive it used to be
exactly and have other things that hold
up the weak spots on my desk exactly to
do that anymore and uh so yeah so
fifteen percent of the the revenue comes
from our online sales okay I have a
subscription service and that's used for
you know their online encyclopedia which
they've been publishing since 1984 so
they did for see the popular all right
the almost 20 years right right although
it's a global cyclopedia britannica
website nothing good looks like it was
updated once in 1980 that's awful and
then the other eighty-four percent on
sir the other eighty-five percent is
sales from like uh education purposes so
but did you like or out to curriculum so
they do yeah what are they licensing out
well I think their licensing out their
books your software or the book both to
be used in the actual school because
perfect scenario sort of situation i see
is 0 is a is it experience where it's
like you know people I feel like
teachers if you do like a bibliography
and you cite Wikipedia yeah it's still
like a no-no right yeah no that's still
not okay britannica they've got that
sort of brand you know sort of integrity
legitimacy going right you know make it
so that their people are using your you
know brand and not the books you know
make this whole software sort of
experience package that you sell to a
school right forces the kids to do the
research and modernizes it all the same
time there should be a really easy
hyperlinking button to the Encyclopedia
Britannica so that when you're writing
articles online yeah you know or when
you're writing papers for school you can
immediately site it and put a link right
to the article it's crazy be easy it
would pay we're just way ahead of the
way ahead of it you know yeah um all
right you want to take a break it would
break I got a funny video okay that's
similar yeah we'll take a break when we
come back videos voicemails and a lot
more fun on the 404 stick around because
the fun will keep on going we promise
you that stay tuned this is the
404 emmer effer 'he's the show where we
all sing songs
you
welcome back to the 404 yeah yeah a lot
of fun to be had today yeah when it's
just you and me what's that what's that
will smith song we should have played
yeah we're doing me I think you owe is
that it except that's about will smith
and his son so in this case who is the
dad and who is the son i guess i'm the
dead you're not the dad dare you that's
fair try to send me i will son the
creditor you need to know that little
boy could talk about this story really
quick i mean we only had three in the
rundown yeah let's hear it really have
one more left I think it's really funny
sure so we've talked about methods that
the UK has tried to use to deter youth
from loading or loitering around public
areas yeah they have a really problem
with that apparently yeah they hate kids
just hanging around yeah they don't they
don't like kids having fun yeah um so
we've talked about this in the past uh
there's been like different types of
things used like I think they was tryin
to blast Mozart uh we talk we have we
talked about that like there's much i
owe you lots yeah because apparently
hanging out in places where they play
Mozart is really uncool it reminds me
that episode where cartman just blasting
metallica hippies yeah stuff like that
apparently is really easy but uh the
recent plan and just placed on cotton
cardiff street that's in a london's fair
fair water district they've been using
pink street lights to deter youths from
loitering because apparently bright pink
luminescent lights really make acne show
up more prominently than regular luh ya
then regular dude that's that's maniacal
i don't i mean like that's really really
cool is it's like man what what's the
word how do you describe how cool and
mean and terrible that it's humiliating
yeah but at the same time it's freakin
clever he's really clever originally
shaming these poor yakhni reading kids
how you gonna hang out when you have to
look at each other like this you know it
is i think this is one step short of
just getting a bullhorn and just being
like hey
kid without ya hey reads of is that your
pants yeah like that for sure I like one
step short of just hiring Louis CK to go
very it's super passive-aggressive way
yeah this is mess you know I mean yeah
like they really are taken a very
creative and aggressive step just all
while remaining sort of you know right
uh on you know civilizing sort of a
violent rioting I guess so but then
you're also i don't know you're also
pushing away adults with acne too and
that yeah that's a bad thing oh it
affects everybody it's not just kids
that's funny man I'm loving that super
messed up that is super mr. God all kids
have acne to you know some canal clear
skin so because you'd be like oh cool my
sure it's pink now what of it or what if
some kids like hey check out this mask
that I can wear its don't hang out yeah
don't they have a buttload of those v
for vendetta mask okay like this car
which is wearing those around yeah
that's it I used to do this though I
used to hang out like in 7-eleven
parking lots and you know like yeah lot
to do where you grew up oh yeah yeah
like dead suburbia is just like clerks
was it really no not really no not at
all it's better than that honey what
beach is not clerks I was just gonna say
there had to be a few things to do yeah
I mean but you know kids are all about
just hanging out like fast food parking
lot it's just wanted I just want to dick
around yeah what was it about being a
kid and just being like what do you do
tonight sitting on the hood of a car
yeah i'm just gonna actually drive
around the same sort of three mile track
that I've worked out in my head and you
know sort of see what's going on that's
all you know just gonna increase the
chances of me getting pulled over yes
please I'm trying to do a drive fast I
couldn't drive it I'm gonna really floor
it when this light turns green yeah I
can't wait well kids I guess kids would
always hang out in front of God we're
just dating ourselves today no we're not
come on I think kids do that because
they're always looking for people to
like buy cigarettes for them that's why
they hang out in front of 7-11 sore like
get older kids to buy drinks yeah not
what happens is anyone ever asked you to
do that yeah yeah did you ever do it
yeah you did no I don't do that but not
you can be honest no one's coming to
arrest well I wouldn't do it not for
profit but yeah of course you gotta give
him that tact right exacting and
handling right there's a tax that you
gotta its total get to you gotta try
yeah it's like it it's a toll it's an
unwritten law that it's a toll come on
we should be honest here I don't
actually do that I don't know it's not
anymore at Lisa proof of kidding kidding
if you do that no no no I mean now man
calls from the public time ladies and
gentlemen I'm to show the love a jig
6404 cnet getting a bird's-eye view of
our studio here is our lovely empty
studio yeah we've is it I like this
though just a lot of direct eye contact
with each other I mean I've never really
gotten to have a chance to just peer
into your ocular cavity what do you see
just a lot of hurt I see a lot of pain
and I see I feel like I see clogged
arteries yeah fantasize now I'm missing
her calls from the public we got a guy
who is trying to correct me on something
I said yesterday in regard to some
Batman lore hey guys you're in for cam
patient I wanted to correct Jeff is a
delicious mistaken on yesterday's
episode in regards to talk 19 or bad
meal in school Joker I don't think your
ties the producer is caught by some kind
of grant waning broke yeah he's right
okay so let me preface this we were
talking yesterday about how Batman
doesn't kill people right I said yeah he
does he dropped the Joker off the oh and
the move right first move I was talking
about the Bert the Burton the first 10
you taught my Heath Ledger no no no he
clearly Heath Ledger clearly does not
right let me take that back the joker
does not die in that in the dark knight
yeah Joker clearly does not die he's
just upside down for that last scene
right but but in the first batman film
with Jack deficit and uh and and Michael
Keaton right no question no question
about it he falls from the top of a
church tower yeah and all the way down
and it goes boom but not hard enough to
break that chattering teeth thing right
whatever that it keeps going like it all
time pretty creepy
that's what I was talking about and they
before he lets go of the Joker they lock
eyes yeah hi guys and you could tell
that Bruce is like sorry brother it was
one of those like gloved hand whole
games right and then he was just like
yeah yes gloves got slippery yeah bye
jack someone should make a make a
compendium of all the scenes in movies
where the people intentionally has hands
on the good son yeah that's our oil that
for anyone who hasn't seen it sure
Macaulay Culkin dies by glove drop
that's that's like on his death
certificate yeah died via club yeah we
have a call from Clarissa she explains
it all hey guys Florence is from Houston
and I know y'all were wanting feedback
on your guest totes and what shows
people of joy room in 2012 and I didn't
leave anything out because I didn't need
a game code but I did want let you know
that I really enjoy when tideline
yesterday's show is really good and it
seems like you guys would tie and like a
dill and even like Bridget to you guys
seem very comfortable and it seems like
everybody you know I appreciate you
together pretty well and it's noticeable
like the way that everybody meshes
together and so those earrings are in my
opinion the best so keep it up and on
the show I well thanks for the call
Clarissa I appreciate that feedback
because it's helping and it's true ty is
a really good guest outsize awesome we
actually tried to pull a Hail Mary today
but he was busy and we walked into this
a meeting that was very fun um yeah so
thanks for the feedback we definitely
take that with you know in very high
regard right so you know the you know
we're sort of curious i think we're at
the point in the show where you know
we've been lining up some some some
people that we sort of want to talk to
you right arm but if you guys really
have suggestions inside or outside you
know we're taking everything into
consideration yeah for sure but ty will
be on again yeah in the meantime the
thing is is like you know to be totally
honest with people you know p
who work here they can't just all of a
sudden be like oh I'm on the four Vorta
it's a big investment is a big
commitment it's right in the middle of
the day yeah it's unfair to almost go to
you know one of these people who already
working on and establish up and be like
hey we're just going to remove half your
day yeah and you're just going to come
and work with us work work work whatever
you know coats in the air whatever you
want to do next call in regards to the
whole 4s 4g debacle hey guys thank you
whoops I played the wrong one um there
we go hey 44 I just wanted to comment
about the 4s having the 4g logo on the
new update i think that this has more to
do with AT&amp;amp;T than Apple due to the fact
that 18d has been advertising their
hspa+ network as a 4G network outside of
the whole LTE thing and of course they
always say that they have the largest 4g
network which includes probably LTE and
the rest of their hspa+ network all
right so beso so at the end of the day
this makes a lot more sense we were sort
of jumping to conclusions being like
it's Apple taking advantage of a
standard well it's not just Apple right
you know aight you got imagine that top
bar all that informations dictated by
the carrier right right and once the
collar makes a really good point saying
that you know in all of 18 tease
marketing they mentioned that they have
the largest 4g network but that includes
both LTE and HSPA+ correct you are sir
so that's I mean that seems a little
dubious yeah to be saying that I agree
let's get to some emails before we gotta
get out of here today okay this is from
our buddy in Newark there's a link in
here i want you to click on uh he says
hello 40 for being born and raised in
newark new jersey just wanna let you
know that there is already a batman cop
who works for the Newark Police
Department really he works for the
Newark Police Department he started in
the early 90s as a truancy officer
riding around in just a black iroc-z
with a batman logo attached to the side
wow these days the forces give him
giving him a lot more money and he has a
fully decked out Batmobile and wears a
serious batman costume oh my god alright
so he says in this
wha jersey city from irving check it out
legal and he's no joke look at this guy
in his like Chevy what is that I don't
know what but it's a legit Batman
consciously on gold wings the with the
doors that pop up outside is that coming
out but it's costume to his little
beefcake pretty badass yeah his little
beef gay like college costume gets
updated for the movies too it looks like
the current Christian Bale Christopher
Nolan car yeah he's you know it makes
sense he's not uh he's not about to stay
stuck in like nineteen ninety-six Batman
do you think he talks in the Batman
voice too because that's not something
you can just hold her off yeah something
like that or do I don't know maybe he's
just like hey it's me Gennaro Ortiz
which is apparently what his name is but
think about it if you ok let's say
you're you know you're on the street or
whatever and Batman shows up ok I'm
sorry some guy dressed up as Batman yeah
shows that like are you intimidated I
would first ask to see a badge because
I'm looking at this picture right now
there's no badge yeah he is badgeless I
probably be like get away from me Batman
yeah I give you my licen how about you
get a real job yeah you know and then
when he goes on to tell me that he's
actually a real police officer I mean
where along the line do you buy that
story and I'm really hoping is not
pulling people over just for speeding
tickets do you know I did Batman's
reserved for more serious I would hope
Batman is not assigned to traffic duty
yeah right and Batman should always be
seen beating somebody up yeah you know I
mean like you can't just see Batman
eating lunch at a rallies or something
you're right you're totally right break
down that fourth wall next email Dwayne
from Barbados says in writing a writing
in about the story regarding the next
Xbox not having a disk drive I want to
stress that even though this is a rumor
I don't think it's true he says I think
we're missing something the new story
speaks to the next Xbox not having a
disk drive nothing about abandoning
physical media okay so no optical drive
but that doesn't necessarily mean it's
going to get rid of physical media as ty
was speaking and passing about the Vita
what if Microsoft went back to using
cartridges could you imagine could you
imagine the xbox 720 just has like a
little flash thing you pop into your
Xbox when I don't know with technology
so
advanced and sizes and cost of these
flash mediums getting cheaper and harder
to hack what if Microsoft stopped using
DVDs and blu-rays and went for an all
cart based system it helps fight piracy
I'm not sure about that if its
proprietary and we know it will be well
i don't i don't know if that's the case
yeah because if you look at the nintendo
DS those are four cartridges you could
buy from china and you pop in they were
the same form factor they just invent
you know so i don't i'm not a I'm not
totally sold on the fact that
proprietary cartridges combat piracy but
they are more durable than your standard
optical disc though right they can
survive a lot more but a blu-ray did
have you about you guys are pretty in
Israel you could you could do and you
could basically do anything to a blu-ray
yes okay you can weaponize you could you
drag a brazier all over that thing and
it's it's like really that's the best
you're gonna do i'm batman it does
that's how he protects all of his media
uh so that's your two cents all right
Dwayne it's uh you know take your
suggestion hard for sure that talk about
my visit to the museum of moving image a
weekend no so if you ever visit that
museum it's an astoria up uptown okay
and they have a whole separate section
just for video games okay and alongside
like Ataris and old like whatever
consoles sure they also have a super
nintendo set up along with the sega
genesis with the first game which was
like apparently Sonic the Hedgehog right
it's so that made me feel really really
old I think that's yeah first ones those
items find their way into a museum yeah
and have you ever seen a placard that
exists in a museum that just has 1994
too sure well I shouldn't be like this
feels weak its way to read that wasn't
that long ago do that messed up she's
very young kids like maybe like six or
seven year olds now that we're sitting
down in front of the Super Nintendo and
it said press start to engage the game

start button on the controller and so
they were struggling to figure out how
to even begin the game there's you're
making a sound like we're freakin cave

picture it's on my phone maybe I'll
bring it up right there but uh it was an
SNES console yeah but encased in a plat
