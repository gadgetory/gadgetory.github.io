Chang I'm
out for dang googles duplex is getting
unleashed I'm sort of the surprisingly
human like AI will go through limited
public testing if you remember Google
showed off duplex at i/o having a call a
restaurant and make a reservation and it
felt scary human with a complete with
thumbs and likes and awkward pauses are
you what do you think you freaked out I
can't wait for the all AI podcast that
will eventually happen 350 die brought
to you by Google and duplex most I don't
know what you think how do you feel
about this um um I don't know yeah this
could go on yeah that's basically the
new AI podcast but I don't think I don't
think I'm creeped out by it I don't
think I'm gonna get calls from like I
hope that the way that it rolls out
eventually like once it's everywhere is
that basically an opt-in kind of
scenario like basically don't call me
with AI unless I give you approval to
was how it's rolling out right now
there's like five different restaurants
around playing in our area I know they
said they were gonna notify people yes
this was do play if this wasn't a the
call starts with like hi this is a
Google assistant I'm calling to see if I
can make a reservation that's still kind
of creepy it's like hi it makes it even
worse it's like I know this is an
assistant now and it sounds eerily human
just I don't have a problem with that I
think things easier for me I don't have
to call anybody I do this kind of stuff
I know I know Millennials hate to call
people is this don't talk just one of
those things like why would you have the
assistant do that why can't I just have
like an online portal to do that like
make a reservation like click open table
yeah something like that
but like all right next up we want to
talk about the BlackBerry key to Jessica
dual court has a review out and
unsurprisingly it's this is a phone for
physical keyboard diehards you know I
had a chance to play with it the
keyboard definitely was better but it
wasn't enough to get me to switch from
an all screen I used to be I used to be
a keyboard diehard like years ago to the
point where like I think I had a phone
with a keyboard up until like 2014 oh
wow it was like a pretty recent
it was just one of those things that was
just like I really enjoyed being able to
type without looking yep and I could
just like walk down the street and like
respond the next do you find that you
can now type on your screw that yes yes
i-i've kind of f wrote out that blew my
mind and then also I was just like like
that people were doing it but then now
I've been able but I still have to check
to see what I wrote is actually what I
wanted to write wanna keyboard or you
know check yeah I know I know I said so
for again for the the few fans of black
bear out there this is a worthy upgrade
if you're into blackberries with
physical keyboards otherwise let's go
ahead and skip yep so want to talk about
smart watches the the market may be kind
of a bust unless you're the Apple watch
everything everything else is kind of
man but Qualcomm sees a lot of potential
in kids wearing them and actually
introduced a new processor a new
platform for children's smartwatches
where the processors for kids yeah what
about it the processor will power to
power smartwatches designed specifically
for kids so I mean I are they really
targeting kids are they targeting
parents who want their kids wearing the
excellent question I think they're yeah
they're really targeting parents who
want some sort of wearable that they can
track their kids with these are watches
with a built-in LTE connection
definitely more power efficient than the
watches that we're getting so they're
not super sophisticated they do the job
in terms of keeping track yeah I think
their biggest challenge will be like
keeping it cheap and keeping it durable
I'm sure like kids break everything and
like true I really wouldn't trust like
putting a smart like $150 like
SmartWatch I'm like would you trust
thirty or forty dollars probably yeah
but I would also have to know like how
often does it break true ya know these
these things will definitely have to be
durable it's funny they actually make up
half the market already and they're
mostly out of China so that says a lot
for the SmartWatch SmartWatch market
mm-hmm for morning story she could sound
seen it I'm Roger Chang I'm Alfred
ringing thanks for sitting
musics getting more and more dramatic
all the time not bad not bad
just like our life oh yeah my my life
today has been relatively drama-free
thanks his slack being down I drop my
drama today I didn't even involve slag
goes on the train if he saw my tweet
this morning I did not um there was a
man squeezed in with me on the subway oh
and I see no I'm not honestly I was
standing up and he gets in on the train
and he I don't know why but he picks the
spot right next to me makes like a
90-degree angle with his shoulder in my
shoulder hey he's just there he's like
his squeezed up space elsewhere yeah
there was space elsewhere I mean there
wasn't there wasn't at the time but then
once space opened up he stayed there and
I realized both of us were too stubborn
to move because it's like this is our
spot so I spent 45 minutes there like
like a like tuna and a can with this guy
even though just like elsewhere just
because you didn't want back with my
space I was there first
he should well I hope you enjoyed that
oh yeah it's really nice yeah it's about
the principle to whoever was on that
train with Alfred I thank you for that
story all right so as per usual we're
gonna jump into the chants they're
taking your questions and comments the
first one that really caught my eye is
from a Katherine Emma who says I have
children and I think this will take off
this is obviously in reference to the
Smart Watch initiative put forward by
Qualcomm a Katherine we'd like to hear
you elaborate on this a little bit and
what you think is gonna be beneficial to
you as a parent and what you think other
parents could actually take away from
this Oh Roger you're a parent yeah not
to Alfred
well no I another follow-up question
like if you don't mind how old are your
kids and you know what age do you feel
that you know slapping a SmartWatch on
them is appropriate cuz I have a
two-year-old right now and he's
obviously he's too young for this but
there's gonna be some point where I'm
gonna have to have a debate with my wife
but whether or not these smartwatches
are actually gonna be useful yeah I I
was just thinking about this like one
kids tech event that I went to like two
years like a year ago where they had all
these tablets and stuff for kids but
then they had this whole other section
just for like smartwatches for like kids
and stuff and all these parents are at
the event table
this is really helpful because like I
know where my kid is after school if
there was an emergency I can contact
them directly that way without all like
the issues that come with like having a
smartphone cuz that's essentially why
parents get smartphones for their kids
right but they were also like oh I don't
want them on Facebook or like Instagram
all the time with like a SmartWatch you
really get all the advantages of that
without having like them being
distracted on social media and all the
stuff all the time and I also noticed
that during Apple's event when they
announced all those updates the Apple
watch that was very family-oriented
there oh yeah yeah I got from the
walkie-talkie feature had like these two
siblings using with each other oh I
can't picture even the as a when my kids
a teenager like buying him a lower 300
400 dollar Apple watch yes I don't know
I can picture that because by the time I
have a teenage I'll probably be very
rich let's continue to elaborate on this
Isaac tan says SOS is great especially
when the kids are starting to go to
school on their own oh yeah life
improvement sites that GPS tracking for
your child could potentially be
beneficial and Rafael is asking if you
guys in your opinion think that this
will really kind of pan out and work as
far as I'm taking it from the marketing
perspective because as we said
smartwatches they're not new but
directing them well they're getting MIT
kids is that going to is that going to
give a shot in the arm to this industry
well I think they're already working in
China as I said it's it's making up
almost half the market already I mean I
think it's it's a relatively easy pitch
to parents I think universally right
like the idea that this thing will give
you location information and there are
apps that do this if you know if you've
got your if you can has a smartphone
already that I mean there are things
that do that but you know for that kind
of middle aged between when they're a
little too young for a SmartWatch like a
big colorful rivairy tough resistant
SmartWatch might be a good alternative
and like they're plenty of apps to sort
of take advantage of that location right
the idea that you know if your kid
leaves the school zone you get an alert
in funeral if the kids in a place that
he or she isn't supposed to be you get
alert like that stuff is pretty useful
it's pretty as you said all this stuff
like makes sense in theory though but
like in practice I'm having a hard time
seeing this play out with like no kid
wants to be tracked all the time by
their parents like III whoa look that's
the thing like the idea is like you have
to win if you want that level of freedom
like yeah you have to wear that watch I
think that's ultimately what it is like
you're probably thinking from a sixteen
seventeen yes I'm thinking from like a
nine or ten-year-old perspective like
where they're a little too young to
really say eff this I'm gonna take the
watch off yeah well maybe I'm I mean
yeah I don't know I thought I was pretty
clever when I was like 12 in the sense
like what you really wore - I know but
that's one of the things where I was
just like oh just like if I were like a
12 year old kid I would just say like
the battery on it died or something
right like I'm sure that's why I'm sure
I'm sure they're workarounds for it yeah
but I fully robbed me yes it's another
thing to think about like what if like
school bullies are like stealing these
and like using them to sell for like
well that's that's a whole other problem
then well yeah address with the school
that's it's not like oh well I'm okay
the bully took your watch I guess we're
done with that no I'm just saying that
there are factors like in like kids
lives that like might not really be
considered here when maybe yeah it
depends again on the age right like if
you're six or seven nine or ten I don't
know like I don't I think those are less
of an issue as versus if you were in
later in junior high or high school yeah
I guess they don't have to be marketed
on like some sort of like TV show or
cartoon that was like we made this whole
cartoon just to sell toys to kids but
now it's smartwatches there you go
that's that's transformers and GI Joe
yeah but now with smartwatches so is
that gonna be the next kid craze TV show
like Pokemon but they're watches yeah
there was like yeah I collect them all
oh my god oh my god that's how they do
it though they make it cool and
collectible and that's true customizable
band that's where true yeah that's like
the kids on the hook cuz then they
become a fashion accessory because
remember when like lanyards were cool no
I'm like pogs were cool pogs though and
jeans were cool pogs are back in POG for
him hey a long time listener apec points
out that they have a kid starting
kindergarten this year congratulations
cast a major chapter in your life
and that they actually like the
SmartWatch idea the problem is will they
wear it and keep it on yeah that's not
yeah let's keep this conversation going
see what other incentivize programs we
can put into it from making them
customizable making them palatable the
kids make it up make it a toy right if
you're creating it for lunch money and
also maybe it's the way you presented to
your kid right you don't present it as a
tracker you present it as like here's
this cool new gadget or new toy now as a
kid that never listened to my parents
I'm just like I probably would have
never won this thing but like even if my
parents gave it to me a day there have
to be something that like I bought on my
own at what point though you never
listen you even when you were six or
seven like there's an age threshold
we're like this'll work maybe you're
right like after they get into junior
high or they into their teens like this
is no longer effective anymore yeah
that's what I'm saying like it would
have to be done with like oh this is
like cool like Drake is wearing this so
you should use all right just get right
to where yeah basically walk ahead do it
Qualcomm you get tricked wear these
watches and have his dad have like for
fun yo kids that's cool if I had this I
wouldn't keep it on cuz I was the kid
who was like constantly taking his pants
off me yeah exactly so like Brian knows
what I'm talking about it's a good thing
no one can see below the tape right life
improvements as GPS tracking for your
child sounds a little like a kid house
arrest
Isaac tan says for those worried about
kids losing the watch there should be a
sensor to send an alert when it is taken
off oh that's easy repoint hard to
balance idea is a good idea and on one
point but also a little spooky a little
stalkery totally totally I think well as
a parent I think I'm I'm airing
definitely on the stalkery side I mean
they're your kids yeah you'd do anything
to protect them that's exactly it
you know what if they don't use them I
feel like parents will still buy them
even if they don't necessarily work you
can just buy them say there's a watch
like here yeah there's a clue watch well
look so this is just for further context
this processor does support
Android wear which okay maybe it's not
that cool
it supports a 5 megapixel camera
supports LTE as I said Android oh this
is out now
no no this well the processors just got
released so you can imagine products
coming for the using this platform I
don't know did they did they give the 30
to $40 price range or was that was that
I think that's that's an estimate okay
yeah yeah like it would have to be and
imagine the ones that are successful in
China are relatively cheap yeah I'd I'd
buy that I tracked myself a question
from Channing che for alfred would you
actually trust a $40 SmartWatch to be a
very SmartWatch know also that you know
terrible security they're like oh yeah
we got a hacked like immediate that's a
fantastic point that I guess that's the
other point too like there's a lot if
like all that data out there on your
children like if it's that cheap they
better have like a very good security
team rich most of the times if it's
cheap I mean probably you know what
that's it would be a good place for
Google yeah make their own kid watch
things like it probably won't have its
own like LTE signal or anything like I
could probably have to connect here no
no no that's the hope oh really this
chip no but you're not gonna get that
for your kid like oh you online like
well I think it depends on the business
model like if I were smart
if I were Google I'm not smart or Google
I mean I create the cheap SmartWatch
because they can create cheap products
really really effectively have the LTE
built in and like have the track
basically you cover it just like yeah
Amazon covered for the handle yeah I was
gonna say I wonder if they could just do
what Kendall does where it's like just
like a 2g connection so it exactly it
just does a location thing and Google
pays for you have to worry about and I
think that would sell again you wouldn't
have to like pay for it exactly there
wouldn't be a monthly subscription yeah
just pay for the watch and that's it
yeah I mean Security's still an issue
but I don't but if it was a couple like
Google behind it yeah at least yeah but
you're right a lot of these watches
probably the for you look at what
happened he definitely the toys what was
that runner like that it wasn't Fitbit
but it was like something similar to
Strava oh yeah
all that data that was available yeah
yeah I think just from my perspective
here and not having kids but growing up
in a very small tight community town
that was a nice place to grow up felt
safe and the world changes the world has
gotten scarier I like this idea as an
option better than the alternative which
is parents putting chips in their kids
or like they put chips in their pets now
sometimes too for tracking in the way
what do you mean in their pets like
embedded understand yeah yeah yeah it's
like the size like a rice grain pretty
sure I wouldn't embed a chip in my kid I
mean it's an option like people can do
I'm saying I like this better that's all
definitely well there's that or the
actual physical leashes
oh god kid on a leash that's so sad and
terrible but like watching my kid my
two-year-old run around like crazy now
I'm like that leash idea does it sound
rollerblades or something so he won't be
able to he's saying trap is free we
actually got a scooter he's just he just
flies away basically been one of those
electric scooters yes it's electric
of course alright let's move on to
duplex for a second Michael Brown says
do you think Google duplex will work
within the Google assistant on iOS oh
that's a great question it is in
probably well it's yeah down the line I
mean they're still testing this is like
really really early days for duplex but
I imagine once it's sort of a core part
of Google Assistant it'll get moved over
to Iowa that's not even that available
on like most Android phones yeah it's
it's a very limited public trial right
now and as far as the credentials go to
participate in that public trial
how are people selected for that are
they like first time big-time users are
there like celebrity clientele that are
being recruited because Nikolas wants to
know when will we be able to start using
Google duplex um the the the program is
more so about it's not like selecting
people to use duplex its selecting
restaurants at and like locations that
will accept it but open to receiving the
call
Hall's as far as like using two Plex I
am Not sure in terms of the limitations
right now it's it's over the coming week
to the timeframe the software will be
used to confirm business and holiday
hours open/close times the fourth of
July it was like yeah this is basically
very limited stuff I think the idea is
to keep it fairly limited keep it simple
for interactions let me duplex need a
learn exactly it needs to learn so it
gets better
mimics us way better so they can replace
us yeah eventually
chase Anika 81 can I get Google duplex
to talk to my mother on the holidays
I don't know how low that conversation
would last I think unless your mother
was a like a really also artificial
intelligence no but she kept talking I
think duplex could handle that cuz it
would just be like um uh-huh yeah okay
how most of my conversations go to
yourself yeah well with me frankly I
would love to see that as our initial
test whenever we get it in the office
here is just see how long it can have a
natural conversation that's not
necessarily like a client base like a
booking thing trying to get a hair
appointment or whatever they they demoed
when they unveiled it right just see how
long we can trick like John Falcone into
thinking that I'm on the phone
it's Crank Yankers but with AI next
uh-huh yeah okay
taking your polls in the chat who should
we crank call with Google duplex whoo I
like that one
alright so to close things out let's
talk about blackberry bill says no one
takes blackberry seriously yeah send you
again to be clear this is not the
BlackBerry company in Canada this is TCL
makes TVs they make Alka telephones and
now they're making BlackBerry's but yeah
it's it's it's hard to take them
seriously now they were once you know
the number two smartphone maker in the
world
but it's a long long way from from those
days so how long do you think until they
abandoned the whole physical keyboard
thing they're not they're not that
amazing heavily into it they tried
abandoning and it
for right like no we make we make
smartphones now I know yeah I don't
think they ever truly abandon the idea
of physical keyboard they made fun they
all touchscreen phones but they've
they've always been sort of like a side
project as opposed to like the core like
honestly I appreciate they know who they
are they are they're gonna stick with it
you know like it's not me that needs to
change it's everyone else
idea that this is sort of like forget
the mainstream forget most people we're
just gonna build the best keyboard phone
for folks who like keyboard no matter
how small an audience that is that's
what we're going after
it's like those the folks that built the
best horse carriages after for horse
carriages in New York City so it's a
loser now so what you're saying is the
BlackBerry is gonna become a tourist
novelty oh god yeah it could be a
novelty come to our museum and check out
the phone with a keyboard
when will BlackBerry be the new Zack
Morris phone or is it already and I
don't think I never will be I feel like
the site cake was the Zack Morris phone
because that's like the quintessential
keyboard phone I don't know but I feel
like the sidekick yeah hit a certain
generation but it wasn't like but it'll
stream lis pop but it also had like a
unique look I mean like the directional
it wasn't also extremely popular yeah I
guess I feel like it didn't hit the
public consciousness maybe because I'm
not I wasn't the right age for those
psychic phones I was for me yeah hey
Roger before we wrap it up do you know
what BlackBerry's market share is by
chance oh I believe it is like point
zero two percent oh I believe I'm not
really a share it's not really sure I
think they sold like a hundred thousand
nine hundred thousand it's pretty low
like last year keep in mind like most
handset maker cell phones in the
millions per quarter and I would hazard
a guess that they probably sold about a
hundred thousand last year I don't a lot
of keyboards
hey man bless their hearts for trying
like you said they were a powerhouse
back in the day but they've kind of gone
the
in Yahoo and AOL right I mean that was
the Obama phone for a while that was the
he was a big chair that is true yeah
that's true it wasn't a jay-z line true
he caught a blueberry though there's the
line it's on encore from the blackout
but he says out the country but the
blueberry still connect Roger talking I
don't know that music either thought it
was called he thought the for the blue
well for a while the Kardashians they
they couldn't BlackBerry's either so
there are still some folks who was so
clean to it what life improvement says
blackberry and Windows should combine
forces I'd be inviting oh my god that
would be it's like the combination of
like to also rands doesn't make a better
company it just makes another slightly
larger also-ran yeah I don't think
Microsoft needs to take that hit yeah I
mean we spent years covering the rise
and fall of Windows Mobile or Windows
Phone so it's yeah that Windows Phone
and Blackberry getting together second
helping what if the NYPD starts using
blackberry good news guys they're all
black bear not Windows phones anymore
they're blackberries now no these
iPhones now though which yeah yeah they
all have ice and look these phones are
to be fairly these phones are Android
phones are not like on their own kind of
island operating system they do use
Android they're just their keyboards at
a time when people don't want keyboards
they they want the full screen right so
one more question before we wrap it up
from our neighbor to the north Ryan
Williams so where does blackberry in
Canada come into play with this are they
still around yeah so that's great
question blackberry blackberry limited
is still around still thriving it sells
business software security software it
does actually secure this phone the
Android operators actually I think runs
through the BlackBerry servers and is
secured and hardened there before it
goes to these TCL billed phones so black
bear is still around they the their
software powers smart cars and they
still do a lot of security stuff they're
just they're not in the consumer mindset
then they're all about business now so
that's why we don't really talk about
them that often that's a powerful review
what's BlackBerry up to these days
they're around around alright kickin we
are out of time we'll be back tomorrow
with more 359 goodness
and on that note Roger you want to take
us on out of here yeah if you like think
that you saw her here check us out on
CNET our podcast is available on iTunes
to tune in stitcher SoundCloud
feedburner google play music google
podcast and the amlong Alexa
