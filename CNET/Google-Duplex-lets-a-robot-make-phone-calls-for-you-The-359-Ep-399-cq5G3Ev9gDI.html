Alfred Eng perhaps the biggest takeaway
from the Google i/o developer conference
yesterday was an experimental technology
called Google duplex it's basically a
human sounding Google assistant that can
make phone calls to people on your
behalf to schedule restaurant
reservations or hair appointments what
did you guys think of this thing I feel
really bad that was actually fooled by
it because I wasn't paying attention to
the conversation to the present day I
was working on another story when they
demoed duplex but I was listening in and
I'm like why are they just playing two
people talking on the phone I don't get
it what's and everyone else like in the
newsroom was called like that's crazy
what's going on and I'm like that's just
two people talking I don't get it what's
to me what was interesting about it too
was that to make a robot sound like a
person it almost seemed like too easy
all you had to do was like elongate
certain words throw in mm-hmm
it was like is it really that easy to I
mean I I think those demos though showed
like they must have called the most
polite businesses in town because the
second language she was responding and
was hard I mean as an English speaker
talking on the phone it would have been
hard for me to understand just to show
how the artificial intelligence was at
listening to someone maybe who's not
rude but who is having difficulty
understanding what a person a person
quote unquote talking in English is
asking and then responding in a way
that's broken English as well yeah do
you think that this is a good idea is
this something that Google should
actually be offering I think that no
matter what maybe we can all agree that
there needs to be some ground rules
about when you devise a robot to talk to
people to be transparent about the fact
that they're talking to a robot right
I'm very worried about the implications
that this has if this technology gets to
you know like telemarketers and Robo
callers in the sense that like now they
can do this like on a massive scale and
you won't know that it's about
immediately there is a version of that I
definitely have gotten calls of that
before but they're really loud
yeah so you're totally right my point
yeah like that it would get much better
and then it would be much harder for you
to tell that it's like a like a machine
running like this telemarketing
operation where they're like calling you
like eight times a day over it
yeah and to be clear Google said that
they do plan on letting the human on the
other side of the phone know that
they're talking to a robot it's still
unclear exactly how they're actually
gonna do that and they plan on slowly
rolling this out because it is
experimental next Google also revealed a
new feature for its Google assistant
that will let you ask follow-up
questions to it without constantly
saying hey Google or ok Google the
future is coming this summer
Amazon unveiled a similar feature in
March that's already live you guys like
this idea is it interesting I just wish
they would give you the ability to
change the wake word for it because say
saying hey Google a lot is annoying and
this kind of addresses that but like
also saying hey Google at all is really
annoying because when I was using my
Amazon echoes I would just say echo for
it and that would be it hey Google is
very annoying to say all the time yeah I
think just saying Google might be a
little off I'm not really sure last
Google's new operating system Android P
wants to help you curb your phone
addiction Alfred you wrote about this
give us some highlights what's what's
interesting so they introduced a several
new features one of the biggest ones for
it is a Android dashboard it's an app on
your phone that you can see like how
much time you're spending on certain
apps it tells you like how many times
you've unlocked your phone that day what
apps you use the most the idea like
being like hey maybe you shouldn't spend
eight hours a day you know on YouTube
watching like dog videos the whole day
I'd be terrified to see some of these
statistics Jonas that's something that
you would actually use I think that it's
yeah I think that I would use some of
these features for sure and I think it's
interesting that you know these directly
go against Google's own well being you
know like getting you to stop using your
phone they're in the business of getting
you addicted to the other services
totally so it's interesting that they're
allowing they're listening to consumers
that are fed up with how these services
kind of feel like they take over their
lives and in exploitative ways in some
cases yeah if you want to read more
these stories check us out on CNN I'm
Ben Fox Ruben I'm Alfred I'm Joey
salzman thanks for listening remax all
right that was that was pretty good that
was a bitch to do a lot in four minutes
I think duplex is creepy too it was it
was four and a half you know what you
know how like one of the other
announcements from yesterday is that
there's more voices now what if John
Legend could be your assistant call you
someone give this man a billion dollars
that's a billion dollar we're watching
the keynote where's my wait you're gonna
call that a hair salon and have John
Legend go happy birthday that's about as
much John Legend singing as I can manage
hey this is John Legend I'd like to make
an appointment for a LFR Edie if the
first name is Lisa it's there's still
some obvious tells Brian am I putting
you on the spot too much to try to get
the actual audio can we play the audio
for the fine people out there I want you
to look for the Bronco okay give me you
got to give me a second you guys talk
amongst yourselves for one I just had to
make one quip that I could not stop
thinking about during the show and
that's a way I've said hey Google so
many times the words of lost all meaning
jiminy checkers we did it it took us
seven hours but we did it I will admit
that the follow-up questions thing is
very much in the order of first world
problem issues but I using these things
a lot it is pretty annoying and it kind
of makes me not want to use them as much
when especially in my morning routine I
have to say Alexa three times in a row
to find out the weather the time and
whether it's gonna rain that day so yeah
I do think that's interesting and it's
definitely useful and it could
potentially get us closer to the idea
which alfred was talking about where you
don't even have to say awake word at all
well I didn't say that I just want them
to change the wake words thank you
I want my wake where to be Harvey danger
so I talked to IBM about the idea that
in the future the AI is actually going
to
well enough that you're talking to it
and not someone else yeah I know so you
you wouldn't have to say awake word at
all like Alexa is just gonna know that
you're asking it a question and not a
person all right so let's go ahead and
take a demo of this this is the new
Google assistant duplex in the middle of
a demo call that they had with a
restaurant here we go how many people
for two people two people yeah what time
5:00 p.m. okay and your name the first
name is Daniel da da and ie L okay
you're all set okay great thanks see you
next Friday okay thank you bye anything
I just like to say that Daniel was
pretty dismissive at the end there he's
like alright bye well yeah no chitchat
he also has no emotions he's not a real
person
right it's also not Daniel himself
making it it's his assistant doing it
for him shocking so every time I listen
to that I think it's so it's just funny
to think about our brains and how
they're more powerful than computers in
ways no for now but like the idea that
like that they're like when he said when
she asked how many people he says for
two people and he pauses on four to make
it sound more human I like I love the
fact that you have to think about well
the reason why a human would posit for
is because while she's looking for
things the human brain is like
meandering and thinking about other
things and then almost like an automatic
you know by rote you would be like oh
yeah she's talking to me I have to go
back to what I wasn't you know like
computers don't do that at least they
don't have memory like thoughts and
that's the reason like it's it's a
simulation of having other processes
going on here's the
thing I love the thing that's a little
ironic about this is that if the robot
is gonna tell the person on the other
line that they're a robot why sound like
human at all why not just sound
automated like why do thumbs and the
slow down and up speak and maybe it's
more efficient for a person because
Google's trying to make it like a
conversational tone right yeah yeah but
Weston is why why bother with a
conversational tone at all if the if the
if the robot has to disclose I'm a robot
calling on behalf of Daniel yeah so like
just get to the point robot I mean like
it's being conversational is like fluid
it's like it's the social it's a
literally like a social lubricant to get
things done like I mean if you're on the
phone with a with a robot you might
maybe because we are at the state we are
right now you would think I need to know
what are the trigger words what are like
you know because that's what we have to
do a lot of AI right now you have to say
things you have to phrase them in a
certain way in order to get the response
that you need yeah you can make the same
argument about like the Google home
currently what with some of the
announcement that they made yesterday to
make it more conversational like why
would Google want to do that when you
know that the Google home is a machine
yeah they they added a pretty please
feature I like you know but my point is
like yeah you know that's a machine you
like why would you have to say that but
like the idea is yeah they're trying to
make things more conversation over
that's AI it seems to me that it's also
inevitable that your robot assistant is
gonna call the restaurants robotic
assistant and they're both gonna act
human at some point I'm just gonna do
have your robot people call my robot
people yeah and we'll do lunch yeah I
think that to me seems like it's it's
gonna be coming at the next Google i/o
so yeah we'll see all right let's go
ahead and jump into the chat and take
some questions
Matthew dacher wants to know we've
already kind of touched on this what
could duplex technology do - Robo spam
callers now we assume that the Robo spam
callers are going to employ this
technology in order to abuse us the
potential customer now let's go ahead
and flip that theory on its head and I
want someone out there to use duplex to
keep those damn spammers on the line
right they ruin their lives right I love
this what the spammers are also robots
robots but eventually eventually they
actually have to pass it off to a client
so there's this incredible video us
we're not the mouse any yeah yeah
there's this video on YouTube where this
guy found out like the like call center
number four like this do like this
center that was like spamming him over
the bunch of calls and he developed a
script that would like call it every
like 30 seconds or something from like a
bunch of like online phone numbers and
it would just keep spamming it and just
say Lee basically clogged up their lines
and he recorded all of their calls to a
like so at first they were just hang up
on her immediately and then I got to a
point where they like this they would
just start cursing out his BOTS it's
incredibly like funny that's that's
pretty awesome especially if the bot
talks like Arnold Schwarzenegger know
the bot is just it's like a
text-to-speech kind of thing so it's
like sounds extremely robotic cuz like
hello you are a spammer and please stop
calling my number kind of thing yeah the
other thing about Google duplex we were
talking about conversational Google home
and also Alexa they they don't pause a
lot it's pretty like the conversation
flows pretty quickly they don't they
don't pause I don't say um unless
they're like saying a joke or it's like
intentional or something like that do
you think that that would cause you to
use those assistants more often if they
sound more like a person or they have
like more tics I don't know because it
would be annoying for the uses that we
use now like when I want to know the
weather I get really annoyed that Alexa
tells me information she already gave me
like if I asked for tomorrow's forecast
she'll say right now or what you know
what I mean like she goes over stuff I
already know so if it's more
conversational a sense that it's more
efficient than that would be great but
if it's more conversational in the sense
that she's like oh hey yeah sure I can
tell you what that is then that would be
annoying cuz I just want to know the
friggin weather totally great that's a
good point
I feel like even if this feature was
really useful and helpful I would
probably still make these appointments
on my own anyway just cuz I like to get
confirmation of these kinds of things on
my own and
don't really trust like the machine to
do that I just remember I wanted to make
a point to and this is really important
I think these really were just demos
yeah and we weren't able to test this
alive so we don't really know how well
it works and it's entirely possible that
the technology looked really good in the
demo because that's what the demo is for
and in the real world it's not gonna
work nearly as well so that's that's a
big caveat that we should I can't wait
to see all the ways that it screws up it
will - yeah we have some deep philosophy
going on in the chat Michael Brown says
this is going to bring up conversation
about humans governing over robots
why aren't self-aware robots worthy of
kind words such as pretty please then he
goes on to say the idea that they're not
hardware the idea that we are better or
more superior than robots is immediately
a problem why do we humans think that we
are superior are these commenters super
supe for a while we're robots and
they're not so that's a so but if we're
like projecting out to a future where
robots are self-aware is the question
that what like why do we feel we're
superior and we don't need to say please
is that the question that's what it
seems like to me oh I think that's why
it's great that there are there there
are these initiatives to build in please
because it's really gross to watch a
child who's do you know growing up in an
age where voice is going to be how they
interact with computers to just hear
them like yell and demand there was
machines there was a lot of them are
personified as women that's disturbing
there was a slate article that was like
don't date anybody that yells at their
assistant and I was like what kind of
psycho like yells at the robot voice
this isn't like what the what's wrong
with you yeah I usually I don't know
it's because that sounds like a person
usually if I'm a little Curt with Alexa
I will then feel bad afterward and it's
a weird feeling all the time I didn't I
didn't even say your name like why are
you bothering me yeah but don't you feel
bad afterward because you're a nice
person
I don't okay I still think you're a nice
person I don't feel do you feel bad when
you yell at your car
for not starting up or something ooh wow
probably not not the same way I'm just
gonna go ahead and say it this a reboot
of Pinocchio sucks
hi there were a great question Michael
excellent question
a couple more Tyson Edwards says I feel
like people are going to catch on to
these quirks and the man.you isms the
moons in the hall isn't yeah I predict
that many people are going to start
calling that out and trolling during the
calls and I think he's right I think we
will pick up but there's always gonna be
someone out there like your grandma
gonna figure out how and it's gonna get
ugly I mean so most of these what all
you can do with these like this bar
right now is like what like appointments
it's very literary yeah so I'm just
thinking like why would you like want to
troll it anyway it's just like others
about I don't want like this person's
business or something like that doesn't
really make that much sense to me
grandma I really appreciate the phone
call well you're gonna make an
appointment with your grandma I don't
know I don't know it's someone will when
I was in Seattle last year they were
talking about the idea of helping lonely
people with these types of
conversational BOTS letting them have
conversations making it a little bit
more useful than just having it play
your music or tell you what the weather
is we're not there yet but it did sound
like an interesting and obviously like a
more altruistic concept for this type of
technology Asimov already talked on this
my my first thought when they were
showing duplex was selfishly this would
make talking to my in-laws so much
easier first names Johnny they don't
watch this show right if the AI watch
this show we would all be completed how
many of you I'll be finished when they
take over Emily how many of you want to
chatter AI right now
I like this comment from Mary Ann but
like you know I also was thinking about
how you know how unlike movies they say
that like um when cops are undercover
they can't do the drugs and so the way
to check if your you have a cop in your
head just like it's entrapment yeah yeah
so wouldn't it be great though if there
is some sort of like you if you ask a
bot are you a bot they have to say
they're a bot essentially a new kind of
wake word yeah
it's not even awake word but it's like
if there were some sort of understanding
it would our regulation or something
that like if you're programming a bot it
needs to have like if you ask it a query
are you a robot it has to answer yes I
mean it does kind of behaving like a
sort of wake word I'm with you on that
one actually I think that would work
better than the potential for you know
they were talking about putting a
disclaimer like a misnomer right in the
front kind of thing like yellow I am
so-and-so its digital assistant and then
moving on with the conversation like
that that might sail over some people's
heads maybe there are situations where
you can be blissfully ignorant but the
idea of being like I suspect something I
am aware of this digital assistant
technology I'm gonna call it out and I
need and I I deserve I have a right to
know
yeah and to be able to say that and
Google is legally required to make that
voice respond in a scripted manner to
say disclose yes I am a digital
assistant something like that's how the
police work in Blade Runner that's right
I know you look in their eyes yeah
you're I should you're close to the test
Brian are you a robot malfunction we get
that dude likes on the podcast
absolutely it's just gonna be me mm-hm
congratulations to our friends at Giant
Bomb next door as I'm sure they're what
are they playing today I don't know I
don't know more questions from Matthew
da chura again with duplex once again
technology threatens an entire class of
employee yeah soon they're going to be
no need for personal assistance now if
only google could pick up my dry
cleaning even time personal assistance
and also you know when you call Amazon
customer service or when you you know
anybody that's in a customer service
center a call center they could be
automated out by this more so than
automation already has mm-hmm I wanted
to go back I wanted to go back and just
touch on this comment from Mariana says
I yell at Alexis sometimes and I feel
bad afterwards I've actually apologized
her before Thank You Marianne more
questions more questions from Josh Boyd
did Google give a timeline on the
rollout on the Google lens to the OEMs
that they
partnered well yeah so I wrote that
story so the it's supposed to be coming
out next week I believe it's a really
short time that's quick yeah I think
that the feature is supposed to be
available starting next week with the
handset makers that it disclosed which
by the way are of course pixel LG's g7
has included a sous so I'm trying to get
my Motorola other ones show me in there
yes show me what's in there but the two
biggest handset makers in the world
Apple and Samsung were not one more from
Josh Boyd and maybe you can expand on
this one Joan - they said that these
certain Android manufacturers are gonna
get lens in the camera app on the phone
yeah that's true
yeah so it'll be inside your camera app
itself that's the idea is that you won't
have to open up a separate app in order
to get these cool things like being able
to copy and paste words if you put your
camera frame on your phone over a book
or a sign or you know pop-up of
information all the stuff that they were
demoing yeah the idea is that when you
open up your camera and take a picture
and if you ever want to just pull up
some information you won't have to
squeal to have that you know everyone
has their camera app as one of their you
know at the bottom of the screen
homepage things usually it'll be right
there for you I want to say that the one
thing I took away from yesterday's
keynote that I was the most excited
about was definitely the the AI are
augmented reality in the apps in the min
Maps map specifically box that leads you
around screw the Fox but the idea cuz
it's that it's the Blue Duck it's the
Blue Dot dance like she said and it
we've all and I get so twisted around
down like in the Lower East Side here in
the city that would be extremely helpful
I love that idea is the Fox so just to
clarify for me because I I think I
missed this part the Fox is literally
there to show you around
yeah the Fox is sleepy 4.0 it like lead
you to where you need to walk - it's
like Pokemon go but actually useful but
you don't need the that's just one
option on there just the idea of having
the arrows pointing you immediately like
orienting for you on the 3d scale and I
didn't
mind the idea that it starts popping up
with what we're essentially ads telling
you like oh there's a restaurant over
here and then there's a gas station over
here kind of thing I don't mind that I
like that I mean you can't see around
every corner sometimes I hope they open
it up to like other developers so that I
can get a little AR Morpheus and you
just like come with me if you want to
live Swartz and Egger sure doesn't work
that line who's Morpheus Laurence
Fishburne right right right all right
anyway when you start doing the Google
map does he offer you a red pillar or a
blue pail there you go
now you got the references right what's
that go back to the 90s out like like to
replace you with duplex now let's take
one more from Joseph google lens on iOS
is only integrated in the Google Photos
app once a photo is uploaded why can't
Google release a standalone Google lens
app that works with the camera I know I
agree I'm with you yeah I didn't even
know google lens was available on iOS
yet I thought well it's part of Google
Photos I think and then and it's part of
Google assistant too so I don't know I'm
not up on the integrations with iOS at
all but you can use both of those if
you're really in love with the lens you
should probably get a pixel
I feel like pixel always games google
lens yeah first yeah we're done I think
we're done are we done here I mean right
now I mean there's still some great
conversation going on in the chat as
always I guess Tyson let's take one more
from Tyson how do you think that the
energy consumption will be once you
start using a camera as well as GPS
simultaneously I'm not gonna leave out
on all the time I'm thinking like in
very specific scenarios it can really be
a headache saver yeah but yeah you got a
good point there that's going to murder
your battery yeah oh please
yeah the Android P they were talking
about better battery management what was
it called app appropriation something
they they had a swanky names called
haribol so way too straightforward they
had some innovations but they need
marketing is that a terrible movie
starring Ben Stiller from engineer I was
lucky
looking for an apartment
hunting he was having my codename duplex
and it just stuck I guess okay so that's
gonna be it that's it for us for is it
there's no its woken up and been like oh
thank God it's Saturday Oh John oh I'm
so sorry I haven't even woken up this
week he's our bot just ignore him it's
time to recharge Alfred's battery but
yeah thanks again for joining us we'll
be back tomorrow on time this time
apologies again and thank you for
sticking with us who wants to take us
out on the script today I'll do it okay
