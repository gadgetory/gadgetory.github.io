sports car and its father an SUV that
didn't hold much let's try the 2012
Infiniti fx35 all-wheel drive in check
the test
now the first thing I love about this FX
is that it's a limited edition they only
gonna make like 500 of these I think but
it's probably the first infinity I've
seen in a long time that isn't gaudy
that doesn't have like blonde beechwood
and too much polished metal it's just
got piano black or some super dark wood
I can't tell what that is and black it's
actually grown up beyond that that we've
seen this whole tech load a hundred
times and it's very good my main gripe
as you probably know if you've watched
my reviews of infinities before is that
childish display of map I don't like the
colors I'm not really cool on the
rendering I mean what is that Street
name doing over that building if I
wasn't from here
I'd have no idea what that is it does
have 3d rendering of buildings it has
Lane Guidance when you get right to a
turn and that's traffic it has weather
pretty much all the bells and whistles
here I just find the aesthetic and to
some degree the informational execution
of the maps is a little childish you can
go touchscreen if you want as you see
that's an 8 inch LCD you get when you go
to the nav system that is not standard
by the way it's part of a pricey package
otherwise you get a 7 inch screen to
control other vehicle systems and good
but not completely comprehensive voice
control for navigation and media would
you like to access navigation navigation
address address was state California
California now all this stuff is part of
the premium package that I'm in the
middle of right now like 39 50 chunky
also brings you a DVD ability in the
optical slot no 6 here because among
your sources you've got a hard drive to
rip to we're getting real cool on that
idea around here but the automakers are
still thinking it's kind of hip it ain't
the last Bell and whistle in that
Premium Package that helps to make it
worth the fact that it's about three
house payments is the camera technology
it bumps you up from rear cam to a round
view so I can look at the back
I can look all around because I have a
front a pair of side and a rear camera
of course or I can change that to a side
view if I'm doing some curb nibbling or
go back to top if I want to pretend like
I'm God now if you really want to take
that powertrain seen that style get the
tech package it brings you adaptive
cruise control lane departure warning
and prevention thanks to your braking
distance assist using laser sensing
it'll even pull back on the accelerator
and auto brake if you're about to run
into someone and the related brake
assist with forward collision tech lots
of ways to keep you from rear-ending
something or someone now fx35 means 3.5
under the hood one of these outstanding
three and a half liter v6 is that Nissan
Infiniti do so well it built the company
around it
this guy's gonna give you a 303
horsepower 262 foot-pounds of torque
good numbers except this is a 4,200
pound vehicle so 0 to 60 happens in a
little under 6 seconds nothing slouchy
about it you'll get 16 23 mpg on the
rear-wheel drive base configuration go
for all-wheel drive and that drops down
to 21 on the highway you have one choice
only on the gearbox 7-speed automatic
that comes back to drive over for sport
back and forth for intended shifts but
no paddles on the wheel
they're underway there is nothing about
this fx35 I don't like the ride is very
good sporting but not harsh powered
deliveries great that's a great motor
and through this 7-speed automatic it
does all the right things a very smart
gearbox I find for everyday driving on
up to athletic driving basically this
car is the expensive sneaker of SUVs
it's not real practical it's never going
to be used in a hard serious deeply
vertical way it's kind of sporty but not
a sports car kind of an SUV but doesn't
carry a damn thing give a second row in
a tiny cargo bay it's for looks it's for
style it's something that makes you feel
good about yourself when you give your
murano driving friend a lift home so
here's the bottom line on this guy I
like the fx35 a lot it's about 44 in
changebase by the time I had Premium
Package for 4 grand and the tech package
for 3000 and those really are all pretty
tasty to go CNET style I'm at around 51
52 and now I'm thinking I should have
gotten a Murano with a lot of the same
tech and the same engine though a very
different transmission so if you reach
for this guy because you love the look
so much and the tech payload you're
gonna be paying a decent amount of money
but the nice thing is they've got a rear
hatch tint option for under 300 bucks so
if you go broke you can live in it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
