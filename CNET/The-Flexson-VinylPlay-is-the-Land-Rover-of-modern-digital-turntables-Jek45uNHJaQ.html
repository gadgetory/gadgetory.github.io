first look at the Flex and vinyl play
turntable so now that people are getting
back into listening to records you've
probably been seeing a lot of new
manufacturers popping up to sell their
version of the modern turntable well
this is one of them and it's made by
flexin and it came out last year and
it's advertised as a way to listen to
records wirelessly through a Sonos
system if you've ever set up a turntable
before you've probably had to go through
the process of setting the counterweight
aligning the cartridge and calibrating
the vertical tracking force
well flexin does all that for you so it
should take about less than five minutes
to hook up to either a sono system or
powered speakers and you can even put it
through a traditional receiver all you
have to do is twist on the counterweight
wrap the belt around the right speed for
33 or 45 rpms then put the platter and
slip mat on top and you're ready to
connect the RCA jacks in the back to
whatever source you want now there's two
things to keep in mind here the first is
that if you do listen to a lot of
singles in addition to LPS it can
definitely be a hassle to have to do
manual switching every time on the belt
the other thing is that the start and
stop button is on the bottom right side
of the table so it can sometimes be a
challenge to reach back there - this is
definitely a mid-range turntable for
someone just starting out listening to
records or someone who appreciates the
simple things in life so what makes this
turntable different from older models
well most of those older ones require a
separate preamp to convert the
turntables phono output to line level
this one actually has a preamp built
into it now that preamp also has a USB
port on it as well that lets you convert
your records into digital music the
vinyl play is really fun to use the
minimal design looks awesome the three
feet on the bottom takes care of any
vibrations that could disrupt your music
and the original audio technica
cartridge is just fine for the average
listener and if it's not you can always
upgrade later on down the road now it's
probably really difficult to design a
turntable that appeals to both audio
files and new users at the same time but
I think this one does get pretty close
and while I have a few issues with its
design I would still recommend it to
anyone looking to add a record player to
a Sonos system or to anyone else that
just wants to use it as an analogue
turntable you can read more details in
my full review on CNET but that's going
to do it for this video I'm Justin this
has been a first look at the flexin
vinyl player turntable thanks for
