bill Detweiler and this is my partner in
crime Jason Heiner I'm managing editor
of Czech Republic and I like to take
products apart and see what makes them
tick if you will today we're going to
crack open a hoverboard or more
appropriately called a self balancing
scooter to see what's inside of them and
to explain sort of what's going on with
the fires has everybody out here heard
about the fires that are happening with
the hoverboards right ok so what I'm
going to do is we're going to take one
apart we're going to look at components
inside of the board and try to show
people why they're catching fire and
hopefully make everybody a little bit
more safe so while I'm doing this Jason
is going to do the play-by-play here um
Jason can tell everybody why we take
things apart oh and just in case
anybody's worried about a fire on the
stage right now we have Katie over here
with the fire extinguisher so if
anything when it bursts into flames
she's gonna run up here and put it out
but hopefully hopefully we won't have
that happen all right so Jason while
we've been taking things apart all these
shows we've been doing this for a long
time we started doing these in 2006 and
the you know the first couple things
that we took apart were the Xbox and
before Xbox 360 or this was right about
the time the Xbox 360 the first one was
coming out and the iPod one the iPad
Mini at that time and we have a an
audience at Tech Republic that's very
technically curious and we we simply
took them apart because there are always
questions especially back in that time
in tech there were lots of questions
about you know what processors were used
how much storage what vendors were
involved and we would take these things
apart we'd look at the tips that were
inside look at the technology that was
inside and we break it down so we've got
the first so I'll say this I fudged a
little bit I cheated I took some of the
screws out in the UH in order to save
time and usually we use really really
small screws and tools like this
but today we roll out the power tools
now we've got the cowlings off they come
off pretty easily there's just a bunch
of screws inside now this is the most
important thing people if you're going
to do this at home and I do not
recommend it please don't try this at
home now um the first thing you want to
do whenever you're taking apart
something that's electric is to
disconnect the battery so you guys can
see I'm going to try to shooting it in
the camera so don't you can see up on
the screen or not I'll tilt it forward
just a little bit this large object here
is the battery this is a large lithium
ion battery and this is what's
responsible for the fire so the first
thing I'm going to do before I touch
anything else inside of this is I'm
going to disconnect the battery that
will hopefully prevent me from getting
electrocuted and from a fire starting
and they'll cracked open a lot of
devices never had a fire never Alexian
fingers ten toes but it's these
batteries that are what's causing the
fire and then we're going to talk about
the hardware a little bit inside there's
there's a couple reasons why these
batteries can catch fire one is if I
were to take something that's like this
really sharp and start poking these
batteries it would expose the chemicals
inside the batteries and that is bad
that'll cause batteries to explode the
other thing is if these batteries
overheat so if they're exposed to
something that's really hot if you're on
a hoverboard and you have a crash that
could puncture the battery also the
batteries can can be cheaply made
there's something called thermal runaway
where if the separation material between
the anode and the cathode is just not
aligned properly or isn't manufactured
properly you can have a thermal runaway
inside the battery which is which causes
it to overheat and burst into fire also
so this is something that's really
interesting about the hoverboards Jason
open this box up here yes and I'm not
singling this particular brand out this
model out as a potential fire risk or
not but open the box up there alright
and Jason's going to pull out while I'm
doing this I'm going to disconnect some
of these cables here so this is the
charger that it comes with now so you
would say Millie er yeah you would think
that you could just plug this up and
leave this overnight right and then
you'd have an
brand-new charge hoverboard in the
morning no you can't do that if you'll
look Jason lift up some of the paper
right there
there's a real little piece of paper
okay
and it says important do not charge
hoverboard overnight or at risks
exploding now you know it's one thing
it's nice I'm sure that the lawyers are
very happy that they put this piece of
paper in there but if you've got one of
these for one of your kids and they just
forget and leave it plugged up in the
garage or the living room you know
that's probably not you know it's not
going to help you any because there's
this piece of paper in there so all
right now we've talked about the battery
any kind of thing is saying it's
essentially saying stay by this thing
all the time when you're when you're
charging it right because it might burst
into flames not very practical right so
we're going to pop off a few of these
cables here there's a lot of electronics
actually inside these devices are to
make them work right there are things
like there's obviously cables connecting
to the charging ports there's LED lights
on these things there's actually quite a
bit of hardware that you might find in a
smartphone or in other sort of Google
devices there are at least three
microcontrollers in here there's one
from STMicroelectronics there's two
separate six access gyroscopes it's very
hard to see so I don't expect but these
chips here one here and one here are
actually Invensys InvenSense six access
gyroscopes and there's they they're what
helps the scooter stay level and balance
itself also there the motors for these
are inside the wheels so if you took the
wheels apart you took these bolts out
you can see of the motors and then down
here you'll see at least one arm this is
a I believe of 78 megahertz arm cortex-m
three microcontroller and then another
set of microcontrollers another two
microcontrollers up there so there's a
lot of hardware inside these devices
that help them go now while we're doing
this what we're going to do is I'm going
to keep keep taking this apart to show
you guys a little bit more of the
hardware that's inside now like Jason
said we've been doing this for a really
long time we've taken apart everything
yes from my iPads iPhones every uh you
know mobile device you can think of
every gaming can work on selected open
and really there's a couple goals that
we have when we're when we're doing
these you know one is the curiosity
factor it is the idea of you know
learning from the technology learning
about the design of these things you can
tell a lot about these products from the
design I remember times Bill cracking
something open and saying come look at
this you know inside there's chase
holding some of these devices together I
remember particularly an HTC device that
you were not very impressed with that
came to market very quickly and you
could tell just by the way it was
organized inside that this product was
rushed to market you know the on the
other hand you can tell devices not
surprisingly devices from companies like
Samsung and Apple that you've often be
very impressed with looking at at the
design inside of the device so it's not
Universal but every time that we do when
these devices we learn a little bit
about the company and about the you know
the what they put into the the product
so we also are looking at how well these
devices can be repaired if you had the
device break if you had something that
either through your own fault or
something that was out of warranty and
you wanted to try to repair it yourself
you know we we look at it and we try to
give you some idea of what you would do
if a screen cracked if a part had to be
replaced on your own and so we give you
a little bit of insight onto how easy or
hard or even possible or not possible it
would be to fix it on your own
yeah and it's a lot easier for me to
sort of justify taking something like
this apart than it is for somebody at
home just to do it on their own so you
don't have to we do it so you don't have
to and later today I mean this guy so
sometimes these little plastic
connectors are hard to get off um but
later today we'll actually be doing
something that we normally don't do so
we taking apart an Apple pencil and in
order to take apart the Apple pencil we
we'll actually have to destroy it I'll
be cutting it in half on the stage up
here which should be fun that is
something you know not everybody is
necessarily good at this kind of thing
if you have a lot of it you have to have
a lot of patience you have to have a
certain amount of dexterity you know
Bill has been doing these you know since
we started he's did the first ones he's
the one who still does all of these
because he has a lot of patience he also
kind of has like the hands of the
surgeon you know very very dexterous and
you know you're cracking these things
open sometimes especially if they have
screens it takes a while to figure out
how to get them open I mean when we
famous picture out there on the internet
that when we were first trying to get
the very first iPad apart we had all
kinds of things stuck down in there what
do you have you're like a spatula you
know butter knife you had all kinds of
things now there are some tools that
have come out some nice tool sets from
people like iFixit then you can go and
you can get your own set of tools that
can help you you know get these devices
open but you know I can count on the
number of fingers you know the the
amount of things you've actually taken
apart like doesn't that have broken do
you also put them back together because
you're trying to learn from that and
then in what you pass on to to people
afterwards when you write it up people
often ask me well you ruined a perfectly
good iPhone or you ruined a perfectly
good device that's a no I usually don't
you you can there are plenty of people
that will actually take devices down to
the chip substrate you know and destroy
the devices I don't do that this one's
really tough we always try to get them
back together in working order so that
we can test them and so that we can use
them so most I always tell people that
it makes them feel a little bit better
like we just didn't trash the device now
the Apple pencil there's no way to do
this without breaking it you can see
here this is the controller board for
the device I I don't want to cut through
all the wires I wouldn't do that but you
can kind of see the complexity that that
it has here you can see the processor I
showed earlier and all these big things
these are the things that I try to stay
away from a lot of these capacitors they
can store power I don't want to be
touching
all of those also we try to be really
careful with our own electrostatic
safety and our safety in general when
we're taking these things apart we try
to use electrostatic ESD safe tools and
that way you know we we don't ruin the
devices when we're when we're taking
them apart I'm going to try and get the
these housing out sit there there are
these plastic pieces here to see what's
under there and this is a really great
example sometimes when I take these
devices apart we know what's going to be
inside them sometimes we don't know
what's going to be inside them sometimes
we're just sort of fly-in blind we don't
know how they're going to come apart and
so we always take a lot of photos as
we're going through the process to make
sure not just to show everybody what's
inside them and talk about them but to
actually be able to put them back
together again when we're done with them
and then you know use them we are the
most prominent devices you know you can
go and see that process for most of the
problems you know most prominent devices
that are available on the market
Microsoft Surface
you know iPads iPhones Samsung phones
you can see the whole process where bill
is taken apart and then he'll post the
gallery he'll do a video and he'll often
do an analysis post to where he is
explaining you know what he learned in
the process keeping track of all these
screws is not fun either some of these
devices will use up to what three four
five six seven different kinds of screws
the worst for that yes if anyone from
Apple is listening please just use one
type of screw we can Oh uh so is anybody
here been hoping that this thing might
burst into flames and you might actually
see it burst into flames yeah me too um
so we're so we're safe so far um but you
know one of the things you may be
wondering is why they call this a
hoverboard right it's not act when it's
not actually hovering when I think
hoverboard I think of the thing that
Marty McFly went in Back to the Future 2
is 5050 or was 2015 yes yes so um I
don't know exactly why they call it a
hoverboard when in fact it's just sort
of a wheeled skateboard but there it is
and sometimes you run into problems like
this this connector looks like it has
glue on it
some kind yeah as a sealant on it and
they don't want to come loose so you
have to improvise as you're going along
and pop it loose otherwise I'll break
the middle contacts what I really don't
necessarily want to do that is if you're
doing it on this up on your own like we
were saying earlier you know patience is
kind of the key a lot of these things
they don't want to come and you're your
inclination a lot of times is to force
it that would be what I would do like I
would never have the patience for it but
you know Bill and others that these
kinds of things exactly you know just
have enough patience as they keep
working it little by little and then it
comes apart so we can kind of see we've
almost got this sort of broken down I
mean kind of see most of the major
components inside of it if you guys can
kind of see this I'll show you you can
see the wheels you can see the mounting
brackets here for the wheels the battery
we can see the large sort of circuit
board here mounted to its own sort of
backing plate you see all the cables
that run through it and how the the
swivels work here in the center and how
these sort of balance themselves I mean
it really is kind of an neat and
interesting device has anybody out there
actually ridden one of these anybody I
wouldn't yet did you fall down at least
once or twice knows it was easy okay
pretty easy I've never actually ridden
one of these things so I really did
think of thought about trying to ride
this before we came out here but decided
that I didn't want to risk the fire
hazard before I had it something also
interesting about these um you know
because the lithium-ion batteries if you
tried to move it around the airline
wouldn't let me bring it on the airplane
to bring it out to Las Vegas so I had to
ship it ground you know it can't even go
on an airplane or a boat the first time
we tried to ship at air they sent it
back the first time we tried to ship it
they actually sent it back and said no
you've got to put this on a truck and I
said okay um but it's this is one of
those things this is probably one of the
largest things we've taken apart in the
past year I've done some really
interesting things in the CNN magazine
there were some copies of it out there
you can see one of our tear downs we've
taken apart the Amazon echo we've taken
one of the parrot drones apart we've
taken apart a we've got a new one coming
up in the next issue of the magazine
that'll be really exciting so stay tuned
for that we've taken apart dr. ball yeah
we took apart an indeed a soccer bar one
of the my coach
smart soccer balls that was really cool
because there's a lot of Technology the
same technology that's in here rate
these the gyroscopes the accelerometers
they're in the soccer ball you can and
they're so small these days they require
so little power that you can put them in
almost anything you don't need great big
batteries like this anymore
to you know to power those types of
devices so that's what makes technology
like this popular I mean remember this
is basically you know a Segway right
it's just a smaller Segway note you guys
all remember when segways first come out
how expensive they were there's a reason
you can buy this so I bought this for
350 bucks at a grocery store not even
electronic shop you didn't have to go
there I walked into the grocery store
and I said oh here's a big you know
here's a big display of these things so
we were able to pick them up but for
that price because they're so you know
the technology has come down in price so
much since then that it's you know
companies are able to make these things
let's just hope they make them sort of
safely you know the last thing I'll
leave you with before we sort of wrap up
here it's just these the batteries like
I talked about before so if you do have
one of these what should you throw it
away should you not let your kids drive
it not necessarily I'm not saying that I
don't mean to say that all of these are
unsafe but there are certain
considerations you should have when you
buy them right so for example you
shouldn't if the manufacturer says you
shouldn't charge it overnight don't
charge it overnight make sure that
you're buying them from the reputable
vendor from one that seen it has put out
some reviews of them check that out
make sure that you're buying them
directly from the vendor and maybe not
through a third party if you do have one
and you're concerned about it you know
send it back contact the reseller
sometimes they'll give you their money
back if it's a a good vendor for example
I know a lot of people that bought these
from Amazon and they sham right back in
Amazon gave them credits right away
but do that otherwise you know just use
it safely and probably you know don't
keep it in your garage you know keep it
keep it keep it outside on the garage
well same same reason just don't keep it
in the living room either if someone
were to leave it plugged up overnight
and it was to overheat and get
overcharged then it's a little bit safer
if it starts a fire and it's outside or
somewhere as opposed to being in your
house or in your garage if you look at
the news stories you've seen the photos
of people of these under the Christmas
tree right with the Christmas tree and
everything caught on fire so that's the
last thing I'll kind of say about that
not to say that these are all unsafe
others you should you know immediately
Chuck the one you have but just so that
you're aware and you can make an
educated decision as a consumer so if
you will want to get in the audience
want to get one of these anybody wanting
to get one of these hoverboards what's
right what's the one guys already Galant
right it's not to say that the
technology itself is the technology
itself is not unsafe other than falling
off and bumping your head right it's
just that a lot of these are cheaply
made they come from the quality control
during the manufacturing process isn't
as tight as it should be on the
batteries or on the rest of the
components so you haven't really heard
of a lot of fires with segways right or
you don't hear you know a lot of fires
anymore with laptop batteries these days
it's because the manufacturing processes
for those batteries are tighter the
quality controls are tighter and so
that's why you know you just have to
know where you're buying the front</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
