the location is not this is the eighth
Apple store in the New York area but the
first one in Brooklyn New York City's
most populous borough as you might
expect it's located in the hipster area
of Williamsburg the Williamsburg Apple
store is built into a reconstructed
brick warehouse space heating with the
industrial vibe of the area and the
interior is dominated by a large open
seating area that Apple calls the forum
it's got wooden cubes for seating it's
got a large 6k screen and Apple says
members of the community and customers
are invited to just you know hang out
there there's also a smaller boardroom
area for meetings and presentations the
outer walls of the store called avenues
and they're lined with Apple products
and accessories the company says they're
meant to evoke the idea of walking down
a neighborhood street and seeing all the
different store fronts 120 people will
work at this store there's actually
another new Apple store coming soon that
is going to be built into the oculus in
the transit hub near the World Trade
Center it's surprising that it's taken
this long for Apple to open its first
store in Brooklyn but if the
Williamsburg Outlet is success I would
not be surprised if we see even more</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
