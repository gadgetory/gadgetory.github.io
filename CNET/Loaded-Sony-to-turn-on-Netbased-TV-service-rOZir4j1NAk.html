Bridget Carey on cnet com and it's time
to get loaded when Sony CEO so the
company is developing a different type
of television we now have an idea of
what that would be a TV that can stream
television shows through an internet
connection so viewers maybe don't need a
cable subscription sony has reportedly
been talking to several big media
companies like NBC Universal discovery
and News Corp to distribute content
through the playstation 3 and internet
connected televisions if your facebook
friends have been posting crude photos
of animal abuse and porn they've been
hit with a spam attack that has been
going around over the past few days
those who are affected cannot see proof
of anything happening but to friends it
shows they click to liked and shared
sexual and violent images such as one
photo of a dead dog the tax seems to be
caused by a browser vulnerability
although at this time Facebook hasn't
said what browser those affected were
likely duped into copying and pasting
JavaScript into their browser's URL and
in turn giving the bad guys an open door
into their account often promises a free
giveaways or contests entries or the
lower to get people to put javascript in
their URL if you've been affected change
your password go to settings delete any
strange applications and run a virus
scan Google will reveal the details of
its music service today google has been
inking deals with music labels down to
the final minutes before it kicks off
the new cloud-based music service it
will let users store the music online
purchase music and share songs on
Google+ cnet we'll be live-blogging the
announcement at two p.m. pacific five PM
eastern this afternoon the drum is
growing around a bill in commerce called
the Stop Online Piracy Act or SOPA
Hollywood is in support of SOPA which is
supposed to stop foreign or rogue
websites selling pirated movies and
distributing copyrighted material it
would give the government the power to
immediately blacklist domain names it
says or copyright infringing and it
would have the power to order a search
engine like Google to erase all links
and traces of a website the wording is
vague and the power is broad so web
giants like Google Facebook eBay yahoo
and AOL are all fighting against it the
Electronic Frontier Foundation calls it
disastrous a hearing before the full
House Judiciary Committee on this debate
is going on today some of us would do
anything for every stuff but would you
fill your facebook page with every item
of clothing you own to earn a chance to
get a gift
earn a quirky startup idea from the
founder of zappos com is called r NK D
or ringt don't ask me how to pronounce
it because there are no vowels and the
idea is that advertisers would love
people who share photos of the shirts or
the skirts hats belts and shoes they
wear and users will want to post this
stuff because they'll get rewarded by
the sellers I don't think my friends
would want me to fill my feet with
pictures of my clothes but for people to
take the time to do that it seems the
rewards would have to be really good
like free shoes good but the founder
said he has an iron out all the details
just yet those are your headlines for
today I'm Bridget Carey for cnet.com and
you've just been loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
