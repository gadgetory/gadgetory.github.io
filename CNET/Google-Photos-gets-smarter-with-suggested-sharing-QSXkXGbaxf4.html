while bowling with the team last weekend
he was too busy enjoying the moment so
he never got around to sharing them but
this time Google photos sent him a
reminder via notification and also by
badging the new sharing tab the sharing
tab is where you're gonna be able to
find all of your google photos sharing
activity and at the top your personal
suggestions they study you're sharing
habits and what's most important to you
and because Google photo sharing works
on any device including iOS let's have a
look at what Jhanvi sees on her iPhone
she receives a notification and ping on
it lets her quickly jump right into the
album and look at all the rows that
Davis shared with her so here we're now
looking at my Google Photos account from
the menu I now the option to go ahead
and share my library which I'm going to
go ahead and do with my wife Jess
importantly I have complete control over
which photos I automatically are I can
share them all or I can share subsets
like only photos of the kids or only
photos from a certain date forward like
when we first met so let's switch to her
phone to see what the experience looks
like from her end she receives a
notification and after accepting she can
now go to see all the photos that I've
shared with her we can access easily
from the menu now this is great but what
if just doesn't want to have to keep
coming back to this view and checking if
I shared new photos for her with her she
just wants every photo I take of her or
the kids to automatically be safe to her
library just as if she took the photos
herself with shared library she'd do
just that choosing to audit a photos
specific people I recently made a book
for Jess on Mother's Day and let me show
you just how easy and fast that was
it'll be a fun Mother's Day gift for her
she'll get a different surprise so I'll
select a bunch of us here and the good
news is I don't have to figure out which
are the right photos and which of the
good ones because this is where Google
photos really shines I'm just going to
go ahead and hit plus select photo book
I'm going to pick a hardcover book we
offer both a soft cover and a hard cover
and notice what happens
Google photos is going to make the best
photos for me automatically
automatically suggesting photo for in
this case how awesome is that</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
