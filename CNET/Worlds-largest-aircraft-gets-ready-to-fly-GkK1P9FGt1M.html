the private sector is doing some
interesting things for Space Exploration
this is a straddle launch carrier and
it's the world's largest aircraft if
you're measuring by wingspan that
wingspan is a massive 385 feet that's
larger than a standard football field on
May 31st it actually left its hangar for
fuel tests for the first time ever
before that date the plane was fully
constructed but supported by scaffolding
now the Strada launch aircraft is on its
28th wheels
removing the scaffolding also gave the
company the weight of the aircraft it
tips the scales at 500,000 pounds so
what is a straddle launch for the plane
is built to go into low-earth orbit to
launch rockets into space the Strato
launch aircraft will be taking test
flights over the coming weeks and months
at the Mojave Air and Space Port
originally test flights were to take
place in 2015 the first rocket launches
are tentatively scheduled for 2019 the
Strada launch is designed to carry up to
three rockets before its first flight
will carry just one if you've never
heard of strata lunch it's a company
that's backed by Microsoft co-founder
Paul Allen Allen says he's been
interested in space exploration since he
was a child for more information check
