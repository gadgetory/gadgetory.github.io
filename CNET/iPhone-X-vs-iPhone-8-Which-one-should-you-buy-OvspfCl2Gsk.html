choose from this year the iPhone eight
the A+ and a completely redesigned 10
version so which one should you buy
here's what you should consider
iPhones have never been cheap but this
time you could end up spending almost
$1,500 on one the iPhone 8 starts at 700
the plus at 800 and the cheapest 10 will
set you back $1,000 that's before tax
Apple care and extra storage so if
you're on a tight budget you may as well
rule out the 10 from the get-go or
consider the Apple upgrade program but
if price is not your main concern the
next thing you should think about is
size the iPhone plus gives you a bigger
screen but it's significantly bulkier
the traditional 8 is more comfortable to
maneuver with one hand but you sacrifice
almost an inch of screen real estate the
iPhone 10 falls at a happy medium
between the two in terms of size and
weight but with a bigger screen then
even the iPhone plus this thanks to a
nearly bezel S design so if the screen
is your top priority the 10 is the
obvious choice it has the largest screen
on any iPhone and an OLED display with
richer blacks and HDR technology for a
lifelike finished the downside is you'll
have to put up with that obvious knotch
all three have true tone technology that
adjusts the hues to ambient lighting but
the 8 and 8 plus still have that HD
Retina display what you won't find on
the 10 is a home button I will remove
the home button on its tenth anniversary
phone which means you'll have to learn a
new way of controlling your phone based
on gestures so if you're particularly
attached to a physical home button you
may want to go with the 8 or 8 plus the
fingerprint scanner this appeared right
along with the home button on the 10 it
uses face ID to unlock which Apple
boasts is even more secure than touch ID
the 8 and the 8 plus kept the same
fingerprint scanner on the home button
so if you're not ready to replace your
fingerprint with your face you may be
better off with one of these too now if
the camera is the most important feature
to you then you may as well skip the 8
both the 8 plus and the 10 have a second
telephoto lens for better zoom and DSLR
like portraits Plus Apple ad
portrait lighting to portrait mode which
makes any kind of studio lighting to
make portraits that much better the 10
does have a slightly faster aperture and
dual optical image stabilization and it
also does portrait mode on the front
camera for pro quality selfies all three
phones come equipped with Apple's AR kit
for immersive gameplay and looking at
the stars but the front true depth
camera on the 10 takes it a step further
with a special setup for face mapping
that can transform you into your
favorite snapchat filter or turn you
into an emoji version of yourself if
your current iPhone is on its last leg
and you can't wait another day then you
can eliminate the 10 from your wish list
right away
Apple's 10th anniversary iPhone won't be
available until November and that's if
it's not on backorder
you can pre-order the other two on
September 15th and have them in your
hands by September 22nd</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
