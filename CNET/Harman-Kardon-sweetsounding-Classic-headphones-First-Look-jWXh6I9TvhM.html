cnet.com and I'm here with the Harman
Kardon classic headphones hummert card
has recently gotten into the headphone
game and this is one of several models
in its lineup this one retails for a
hundred and ninety nine dollars and what
distinguishes it from a lot of other
headphones is obviously its stylish
design it has a unique look a lot of
headphones these days are starting to
have a square ear cups and this is in
that genre what's also interesting about
this is that the headband on it actually
comes in two sizes it's that top metal
portion that I'm talking about that's
replaceable and what's interesting was I
didn't think I had that big a head and
so when I tried the smaller one on it
fit pretty well but when I shifted to
the extra large size on that metal band
it fit a lot better and I felt a lot
better about the headphones comfort
level these do swivel and they do have a
detachable cable that cable has a built
in microphone as well as remote control
functionality for the iPhone and other
iOS devices those controls and that
microphone will not work with a lot of
Android smartphones and other smart
phones but they will work with some
models it's just hard to tell which ones
aside from their distinct design where
the Ciel's
really do shine is in this sound
department these are nicely balanced
headphones they have an audiophile sound
profile by that I mean they don't
accentuate the bass too much or the
treble they're really even sounding rich
sounding detailed and I like them a lot
on they're good for a wide range of
music the other thing worth mentioning
is that these guys fold flat but they
don't fold up still because they fold
flat and they are actually very flat
headphones when you put them in their
carrying case they don't take up that
much room in your bag that's really that
these are definitely a really nice pair
of headphones they may be a tad
expensive for some people at $1.99 but
they do hold up well against the
competition other headphones like the
B&amp;amp;W p3s for instance also retail for 109
we
didn't think these were a little bit
better than those I'm David Carr noise
and these are the Harman Kardon classic
headphones thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
