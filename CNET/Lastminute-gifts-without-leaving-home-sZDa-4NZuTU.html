you were almost out of time on your
holiday shopping so let's get real here
you need gifts and you need them faster
than a fat bank and shimmy down a
chimney
well the CNET elves are here to help if
you cannot get to a store in time
electronic gift cards can be sent
through email or consider giving a few
months of access to a subscription
service Spotify is popular for music and
movie paths is also hot this year it's
like Netflix but for first-run films
inside of actual movie theaters Amazon
can save you in a pinch Prime now gets
items delivered to your doorstep
in two hours just browse through Prime
now amazon.com and that quick delivery
service is only available in 32 metro
areas for prime subscribers and speaking
of prime you could just give someone a
prime subscription it's a way to get the
bundle of Amazon perks like free
shipping and access to a streaming
library of music movies and ebooks and
if the person already has a Prime
subscription they'll get the Amazon
credit now to be more personal
you could gift a specific digital book
through Amazon iTunes and Google Play
and on iTunes you can also send someone
a digital album or even an app if you
want to give a specific video game while
Amazon and Game Stop sell digital
download codes and steam is good for PC
gamers for the person who doesn't want
more stuff why not give an experience
using Groupon or LivingSocial and for
the person who always wants more stuff
there are subscription surprise boxes
for literally every interest geeks may
be familiar with loot crate but there's
also services for beauty addicts babies
fashionistas foodies fitness buffs even
cats can get their own box
I'm sure whiskers will be so thrilled
I'm Bridget Carey and you can comb
through more ideas on our CNET holiday
buyer's guide good luck my last minute
gift errs and Happy Holidays</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
