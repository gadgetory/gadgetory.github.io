people even watching right now they're
still right up there with flying cars in
terms of reality and likelihood but I've
got news for you
they're coming I'm Brian Cooley with my
top 5 reasons why I think you'll be glad
to have a hood or head-up display in
your next ride let's go number 5
eliminate the center console screen you
heard me
get rid of the center screen the head
unit I put this low because yes even in
the car business
this is considered heretical talk but it
is talk you see that big flat immovable
LCD right in the middle of your car is
kind of a big flat necessary evil for
car designers if they can get rid of
that thing and have more creative
flexibility in the middle of the dash
they'll do it I hope it just doesn't
mean more cupholders though number 4
gesture control in the car one of the
keys to powering future gesture control
of our dashboard gear is to have a
tightly integrated interface otherwise
you're flailing your arms all over not
sure what the car was expecting from you
or getting confirmation of what it
thinks you just flailed for a head-up
display can be that easy channel number
three information in context think about
it all the information your car presents
to you is basically in the wrong place
speed isn't shown late on the side of
the road navigations not shown laid out
on the lane even your engine
temperatures not displayed on the hood
nothing else is such a digital Picasso
in your life but HUD could make things
live where they should be number two
faster refocus every time you glanced at
a gauge or a screen you have to
dramatically change your eyes focal
plane and your center of focus and then
do it again when you look back out the
windshield and keep doing it over and
over and by the way it doesn't get
faster as drivers get older a HUD lets
your eyes stay in largely the same plane
of focus and the same scope of you
seeing everything number one is of
course the Holy Grail eyes on the road
because you can't react to what you
didn't see HUD technology for the first
time will let drivers see everything at
once integrating the information
driving with the optics of driving while
you carry out the physical actions of
driving in many ways the fact that cars
were born before hug technology is kind
of a sad accident of history more top 5
lists to wait the car lover go to see
net on cars calm but on top 5</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
