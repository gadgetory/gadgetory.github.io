look at the origin PCE on 13s and that
is a very rare feast indeed in that it
is a 13-inch gaming laptop you very
rarely see smaller gaming laptops so
usually 17 inches 18 inches lately we
have seen a bunch of 14-inch ones here's
the 13-inch example it's it's looks
thick and chunky for a 13-inch laptop it
almost looks like a system that sort of
skipped the last couple of generations
of thin sort of Ultrabook and Ultrabook
style designs but that's because you
need to have a certain amount of hep to
fit in all these high-powered components
you can configure this a lot of
different ways I think it starts off at
about $1,200 but really you need to get
about sixteen seventeen hundred to get
something that's good for gaming this
particular configuration is just under
twenty two hundred and that's because
it's got a very high-end Intel Core i7
processor pretty decent nvidia geforce
765 m graphics card and it's got three
hard drives to em Sata's and then a big
regular traditional 750 gig platter hard
drive which means you can get that you
know speed for launching applications
and the OS and then a lot of storage if
you want to download a lot of games I
assume will be downloading them because
there's no optical drive here but really
everybody gets their games through
download services like Steam now anyway
for gaming the system I thought really
works fairly well overall it's got a
1920 by 1080 screen now that's a very
high resolution for a 13-inch laptop but
when you're gaming you really don't want
anything less the keyboard kind of a
generic keyboard Alienware for example
does a better job of having custom
keyboards and really custom bodies for
gaming the touchpad nothing special most
of the time you're just gonna hook a
mouse up for gaming anyway and you'll
probably do what I did which is at least
half the time use the HDMI output to go
into a bigger monitor so then you've got
an external mouse an external keyboard
and a big let's say a 27 inch 1080p
monitor and you're just sort of using
this as the gaming back-end now the
battery life isn't killer so if you're
looking to let's say play a high-end
game on a cross-country flight using
this and not plugging in that's really
not going to work for you the only time
someone really get thinner than this in
the gaming laptop is that razor blade 14
which was super ambitious super nice but
that system was held back by a lower
resolution really low quality screen
that made it really hard to enjoy I
would much rather trade up to a a super
high resolution 1920 by 1080 screen like
we have here I'm Dan Ackerman and that
is the origin PCE on 13s</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
