the ipad android tablets are a great
choice the finding apps for an Android
tablet can be hit or miss with any luck
you'll get a gamer app that's clearly
optimized for a large screen but there's
an equally good chance that you'll end
up with a stretched out app that was
obviously designed for a smaller screen
of a smartphone so how do you find the
cool tablet-optimized apps here are a
few tricks to help first stop open up
the app for the Google Play Store and
head over to apps in most cases Google
will recognize that you're using a
tablet and will show you an option here
called staff picks for tablets it's a
long list of apps and games and you're
bound to find a few showcase apps worth
downloading it's also worth noting that
if you're searching the app store for
something specific like say a photo
editor including the word tablet in your
search tends to narrow the results to
something more useful another trick is
to use the web based version of the Play
Store which offers more advanced search
and sort functionality the same search
for a photo editor can be filtered by
device compatibility and ordered by
popularity and once you get to an app
page you can look at the user reviews
and find any that are specific to your
tablet if that's still too much hassle
you can download a separate front end
for the Play Store that just shows you
tablet-optimized apps one of the best
ones out there I've seen is called
tableau 5 HD you can browse new content
or sort by category but everything you
see has been hand-picked for how well it
performs on a tablet the google play
store still handles the purchase and the
download this app just takes the sting
out of finding great apps now if your
tablet runs on an nvidia tegra processor
that is a similar app out there called
TegraZone that does a great job tracking
all the latest tablet-optimized games
it's a free app and there's a good
chance that is already on your tablet
you probably thought it was crap where
but it's actually a great way to
discover games again Google handles the
actual purchase and download so you're
still in their ecosystem those are my
best tips for discovering great Android
apps for your tablet for more tips like
