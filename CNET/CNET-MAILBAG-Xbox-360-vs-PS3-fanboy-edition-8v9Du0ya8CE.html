to the cnet mailbag the show where we
answer all your questions even the
really mad ones about prize fights and
speaking of which let's get right into
it not surprisingly fans of the
PlayStation 3 were not happy when it
recently lost its prize fight against
the xbox 360 here are some of your
responses but FYI I left out all the
ones with lots of swearing you people
get mad William from New York rights
just finished the prize fight between
360 and ps3 the last category bang for
the buck should have been for the ps3
for a hundred dollars you get Wi-Fi
Bluetooth blu-ray free internet access
the blu-ray alone is worth well over one
hundred dollars I'm a brian Tong fan but
stop reading the fights nick says just
in regards to your 360 vs ps3 video it's
nice to know where Microsoft's money is
going straight into your pockets you
guys really have to quit with this
rubbish bias and hatred that the US
media seem to want to have for the ps3
and paul wrote quite a long analysis
breaking down the prize fights flaws by
category and ending with this sorry to
say but this prize fight stinks of bias
the ps3 is newer and better hardware
with a price that's appropriate for what
you get if you researched at all how
much it cost to produce the respected
products compared to what you get you
would clearly see this why is it always
about bias with you guys do you
seriously think that Microsoft pays us
off really because they don't believe me
also I'm not trying to start this up all
over again but it's pretty obvious that
the ps3 is too expensive because Sony
isn't selling any and everyone's pretty
sure they're finally going to drop the
price by a hundred bucks because they're
now totally desperate I'm just saying
too expensive in other prizefight email
mike says in the newest prizefight clips
vs sure did Jasmine Donald and Brian
tried on the earphones if they all did
it is fairly unhygienic especially when
they were in ear headphones I like
Donald and Jasmine's reviews therefore I
really hope their ears are fine after
sharing millions of bacteria with each
other yeah Mike I heard that prize fight
was like a visit to Madame Tussauds Wax
everywhere
okay here's some more fanboy male jack
says I am really really really curious
and upset that Y is a Power Core
connected to the macbook pro in video of
Wilson tang showing how to make widgets
live on desktop I always believed and
proud that apple notebook is one of the
best computer with longest battery life
so what was the Power Core for does this
recording process take more than three
to four hours to get all the juice out
of the macbook pro please please please
watch this for the next videos Apple
fans are not happy to see this again Wow
seriously you can't stand to see a
plugged in macbook pro because that
suggests the possibility that the
battery life might not be more awesome
than every other computer wow dude you
fan boys needed toughen up and fanboy
Joel rights why did you be little apple
hi Molly I'm mad I just watched the buzz
report my favorite show it was going
good then it happened you did a story
about phone makers agreeing to change to
universal charger by 2010 then you lose
it and say Apple are the only ones
against change excuse me Molly you're
wrong the ipod is the device of the
century and Apple has not changed the
charger since and that's after two
iphones and two ipod touches you know
how much times i lost broke forget my
charger and I was always able to get
another from my old ipods to friends
even at restaurants where my phone was
low on battery let's see another phone
or device do that Wow well Joel Apple
didn't actually introduce the dock
connector until the 3rd generation iPod
first they went through firewire and
then they dumped that and then they
switch to USB and then they dumped that
and then they went to the doc and sure a
lot of accessories use the dock but a
lot of them only work with older ipods
like how the really expensive kit in my
car doesn't recognize my iPhone even
though it's the standard dock connector
so it's not like they're so married to
the dock standard and let's not even get
into apples forced marches and eventual
abandonment toward firewire DVI and now
the all-new midi display board okay i am
mad today and finally just one more
thing that you were mad about aj says
haven't finished watching the buzz
report episode for FEHB 19 because i'm
sitting through a 60 plus second
commercial for verizon
what that crap is what is really
clogging the tubes what is with that
yeah I am also not happy about that and
I have no impassioned defense of it it
was totally a technological screw up and
we would never purposely subject you to
60 second ads I am very sorry and I am
NOT happy about all those lost streams
because it only happened on my show and
on that note let's end this angry angry
mailbag please do keep sending your mail
and i'll try not to yell at you so much
next time mailbag at cnet com or send
your snail mail to 235 second street san
francisco california 94 105 thanks for
watching everyone</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
