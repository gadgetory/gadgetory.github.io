and fair enough yeah so we'll be here
tomorrow Friday or Monday coming back on
Tuesday but you have guests on Friday
anyway yeah that's right a film director
James Gunn will be here talking to us
about well getting through his past the
movies he's done like super slow their
stuff like that and he's going to talk
to us about this new game he's got
that's coming out uh in conjunction with
the grasshopper manufacturer guys I know
that means nothing to you but they've
done some really really impressive stuff
like shadows of the damned killer
7 no more heroes and now lollipop
chainsaw did James Gunn right scooby-doo
I'm pretty sure he was the writer for
scooby-doo feel like he did yeah he used
to be involved in like the Troma films
Romeo liked Romeo and Romeo and Juliet
yeah I wonder if he knows like the South
Park guys then could be he might did he
I'm sorry he did Scooby Doo the original
and it's scooby-doo two monsters
unleashed so we have plenty to talk
about with James Gunn my face when he's
here on Friday and I'm gonna find
someone to replace you awesome so that
yeah it's not just like a one-on-one
Jeff and James sort of thing yeah that
would be nice as his vice god all right
so uh the show title today talks about
adding someone on facebook here's a
really strange story says it straight
man says that he's been outed by a Best
Buy employee on facebook how did this
happen this is a pretty old prank I feel
like I've done this to a lot of people
before but the first time ever heard of
an employee at a Best Buy doing it to
somebody okay so this story comes out of
Denver and this guy was on the news
talking about how he had a broken phone
and so he brought it into the geek squad
at best buy okay and they couldn't end
up actually fixing the phone so they
give him a replacement but I guess when
they transferred the sim card over he
didn't log out of his facebook and when
he got the new phone he checked his
status updates on ax he checked his
profile Murray and his profile said I am
gay I'm coming out no after he got the
phone back so some geek squad they holds
good dummy changed his feel like updated
his facebook status it what haven't you
done this before to where you just like
sent a mass text out or something that's
totally this usually real time when you
do something like that on twitter or
facebook it's pretty much gospel it's
pretty much a press release right you
know you're pretty much saying hey this
is it right I mean I'm my me myself I
don't know it's a really dumb prank yeah
I don't know if I would choose that
platform to make such a life-changing
sort of announcement sure yeah but man
oh man so what was the fallout we got a
lot of heat for it obviously and you
know a lot of people actually like the
status which is cool but of course cuz
there's nothing wrong with it I people
were just like commenting and
said he got a ton of phone calls from
his ex-spouses party for kids call them
his kids call them when they're you know
they wanted to know more about it bro
obviously Facebook is in the first place
I can out something like that of course
and like I said and we'd if it were true
obviously there's nothing wrong with it
write something wrong with it when it's
not true it's not fair that's not you
know that's not that's but the way the
guy handled it afterward is what I have
a problem but right instead of talk
about the victim yeah the victim is just
updating his status and leaving a
comment like hey sorry some idiot feel
employee I was I told me I would be like
oh my god yes this geek squad dude yeah
just mess with my status he actually
went to a lawyer and now there's
litigation in process tasks to Best Buy
which is probably a financial thing
right he's gonna try to get as much
money of this company's policy yeah I
mean I don't know do you think there's a
monetary uh compensation due to this guy
I guess so I mean I don't know what
would it be though it wouldn't be
defamation of character it would be what
I don't know i don't i don't know
there's no login trolling not i would be
in jail my life no in arizona you can't
troll anymore that's right we covered
that story I don't know it's a very
strange situation I don't think he's uh
he's he's owed anything no and plus
there's no way they could find out
whether or not this came from the
original Hanson right factor or through
best well nobody's owed he's old like a
thousand-dollar best buy gift
certificate yes that's what he's owed
it's a couple CD spindles yeah get him
what a blank cd-rs best buy sell anymore
not anything I want really refrigerator
get this guy refrigerator yeah free
refrigerator with a TV screen in it sour
candy alright that's it um it's a good
lesson to be learned here though right
log out of all your apps before giving
your phone over to me shouldn't have to
do that you shouldn't have to do that
it's the smart thing to do but you
shouldn't have to worry about that when
you're handing over a piece of
electronics do a company like this okay
and obviously this guy should get canned
it's a little funny but he should get
fired yeah right think we're all in
agreement there sure fire this idiot um
so everyone knows zynga acquired OMG pop
the company behind draw something for a
shockingly overpriced one
million dollars right basically for one
app for draw something redeem that you
cannot lose apparently I've been playing
this game for like a month I stopped yes
it's not fun anymore right you can't
lose you can't you draw and everyone
gets it and that's it you can't lose
it's too easy right so uh this is the
story from the Atlantic talks about the
decline and fall of draw something
mm-hmm uh so yeah draw something is
obviously a game from OMG pop they're
psyched because how much did they 1
billion a billion dollars from facebook
for this and not about Zynga I'm sorry
Zynga uh yeah so they netted 35 million
downloads within the first seven weeks
when it debuted back in February right
and uh the Atlantic came out with this
article that sort of analyzed a chart of
their hits and Zynga seems my like they
might be regretting that purchase cuz
that uh amount of downloads has gone
down for 15 million when they first
bought it down to 10 million which is
clearly less than the amount and they
purchased it for well I think the big
sort so this is um these are downloads
right yeah all right so obviously you
can't I mean unless you're something
like all instagram went up after
facebook bought instagram right but uh
draw something went down which is just i
wasn't a bill i said a billion dollar
was it a billion dollars no wasn't a
billion dollars was 180 million
Instagram was a billion yeah instagram
i'm sorry about that uh it went down
well and I mean this chart is sort of
deceiving though because it's only going
you know there's a lot of this 10 to 15
that's only 10 to 15 million so you're
sort of you know it's sort of
exaggerating what's not a huge decline I
mean they're still ramming in 10 million
downloads as of yesterday yeah I mean I
think the point is by looking at this
graph it's clearly on a down right it's
definitely going down which sort of
sucks I mean but it's not I mean what do
you think do you think this is just a
prime example of paying too much and
sort of not getting what you pay for or
is it just like the harsh reality of
like you know what unless it's Angry
Birds yeah you're you're you know these
things are sort of one-hit wonders yeah
that's what I definitely think that
there's an issue of like the long tail
of draw something here right it's
basically just pictionary
and people are just breaking out there
pictionary games at home you play a few
games right and no one wants to play
anymore its kind of like the spark is
gone it's there's just a false sense of
fun I mean it's really just like a
one-trick pony and the whole the big
buzz was like oh my god there are some
artists here yeah that are you know
using it to jar really intricate and
detailed drawings &amp;amp; and then now we have
like the best draw something drugs and
all that's done yeah in internet time it
was like 24 hours I me over I think it's
useful to compare it to a game like
angry birds for example which I'm still
playing it's because they came out with
new packs they continue to come out with
new games right which makes it still you
know more fun The Biggest Loser in all
this the stylus industry ya know those
people have been using the galaxy tab
style is to plan something for sharing
some pretty cool stuff but I even
anecdotally I've been using this for a
couple weeks just apply to play anymore
plan now i plated maybe three times I
was down there I mean you can guess
anything yet you know this the they have
to figure out a way to make it harder it
has to be harder to lose because the
fact that all the letters there and they
get all scrambled up and you're like oh
he's just probably drawing you know New
Jersey or whatever it is that's all you
know I can just tell just by the letters
that are there how many variations of a
penis can you draw on draw something
that's what makes it the most fun right
like this isn't a word well you know you
just don't like different types of like
perverted stuff that's right okay you
know what I don't know I don't do that
your weirdo you know what I can't stand
with that when someone sort you watch
them draw it out and then they just give
it up and right to ya on the scratch
it's just like man you suck yeah I know
what I do I get it wrong on purpose I
didn't I've in that point is there any
game that you have for your phone that
you've been playing for more than a year
ah probably angry birds I but I don't
play the stuff I've beaten already I
just play through and then i'm done i've
been playing a lot of scramble with
friends i think that's fun that's from
OMG pop as well no it's Zynga okay zinc
yeah they it's basically boggle but you
play 10 you have to like drag your
finger to create worried spell words and
then there's three rounds and you go
back and forth and then there's a winner
that's a lot of fun I know you playing
the games Richard
playing arms I i play draw something I
played a lot of that but yeah I'm
getting cigarette your second choice the
honeymoons over man I also play scramble
with friends everyone so I played with
you wasn't he kills me I did I think I
literally murdered you that's why I have
a request another game how about this i
won't do any uh you know that those
perks I'll make a deal with you I won't
do any perks next time okay and you can
do all the Pearl you want do you think
that's cheating that you can use those
because sometimes if you use too many of
those yeah we're like gives you it it
cheats for you basically right you mean
inspiration yeah inspiration yeah you
think that's do I think that's cheating
yeah no I mean if you use any like third
party like there are some people who I
hate that that sheet in in words with
friends where they use arm they use
third-party programs to basically tell
them the words that they can spell like
an anagram yes some sort of like bot
that does the work for them that's
freaking cheating but I mean that
inspiration in the freeze time and those
are built into the game yes that's are
you trying to make an excuse or accusing
you of cheating these accuse me of
cheating by via settled into the game oh
man all right Richard now maybe I won't
allow you to get a free shot at me no
it's just really difficult to believe
that you have a good sense of vocabulary
it has nothing to do with vocabulary it
really does is just about seeing things
video just strategy after a while and
fun game it is a fun game uh speaking of
games big news yesterday uh Activision
confirming that call of duty will have a
sequel again this year with the with the
shock to no one yeah it's called black
ops 2 what nothing what do you laughing
at also going to be call of duty Occupy
Wall Street you want a game games all
right there you go well you know
honestly could have been anything it
seems like they just sort of just
shuffle up a bunch of like world
conflicts and a hat and pick that one
and then they got their new role duty
game but no they're doing a sequel to
black ops 2 what's cool about this if
you're going to find something cool
about it it's that it takes place in the
future it's the first game that it's so
like the first black treyarch game
so so the way it works is there's call
duty game every year it's been like that
for like seven years now Larry had a
three okay yeah it's confusing for
someone looking on the outside in and
continue your like on it I don't like
tell it's good seriously you can barely
make out the picture up so they sort of
alternate every year in terms of
developers select the modern warfare
series is referenced modern warfare is
done by infinity ward and then treyarch
does world at war they do the black ops
now they're doing black ops 2 gotcha
historically the black the treyarch
games have dealt with conflicts in the
in history now they're jumping ahead and
they're doing something from the year 20
25 nerium ad they're imagining what a
21st century Cold War would be like uh
yeah I mean yeah so it's not really much
news here people are sort of like a
lukewarm reception yes because it's like
how many times can you play the same
game over and over again I remember when
black ops originally came out people
were really into the zombie mode do you
think it's gonna yeah i can probably i
think i mean if they're there they're
not they're not stupid they'll they'll
do that again whether it's uh it comes
in with the game or it's a add on that
you download after the fact um yeah I
mean cherrim sourcing like what is this
call duty nine yeah it's crazy there's
so many games I don't know I mean it
looks like you'll be able to pilot up
air vehicles and tanks and stuff in this
one do you do you have the same feeling
about video game franchises as you do
about sequels or reboot or mooses it's
worse in games because there's so many
more sequels right I don't know if
that's act factually accurate but it
feels like there are much more sequels
in many more sequels in gaming than
there are in movies yeah I mean
obviously if the call call it was a call
of duty black cops um ya know do you
ever seen that album car that looking
for Winslow yeah Carl of duty black cops
you haven't see not that old there look
show me yeah
we uh those good name when it for him
always plays a cop yeah he does oh my
god is that funny I didn't ever thank
you yeah let's see let's see it on xbox
here you go it's fantastic my original
point is that don't you think fuckity
loves it let's just say so it's just so
good yeah it's I can't believe I haven't
come across as taking credit for that
you should have met all in that I would
have given you give I have something
yeah no I'm saying like don't you think
the publishers would rather go with the
game franchise that they know would be
successful rather than taking a rewrite
I'm coming out with something new you're
right and I feel like maybe I'm in the
minority that demands creativity right
like even you know even though the
walking dead game that came out last
week obviously there's AB in a comic
book there's been a TV show and now the
mood and now the game games really good
yeah it's sort of a unique take on the
walking dead right so I don't know I
this is just base it's like the same
thing over and over again and look I'm
I'm not gonna I'm gonna play I will play
and i will like it and i will hate
myself for liking it but i don't know i
just i demand creativity maybe the the
new vehicles and stuff is enough but i
don't know did I see something about a
walking dead video game coming up oh you
didn't know about that no no we didn't
talk about that up so you don't read
what I write on our fantastic website uh
sometimes I do mostly time I do not
about this did you it will tell me about
it now absolutely so telltale games and
this is a company there's the company
behind the back to the future game that
came out a couple months ago these sort
they do these sort of episodic video
game releases okay there were I think
five think there were five back to the
future episodes there's gonna be five
walking dead episodes so it's a brand
new take on an on a brand new character
okay and it's not what you think it's
not a very it's not an action II game
it's story-driven character-driven it's
basically like a point-and-click
adventure you ever play one of those on
on a computer back in the day
probably yeah yeah it's like those old
lucasarts games where you're you're sort
of making decisions along your way
there's a RPG element where you're like
oh you know I gotta choose whether to go
left or right it's a little more intense
in The Walking Dead you basically have
to decide who lives and who dies and
it's graphic it's not a typical telltale
Game this is rated a blow it's crazy
it's really kind of scary here's some of
the new years of video of what the games
actually like Diana were still in
Savannah ad had a little incident with
some crazy guy near the hotel so we had
to get him back to the ER and have it
checked out anyway he's not feeling well
enough to drive back tonight so we're
staying an extra day thanks so much for
looking after Clementine and I promise
we'll be back in time before spring
break oh my god finally I don't know if
you tried to reach us all the calls are
getting dropped and they're not letting
us leave and aren't telling us anything
about Atlanta please please just leave
the city and take come in time with you
back to marietta I've got to get back to
the hospital please let me know that
you're saying message 3 651 Clementine
maybe if you can hear this call the
police 911
it's crazy man that's messed up it's
really good they did a really good job
with it um yeah so ma I feel it's in in
my personal opinion if you've read the
comic books you're going to find that
the game is much more true to the
feeling of the walking dead so the
original characters from the comic are
in it don't want to say that okay but
you the main character that you sort of
play as is a brand new character not in
the comic i can say cuz i'm all caught
up in the comic and not in the TV show
either but it's still the world it's
that university a zombie ya dystopian no
it'sit's The Walking Dead universe cruel
it's really cool we'll take a break when
we come back more with the 404 some
voicemails and emails stick around we
got a lot more coming your way this is

asking about more about walking dead
sort of stuff I read it digitally it's a
beautiful Comicon on the new iPad it
looks really good it's black and white
but it's really really good is there
like a subscription system you have
Image Comics Image Comics allows you are
you laughing laughing because I know
that you don't always endorse the right
way to do things no I that's why I'm
asking yeah Image Comics has a
subscription sort of thing how much is
it you can get it it's uh it's 299
during an issue so it comes out about
every six to eight weeks ok so I'm a big
fan they're about to hit their hundredth

compendium which is what I 48 yeah hatch
