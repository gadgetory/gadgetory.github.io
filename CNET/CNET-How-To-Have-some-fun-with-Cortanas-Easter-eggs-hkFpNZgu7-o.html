it's time to have some fun with Cortana
Microsoft's virtual assistant I'm Lexie
Steve a DS for C net and here are some
of my favorite Easter eggs to bring up
Cortana just press Windows key + C or
activate hey Cortana hey Cortana testing
check check is this thing on check let's
start with her origin story who's your
daddy technically speaking
that'd be Bill Gates no big deal
sticking with the Microsoft theme let's
ask her about the previous Microsoft
virtual assistant that everybody loved
to hate do you like Clippy what's not to
like that guy took a heck of a beating
and he's still smiling and how about
that other virtual assistant Siri what
do you think of theory I think it's cool
that she's out there trying to make
people's lives a little easier very
diplomatic
now Cortana is the artificial
intelligence character in the Halo video
game so let's ask her a couple of
questions where is Master Chief
hopefully getting some R&amp;amp;R he has saved
the galaxy three or four times the guy
needs a vacation
tell me about halo 5 I'm quite certain
you don't have proper security clearance
for that information
she can also entertain you with things
like this sing me a song on top of
spaghetti all covered with cheese
I lost my poor meatball when somebody
sneezed but if you want to get a bit
more specific you can ask her this
what does the Fox say
ring-ding-ding-ding-dingeringeding now
that's in your head you probably want to
get her to tell you a joke tell me a
joke
what do you call two crows on a branch
attempted murder and finally the big one
what's the answer to life the universe
and everything that makes 42 so this is
just a few of the fun Easter eggs that
Cortana has in store if you have some of
your own I'd love to hear from you can
tweet me at Lexus Avedis and make sure
to check out the rest of our Windows 10
coverage at cnet.com hey Cortana goodbye
bye now</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
