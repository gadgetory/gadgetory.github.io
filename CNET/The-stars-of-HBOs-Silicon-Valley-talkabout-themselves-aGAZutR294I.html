two of the castle herbs of Silicon
Valley's Atwood smart star now talking
about your characters a little bit I
mean watching the show Gilfillan he's
kind of like he seems to be like badass
of the group if there was one badass
cool man thanks you know but how but he
somehow knows how close are you how
close are you in person to guilt Lou
Martin is is Liana's modest be honest
well he's got the tender heart of an
overweight Greek god Martin yeah I think
you're a badass Ivan described you
submit it I wear a leather vest around
set I think that's mostly what he prefer
just to get you you know in that moment
a leather vest yeah I killed the cow
that it once belonged to how would you
describe Zak's character compared to how
he is a person right he's kind of like
 like the maternal like yeah you
know he is x-axis sweeter man I think
it's obvious in the and on the show he's
the sweet qualities that are in here
that are innate in that character I
think are innate in Zach therefore
really easy to for him to tap into but
even if that weren't like him he'd I
know he can do it really well because of
how talented he is well the feeling's
mutual
you guys want to hug this out yes I
think part of what's hopefully good
about the show but is definitely good
about our experience of making the show
is kind of adore each other I mean and I
think there's a lot of like mutual
respect Parton stars like one of my
heroes like from freaks and geeks and
partied a name is like one of the actors
I wanted to emulate you know early in
season one people were saying there's
not enough women above Silicon Valley
season two oh god they got a few you
know the dynamic in Silicon Valley there
are that many women in general but just
for you as actors that we haven't seen
enough maybe romance and love lines so
yeah I think because it since it's an
actual problem in tech that women are
underrepresented if a satirical show
sort of corrects that in the fictional
representation of the world then you're
not satirizing it you're just improving
it but not in the real world and also
not making light or note of the actual
issues yeah just in the discrete so what
are the key things you do want see I
mean there are obviously women it's we
would prefer to have more when I would
yeah I'm around give me just a show that
the team you know have some fun with
small get some of the ladies
would you describe it also get in the
business side of it too it's just
hopefully the actual Silicon Valley will
lead the way yeah and then our satirical
Ashok we'd love to satirize more women
on the show yeah awesome guys well
thanks so much for your time here we
appreciate it we can't wait to see
season three thank you
all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
