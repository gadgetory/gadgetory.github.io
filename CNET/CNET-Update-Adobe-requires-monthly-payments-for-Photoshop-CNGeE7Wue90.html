to everything I'm Bridget Carey and this
is your CNN update you can no longer
simply buy the full Photoshop program or
any other software from Adobe's Creative
Suite Adobe announced that now customers
must subscribe to the Creative Cloud to
get updated versions of Adobe's full
software suite getting the whole suite
cost $50 a month whereas buying the
whole suite at once used to cost twenty
five hundred dollars in this
subscription model customers might be
more willing to pay that $50 monthly fee
for the chance to use all of the
software and it's the equivalent of
paint it off over the course of four
years and four years is probably when
you want to upgrade again anyway if you
just want an individual program it'll
cost $20 a month this subscription cloud
service was first introduced as an
option last year and Adobe says
customers prefer it so now the company
made subscriptions the only option
although if you use something like
Photoshop Elements which is a lite
version with less features you can still
buy that with a flat one-time fee this
subscription stuff only applies to the
full versions of the Creative Suite now
we branded as the Creative Cloud we're
seeing many software companies slowly
switch over to subscription models
Microsoft Office began pushing a
subscription option and so our other
productivity and storage apps like
Evernote and Dropbox
with subscriptions software updates are
rolled out continuously to users rather
than having one big update you pay for
every year or two and YouTube wants to
collect monthly fees from you as well
we're expecting to hear something soon
about YouTube launching a paid
subscription service the Financial Times
is reporting that YouTube will introduce
a new ala carte service this week first
luckam four channels that require
viewers to pay two dollars a month to
access the videos YouTube confirmed it
is working on this subscription model
but it's just unclear exactly when it
will launch and if you've been thinking
about getting a fitness tracking gadget
the Fitbit flex wristband is out now and
our CNET review says this is the best
fitness tracker you can buy and that's
because it's comfortable to wear and has
a good variety of health tracking
features the unit tracks your steps
sleep and calories burned of course
that's an estimate of how much are
moving your arms around
the day right now it only offers direct
blue suits syncing with the iPhone the
Samsung Galaxy s3 and the Galaxy Note
but if you don't have those phones you
can just sync it to the computer to
analyze your stats the Flex also has
this little LED screen at this place how
far along you are at meeting your daily
step goal with little dots so you can
quickly check if it's worth taking the
stairs or the long way home to meet that
goal you can also see how restful your
sleep is it tracks how much you move
around the night it costs $100 and comes
in several colors although you have to
pay extra for those fun colors
that's your tech news update you can
