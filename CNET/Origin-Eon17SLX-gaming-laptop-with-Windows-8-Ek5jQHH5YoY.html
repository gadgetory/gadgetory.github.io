a look at the origin Aeon 17 SLX
as you can see this is a huge massive
desktop replacement laptop meant for
gaming big gaming laptop and the big
difference between this origin and some
previous very similar models we've
looked at is that this guy finally has
Windows 8 now interestingly you can
still order it with Windows 7 at least
for now and origin tells me that more
people are currently ordering this
system with Windows 7 than Windows 8 you
know honestly despite all the complaints
people have had about Windows 8 and how
it works with different game apps really
doesn't make a huge amount of difference
once you actually get your games
installed on here you're just gonna be
running them from the traditional
desktop most of the time instead of from
this tile based windows 8 experience and
of course this is something fairly rare
for Windows 8 laptop so we've seen so
far this is not actually a touchscreen
most Windows 8 laptops that we've at
least revealed so far have been touch
screens I found myself the first time I
turn this on instinctively reaching out
and trying to swipe on pass that Windows
8 lock screen until I remembered that I
actually have to go to the keyboard and
touchpad or external Mouse in order to
interact with it now the chassis here a
little generic looking that's because
boutique PC makers like Origen use
off-the-shelf cleveo bodies or from
other laptop companies and just kind of
build their own components into them and
tweak them a little bit I will say this
cleveo case is a little bit different
from the last couple of ones we've seen
they made a couple of improvements the
touchpad has been replaced with a click
pad version that's just a big pad with
no buttons that means they move the
fingerprint reader over here to the side
they move some of the ports around they
made it a little bit thinner and more
tapered in the back you still do get a
lot of ports and connections which is
good for a multimedia friendly desktop
replacement laptop but really the real
star here is the internal components the
stuff you don't see this particular
version very high-end it's got an Intel
Extreme Edition quad core Core i7
processor it's got two video cards it
has got two 120 gig SSDs
and a one terabyte standard hard drive
and when you put all that together this
particular configuration cost about
$4,500 which is certainly a lot to spend
you can change the configuration and get
it down to about 1800 or so you're not
gonna get nearly the performance out of
it and of course at this super-high in
level we're at it pretty much killed any
gaming tests we threw at it you can just
take any new game pretty much cranked
everything up to the maximum settings
and it's gonna play just fine now of
course you're gonna pay a lot for that
privilege and honestly you're not paying
for the looks it's kind of a boxing not
very modern looking laptop but you
aren't paying for it not just the super
advanced components but all the hand
assembly and hand testing that Origen
does and they're really well regarded
support services we can get people on
the phone easily if you have any kind of
problem they'll take care of you and
that's the sort of you know hand-holding
that you can't get with the bigger PC
brands and that's why people who are
really into gaming and performance
laptops often don't mind spending a
little bit more on something like this
I'm Dan Ackerman and that is the origin
