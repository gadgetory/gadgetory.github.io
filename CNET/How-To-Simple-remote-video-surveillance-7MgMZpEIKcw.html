vacation or traveling for work you might
be a little worried or at least curious
about what's going on while you're away
or maybe you want to keep an eye on your
office area or even monitor your child
while you're in another room all of
these problems can be solved with a
little video surveillance companies will
charge you hundreds if not thousands of
dollars to set this up but if you're
looking for a quick and dirty solution
I've got you covered I'm Sharon Vaknin
for cnet with a guy to turning any
webcam into a video surveillance camera
that you can monitor with your tablet or
smartphone to show you how all of this
works I'm going to use my laptop to
monitor my desk area because i'm pretty
sure someone's been swiping gum off my
desk when i'm not around to get started
you'll need to install a piece of
software on any computer you want to use
as a camera and an app on your tablet or
smartphone head to your computer and
download icam source it's free and you
can grab it from skj mcom once its
installed start the program and select
your webcam from the drop-down list next
to video source now before you hit start
create a login username and password use
one that you'll remember but make sure
it's secure enough so that no one
especially friends and family can crack
it when you're done click start you'll
likely be prompted to let icam through
your firewall click allow access to
continue now repeat this installation
for every webcam you want to use for
surveillance if you want to add
additional cameras or want to use
something a little more discreet than a
computer consider purchasing IP cameras
there's standalone cameras that can
connect to your network and stream the
surveillance setup instructions for
using one with I cam are available on
the website but for my purpose using my
work computer's webcam is good enough
now grab your phone or tablet and
install the I cam app on your device
that's how we'll monitor my computer's
webcam there are apps available for
Android and iPhone so just search for I
cam in your App Store when you launch
the app for the first time it'll ask you
if you want to receive push
modifications that's up to you but I'm
enabling it so when I came to text
motion I'll get a push notification
almost immediately now enter your login
hit done and you can start monitoring
right away all right now that it's all
set up let's put it to work I'm going to
put my laptop back up my desk and see
what happens while i'm away maybe I'll
finally identify the perp you owes me a
pack or two of gum alright with I came
running at my desk and the app on my
iPad I'll wait to see if it detects any
motion
all right I got an alert so we'll open
up the app and there she is looks like
Karina I will be having a little
discussion later today now a couple of
things for this whole setup to work the
computers you'll be using for
surveillance need to stay on and
connected to the Internet and since the
stills I can records when it detects
motion are kept on the computer that
sees them you won't be able to access
those images while you're away to get
around this consider putting the icam
source motion events folder in your
dropbox so you can access them anywhere
if you have any questions hit me up on
Twitter and subscribe to my facebook
page for more tips like this for cnet
