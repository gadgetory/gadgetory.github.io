signs of life have found something very
interesting a repeating fast radio
bursts and it has some people wondering
is it aliens well truth is there's no
clear answer but before we start talking
about little green men
let me explain these fast radio bursts
or FRBS for short
they are signals far beyond the Milky
Way and they only last a few
milliseconds and since scientists first
noticed them only about two dozen have
been recorded it's usually a random
event there's this one particular FRB
spot that has scientists intrigued is
from a distant dwarf galaxy about three
billion light-years away
a burst was found there in 2012 but a
few years later in 2015 another burst
was found in that same spot jump to this
past week and researchers pointed
instruments at that spot again watching
for five hours across a wide frequency
band and after combing through four
hundred terabytes of data they found a
radio signal pulsing there 15 more times
so what could have caused that are these
outbursts from neutron stars or directed
energy from alien worlds scientists are
still not sure but whatever or whoever
causes those bright radio bursts well
that happened a very long time ago when
life-forms on earth were just
single-cell organisms we are just able
to see it now and the researchers are
asking other astronomers to look up to
the sky for follow-up observations to
help gather more data I'm Bridget Carey
