had at CES 2017 was the Lenovo VR
headset doesn't have an official name
now they're just calling it the VR
headset it's built on the windows
holographic platform which is a
Microsoft endorsed platform for making
less expensive VR headsets this is also
lighter than other VR headsets like the
HTC vive or the oculus rift and in
trying it out this was a non working
prototype I found it easier to put on
the front panel lifts up and out and it
works better with glasses I have a hard
time fitting my glasses behind let's say
an oculus rift but the big difference
here is the Lenovo VR headset doesn't
use external sensors or trackers like
those other guys where you need to set
up a lighthouse or a little camera and
this is an inside-out model it's
actually got two cameras built into the
headset that look out and do all your
positioning and room tracking for you
now that allows for it more augmented
reality because the cameras on the
headset can look out and present to you
inside that view of what you're seeing
and then put things on top of it a
little bit like microsoft hololens just
in a more traditional VR setup now this
guy should be out in the second half of
2017 and like a lot of the other
proposed windows holographic platform
devices it should be less expensive and
cost around $400</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
