headset in collaboration with valve a
composer is making music with slime and
3d printed food that grows its own
feeling oh my god HTC half-life 3
confirmed tomorrow daily
creating citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk show the known universe I'm
punching this guy i oh i know i'm your
host Ashley's gonna join me as always
just on the other side of the camera is
producer Logan Logan Logan muy if you're
if you're looking for his last name kale
kale as we mentioned last week was going
out to see his grandma for her birthday
surprised everybody apparently his
grandma was very excited to see him
unfortunately kale is snowed in at the
airport and they just keep cancelling
his plane ticket home so we don't know
it we think kayla just moved to
Connecticut yeah he just lives there now
he just lives there and today this
morning he sent me some video footage he
shot at the airport wanted us wanted me
to show this to you guys so a room do we
have that
what's hiding there yeah people are
really upset about missing their flights
so come home soon kale and hopefully
hopefully we're hoping to get a flight
home tonight but yeah he's been trying
to get a flight home for like over a day
at this point so he's gonna end up being
like Tom Hanks in that terminal movie
yeah where he's just lives in one bad
movie over and over again over and over
yeah it's gonna be terrible um but on
that note we've got some great stories
for you today so let's hit the headlines
this was a story I was bummed kale
wasn't here to talk about it's a very
kale story it's about very kale centric
story HTC announced at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona this weekend a VR
headset and not just any VR headset they
developed it with valve creators of
steam and they're the first video game
company to kind of get involved with the
VR as a brand right like riding VR um
well Sony said project Morpheus Oh the
right but it hasn't it still not come to
consumers nothing it out there is like
really retail that are these sort of PC
gaming virtual reality headset so I'll
explain a little bit about this it's
going to compete this is a PC gaming VR
headset meaning you don't slide a phone
into it to use it so we have like the
gear VR where you put your phone in and
then you use it and you have to pretty
much have a specific brand of phone Trey
use it right um so this is actually a
standalone VR headset that plugs into
your PC it's called the vivre or the
Viva I think it's beep leave hpc 55 vibe
like live live like five um I'm gonna be
I'm going to take the French tactical de
vivre it's the Viva so it's a
partnership with valve there is HTC's
Peter to showing off it again does not
use a phone standalone headset use the
pc they talked about at Mobile World
Congress using a pair of controllers
which would suggest something similar to
what sony has going with their
PlayStation Move where you have like
sort of it looks like ice cream from
camp like the sticks it seems like a
good alternative to happen to buy an
entire stage that you can walk in place
on very true and um and so what they
were saying is they promised full room
virtual reality via something they're
calling room scale experience so that
you can actually walk around objects
like they're going to scan your room
that the
said itself has room scanning technology
in it so the headset has like a camera
on the front of it guys like a scanning
technology sort of like a kinect almost
where it would like scan the room and
then you'd be able to start yeah and
then so they want to release it
developer edition this month which is
really soon which means they are ready
to immediately get in development which
is cool and then consumer headset later
this year basically goes head-to-head
with oculus so it's going to be this
holiday season is going to be eight this
is going to be the hot ticket item I
think I'm calling it now it's it's not
even it's like ten months before
Christmas VR headset is gonna be the hot
ticket item are you gonna get the first
generation of consumer VR headsets I
think I have to yeah I feel like I have
to I just want I just want to have it
I've tried the oculus rift demos I'd
like it's just so cool and so fun to use
and I just really enjoyed I gotta I'll
buy it I don't know if I'm willing to
pay twice as much as what I will pay two
years from now fair um but I'll go over
to your house and use yours yeah yeah
you can just come over my house and you
use it it's totally fine but yeah so
really interesting stuff you can go over
to HTC's website they have everything
and then we also have some stuff on cnet
that will have later this week with the
the vibe which is pretty cool it was
kind of surprising that they held the
event on a Sunday I didn't I wasn't
expecting to wake up and see tech news
yet yesterday so that's a that's a
mobile world congress thing so they just
kind of like CES where everything kind
of starts at the beginning of the week
and then goes through mobile world
congress is sort of press day is like
that sunday and then we do all their
press conferences and all the news comes
out and then and then they have the rest
of the conference sort of do things and
a whole bunch of cnet is at is in
barcelona right now and to those people
I say hola and I don't know I have good
luck buena suerte you have to do a
little list because they're in Barcelona
um yeah so good luck have it have a
great trip at Mobile World Congress and
and yeah so that's a that's the that's
the haps over at mwc some really
interesting VR stuff tell me about this
professor with the slime mold because
I'm you're really into music yeah so a
professor / composer made is making
music or making a musical duet with
using fungus a bio-computer an iPad and
some slime weird yeah so what happens is
um so he plays he has a grand piano
plays the music he plays notes on a
grand piano okay so I'm the professor it
is then picked up by a piece of fungus
which is known to to be able to read
audio signals or audio notes ok so i
play my piano into a microphone
microphone sense sends music my music
piano music to the fungus yes ok and
then the fungus much like we learned in
Ghost Busters can fungus and slime can
transmit electrical signals cool so the
fungus then interprets these musical
notes and sends it through the
bio-computer which is able to interpret
the the messages being sent from the
fungus so as we're looking at this video
if I'm not mistaken that stuff the wires
right there that are coming out that's
actually going down into the fungus
that's ok so that's the piano obviously
i'm not completely bonehead right but
those go and then there's a the fungus
is part of a bio-computer so the fungus
is inside the bio-computer or surrounded
by in some way ok and then so when when
the fungus receives the musical notes it
then transmits own signal out of out of
the fungus through the bio-computer and
then it controls it goes to an iPad
which then controls these are these
magnets that are hovered over piano
strings mmm and so the fungus is is
taking the the music from the piano
interpreting it and sending it out to
make its own music that is the weirdest
thing I've ever heard of and now the
composer rather than just control piece
of fungus decided to play along with it
well why would you not as one does right
you have a chance to play music with
nature why not we thought with it with
the tree stump final oh yeah yeah the
tree suppress your ok so but the music
sounded very safe science fiction to you
had like a lot of weird toe do we we
actually have a sample of it if you want
to go take a listen so if you're if
you're listening to it right now which
probably are it sounds like almost like
out of 2001
yeah it's very very very bleak and a
little depressing yeah and a little uh
just very sci-fi like it has that weird
b-movie sci-fi like almost like they're
I mean but not but much more dinner but
it sounds like a synthesizer but not at
all it's all analog instruments from the
the sound is coming from from the
magnets which is rather than plucking a
string like a piano hits hits a string
and reading a response from the fungus
right and then the ipad's telling saying
okay here's your response and now I'm
telling what the electromagnets yes
vibrating the strings using magnets as
opposed to actually physically hitting
the string that's weird so that's what
causing the more of the the synthesizer
sound can we expect the mold to do a
collaboration with Kanye West this year
yeah but it's a surprise so you know
what we can't say too much about it I
won't say anything about it um so that
brings me to our hashtag today actually
TD duets is our hashtag of the day and I
think the question is what weird musical
pairing would you want to hear for me it
would be I would want to hear Taylor
Swift collaborate with the sounds of her
digestion after she eats a sandwich I
want to hear I want to use the fungus
okay but I want it to play black key
songs using only the white keys oh I
like it I like it it's really upbeat
black keys a little a minor stuff in
sharp enough now it's gonna change yeah
don't get your foot tapping okay guys so
that is your hashtag add a hashtag of TD
duets what what other weird at musical
pairing would you want here so like a
like a musician or person and then
something maybe a nature or maybe you I
don't know you want to hear it let's
cover with a band name yeah I get click
bit clever with it whatever you guys
want to do um okay this very last story
is super creepy and I but i'm also
really intrigued and i feel like i would
try it even though i don't even like
mushrooms okay so making 3d printed
snacks like we've like we saw at CES is
kind of hard because when you 3d print
it's a paste so really there are only a
few options you can have you can make
like chocolates ice creams i bleep wrote
like or something that's like liquefied
protein
something like that something that was
liquefied and then hardened and then and
can be reharden okay so um this is very
interesting this called edible growth it
is by a woman in Chloe ruts are filled
and she found a way to 3d print this
sort of shell that is made out of insect
flower so it's it almost looks like
pastry dough and and so she says you can
use a nun another type of doughy
material if eating insects Laura kind of
freaks you out but we've already had
insect flower on this show we and it's
gross EA cricket cookies and I thought
they were all rights I know they're ok I
didn't taste like at all but it was all
its own it's I think it's into his head
it is it's it's placebo so the shell is
printed by specifically designed 3d
printer here's what they look like they
kind of look like a little almost like
honey combs yeah um and so this is the
crazy part so they print out this little
shell and then inside they put this
edible center that's made of a gar and
it has seeds mushroom spores and yeast
and you give it five days and it grows
its own filling and then you eat it so
you're just eating a bunch of spores and
fungus son you're eating mushrooms and
you're eating well you know and then
there's like you could grow like little
herbs out of there and stuff so maybe
you eat like a little bit of sage or
something that is growing out of there
too are you eating any 3d printed
material well the the the actual shell
of it is 3d print oh the shells edible
yeah oh yeah totally so it's a it's like
it's made of insect flowers so they 3d
print out that little like 3d shell that
little round spherical shell and then
they put the AG are the idol blog are in
there and it has like spores and
different things the seeds and
everything and then you let it grow for
five days and then you eat your snack oh
well and she was saying like you could
give it time to depending on how intense
you want the flavor to be like that's
how long you wait to harvest it so if
you wanted really been tense bold
flavored you wait the full five days but
if not you do it like two or three days
in how many of these are they able to
grow at once I'm thinking mass
production right now well mass
production uh see the thing is is I
would imagine it would probably be
pretty slow to print out the little
shells so I think that's sort of the
barrier but she was also saying that
like uh it'll be a while before we see
this kind of thing come to masses
obviously because there's so many
different kind of problems that you have
to solve before obviously
like would it be so weird you go grocery
shopping you just like click on a bunch
of things and then they send you 3d
printed like directions or prints
waiting for you yeah and then you just
print it out at your house with like
some food printer so it's so weird like
to think of that as like a thing that
could happen at some point in our life
time it seems like more of a hassle
though to have to buy the individual
types of materials to print with right
but the AG are sound like I would
imagine you could buy the AG are in bulk
like you could buy these little edibles
kind of pods to put in the 3d printed
them like a cure egg or something yeah
yeah you just buy the little pod and
then it grows your little mushrooms
maybe your snack but really weird and
it'll be in a bunch of European
exhibitions this year it's gonna go
travel around you can see it people can
taste it I think so like they have it at
exhibitions like it might you might be
able to taste it but they might just say
like okay well we'll do one is like a
demo and then do we know what this even
tastes good though I mean I guess she's
super her thing is basically 3d printed
stuff tends to seem very unhealthy
tastes like plastic and tastes like
plastic e or taste chalky that's another
like thing people have said I know when
I tasted 3d printed chocolate at CES it
was kind of cha I was chalky yeah I'm
not in a chocolatey way it was chalky
like a chalk way but she was saying she
was she wants some healthy alternative
so that was what she came up what's
pretty cool all right guys we are going
to take a very quick break we're going
to come back with a round of backcolor
Hackett and then we're going to get into
your your TD hotel user feedback and of
course our phone tiger for the day so
don't click away it's tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show I can't believe
somebody actually figured out how to rig
an old I want to call it an old-timey
printer it's terrible an old-timey
printer to play the Jurassic Park theme
song yeah hopefully just doesn't run I
think pretty quickly though oh yeah I
know it's gonna be really bad place you
got to replace the toner yeah the
musical toner yeah musical tone or uh
that was a terrible joke which means
it's time for another segment so this is
back at her racquet every week we like
to take a look at some weird
crowdfunding thing and tell you guys
whether we personally would back at her
Hackett we have no skin in this game I
think I have some power this week
normally I don't get any decisions on
the show the power this is the power
kale wields every week the thumbs up or
thumbs that's kind of like being a
Caesar an old Roman time you can just
like decide the fate of a project with
just one thumbs up or thumbs down
although that the stakes were a little
higher than Siskel and Ebert decide the
fate of a movie with a thumbs up or
thumbs down okay stakes were a lot
higher I'll give you that um nobody is
going to be eaten by a tiger today so
this is ringo and i don't mean the
drummer for The Beatles this is well
it's kind of a it is a kind of a bug
though so Ringo is an Arduino powered
robot that actually has some personality
which is kind of fun we have some really
cool video from their Kickstarter which
shows sort of what it is so this guy his
daughter helped him design this she's
really into programming apparently she's
under the age of five or his five and
knows some programming which is crazy
like she's nature she likes coding and
this kind of got her into that so Ringo
again arduino powered has an
accelerometer gyroscope leds music
chirper ambient ir light sensors it's
got transmitters a bunch of other
sensors on there it's good I mean it's
got all kinds of stuff this is like a
pretty jammed packed little little robot
here it can follow light which is really
cool so he's saying like you could use
this as like a digital pet sort of get
people into coding sure no matter what
age and it won't pee on your desk it
will not be on your desk or anywhere
else in your house for that matter which
is pretty awesome and it's he basically
the goal is to get people into
programming so whether you are
a kid or an adult who is thinking hey I
want to learn some coding this might be
a really good way to get into that or if
you have you know somebody who maybe has
some interest doesn't know where to get
started again this would be a really
good place to do it and then he also
said that this can scale up to some
really advanced programming if you're so
inclined so even advanced programmers
could use it I'm trying to figure out
what you would program it to do
currently well obviously programmer to
fetch the newspaper and your slippers
and your corn cob pipe very tiny
newspaper very tiny newspaper a little
tiny newspaper made for bugs this is a
bug newspaper of course I'm the bug
daily the daily bug there's got to be a
lot of tragic events that happen in the
lives of bugs for daily newspaper so
much murder so much tragedy that's true
I don't want to read a bug news favor
maybe the book I think our news is
depressing it's even worse even worse
than the box like giant terrorists
attacks essentially happening to all
their communities every second every day
and this is a person's foot like it's
just terrifying I they can talk to other
Ringo's like you can help you can have
them swarm if you want so if you wanted
to create your own bug army I mean you
could do that a robot bug army um so
here's okay so here's my question this
is what this is really where the crux of
it is so it's a little pricey
eighty-nine dollars for a Ringo robot
and 129 if you want to be in the first
round of shipments so you do have to
have a basic understanding though
because I don't have any understanding
of programming whatsoever I would not
know where to begin with something like
this so part of their Kickstarter is
their website when the product ships
their website is going to unroll a whole
bunch of video tutorials and classes on
how to get started okay so that's part
of it so you're you're it's like little
classes to that almost seems like it
makes the price point worth it because
they're you pay hundreds of dollars at a
college to go learn that stop trail but
with this you get a little robot you get
the basic like video construction then
of course you'll have access to the open
source community who if you want to take
it a step further after you get past
those like basic instructions you'd be
able to have all those resources I in
addition to the Internet in general
that's just a giant resource dinosaur
seahorse I say if this seems like a
really awesome thing and you you know
for a fact you really want to get into
programming like I say back it but if
not I say hmm yeah you have plans on it
as very
I'm going further than this it would be
a good investment but if you're not sure
what do you think yeah I don't know I
can that power Logan I personally I
don't want to get into programming I'm
not I've never had the mind for it I
could see this ending up in my kitchen
drawer with all with all the double-a
batteries that are half charged I see I
see um so for me I'm gonna say no but I
also but I do like that it is uh I'm
gonna say it Hackett oh how can hang it
back that one but i do like these kinds
of educational toys that are getting
children or anybody more interested in
what could potentially be the industry
of the future yeah yeah totally I like
that too so I say like for the for the
good of science and for the forwarding
of Robotics education I say back it but
I also say that if you have a kid and
you're thinking about buying this for
them and they have a really short
attention span maybe just wait until
they really show you their into robotics
that's what I think yeah i'm gonna say
hackett because i think you can learn a
lot of stuff for free on the internet as
is fair enough but you don't get a
prebuilt little bug robot that's right
it is safer than like tinkering with
something that has a big power supply
like Stottlemeyer laughing yeah see you
this it does seem like a safer
alternative it's kind of a prebuilt
ready to program ready to code sort of
things so it's kind of cool alright so
now we're done with that I promised you
guys last week and I'm we're so sorry we
missed out to talk about your user
feedback for TD hotel so let's hit use
your feedback
okay so TD hotel what was your answer
what's that what's the themed hotel that
you want to stand because we talked with
the Godzilla hotel and a lot of people
thought that was really cool uh-huh but
a lot of people you guys had way better
ideas than the Godzilla hotel I just
want to say cuz they came up with
amenities like activities to do in the
hotel it's like crazy I want to stay in
a Power Rangers command center themed
room where I want a LED Zordon on the
wall and like that in he can respond to
you and talk to you much like Siri I
like it's pretty good okay so Josh wrote
to us first and said Nostromo alien
hotel air-duct crawling sounds
flamethrower marshmallow roasting an air
vent play area for the chip for the kids
which that is great and then Fritz wrote
in and said Gundam theme hotel says
there's a Gundam cafe already with
anti-gravity hallway and room also do
you get to walk around between the
hallways in a Gundam I think so i think
that would be the point it's like the
hotel is a Gundam what if like to get
into your room it's like getting into a
Gundam like it is a big door opens up
and you have to like essentially get
into a seat to be able to flip around
and get into the room that would be
amazing I would love that um and then
Neil wrote in and said hotel themed on
cube movie the room shift every hour
hashtag where the toilet go that's a
scary thought that is really terrible
human groom I actually thought after I
read his tweet I was like man why didn't
I say last week a portal themed hotels
where you have the speed the speed goo
and you like run really fast and like
the bounce goo I would be great i
thought the technology included then
yeah that was testing the end of the
testing but no and the turrets don't
actually kill you they like they like
put like rays of happiness on you
massage you or whatever okay then Leo
wrote in and said I would die a thousand
times to sleep in an adventure time
themed hotel featuring the ice kingdom
and bubblegum bubblegum kingdom and you
know Leo I bet you are jumping for joy
this morning when you found out there's
gonna be an adventure time movie yeah
and kale too that's exciting new I I
haven't seen an episode of adventure
time but I have to get into it kill I'm
sure actually might be able to fly here
with his own arms out of his excitement
because he probably was like this like
freaking out when
there was gonna be an adventure time
movie Kylie wrote in and said my TD
hotel would obviously be Princess
Toadstool Peach's castle who wouldn't
stay there that would be awesome i
remember when i was playing mario kart
on the n64 the track where the peaches
yes I would ice would just free roam
around that place just because you could
roam around is really nice hustle I'm
jealous yeah like she's like the coolest
royal ever and then lastly jolly emailed
us and wrote and said I think I'd like
Hotel where every rumor floor was themed
on a different movie property and then
they would move you between them every
day you could go out for the day and
come back to get surprised with what
film you were in for the night yeah I
really like this this is a really good
idea yeah i think that like you go in
you have one room and the next thing
come home at the end of the day come
back to the hotel and it's like oh
here's your other room we moved all your
stuff now it's Indiana Jones now it's
Indiana Josie your watch indiana jones
oh that would be great and then you
wouldn't have to decide on a theme that
way because it'd be several things in
one you know how you could do that jolly
I've listen I'm with you projection
technology oh yeah like the entire room
project total room projection and it
changes the theme of your room every
time you go into it like when you hit
the key oh it changes the theme a room
that's great done you're welcome hotels
I just made you a billion dollars all
right guys it's time for our very last
piece of user feedback which is always
our photog refer the day
so our photogra for the day to day is
Robert he writes in and he says hi guys
love the show great chemistry and lots
of fun I've never submitted anything but
Ashley's pursuit of her favorite picture
got me hoping I could become her
favorite well let's see let's see if he
lives up to we'll see anyway here it is
shot with a galaxy note 4 it was taken
from the charleston SC aquarium it is
the Arthur Ravenel jr. bridge hope you
featured in The Show keep up the great
work respectfully a good human I love
ocean pictures that's a pretty great
shot I live near the ocean and so it's
always nice when a photographer or
photographer is able to capture
something that I don't see every day
yeah I don't live near the ocean I mean
quite close ish why many other people I
look near the ocean in the sense that i
could drive there in less than an hour
right yeah I I'm with you on that um so
I really like that picture every weight
room can we see the pictures some more
we're going to talk about it we're going
to discuss this picture for a little bit
ok so we got this beautiful sailboat and
we have a nice bridge so low cloud and
this guy this is it he took this from an
aquarium so this is all very water based
oh yes all very water-based took it from
an aquarium I'm look like on the deck of
the aquarium then or something somewhere
else yeah somewhere outside a minute
that doubt in the background is the
Arthur Ravenel jr. bridge what if this
was just the mural at the aquarium what
if he yeah that's it that'd be amazing
which is like I took this picture of
this painting on a wall and it looks so
real that i sent it in uh no i really
dig this i listen it's pretty good
robert it's pretty good but i don't know
is it is it my favorite I mean it's so
close like I mean you know maybe if
there's a dolphin jumping out of the
water that's what would have made a
difference I think I start doing i'm
gonna start telling everybody what would
have made that picture my favorite if
it's not what's missing I'll tell you
and if you want your phone tog raphy to
be featured on the show you can send it
over to us to be considered to tomorrow
at cnet com you can also send us story
ideas you can send us tips and tricks
game genie codes whatever floats your
