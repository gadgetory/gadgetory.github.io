a 44 show on CNN TV i'm jeff beck Allah
and I am Justin you and this is the show
where Jeff takes a nice nap I snap
permanently man you ate it yesterday
okay though you know it's funny I don't
know what's worse my hip or my allergies
cuz I'm struggling man yeah it's my
voice you hear that you better cancel
that dance class I can't see I can't
screw I can't talk what I do every day
you're all flamed up your sinuses are
bad I'm not stuffed up yeah I could roll
are we all are we asked in the pre-show
how come when you're sick only work one
side of your nostril one nostril gets
clear and then the other then they
switch back and forth that might be
because you're tossing and turning in
beds or whatever side you're on that's
the one thing so yeah I don't know I
feel like yeah I don't i agree with
Richard it happens when your stands it
happens it happens to me when I'm
standing up time like sometimes when I'm
walking down the street all of a sudden
I'll just feel it go like yeah to the
other side of my face yeah it's crazy
anyone what have your legs is longer
than the other you're leaning toward
this and it's just like a gravity thing
could be if there's a doctor in the
house call us up let us know why the
hell that happened we only cover the
most pressing questions on the form it's
a little abstract piece of trivia like a
philosoraptor exactly but nevertheless I
would feel better knowing the answer
yeah and that's what we do here on the
show we get down to the nitty gritty and
we find out all the answers tell people
where the show title came from I fell
down pretty hard yesterday my hockey
game and I I'm walking funny huh I'm
nice that sounds nice you know that's
not nice adjustment is like that came
laughs at that oh sorry it's okay but
the worst part about is that it was
nothing but my fault you didn't get like
shoulder checked you know that that just
fell I tripped over nothing that's why
you don't lost an edge humans don't
belong on tiny little pieces of steel
rolling around on what these knives that
are touching yeah exactly after who
invented the eye hole I thought I don't
know but it's not I don't want to talk
more about that I want to talk about I
show us your bruise now it's not bruised
not know it's just like it's like the
hip bone do you know what I mean it's
under its its its there's a and I'm
surprised because I have a fat ass
please isolate that sound and I would
give anything for that sound but so
would I and I got one of them and I have
booty all those inches and inches of
blubber that protect my my hip from you
know myself we gotta stop talking about
this I'm getting very excited you're
getting hungry it's what you gettin
tables moving so anyway quick
programming note I know Wayne Brady's
definitely gonna be in our program we've
been switching back and forth the days
and I just want to clear the air it does
sound like officially he's gonna switch
back he's gonna be on Friday because
he's getting in a little earlier now and
we'll be able to have them on at a
proper time on friday cool I think so as
of this recording that's when he's going
to be on this friday April twentieth ok
ok sounds good say so I want you to know
I want you to know and I want you to
know alright and that's all that matters
me you ok just you let's jump into
things shall we mr. you I wanted to talk
about this yesterday but we didn't get
to cover it and now a little older but
doesn't matter it's fun talk about it
anyway Tupac at Coachella Jeff you've
heard about this right so at the big
music festival Coachella this year there
was a groundbreaking performance Tupac
was resurrected from the dead yeah of
course he died got shot in 1996 I
believe he's been dead for that long
he's been dead for a while it's a watch
17-year no 16 years that's crazy yeah
yeah but it was this is really cool and
I wish we could show a video of this but
pictures will have to do because he kind
of cusses a lot but it's awesome because
uh it looks so realistic and this has
got to be the future of musical
performances for us I mean okay so
everyone thought initially that it was a
hologram it's not a hologram it's a
holographic image and it's important to
note that because it's not you know like
this is basically the same technology
that will i am from black eyed peas used
to
display those election results right
it's kind of cool though I guess this
company AV Concepts is behind it and
there's actually a separate room on the
side of the stage where they have the
image projected and then there's a big
sheet of Mylar next to snoop dogg here
which reflects that image onto the stage
so that's what makes it look so 3d and
realistic and it's actually three
stacked 1920 x 1080 images and that's
what gives it that 3d effect so I'm
still confused as to how they display
this ok so it's a technique that's like
five centuries old did a little research
five centuries live centuries all those
it was actually invented in the 16th
century missions have been using it for
a while it's called Pepper's Ghost
that's the technique okay right so so
there's a stage right that everyone can
see there's actually a hidden stage on
the right hand side okay where the
original image graphic is projected onto
okay right and then they have a really
thin sheet of Mylar where you see Tupac
standing here on the main stage gotcha
that reflects the projected image on the
side stage okay and that images such
high quality that it's actually 2d but
the pixels are so fine that him you know
the audience kind of get it looks really
good yeah do you think people were were
freaking out people were free yeah I
mean if you watch the video the coolest
part about is that he comes out
introduces himself and says what's up
Coachella how does he do that it's weird
I have any points that people have a
healthy wait a minute yeah so where did
they so what I okay where did they grab
this footage where do they grab this
original footage is it cg b is cg okay
yeah so AV Concepts worked with dr. Dre
to bring this image and they what they
do is splice together Tupac sold
performances right into a montage of it
you know that basically creates this new
video right of him that's crap he said
Coachella in conversation before and
some other words some point in his life
he said Coachella yeah on and it was
recorded but yet so cool i mean that's
funny to see snoop dogg unsure of where
to look because yeah he kind of goes
over to him you
like put his hand through rock space
it's kind of funny to watch him sort of
maneuver around him hehe it looks like
he keeps a safe distance the whole time
yeah I don't want to mess with the
effect there you know it would have been
funny if to buckeye gotten on stage have
been like what the hell happened to my
shirt here I died at 96 with his shirt
might be that Chappelle show it yeah
yeah oh man that's that's just crazy so
two people freaking out the same people
who thought who didn't realize i thought
that tupac was still alive yeah i mean
this looks so good though it looks
really looks really awesome you guys
should go watch the video and it just
kind of got me thinking is this what is
going to be acceptable no I performances
now I mean for David on ya not to
substitute there's still a lot I mean if
Biggie and Tupac want to have a concert
and go on the road with their but
they're like projections I think it'd be
I think you're a little weird to pay
money to see the projection of a dead
person right ah watch that beef you know
but hey it's it's uh in in this context
using it as a cameo and as a purely a
special effects or a spectacle sure I
don't know what am I going to get mad
and got so much media attention that the
company behind it dr. dre said that they
might take it on the road so they could
do a traveling thing I would maybe not
go watch Tupac but I would definitely be
up for watching past acts who would you
want to see Queen Queen was very
freaking mercury that's who I want to
see definitely nuff said I mean I don't
there's no one else maybe they then they
could do like a Nirvana thing I was
gonna say i wanna see Kurt Cobain into
nirvana why not Michael Jackson I want
to see that completed this is it tour
I'm serious I just I just I don't know
if you go and you see Freddie Mercury
yeah you did not see Queen okay you saw
queen with an asterisk at the at the end
of it and at the bottom it says
projection of a dead guy right is what
you saw unfortunately it said but I mean
hey if if you can feel some sort of like
you know if you can just knock another
thing off your bucket list right like I
got the sorta sequin blonde yeah
go for it you know what screw it though
I want to have a whole bill and ted
reenactment I want like Amadeus I'm
sorry Don there you want to see Rufus
off at the up there to grab friggin
Beethoven all those guys i wanna see
sokrates so jam performance that would
be cool how amazing with that then I
want Ben Franklin in the background
compose your Genghis Khan gag his
out there Joan of Arc on the ones and
twos and then the finale Abraham lling
handling is just gonna get like a little
monologue talk to you about emancipation
for an encore yeah definitely that's
crazy but it's funny though man is funny
but I could imagine a future you know
maybe in like a decade or so when this
technology comes into the home or in
mobile handsets you could have live
performances in your living room wasn't
this the plot to that movie Simone with
Al Pacino yeah I remember that what like
Al Pacino was somehow I didn't see it I
just remember what exactly the film was
about Al Pacino was involved in some
sort of conspiracy where they created
this celebrity that wasn't real he acted
in movies and issues just cg huh and he
took her around and she to the point
where they were able to do like in
person stuff right yeah they did
interviews and stuff I think like she
was in movies but her co-worker her
co-stars and stuff didn't even realize
yes wait a minute cuz she did like all
her scenes like separate because she was
fake okay but but and did ever realize I
don't know it's been a long time since I
seen the movie but I remember and Simone
and like the one is a the eyes of one
and the cereals and hoe and stuff like
that yeah that's some own same
technology Al Pacino read the script is
like okay I'm on boy it sounds like
let's do this is in my candy this is it
right here hello Oscar yeah it's pretty
good it's really cool though I'm into it
yeah I'm fully supporting this idea yeah
I mean it's tough to get mad at it like
I said I just don't like people acting
like that's how I saw sublime yeah I
mean that's how I saw Nirvana know you
just you saw a special effect
and how do I feel so okay they get queen
right they're like all right the whole
band if you know everyone's still around
and then okay guys we're just going to
project Freddie Mercury as your as your
frontman right so what do you do if your
do you like if I'm the drummer of Queen
and I'm just playing I'm like all right
they're just gonna have a holographic
framer here singing while play it's sort
of weird yet it is weird it's a little
strange actually rapping lets you know
what you just I guess no maybe behind
you it's so weird for stupid or two to
just you know I heard they were going
back and forth right he like tried to
pass him a joint and dropped onto the
ground burn part of the stage is weird
oh that's pretty terrible and funny at
the same time IKEA is making headlines
they're announcing furniture with
integrated TV speakers in blu-ray and
they're not using those fakes plastic
stand-ins that they have at their stores
is actually real tvs i love those things
by the way oh like all the fake the
power electronic is like flicking it
falls over the guys open house pretty
good what kind of furniture are we
talking about here so this fall IKEA is
going to be releasing their own home
entertainment system it's basically
integrating a flat panel television an
HDTV with a built-in blu-ray player and
then a wireless subwoofer the one
calling it the up never be what up lever
up lleva a know it's some Swedish thing
the only catch you gotta build the TV
yourself that's good I was that like a
Krusty the Clown yeah this will be crazy
the first thing you never have to build
by yourself right right and I'll just
give you that weird allen wrench yeah
they're like tiny little thing like here
you go build this you know semi-truck
cut up your hand with this thing price
is going to start around nine hundred
fifty dollars presumably for the 24 inch
version and then they're going to have a
larger one as well they're also in
addition to a full screen HDTV I'm sorry
flat screen HD HD TV they're going to
have a 2.1 surround sound let's not
release around but a 2.1 sound system
installed as well
I don't know really good for like the
college person yeah again you know this
it's weird because uh last night I was
catching up on my episodes of 30 rock
and it was the one where they talk about
vertical integration and Jack wants to
start making couches right because the
you know they want to pretty much
capitalize on the entire home theater
experience right is I cannot try to do
the exact same but seriously when I read
this I thought it was a joke they're
like yeah you know ikea takes a page
from 30 rug and then couchy comes out
yeah yeah yeah but this is it like you
know soon you'll be able to go to ikea
just buy everything you need your living
you'll just be by your apartment yeah
this little pod you know that you put in
the back of your SUV right and you bring
it home and there's a little spot for
the plumbing little spot for the
electricity and you're done you have a
house would you get I got my house that
idea it's cool deliver the whole thing
in one day if you put it together with
this little average that's it man but
you can't ever take it apart just follow
you know just disintegrate I key is a
crazy place was last time you were there
um the one in New York I don't know if a
lot of people know this but you can
actually take a ferry there oh cool what
I mean why cool they might have liked
your dresser on your back you can ferry
others then yeah it's actually an old
Chinese junk ship I kept like you scary
man you go in there especially on the
weekend you got to follow those arrows
yeah you know there's like a very you
know meticulously designed path that
interweaves in and out of each section
very affordable solutions for home
modern home living yeah if you if you
somehow deviate off the pad you're
pretty much screwed yeah because you're
hiring experienced yeah is compromised
and you can see other people that are
equally confused when they did you know
as soon as I do very it's like a lost
and found receptacle for people just
wandering around like they're blind
bumping into you all wherever god forbid
you try to walk the opposite way on the
track yeah men and yellow and blue
superman with their fingers dragging no
no turn around sir I've got to follow
the path I always go straight to the
damaged return furniture for you there
are some good deals to be had there on
three
it's tools are they the fourth ones just
put together with duct tape my favorite
I mean that store is so DIY it's like
why does anyone even work there yeah
anyone besides the people who need to
keep the shelves stocked you go and
right at the end right before that meant
you hit that massive checkout line
there's that warehouse section yeah your
tricks up your own yeah that's like what
am I did yeah no wonder this couch was
forty nine dollars you know I have to
build it and load it into my car myself
yeah the best of those little dollies
you have riding them is so much fun give
it later yet the way is perfectly
proposed perfect and there's their
greased perfectly they have a lot of uh
you know attraction it's a lot of fun
riding those things very you guys ever
eat at the cafeteria hell yeah good
meatballs English meatball dish yeah I
mean those can you fit in your mouth at
once six yeah been there done that yeah
yeah we've all have come on now we've
all been there oh my god we'll take a
break more 404 right after this please
stick around this is the 404 mr f'ers
the show where we all sing songs
you
this is greg for new orleans and you're
listening to the 404 well one day
holographic tupac shakur's before the
concert the next he's given election
results for see it in yeah that was
among the more awkward moments on
television yes you have a very out of
place an awkward wolf blitzer seemingly
talking to nobody he's just like Oh will
I am will I on the said right pretty
ridiculous was ridiculous yeah but that
but at least that wasn't that like that
was more like the Star Wars projection
message then no I was saying even when
we were talking about that Tupac segment
it's the same company right yeah so they
you know they did pretty much the same
but wasn't will.i.am weren't they
capturing will.i.am yeah I think so yeah
there was any like a different room
right there's a live bro he was in the
room next door they're just sending him
ten feet yes look for two back two
boxers were coming to an idea pretty
soon please birch veneer there you go
man oh man they just at the naming is
the best what there was a pro like you
there's a product there's an old photo
of me holding a box it says 40 g it's
just I swear they have something let's
go that far T and then G the way the
letter G it's probably farting you know
look it up look it up but it's it's
spelled out in English for TG I'm not
joking it was something handheld I'm not
joking you're gonna find it man or even
spell buddy oh hey you it's a triple
ceiling hold on you're good you found it
man you're gonna find it it's it's a
real product triple ceiling spotlight
called the farty g it is where is it do
you have a thing there it is far TGI DJ
why is that weird there it is the
bruising the pleasure you dummy and
there's a photo I took someone took me
in college cuz kanji always go to hear
there's a box hold the boxing is this
for DG on
like hey oh my god that's awesome hey
it's lasted all these years it's all
that spotlight I got it from Mikey it's
the farty Jesus party but I guess it's
the farting farting was that what you
would call out of tea I think that's a
hockey player to Daniel fart digs yeah
it's pretty awesome I want to hear good
I want to hear good ikea stories there's
nothing like I mean it could be the best
or worst day of your life there it
really could depending on what kind of
mood you're in really all go south real
quick I hate it uh let's let's get into
some more ridiculousness of the day
there's a fragrance modeled around Apple
and it's coming to a nose near you
speaking of farts oh just spray it right
in the face when you walk up to it let's
hear about it on this is pretty
ridiculous but it's actually part of an
upcoming art exhibition in melbourne
australia beacons over there have
created a new scent based on the smell
that emits from when you open a new
Apple box okay so this is actually uh
we've heard about this stuff before when
we watch the morgan spurlock documentary
yeah a couple guys crowded around a
comic book like a vintage comic book and
they were like the smell of it it's
delicious yeah and so they're basically
trying to recreate the smell of plastic
and this will actually encompass that
smell the plastic wrap along with the
cardboard box and the plastic components
within the box as well as the aluminum
that Apple uses to make their products
and basically I don't just sounds to me
like it'll they're trying to recreate
the smell of a Chinese factory is this
really like uh this isn't Foxconn yeah
UD Foxconn you doing Scott spray cologne
um I you know think about it we will you
no sense in in memory those are all
tangled together right like you know
when you think about the kind of sense
that are available for even like cars
like new car scent right you know I mean
what's the difference it's the same sort
of thing no because the new car smell
that's all about like leather
yeah but I mean there is something I'm
not gonna lie it's okay to enjoy that
smell i think right it's not okay to
enjoy certain smells that are toxic yeah
like oh let me say gasoline glue or glue
or magic markers something like that or
spray paint or huffing anything terrible
like that but I don't know when I you
know when I used to buy books there is a
certain you know you you can't help but
smell it yeah like if you don't go like
right up to it you don't mean you still
get a whiff of it when you when you go
like you know oh oh it smells good I
don't know what it is it's just that
dress that's what I always said about
barnes and noble the only thing they had
going for them was that unique smell
that your own you walk in the door the
smell of leather bound books and freshly
printed you know 30 pound you know stock
yeah I remember I would always smell new
shoes when they came out of the box yeah
there you go paper and so special about
that there you go Richard you can
identify yeah I love the smell of new
shoes I've come all so love new tennis
balls yes you are smiling way too much
but I think he's right yeah tell me how
many times have you opened up maybe when
you're younger opened up a brand new
breaking canister three ball pens it's
like hahaha it's weird canned balls and
balls let's let's go or I want to hear
from our audience there are lots of
great unintentionally fantastic smells
right in the world I'm sorry you open up
a new piece of electronics something
comes off of it and it goes into your
nostrils and you smile you know what I
really always like to as I always got
dragged into the sanrio store in the
mall what is that with my sister come I
do not make me emasculate myself by
explaining what sanrio I will never
avoid a situation where is the company
that makes hello kitty products okay so
in the mall it's always like the pink
brightly colored store sure and inside
they would have it I think I hope our
listeners can know what I'm talking
about but it's kind of like a jelly sort
of smell it's like the smell of plastic
wrapped around
and jelly and it's weird okay one yeah I
really like that store everything has
you know now that I think about it
everything wrapped in plastic once it's
exposed to air for the first time even
like I'm going back to like CDs yeah you
know there's something in there I don't
know what it is maybe that's what's
killing us maybe that's why the average
age is declining yeah but man oh man
what else smells really good I'm trying
to think you got a bunch of colognes and
perfumes up on your screen yeah excited
well there's this company called Demeter
that I remember came out like maybe a
couple years ago they have like a lot of
unique sense like if you want smell like
brownies or cannabis flour you can buy
that you ever smell someone walking by
and they're wearing some cologne or
perfume that smells so good that you
that the pheromone start to kick in like
any sort of thing where you're just like
man I want to just you know talk to this
person be like what are you what is what
is that oh well get some of that you
know anything like other dudes yeah wait
really or the dudes or you know just
like someone smells their cologne or
perfume is so good yeah just you
instantly identify walking around New
York it was 86 degrees yesterday I kind
of got the opposite the who you are
gross you are right sir yeah no I
understand that unbelievable let's talk
about your favorite electronic smells
hmm but for now we'll get to our calls
from the public time to show the love 86
for scenic okay calls from the public
time spoilers were a big topic
conversation yesterday talked with Katie
linendoll about what it's like to have
something really really sacred to you
important to you and have that ruined by
strangers terrible here's another way to
avoid spoilers and our buddy has a
little topic to talk about what the
Hunger Games don't worry he does not
spoil anything hey Jay there in from
champagne I was callin regards to the
spoiler alerts when it comes to movies
and books and stuff like that I feel
like I kind of spoiled the hunger games
for myself i was at walmart and ready to
buy all three popes had just seen the
first movie and i wanted to read the
books i made the mistake of reading
it'll slip like comes inside of the
cover of the second one what kind of
knew what was going to happen in the
second one before i was even like a
hundred and fifty pages into the first
one so then the whole time has it'll
just feeling of having the second books
let me know what's going on because it
kind of gives you an idea what's gonna
happen but then just kind of just
feeling the whole family the other books
that's the worst part yeah especially
when you try and you know something's
been spoiled and then you have to like
crawl limp back into the thing and be
like okay I know what's going to happen
maybe I can act surprised right and you
know and you you get denied that feeling
of innocence you know what I mean it's
it's so good bother anymore yeah really
if somebody ruined Game of Thrones for
me episode 9 I'd be the worst thing ever
killed that person I would kitna in them
and myself that's why you don't read the
book first dude serious watch the movie
then read the book no well I disagree
with that are you about spoiling things
for yourself like have year do you know
these people that like read the end of
the book first and then backtracked the
beginning terrible no you know what are
you doing you know people that do that I
personally do not really heard of people
having a lot of people what are you
through are these people they're just
very impatient people i really like oh
god this brand new book let me flip to
the back
up the Joker kills him yeah well now I
know that I shouldn't invest any time
and caring right about this character
what are you crazy are you five years
old how old are you have some freaking
patients will you please a woman in tech
was a topic we talked about with Katie
yesterday and here are some encouraging
words from a teacher hey guys press
search up to elkhart i was listening to
store your show with katie and your talk
about women in tech as a electronics
professor dealing in high pick
situations and classes I only have three
girls in our fields of study at the
school that I teach at I tell you what
though it's three girls it went the
floor with all the boys all the time
basically all three of them are quick to
be vocal about it I've seen in the last
couple years a kind of resurgence of
what it ain't interested in Texas which
is really cool I just like to see dinner
a lot stronger foothold thanks so yeah
it's it's um it's interesting to hear he
said that he has three girls in his
class but these girls kill it yeah and
they make the boys look terrible that's
awesome I like hearing that I love
hearing that sort of stuff um yeah I
mean you know it was a it was a tough
it's a tough thing to sort of discuss
especially when you and I are both last
time I checked men so it's tough to
really you know sort of put yourself in
those shoes yeah um and and sort of you
know understand here's another call I'm
not sure we understand a hundred percent
agree but let's hear what he has to say
anything also comments on a few other
topics that we ran into yesterday hey
guys this is salt lake from Lance I'm
just calling yep i finished listening to
the show today at the podcast with Katie
linendoll lonegan I just had a couple
things I wanted to comment about number
one you guys got to find a way to pay
her to be on the show because he/she
could totally be Wilson's replacement
okay number two you understand what's
justins comment about five iron frenzy
let's go band of all time and don't even
though there I don't
three as far as women in tech I guess
just mind my own experience whatever I
talk to providing neo kind of a tech
nerd when I talk to women it just
doesn't seem to be something they're
interested in let me just don't want to
bother with it or learn about it you
know like I try and help them out with
their like cell phones or iPads or
whatever there's like I don't know
anything about it they just have other
fish to fry or something I don't know so
anyway for the call give my two cents
you guys are awesome and thanks um I
don't know if that specific that's a
very vast general is yeah i think the I
I do find you know we get a lot I'm sure
you get a lot of people ask hitting you
up for advice and stuff like that I
don't think one sex demands it more than
the other right I think it's an equal
sort of an equal opportunity annoyance
if these people already have iPads and
iPhones in there she's invested enough
to buy it ya know I but I'm saying like
in terms of people asking you for help
with stuff right I don't find that it's
more guys than girls know personally
nobody knows about your college no one
knows universally your you all have no
idea I mean if you're listening to our
show you probably have some sort of idea
yeah but most people it has wave bye-bye
to them a very long time ago but what
about web sites like Pinterest for
example that are vastly more popular
with women yeah for sure don't think
that let's be honest though that it is
sort of a phenomenon though I mean for
the most part they're the number one you
know they've just become up it is what
it is i don't know like i said i think
it's just a cultural dictation that is
uh you know finding its way through but
i think the original conversation was
more about women involved in technology
right female programmers not the women
that are interested exactly for sure so
yeah you know good to hear that story
about the guy with the teachers um so he
says oh five iron frenzy that's awesome
yeah a lot of respect for that and then
Katie replacing Wilson yeah alright man
if you got the money let us know yeah
Wilson never brought us gifts yes
seriously you know I would love for him
that would mean she'd have to give us
gifts every single day yeah I could deal
with that gonna be okay with that yeah
jerem saying they wanted Katie linendoll
sent that's not creepy at all well yes
we'll work on that I'm sure she might
have a problem with that though give us
