any car the midsize sedan segment but
it's pretty modern to think of it as
Clark Kent with a smartphone let's take
a look at the 2014 Chevy Malibu and
check the tech
a midsize sedan is more of a practical
purchase than an emotional one with this
kind of car the entire family chimes in
its got to meet a lot of needs now that
Chevy Malibu does pretty well in all
considerations it's a comfortable ride
gets good fuel economy and it's got a
lot of interior space the design is
pretty conservative this car really
blends in it's kind of the opposite of
ostentatious we see a lot of the
standard Chevy design cues like this
grille with the bar right across hosting
the bowtie and then back we've got those
big square taillights that they're using
these days underneath we've got them at
first in style suspension in front and
in back we've got a four link
independent suspension that's pretty
standard stuff for this type of car but
Chevy does a really good job of giving
this car a nice ride now let's take a
look under the hood to see what
motivates this thing under the hood here
we've got the base engine for this car
it's a 2.5 liter 4 cylinder from Chevy's
Ecotec line
it's got direct injection that sprays
fuel directly into the cylinders now
it's interesting about this is it's not
quite as loud there's a lot of direct
injection engines you don't hear that
clattering of injectors which you do on
a lot of these types of engines now this
engine makes 196 horsepower at 186
pound-feet of torque that's to the front
wheels in this transversely mounted
engine it's a decent amount for this
sized vehicle the best thing though is
it turns in EPA estimates of 25 miles
per gallon city 36 miles per gallon
highway
that's why Chevy's gotten to this direct
injection engine here it's a pretty
efficient now this isn't the only engine
you can get for the Malibu Chevy also
offers a 2 liter 4-cylinder with a
turbocharger alcee uses direct injection
that gets 259 horsepower 295 pound-feet
of torque that's a lot of power that's
actually more than a lot of v6 is
produced but you also take a pretty big
hit in fuel economy
that'll get 21 miles per gallon city 30
miles per gallon highway it's a little
lower you get mid-twenties fuel economy
get a lot more power
that's gonna be ninja that some people
are gonna want but this base engine will
do for better fuel economy all around
now let's take a look at the capita and
see what this car is really all about
at the top of the stack here I have a
7-inch color touch screen this comes
with a seven hundred ninety five dollar
navigation package and this interface
will look fairly familiar to smartphone
users because it's all icon base this is
Chevy's MyLink infotainment system and
all icons are the same size they look
pretty much similar we've got one for
navigation different audio sources phone
different offline information sources
here as well on the sides of the bezel
we have these capacitive touch areas
here so I can go straight to navigation
just by hitting that or I can go to
destination by hitting this side got my
phone button here and I can go back to
home that will bring me back to this
this icon view there's this source area
up here for the capacitive touch bezel
and I don't really like this as much
this doesn't bring up an audio screen
this merely kind of scrolls through
toggles through the different audio
sources so he doesn't bring you directly
the audio source you gotta keep on
hitting it and go through the different
ones now if I go to the navigation area
I get this nice pretty good looking map
it's showing me traffic of course on the
major freeways around the area here I'd
like to see a little more coverage for
the surface streets too a lot of
navigation systems are actually covering
more surface streets with navigation so
I'm not really seeing that I don't know
if that's because there's no traffic
problems around here right now or it
just doesn't cover that area now when I
go to enter a destination I hit this
area like I mentioned before and I get a
lot of options for destination I can do
address entry I can search points of
interest previous destinations all I
good stuff I can even go to actual GPS
coordinate entry now I've also got this
thing called travel guide this is a
pretty cool feature I like this a lot I
bring this up I can search through a lot
of local points of interest these aren't
businesses necessarily these are things
you might want to find if you're on a
road trip and you're just kind of
looking around for something interesting
to see of course we got our phone area
here and we've got the normal stuff with
the phone system integrated here I can
take a look at my phone book and see all
my different different contacts those
are visible on the screen here I could
also hit the voice command button and
bring those up but just say call Wayne
Cunningham or something like that
and it'll give me the options for the
numbers I have stored here and place
that call right away
voice command in this car also works
with navigation and it lets you say the
entire address in a single string which
is nice
but I haven't been very successful with
it I've tried to say the the alley run
right now Tehama Street and that's a
tough one for a lot of cars some get it
better than others this one never got it
once so hmm not so successful with that
the cooler thing though is so I've got
an iPod attached here I can also have a
USB Drive go to that and I can actually
hit voice command and say play an artist
to play a song or play an album so I'll
try it right now play artist frightened
rabbit and it finds all the songs I have
by that artist brings up I can see it's
plane right now so that's pretty cool
now this car also has Siri hands-free I
could use that for navigation too if I
didn't have a navigation system here or
any of this good stuff so that's the the
MyLink infotainment system here one
thing
Chevy announced at the Consumer
Electronics Show this last couple of
weeks is they're gonna add something
called app shop I don't know if this is
gonna just be on the 2015 Chevy Malibu
and not on this generation or they might
retro actively update it'll be nice to
see so down on the console here we've
got the shifter for the 6-speed
automatic transmission this is a pretty
standard transmission for this class of
car right now but one thing this has is
a manual mode which you don't always see
that often so I pull it all the way back
put it in the manual mode and I got this
rocker switch on top of the shifter that
actually lets me go through the gears I
need to use this in situations like if
you're going down long descent you want
to hold it in third or something like
that they use engine braking to get down
the hill or maybe some situations where
you're going up a slippery Hill it's
fairly steep and you want to keep it in
a single gear without having an up shift
and change your torque at your wheels so
now let's take this thing on the road I
wouldn't call the driving character of
the Malibu
really engaging but it is very very easy
and that's very appropriate for a
midsize sedan one thing this engine does
have to help it safe so that any tenant
auto stop feature so if you're stopping
the stoplight or something it will stop
the engine for you and sometimes those
features aren't done very well sometimes
they're they really are they're really
intrusive but in this car you barely
feel it at all one thing we have in this
car that is part of the entertainment
and electronics package are a lot of
driver alert features so this gives us a
rear-view camera when I put it in
reverse that blind spot monitors and
those will put little icons on either
side mirror if there's a car back in my
blind spot on either side that's a
really nice feature to have there's also
a Lane Departure alert so if I were to
drift across the lane line like if I was
drowsy or something like that it would
be that'd be most interesting feature
here is the
collision this is really just a warning
it won't die hit the brakes for you but
the a collision warning it uses this
camera looking forward as does the lane
departure system Sagan camera and that
if you're coming up on another car too
fast or you know slower traffic maybe if
you're distracted by something it will
actually flash a red light on the inside
of the windshield and it'll give you an
alert - and that'll kind of tell you
it's time to hit the brakes cuz you're
about to hit a car in front of you all
right let's price out our 2014 chevy
malibu this model in 2lt trim goes for
twenty five thousand two hundred fifteen
dollars adding navigation for seven
hundred ninety five dollars that gets
you the touchscreen and also we have the
electronics and entertainment package
that gives me that collision warning
blind spot monitor rearview camera and
the upgraded pioneer stereo system that
package cost one thousand seven and
fifty dollars and with a few other
options in here total price for this
model is thirty thousand one hundred
twenty-five dollars the chevy malibu
faces a lot of competition in the
midsize sedan segment
there's better-looking cars like the
Ford Fusion of the mazda6 but one thing
the Chevy Malibu has going for it is
that MyLink infotainment system it's
definitely one of the better
infotainment interfaces I've seen and
it's got a lot of good features we also
have OnStar which has a lot of good
telematics functions so that might sway
you in the purchase of this car</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
