augmented reality sandbox with real sand
in it a really really cool fiber that's
going to be used in some amazing ways
and Kentucky Fried Chicken has some
really weird tech for you yup YUM
tomorrow daily
kruti citizen to the internet welcome to
tomorrow daily bestie talk show in the
known universe I'm Ashley skele that's
Cal anonymous and you're you so welcome
to the show cool you gave them an intro
did your you you're part of the show now
congratulations I hope you're ready to
present your story we can't pay it I'm
really sorry so I mean well I mean
really can't really pay us know that
will they they pay us in french fries
and hugs but not actual money you get
hugs i only get the french fries well
producer Logan gives out hugs so you
gotta hit him up Oh Logan is that true
yeah you collected a while oh cool yeah
hold back love oh my god I know what I'm
doing this weekend maybe you'll get ok
look I'll raise all right guys heads
down headlines
super awkward huh but no all right all
right we got some good ones if we do
let's talk about a super fiber and is
not the kind you eat I know you're very
health minded kale this is a little bit
different but actually really exciting
in terms of future tech so this may be a
is that from last week that's us cus he
never goes bad you didn't know that
you're never goes bad you can quote me
on that all right so this is not the
kind of barber you eat as I mentioned
this is a fiber that was developed by
the University of Texas at Dallas and it
is an electrically conducting fiber that
can potentially be used for things like
artificial muscles exoskeletons and
morphing objects so it's like so watch
they're stretching out this fiber they
can stretch this fiber to 14 times its
original length without without losing
any resistance and also it conducts
electricity in it so it actually
increases its ability to conduct which
is amazing so they were saying that the
great thing about this is that
originally they thought this will be
great for things like artificial muscles
like this is what we want to develop it
okay originally they because because it
expands and contracts you can conduct
electricity through it so if you have
like an electrical network that helps
you know move these artificial muscles
things like that which is great really
really awesome but now after testing it
they actually think they might be able
to use it in a much wider variety of
applications and one of the examples
maybe was flexible electronics oh so
like phones yeah or watches watches I
mean things that did that conduct
electricity on sings like that like this
could be a really great breakthrough
could be really great the next step yeah
right um so how it's done is it's made
by wrapping carbon nanotubes around a
rubber core and they were saying that
this rubber core is actually pretty
easily accessible it's inexpensive it's
not terribly expensive to make the only
part of it the entire process that is a
little bit expensive as they have a thin
layer of air
gel in there it took they have like
different layers and so the bass part of
the fiber is this rubber core with all
these carbon nanotubes and then if they
add to it they have like these different
layers of stuff that help bolster it so
one of them was aerogel which pre pretty
expensive okay that's gonna be expensive
well not alter if you don't have the
aerogel which you can have the bass part
of it which is that rubber core which is
inexpensive easily accessible they were
saying that this is literally able to be
very rapidly commercialized if people
chose to so you could really put
something like this into production for
a product like relatively quickly right
which is kind of impressive um honestly
I want a superhero suit made out of this
like elastigirl yeah I'm just super
super suit bring my mate where's my
supersuit yeah no I mean I mean that'd
be pretty good for something like if
they needed to like gauge someone's
heart like a real Hospital needleless I
mean even though even the idea of
flexible muscles artificial flexing my
was more excited about that pretty
impressive oh yeah you can be like deus
ex human revolution yeah like you know
super robotics and instead of your like
if your arm was lousy you right lousy
medical term and you could just kind of
like a place at like if you yeah you
could exoskeleton that was one of the
big things they talked about is having
these sort of artificial muscles assist
and be very flexible and easy to move as
opposed to like ReWalk has that robotic
exoskeleton but it's very big and kind
of bulky and you got to attach it to the
outsides your hips and stuff yeah I'm
sorry I jumped to cell phones and
watches that even make it that much
sense helping disabled I'm just excited
just like melon kiddo okay my turn is
stupid all right yeah I love when you
give me these stories because this is
just what what's going on okay cuz kmc
has has announced a new technology that
is going to be worked into their buckets
their bucket okay so so let's uh let's
go just show any just shout it has a
chain okay so check out this new tech
that they have based on their buckets
I'm gonna go ahead yeah so this is this
is a real thing it is a bucket that
prints out pictures is called the memory
you bucket basically you buy a bucket of
chicken and then you set up your
smartphone you take you take pictures
and then you're able to send it over
like bluetooth or Wi-Fi or whatever and
then the bucket will print out pictures
of you and your friends getting your
greasy little mouths mitts and stuff
like that that is what look at that's
the thing you haven't been asking for
it's the thing you've never thought of
asking for in your whole life because it
seems real dumb so basically it's just
built a built-in photo printer and now
this is all based around get ready cuz
this is ready to make less sense this is
to celebrate the 60th anniversary of KFC
in Canada big I mean you know listen I'm
not Canadian and neither you so I maybe
we don't understand how important
kentucky fried chicken and the colonel
are to the people of Canada we don't
know maybe can't maybe the colonel is
like I don't know like a second
figurehead like a rolling royalty of
chicken royalty to Canadians if you're
Canadian tell us in the comments how you
feel about the colonel from KFC but yeah
it's really dumb anyway I'm seeing this
before they did came she did this weird
promotion where they gave you a
bluetooth keyboard you know when you
order like a tray and there's always
like a little piece of paper and they
had a bluetooth keyboard so you could
work while you're eating your kmc again
another grease factor is involved here
and people kept them so oh and the other
thing is there's been a lot of fast food
joints and companies making this this
promotional kind of stuff like there's
that hoverboard that's supposed to be
coming out soon which I still think it's
stupid Lexus says video next week I know
but this week i'm so tired of them
hyping it up and getting attention for
it but let's just see the thing but
anyway KFC says that this is a real
thing it's not fake its not promote i
mean to promotion but it's you're gonna
be able to get i'm sure there's like
gonna be limited ones but regardless
people will be getting them um so yeah
it's it's called the memory bucket I
remember how much hopefully we can get
one awful how awful I fell after ate an
entire bucket of chicken just to be able
to get a photo printer it looks like a
chicken book so we have a hashtag of the
day based around this i love i love
these stories and love these so we want
to
hashtag TD bucket um come up with a
better fried chicken bucket tech like
what's a what's even together around
their fried chicken bucket so what is
yours how about a calorie counters like
a little scale like it in your blood and
the cholesterol measure yeah yikes i
would say i would want a sauce dispenser
so like inside the bottom of the bucket
you like press you get like three
options you can press like ranch BBQ
honey mustard you press it and like
coverage that's actually a really good
idea the weird thing is that you'd get
all of them no matter what like they're
all there they're already all there so
you may be wasting i do like to dip like
chicken tenders in both ranch and BBQ
though that's a good one it's pretty
tasty um I'm gonna go ahead and change
mine and say that I would have a heated
bucket like it keep like yeah yeah okay
again this is a cool tech even want you
guys are better at thinking outside the
box like maybe your strobes or something
I don't know come up with something
crazy I like the idea of having a Tesla
machine like zap the chicken to keep it
crispy that's it there you go oh that's
pretty good I like a retired up with
anything about the food but we want you
guys to come up with something crazy
like maybe maybe it's a part drone and
it comes to you lies to you I like that
idea I don't know tell us you just stole
somebody's great idea i just want you to
know like someone right now is i just
show going kale why why did you take my
idea I'm really upset alright last thing
let's talk about a our sandbox this is
really cool we saw something similar for
kids like museum but this is a little
bit different it's meant for education
of university students this was
developed with by UC davis and UCLA
together jointly and they made a really
neat sandbox that's real Sam that
they're pushing around it changes the
topography of what's going on with
augmented reality so it uses a kinect
projector sand in the box like all this
stuff and what they do is so the idea is
that topography maps are made for people
to get elevation data very quickly
through all of the lines but there are
two DS so it can be really hard to
visualize exactly sort of what you're
looking at like I've look
hiking maps I'm just like I don't know
what's happening here but I'm not a
seasoned hiker so you see Davidson UCLA
said okay let's make this a our sandbox
let's put sand in their students can
make valleys they can make exploding
volcanoes they can make you know
beautiful hills like all this different
stuff and then they can actually hold
their hands over the top of what's going
on in the sandbox to artificially create
rain like their hands are the clouds and
so all these he watch so you can see it
look at waters falling down into the
different pools inside the actual a our
sandbox which is pretty amazing so it
gives students an idea of how erosion
works it gives them an idea of how
rainwater affects the land in different
ways and also the real goal here is the
university said they want to hopefully
help students develop the ability to
sort of visualize these top our
topographical features out in the field
so when they don't have access to this
they can remember using this and say
okay like I remember seeing this effect
in the sandbox so now that I'm out in
the field looking at this actual piece
of geography I can say okay well this
topography is different and here's how
it might have eroded over time because
of the simulation that I saw in the
sandbox I was gonna say UCLA you seem to
be a little late on this one because I
don't know you remember look pretty sure
lucky go to my camera yeah that was the
that was the kids thing right well not
only did you pan do it but even before
that Disney did this right and they had
it on their cruise ships just for kids
to play with this is sounds like dance
it sounds like the huge difference here
which none of these had is the clouds
and also the erosion factors so so it's
not just a because you can also on the
disney one create a volcano and see how
that's really how about deals down but
this one sounds like the erosion as part
of it the rain is part of it well you
can also see in the video the topography
lines so it yeah it's actually site like
you can actually do scientific
measurements and experiments with this
one as opposed to the one that's just
for kids for fun so
they basically took an idea that's out
there and said let's try to find a way
to make this educational for college
students as well as children so it's
children it's really fun thing to sort
of just see how the land changes but
then for these topography students it's
like okay we're going to equip you with
the ability to use this device and then
go out in the field and say okay I saw
the simulation this is how I'm guessing
this this piece of land eroded just
saying UCLA you got that college money
maybe keep up keep up with Disney and
Japan no one can keep up with Japan I
know but it's cool I want to play I want
to play with that all right guys we're
gonna take a quick break we're gonna
come right back with back at her hackett
it's a food-based back at her hackett
this week I don't know if you're gonna
like it at all but writers what yeah
they actually just eat spiders says
that's the back of the Hackett and and
then of course we have your user
feedback and our phone target for the
day so don't click away it's tomorrow
daily
welcome back to the show everybody that
is going to make you so sick um you know
it's Monday and that means we like to
talk about crowdfunding and whether or
not we want to give our money to people
so it is now time for back into Hackett
all right Kel I'm gonna give you a name
of something you're gonna tell me if you
think it's something you would buy just
based on the name the Imperial spirit
cater oh yeah you do it oh yeah kills
already guy's wallet out okay it happen
to me so have you heard of molecular
gastronomy like super high-end cuisine
it's kind of weird experimental stuff
yeah I think we've talked about
something like I'm not like I love
astronomy okay so there's an idea in
molecular gastronomy it's like Perl
izing foods so they make little pearls
of stuff that looked like caviar but
they're flavored very differently and
it's kind of a little bit of a process
use alginate like it's a big thing but
but this is the Imperial Spheeris
purification and held device that makes
any food you can liquefy in the little
tiny edible pearls that you can put it
onto your food so you can make like
creative cool like ideas culinary ideas
so the video shows off a whole bunch of
different types of food it looks like
caviar fish eggs row whatever but it's
not see how this is the way you would
normally do it is you would have this
alginate you have these little syringes
and it's this big whole thing this now
is the things to make it easy quick and
painless they're saying it's very easy
to use they say that it's easy to clean
and the video shows different flavors
like onion vinegar mint tomato coffee
like they did a coffee a little coffee
caviar almost on the desert and then you
get these little like bursts of coffee
as you eat your dessert so pretty
amazing um so you blend whatever it is
that you want to make that you want to
liquefy you want to turn into caviar you
got to wait for all the air bubbles to
leave so this is the one without any air
bubbles they let sit for a while and
then you dump the liquid into this
terrific ater that's alginate they're
adding alginate that's what you've got
to do all the Elgin because that makes
the outside the shell of the little
spheres so you mix the alginate you put
in your stuff and then when you use the
spirit vagator it puts just the right
amount of liquid down into the alginate
bowl and then you like to sift it out so
yeah there you go see drops his and then
as you drop them in it makes the little
dots and then you pull up the strainer
and there they are right there you rinse
about onions rinse them off of water yep
and then yeah that's it you're done you
put him on your food pretty amazing okay
tell me why I wouldn't like this well I
thought you'd be really weirded out by
it if I'm being honest I thought you'd
be really weirded out I love the
delightful it's you don't have to have
like a big chunk of onion it's kind of
like this these little bites the stops
of onion it's a fancier like it's a very
kind of cool futuristic way to season
something I I really like it do you
really like it I'd up again I don't like
the texture of that kind of thing okay I
don't even like dippin dots if you even
know what those are not like that ice
cream that's the ice cream of the future
yeah from 90s funny but it's stupid but
this is cool I like that it's sort of
subtle because some people don't like
your texture a certain thing that's true
maybe onion sure when you bite into it
it's too much it gets stuck in between
your teeth or whatever but this is cool
he's like you gotta like tomato Tabasco
he may like tabasco is the hot sauce
ahhh see ya PR that's correct about you
and then it's like you do bite them and
then they pop like they obviously a
little pop nigga okay big gold mouth of
all right all right all right so okay so
uh let's let's let's get to the
nitty-gritty they want sixty one
thousand dollars they're very close to
their goal if not they may have
surpassed it at this point they're
pretty close this morning um they
deliver this year in November so it you
can get it in time for Christmas if
you're thinking about buying it for a
keulen airy loving friend or loved one
the retail price of this so much do you
think does it come with like the packs
of whatever I think it's like a kit that
first shipping comes with a kit of like
alginate and then you get the
spherificator and then you get like 250
250
retail 175 so less than you actually
thought but the Earl okay so they did
too they have three early birds the
first two are already sold out they had
a hundred-dollar level which I totally
would've totally bought it charlie is
it's got less than 20 days left then
they had a 125 level that also sold out
what about a pro violet it now I think
there might be a few left at 150 bucks i
wouldn't pay 200 so 175 though me not
bad i like all things considered if you
want to do something cool with your food
like it seems like a fun thing but yeah
it also seems to me like the kind of
products like the kind of product you
buy like you go to bed bath and beyond
and you're like oh my gosh this looks
amazing I have to have this thing for my
kitchen it's gonna do this one thing in
the kitchen and then you've literally
use it like twice a year yeah it's like
people that get excited about the Magic
Bullet you know that infomercial and
you're like oh I'm gonna magic bullet
everything and then you magic bullet for
like a week and then you're like answer
because this is a lot this adds a lot to
prep time right it's basically you'd use
it for company and then usually just
once or twice Christmas I get what
you're saying that's why i said i
wouldn't pay two hundred dollars for it
but man i would have paid a hundred if
you own a restaurant this would be super
cool any big expensive put yourself on
the map now so they well now i mean like
a lot of molecular gastronomy chefs who
are who have you perfected this like um
Wylie Dufresne is really famous for this
sort of idea he had a restaurant called
WD 40 in New York and I love chefs like
food and if you couldn't tell Oh at home
I like food and so um he has this he had
this restaurant and really kind of like
he was one of the people who sort of
revolutionized the idea of molecular
astronomy and like doing sorts of crazy
things with food like making ice cream
with um you know nitrogen liquid
nitrogen and like you know doing food
like that or you know different types of
techniques that weren't used in the
kitchen previously like that are very
kind of futuristic looking things like
that like that was one of his things and
this was one of them was like caviar or
paralyzing food so it's been around for
a while and a lot of really
restaurants like you might see this
technique but they're trying to bring it
into casual home use which is pretty
cool so there you go the Imperial spirit
gainer all right great name by the way
God whatever back it yeah sure I'm back
it I see yeah why not like it's like a
yeah sure why not I mean this would be
fun I again I'd love to see in a
restaurant yeah my friend had to be like
oh cool and that I would never want him
to do it again never see it again yet
what about you Logan me see are doing
alcohol everyone has a light to alcohol
you could do it like alcohol dippin dots
could I make this can I figure that out
if you put like little Tabasco balls and
you're a bloody mary that's cool that'd
be pretty glorious all right guys let's
uh let's go let's shift gears let's stop
talking about crowdfunding and let's
talk about you it's time for a user
feedback so we asked you guys to use
hashtag TD prime here and tell us how
exactly you would differentiate amazon's
version of top gear which it won't be
named that versus the bbc's version of
top gear which they're now trying to
soar reboot with new hosts so you guys
have some good answers and a couple that
I expected but Tilly wrote in and said I
don't think they can actually amazon
knows the talent they bought and the
people who will be watching so I think
that's a good point account is it good
how much can they differentiate without
turning off the original viewer base of
top gear however I'm sure that there are
ideas that the the hosts and creators
had that they couldn't do because the
BBC might have been limited or maybe the
formula work too much that Amazon's more
willing to keep open minded but Tilly's
absolutely right you don't want your
audience to come they're expecting that
one thing they're like finally it's back
and it's something different yeah you
moved my cheese you know so good good
good finally good uh Roger wrote in and
said they can be as racist than sex that
says they want now whoo too hot for TV a
sick burn lawyer Clarkson's gonna need
some creek exact he gets to punch every
guest see you just get to punch
everybody now come on I just contractors
coming up next we have Hugh Hefner yeah
I guess his punches everybody ocular
nervosa Rhoda and said is it bad that I
hope it's just like Top Gear these are
most of the answers don't change it it's
the same and then lastly Ramses wrote
and said I hope they don't yeah most
people don't change if it ain't broke
don't fix it keep doing the same great
stuff and it went it's it's really is a
great show it's just keep doing the
great great stuff and if you can find
ways to make it interesting or different
like you were talking about last week
like then do those things but not don't
don't try to fix it like better because
nothing's broken just let it be Yeah
right it's but you know I had the same
feelings and I'm not disagreeing with
you but usually means I disagree with
you mine is kind of like a devil's
advocate I'm a huge fallout fan in case
that I haven't translated that out to
you and when people ask me what I'd want
to change but from fallout 3 to fallout
4 by the way it's video games open
worlds post-apocalyptic anyway so they
said what would you want change I said
nothing just make another version of
fallout but they've added all this great
stuff that I don't know that I wanted
and I'm very excited to spend even more
time in that world so we don't know yeah
but I totally get not wanting it all we
can do is trust that team and their
executive producer who all came from Top
Gear to make a show that is as good if
not better than what came before like if
I think we can trust them I feel like we
can trust them and I think Amazon is not
dumb and I think they know that they
need to give the fans exactly what they
want but also go up above and beyond
just like you were saying with fall out
and give them things they didn't even
know they wanted so I think like if they
can do that then they're in a really
good I love for them to get more people
excited about the show not that there
isn't enough cuz there's tons yeah
everybody loves I'm sure they'll be a
big ramp up yeah I would love to see
some sometime again never bored by
watching the show who knows knows but
good points very very salient points all
right guys it is time for our last piece
user feedback which is always our phone
tog refer of the day
Tom wrote in its better not be amazing
you know it's it's the worst really what
a what a dump I says hey guys huge fan
of your show from New Zealand these
photos were taken at Lake Coleridge and
mount Hut just out of Christchurch and
you know what like honestly guys uh I'm
a little jealous because I don't I feel
like I only live in a place with great
sunsets like that's all I really get in
Southern California amazing sunsets like
that's the thing I feel like we're
famous for photographically if you go
look on like Instagram it's awesome be
another beautiful Southern California
sunset we get that a lot yeah we're
never likely this beautiful smog this we
don't see this this never happens maybe
you go to like mammoths you might see
something like that but I have never
seen a photo like this and all my day
I've never seen anything like this in
person in my life yeah that's what I'm
saying and that's a lot of your pictures
there are things that you send in that
I'm just like I have never seen that in
my life I've never seen that in person
with my own two eyes Lawson Los Angeles
isn't known for any sort of nature type
thing really good street photography i
will say that there's some really good
strong beautiful street photography in
LA which isn't for everyone not for
everybody but like you're in the
landscapes and stuff you got to go out
to the desert it's like that's don't get
me wrong our desert rock unbelievable
our mountains rock but they're so far
from where we live at least the now
we're just trying to explain our
jealousy yeah and why we like your
photos like we like them so that's I
mean that was incredible like you forget
you said that out of jealousy you said
that out of like like just being great
probably never seen anything like that
and i don't know that i will in my whole
life we're also glad that you have an
eye for it i like how we're unloading
all this stuff that we felt for a long
time but we're glad you guys have an eye
for it showing off such a such cool
things that like maybe not everybody
gets to see now just why this segment is
really awesome yeah that is the soapbox
of yellow get down off of our soap box
and if you want to send in your photogra
fee you can always email it to us
tomorrow at cnet com tell us what phone
you took it with tell us where you took
it all that good stuff and if you want
to find us on social media you can find
tomorrow the show at tomorrow daily or
tomorrow daily com
if you want to share it with somebody
that would be awesome and if you want to
find us on social media because we're
the best ever you find me at Ashley
sceva on Twitter and I'm at killing i
miss Logan what do you think is gorgeous
in LA no bouquet he should have said his
girlfriend but I was gonna say we may
not have those beautiful views but
everyone here's gorgeous like Liam some
of them are really pretty so it's such a
mind they're terrible people oh ya know
they're empty inside empty inside of the
house like shell is oh my god yeah it's
like beautiful shell but that's about it
anyway anyway that note that is it for
today's show we'll be back tomorrow with
