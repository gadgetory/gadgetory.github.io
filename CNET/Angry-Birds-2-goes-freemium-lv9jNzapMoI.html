net and today we're going to be looking
at Angry Birds - the long-awaited sequel
to the game all the way from 2009
there's been a lot of spin-offs since
then but this is sort of a completely
different take on hangry Birds there's a
lot of polish a lot of rate graphics and
cool stuff to play with but at the same
time it has some freemium problems that
I think a lot of people won't be happy
with so it's the same as every other
Angry Birds you have your slingshot here
and here's the structure you want to get
rid of the little green pigs so I'm just
gonna choose the regular red bird fling
it at the structure success alright so
all the birds that are available for the
level or down here over on the left and
there and this is sort of a new concept
of cards and you'll actually earn cards
that will carry over into the next level
there's also spells that you can select
before each level one that's that has
ducks that rain down another that
freezes the level before you knock it
over and still another that has the
pepper which makes one of the enemies
explode outwards okay so here's the
thing about Angry Birds - it has a huge
freemium component and a lot of people
are probably not going to be happy with
it
you get five lives to complete a level
if you run out of lives before that
level is complete then you're either
gonna have to pay or you're gonna have
to wait and as it says it takes 30
minutes for another life to come back
but here's the other thing each time
that you do a level it is random and so
the structures are going to be different
every single time so what's less than
that is learning how to play a level so
you won't play level 36 over and over
again to try to do the exact same thing
over and over because it's going to
change every single time and so that
randomness takes away a lot of the
puzzle aspects that people liked about
the earlier Angry Birds games here's a
new concept for Angry Birds - is the
idea of the boss level here's the King
pig and we have to try to take him out
in order to finish on the boss levels it
always takes a few hits to take them out</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
