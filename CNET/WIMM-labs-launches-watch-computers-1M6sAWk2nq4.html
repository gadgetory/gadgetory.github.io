here to introduce whim and the whim
wearable platform the one platform is
about allowing licensees to take whim
technology and turn it into wearable
products whether that's a SmartWatch a
bike handlebar computer a pendant that
laughs you pay for things it can really
be turned into anything the one platform
is based around the wind module which is
a small android based computer that has
Wi-Fi bluetooth gps accelerometers and
magnetometer and allows you to quickly
get glances of data in a very readable
gestural way you can get in and out of
the ops very quickly you can change
between apps here's our world clock for
example get time around the world get
back out let's get my next appointment
and if I want even change out my watch
face here's one that shows local weather
when does this ship so the Developer
Preview kit ships in about four weeks
and we'll have that available on our
website and then licensees we hope to
have shipping by the end of the year
okay what's inside there again inside
the wim module in grab a full module a
or show you we've got this is a fun
watch face we've got Wi-Fi bluetooth gps
accelerometer magnetometer a vibrator
for silent alerts and piezo for audible
alerts and we packed the whole thing in
a water-resistant package that was
ceramic right this one is ceramic we
both ceramic and plastic some of our
licensees have expressed interest in
going higher end and for high-end
materials ceramics great because it
allows us to be RF transparent so all
the antennas inside can still
communicate and how much do you think a
watch with that will be we'll see a
whole range of price points from our
licensees some of them talking as low as
1 99 and some we're talking as high as
over a thousand dollars thanks mm-hmm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
