as the best-selling pickup truck in
America some would say it's the most
important car on the road today which is
why it's even more important that the
Ford f-150 step into the 21st century
and modernize let's hop behind the wheel
of this 2015 ford f150 4x4 super crew
platinum to see just how big of a step
had taken
another thing the Platinum's version of
the Ford f-150 means that it's got a lot
of fit and finish and luxury upgrades
this is the truck that's aimed at the
person who either wants to use this as
their daily driver and has a little
extra money to spend or somebody who
wants to go to the work fight but
doesn't want to feel like they're in a
utilitarian vehicle on the way there and
back so around the cabin we've got
really nice things like leather
multi-contour seats we've got leather on
the dashboard metal wood everywhere that
you see there's a really good fit and
finish but underneath that there's until
that truck ashiness everything is really
big I mean for example the shifter is so
big and so chunky that I can't really
get my hand around it
getting back to luxury things we've got
a really cool feature in this card from
a thighs seat I can get a back massage I
can get heated and cooled surfaces I can
even get the seat bottom to massage the
my back s600 we had a couple of weeks
ago didn't even have feet massagers this
truck will massage your butt as you
drive down the road it's really cool
now this 2015 f150 still uses Ford SYNC
- and my Ford touch this is generally a
pretty terrible infotainment system it
kind of moves everything out to the
corners and in this vehicle it's a
really long reach to the screen feel
like getting the navigation means that
you've got to get full extension of your
arm to reach it and even once you're
there everything just takes an extra
second to get around
fortunately the 2016 Ford f-150 is
getting the much improved Ford SYNC 3
weight for that one
now the cats all good for getting people
around but this is the truck so you're
gonna want to move things every now and
then that's where this bed comes into
play and because it's the Platinum
Edition we've got some really nice
features such as this automatic drop
down tailgate and right here we've got
this slide-out step up so you don't
break your neck or twist rank while
getting in and out of it and the bed is
very customizable we've got built-in
tie-downs in this example has this sort
of bed extender well they are these
little plastic gates that sort of like
unlatch and fold out so as you can get
an extra foot and a half of cargo
capacity driving around with things that
your bed down without having to worry
about them flopping out now under the
hood we're gonna be dealing with four
it's 3.5 liter EcoBoost v6 not v8 v6 and
that's not even the smallest engine
available in this f-150 now what
EcoBoost means in Ford parlance is
turbocharged and in this case we're
talking about twin turbos on our v6
engine total power is gonna be about 365
horsepower stated and about 420
pound-feet of torque it's nothing to
thumb your nose at there and when you
step on the throttle you do get a little
bit of a rev up and nice burble it
sounds like a v8 and it sort of pulls
like a v8 so let's at least consider the
acceleration portion of Ford's claim of
v8 power of v6 efficiency as confirmed
I'm speaking of efficiency the EPA rates
this thing at about 19 miles per gallon
combined during my testing I got about
eighteen point one on the highway which
dropped down to about 16 miles per
gallon when I got stuck in traffic and
really started testing the acceleration
now that engines gonna be paired with a
single option six-speed Automatic
transmission that close in to a
two-speed transfer case this is a 4x4 so
we also have the ability to slick
between two wheel drive and four wheel
drive with high low and automatic ratios
now the Platinum Edition sort of
positions itself not really as a work
truck but more of a luxury truck the
sort of thing that you'd use to tow the
down to the waterfront on the weekend
and so what she won from that is
reasonable efficiency which we kind of
have and a nice quiet and comfortable
ride you want luxury out of this
Platinum Edition and the interesting
thing about going with a 3.5 liter
ecoboost is that it's a very quiet very
smooth engine well you're just sort of
cruising down the highway not really
hammering it when you're waiting at a
traffic light you'll immediately notice
that that v6 engine is extremely quiet
you barely even notice that it's running
that's just how buttery smooth it is
2015 Ford f-150 platinum rolls off the
lot at about fifty four thousand three
hundred and eighty-five bucks but with
all the options and destination charges
we've got on this example we're looking
at more like sixty-two thousand one
hundred and fifty bucks
Alif excuse me I've got to go help
everyone I know moves
