on iOS and people love sharing things
with messages whether it's photos or
links to their favorite websites but
they look like this but not any longer
because now we have rich links so when
you share links you get artwork from the
website extracted title it's really
great and it's especially awesome when
you get shared with things like video
because they can play right in line
inside the transcript look at that guy
go now people really love emoji and now
we've made them three times bigger in
the transcript which is fantastic
and to help you always reach for the
right emoji we're providing emoji
predictions as you type super handy but
you know sometimes you typed a whole
message and you realize at the end that
you're totally lacking in a moja
fication and so we've provided the
solution when you tap on the emoji
button will highlight all the emotive
fiable words there and you can just tap
tap tap tap and mode 2 pi but you know
we wanted to do something more
fundamental with messaging because today
no matter what you say it's always the
same bubble it always is this comes
across the same way but no longer
because now we have bubble effects so if
you want to say it loud you can say it
loud
and if you want to say it more gently
well now you can do that as well
and you know sometimes you want to get
across something personal an invisible
ain't gives you the way to do that so
you can just slide your finger across
the bubble and clear away the message
like that and it's a really great way to
share a surprise a little scared to see
what's behind that you can just slide
across okay but you know there's nothing
more personal than your own handwriting
and so now we'd support handwritten
messages think handwriting bubbles you
see when it comes across the care there
is the ink just settles in to the
transcript it's really beautiful and of
course we support digital touch as well
so you can send these very lively
sketches but also with video photos even
things like your heartbeat and sometimes
what you say really deserves using the
whole screen so now messages can do that
as well
