welcome to the apple by for all the good
and bad inside the world of Apple let's
get to the show and it's official
apple's next product launch event will
happen on tuesday october the 23rd with
the invitation teasing us with the
tagline we've got a little more to show
you you know I swear only Apple could
get away with saying that right here's
your stories oh okay yeah no thanks Team
this is awesome sure it's cool do you
need anything else oh I've got a little
more to show you what I was actually
going to show her my new thumb drive now
the event is being held at the
california theatre in san jose and no
surprise one of those little things is
expected to be the ipad mini the mini
pad mini me or the maxi pad whatever you
guys want to call it now etrade supply
posted photos of what's believed to be
the seven point eight five inch display
for the ipad mini which still looks to
retain its four by three aspect ratio
like the full-size ipad now earlier
rumors also suggest the resolution will
be 1024 x 768 which is the same as the
ipad 2 but there's no confirmation of
that yet and if you guys like batteries
i know you do this is an image from mac
rumors that shows off the purported ipad
mini battery that's about three times
the size as the iphone 5s it's one-third
the size of the current iPads battery
but that could also indicate this will
not have a Retina display since it
typically requires more power now the
mini isn't the only ipad we're expecting
to see 9to5 mac receive the list of ipad
skews that shows apple could be set to
launch 24 models of the new device now
24 skews just for the ipad mini seems a
little aggressive this could point to
the scoop we told you about two months
ago from our own sources that apple
would be releasing a revamp full-size
ipad with a lightning connector before
the end of the year now the current ipad
has 12 configurations that's two colors
three
capacities and two versions with Wi-Fi
as one and Wi-Fi + cellular as the other
the ipad mini would most likely follow
this same formula so we could see 12 new
iPad skews and 12 new iPad Mini skews
but we'll wait to find out on the
twenty-third iPads aren't the only
hardware we expect to see as well
unofficial reports have come out that
the anticipated macbook pro 13-inch with
retina display will debut at the apple
event that will be based off of the
15-inch retina design with no specs
revealed at this point and i know many
of you have been holding out for this
model new mac minis are also expected to
be announced and available immediately
after the event in two configurations
and an OS 10 server version as well but
what about the new iMacs it's been over
five hundred and thirty days since the
last refresh and it makes sense to
release them for the holidays now a new
rumor from website way phone com that
includes an image of the internals of
the purported new imac says the design
will be thinner sporting a new curved
teardrop shaped outer shell and will be
announced alongside of the new ipad
there's still no real Intel if they'll
include a Retina display and this is one
of the few Apple products these days
that still remains pretty much under
wraps 9to5 mac also has a list of what
appears to be four new iMacs cues for
the 21 inch and 27 inch models and says
they'll either be available the day
after the event or a few weeks later but
we'll see how that all shakes out and
Mac Pro fans I'm sorry you'll still have
to wait until 2013 so that's a wrap up
of what we expect to see at this next
event and we'll get the word straight
from the apples mouth on Tuesday now in
some other stories are you one of the
people still waiting in line for an
iphone 5 at an apple store trust me it's
happening people with first world
problems I've been complaining about the
product shortage and part of the reason
is because of the complicated assembly
process just like seeing its own Josh
savage in this Saturday Night Live skin
joining me today are Josh savage from
cnet thanks for having me Josh we'll
start with you what are your complaints
about the iphone 5 well Kaitlyn everyone
knows that Apple maps has been a total
disaster and since there is no Google
app yet I've been forced to use google
maps in my browser which is
significantly slower oh no talk about
Apple map it not work right it took it
to wrong place you want Starbuck I take
you to dunkin donut that must be so hard
for you it's a tough life we live guys
now an unnamed Foxconn official told the
Wall Street Journal that the iPhone 5 is
the most difficult device Foxconn has
ever assembled to make it light and thin
the design is very complicated now
earlier in October that were up to 4,000
employees who stopped production to
protest over the unrealistic quality
control expectations from Foxconn and
apple now the foxconn official says
practice makes perfect and their
productivity has been improving day by
day but I can assure you Chinese people
work fast like really fast but they
can't all do cool ironing tricks alright
guys and before we go some apples
announcing iPads let's do an iPad
