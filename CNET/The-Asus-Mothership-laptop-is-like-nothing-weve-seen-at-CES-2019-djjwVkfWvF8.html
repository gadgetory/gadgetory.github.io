the new or soos mothership works you
won't get it no one I've described it to
does and even after reading about it
before seeing it I had no idea what to
expect but in person it's one of the
most inventive gaming laptops I've seen
and the closest I've seen to a gaming
laptop truly embracing the DNA of a
desktop the mothership starts out
looking like any other oversized 17-inch
gaming laptop but to open it you place
its rear edge where the ports and vents
usually are flat against the table or
desk press down lightly and a kick stamp
pops out from the back the prototype we
tried only worked at one angle but as
sue says the final version will allow
for multiple kickstand angles then you
fold open the clamshell revealing a
keyboard with a side aligned touchpad
that keyboard can sit at its slightly
inclined angle making for an unusual
gaming laptop setup but it can also
fully detach that way you can sit back
with the keyboard fold the top half of
the keyboard panel underneath it or
position it however you like in this
mode the mothership is less of a gaming
laptop and more of a gaming all-in-one
desktop with a wireless keyboard the
advantage of a setup like this is that
it's more focused on being desk friendly
than lap friendly which is what you
really want the gaming PC laptop or
desktop unlike traditional laptops the
components are all built into the
display side and that includes new
NVIDIA r-tx series graphics and Intel
Core i nine processors the kickstand of
the back allows for some pretty
substantial cooling letting these
high-power parts live in harmony in a
laptop body and if you're looking for
something a little more modest but still
a top performer there's a new version of
the very slim a Suzy forest gaming
laptop the GX 701 takes the basic
concept of the Zephyrus a slim body that
lifts up on a rear riser for both
cooling and ergonomics and puts it into
a larger 17 inch laptop core i7
processors and max QR TX graphics from
Nvidia add up to date components it's no
mothership but it'll be a lot less
expensive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
