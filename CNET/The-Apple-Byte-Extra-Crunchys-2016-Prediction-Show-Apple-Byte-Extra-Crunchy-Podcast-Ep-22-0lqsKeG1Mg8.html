building in san francisco california
it's the apple byte extra crunchy with
your hot with your host mr. Brian Tom
whoa whoa that was a mistake but he just
called me hot I think I well I was
trying to say like podcasts or son no no
you're trying to say hot just admit it I
i I've here hot hoes I've heard that
from both sides of the fence I am
completely comfortable with who I am and
I embrace it all nice bring it thank you
and my hot co hostess with the mostess
producer up out even beat him in the
house all right everybody this is apple
byte extra crunchy episode 21 21 a nice
number also just to let you know before
the break we will be doing our
prediction show today so we're going to
start off with a few headlines and then
get to our predictions of the year and
then you won't hear from us for a few
weeks because we'll be on vacation will
be at CES and then when we work we will
return to our normally scheduled
programming yes correct host CES is
going to drain us if we survive we will
survive so let's just get to some
stories we only have a few here to go
over and then we'll jump into our
predictions but we talked about it last
week how 60 minutes was doing a profile
behind the scenes on Apple showing
inside their laboratory where they
designed that amazing smart case battery
that we all obviously know and love it's
a it holds a very dear near and dear
place in my heart it's very special near
the trash can so a lot of people on the
internet we're watching this video and
in one of the shots one of the
interviews there was a a macbook in the
background that was kind of angled
differently and kind of weird and people
were like what is that like it people
were they didn't know it didn't look it
really didn't look like a 12 inch ultra
thin but it still looked like an
ultra-thin in the way it was angled made
people wonder is that is that is that
the new macbook air i'm pro 15-inch
retina Apple has gone on the record and
told tech insider it is not but people
literally freaked out and if you look at
the pictures you can check out tech
insider if you're watching us right now
you could see that
it looks a little different but there's
I'm shocked that people can see that
kind of stuff you know it's just since
in the background I think the
proportions threw them off based on the
picture it does look very 15 ish I've
got to admit but there is no way Apple
is going to just leave new hardware
laying around in fact when they went to
the lab they covered like tons of their
tables with with big ol whatever sheets
or they're all covered in these like
bagel tarps so you couldn't see what was
going on so anyways if you got excited
that's not it although if you tilt it at
an angle that's my that might be what it
looks like also just to get people
really excited believe this one nowhere
else fr posted a video recently what was
purported to be an iphone 7 like from a
factory and it looks totally fake in it
actually actually looks too well
produced and it's funny because the
person's wearing the gloves like in
Foxconn or something you know so it's
like I don't know but I was studying
this very closely you're studying the
video really closely yeah what it what
did you find in your mind I'm looking
I'm looking for a port like what ports
there are 0 and then someone screams hey
it's so rehearsed yeah it's so fake dude
has the white gloves has like a body
suit and you here at the end some would
say hey and then the person like puts
away this is not the iphone 7 though the
reason why people like jump to
conclusions this is the first phone it
had kind of a generic iphone looking
back factory service but there's no home
screen button on it so then people like
I'm thinking to get rid of the home the
whole button they're not this is all
fake right now it's Christmas it's the
gift that keeps on giving and we're just
getting fake stuff right now it is funny
though we gotta do that we why don't we
make a stupid you know fake iphone 7
video maybe it'd be pretty easy actually
yeah very easy these days and the name
of the youtube channel that that posted
it to was called wet let me see the
youtube channel was called oh yeah viral
video lab wow that's not real viral
video lab is the youtube channel not
real trying to be viral it's fake that's
funny um also I think that you would
like this to
ray mr. Beecham apple once again rumored
to be developing a high resolution audio
format this is according to Macotakara
at this weekend's portable audio
festival in tokyo according to several
sources familiar with Apple whose
products are shown off at this festival
the company has been developing a high
res audio streaming plat basically what
a codec or format up to 96 kilohertz mmm
24-bit Wow for 2016 man that's gonna
that's gonna eat up your hard drive now
this is what's going on the Lightning
terminal with iOS 9 right the Lightning
what it's capable of pushing is
compatible up to 192 kilohertz at 24 bit
wow so this to me logically leads to
something we might talk about in our
predictions if lightning is able to
handle this if Apple is potentially
developing a high res audio streaming
format does this point to even more
information that they are going to get
rid of the 3.5 millimeter headphone jack
definitely does yes this is more clues
through the little bit of bread crumbs
just down there yeah I mean 192 i Nev I
don't even record music at 192 it's too
big and it takes a long time for a
session to open you know like if you
open in Pro Tools all the tracks pop up
it takes like 10 minutes or something
but I think 192 might be a little
overkill is that that's what I'm gonna
say is it even necessary don't get our
gears interpret our ears and your ears
will be able to hear a difference for
sure but it's also gonna weigh down your
hard drive like it's gonna take forever
to sync songs and to even just transfer
songs I mean that's a big file so I
record a 48 uh-huh maybe 88 occasionally
but 48 is like the way you know 48 the
easiest i have a question could someone
be able to tell the difference through
their ear buds that they listen to oh
yeah I think so I think so even through
through little earbuds yeah yeah that
Willie expression in the new ones the
new ones are really sound great so you
can hear a difference i can tell the
difference between a wav and mp3 easily
well because you're Stephen Beecham well
you know haha it's just
you know just is big so much fuller it
just sounds a lot heavier and fuller you
know so Apple has their uh uncompressed
what oh my gosh off the top McKenzie
they have their yeah they have their own
audio file format that it's not called
Apple play but they gave their own
little clever name to their audio format
people can remind me right we always
have our periscope errs this is just
like when I was talking about exit at
the gift shop oh yeah and I couldn't I
couldn't remember off the top of my head
cuz we're just flowing but out the
beauty of a chat room who knows who
knows if we'll see this but again these
are bread crumbs that are pointing to
maybe Apple really ditching the 30 point
five millimeter headphone jack yeah I
still don't see about this could be
crazy mizzen could be crazy okay and
then finally just a little quick story
facebook for iOS as of today it'll be a
rollout they're gaining support for
iphone 6s live photos so you could post
your live photos through the facebook
app and then people who have their
phones if they hold on to it they'll
actually be able to see that play those
animated photos that's cool it's kind of
neat i'm kind of surprised they didn't
already have this but you know all good
it's cool they finally integrated the
integrated the photos into it so that's
cool ok so really you know it's a short
week it's the holiday season starting up
not too much apple news going on but we
know what's most important to you all
did predictions that's why you came here
predictions for 2016 my people so well
kind of well i guess what kind of what's
get them in the mood a little bit yeah
because you know it's me as V Nostra
Tongass oh man hello where's my
lightning I'd you have your lightning
better yeah I used to have that from
puss out loud so every year we do
predictions we're gonna do it on extra
crunchy because guess what the show is
extra crunchy so I have a general
statement do you have a general
statement for next year or would you
like me to start off you start we'll
just go about how about we just go back
and forth you start and then all of your
mind does we have our bold predictions
but I'm gonna start with a general
statement about 2000 and which I'm gonna
call it 2016 he okay yes so what I feel
like I really feel like 2016 Apple is
going to have a relatively flat year for
Apple I'm going to turn on the music a
little bit oh there's a lightning a
relative I feel like this year they had
a rel know but that's why I'm saying
next year will be even flatter and this
is why okay we were like hoping I was a
ref eternal music sure I'm starting to
get strike it was good for a second and
then I'm like I'm like I thought I would
feel bad for people that have to listen
that the whole time it just right
looking back I can't listen to this
anymore so look this year was supposed
to be really like the biggest year for
Apple they released a new Apple TV they
released a new product platform and
Apple watch they released the ipad pro
they had apple music i'm not gonna talk
about a smart battery case that doesn't
count but these are and also right we
have iphone success with 3d touch okay
yeah these are all props most of those
products were first-timers for Apple
none of them exploded none of them took
over like the public consciousness like
the general consumer and took them by
storm so you're like okay I cuz when I
was ready for 2015 I actually thought it
would be one of the most exciting years
we'd seen from Apple in a long time
really the thing that got me the excited
most was for personal reasons but I know
most people don't care ipad pro and then
3d touch those are the two coolest
things about it but the Apple watch is a
half baked product we've talked about
the apple TV is a half baked product
it's not complete even arguably the ipad
pro is a half baked product not complete
okay yeah so then I like fast forward
into what could be coming into 2016 and
why do I think it might be a flat year
well there's a few make-it-or-break-it
things that are going to happen for
Apple for 2016 and these are what I put
out one Make It or Break It moment 4
2016 will be apples live TV service a
will we see it be how much will it cost
if it costs basically 50 40 50 bucks
just like every other cable service no
one's gonna care there's going to be
nothing different about it no sling
offers an open package starting at 20
bucks a PlayStation view starts a
package at like 50 bucks but again if
Apple is doesn't offer anything
compelling that's it's going to be like
okay fine Apple TV Live service macbook
air 15 inch with
display like an ultra-thin macbook
15-inch that might be arguably the most
exciting product from a hardware cited
for Apple fans but is it going to take
over the world by storm I don't think so
just because it's thinner know right
okay the third one Apple watch to write
the second generation of their Apple
watch they have a lot of work to do when
I think about what they could do adding
Wi-Fi to it making it thinner having the
same maybe has a few extra health
sensors that's not going to blow up so
those three things that should be the
key moments for Apple next year don't
sound very appealing to me and again
they just rolled out like three new
platforms last year so it's not like
we're gonna see a bunch of new toys this
year yeah I I'm not trying to be a
debbie debbie downer i'm just kind of
giving people the real story we know
that the iphone 7 will come out but we
know every year the iphone drives most
of their business so that those numbers
that percentage of whatever it is like
sixty or seventy percent of apples
business is going to be driven by the
iphone that's always going to be the
case even if the iphone 7 is like has
this all-new design it's gonna have 3d
touch it's gonna have a different screen
potentially it might get rid of a
headphone jack it's still going to
produce about the same numbers of what
we seen from past iphone so from an
excitement level I don't think we're
gonna see anything really innovative
from Apple I think it's just that
business as usual and this year was
really supposed to be that year but it
didn't happen I thought this year was
supposed to be the innovative OMG here
but it just didn't happen yeah that's
where I'm at that's why I'm saying I
think apple will have a relatively flat
year in 2016 they're just gonna update
all their toys at the yes and it's
gender big update general updates and
then completing the products that were
kind of half-baked but they've lost a
lot of momentum because of that right
yeah that's where I'm at I don't know
about you guys but that's where I'm at
is Apple losing their mojo I know we've
been saying this for a year but they are
they are losing their mojo I think
they've lost their mojo every year just
a little by little by little and I do
feel like 2016 is going to be the first
year where we really feel like where's
the innovation because
I look around and I see what Microsoft
was doing Microsoft in 2015 was the
innovator of 2015 in my time hollow
hollow lens surface book surface pro
like exam those that's what they're
working with apples like we made a
bigger iPad like you know so and it's
frustrating mean people again I'll i
have mostly apple products i love tech
but if everyone talks about apples
leader of innovation there there I don't
know if they can show me that the leader
of innovation next year they could
surprise us they could what I'm just
saying I think now these days more
people are surprised by new products
what if Apple came out with a VR product
are we gonna be surprised no oculus has
it Samsung Galaxy gear I'm sorry
Samsung's gear VR Microsoft is doing
Hollins like that's not gonna surprise
us yeah Apple car is still roughly 20 20
even if the Apple put out a car people
still Tesla still has that name there
right now Oh Tesla right as its vessel
is like polished and yeah can I mean
that's a product so I don't know I'm
just saying think about it this is not
hey donation this is just let's think
about really what do we have in store
for us next year's like iphone 7 ipad
air three incremental skylake processors
that's important for just processing in
general everyone else is going to have
that Apple music will probably evolved
they might make more money off of Apple
music right or subscribers yeah Apple
will make more money but will they
really truly innovate they're gonna
they're really gonna have to show me
something next year I don't know they're
busy building their fortress in
cupertino so yeah they are and you're
sitting on two hundred billions of
dollars of cash coming out of there but
but but uh did I just like completely
take the air out of you Steven no not at
all i have i have some predictions to
did it were those all your predictions
that's my general i actually have my our
probation going but that's my general
statement for 2016 i see it's kind of
disappointing to me quite honestly quite
this point okay how about i've talked so
much i would like to hear from you we
steve and i both came up with kind of
some predictions of the year right yeah
i wrote 330 cake you wrote a few so you
so i want to hear yours
start with you first and you know you
can okay i know i need i need the no
shirt okay let's say yeah let's get warm
a little bit with our eyes ok so my
number one prediction is that the iphone
7 will get rid of the eighth in the
eighth inch connector as we previously
predicted or others have and the media
is predicted and we will be we all be
sad about it for a short period of time
right well i'll be bummed out but we'll
get over it and then I think that the
iphone 7 will have not one but two
lightning big vectors in the bottom
you're going with a double I think it's
gonna have to so that you know you have
one for your headphone one for charging
and also you can open up options to have
a monitor connected other thing you know
so that is my major bold prediction for
the iphone 7 and 2016 my-my for one of
my predictions is exactly that they will
although I don't want it Apple will get
rid of the headphone jack yes they were
all gonna be sad we're gonna get over it
it's just like when people were sat on
Twitter that they replaced the star for
the heart yes you're gonna get over it
no one talks about that and when the DVD
replaced the VHS tape everyone was
bummed they're like I have all these VHS
tapes what I'm going to do with them ya
know people gonna be sad for like
because also the adapters gonna sell let
you use your headphones yes but this
whole apple lightning and this whole
Apple working a new hire hi res audio
format all these things and apples
planted the seeds long ago with their
made for iphone program or made for AI
program it's going to happen yeah that's
all pointing there and we saw how Apple
was the first to get rid of the floppy
disk right yeah Apple now with their new
ultra thin macbook 12-inch removed all
ports except for a u.s. day I think that
has one USB port it basically like to I
can't remember up Tom and like an audio
port and a single USB port yes and when
like we're almost completely done away
with even having optical drives on
computer I've to right is a bummer yeah
you know I still use this occasionally
no it's true it uh yeah so apples push
some of that let's just get rid of
something people will adjust to us
because we're Apple in it has happened
no how's work pretty decently even the
whole remember when Steve Jobs like so
anti flash yes and people were like mad
about that well we don't really use
flash anymore it's all html5 it's true
well some sites still use flash but I'm
not gonna mention them he's oh he was
also against a stylist we still don't
use the stylus we use a pen and that's
true that should we use a pencil gotta
make sure we got to get that corrected
to pencil so okay that that is I that
was one of my predictions as well cool
though um what how about since we shared
that same one how about your next one
okay so my second prediction let me get
my notes or tongs music back I predict
that Apple release a standalone Apple
watch that does not require the phone
but will require an LTE data contract
and it will do facetime I think that
they'll have facetime built in there but
uh you know that's a very bold one
hopefully Apple fans have been listening
to all of I think his apples been
listening to all its customers you know
and immediately when it came out
everyone's like if its standalone I
might buy it but if it's if I have to
use my phone then it's kind of worthless
to me so I like that I I didn't really
put an apple watch prediction on mine
because I think they're just going to
iterate it I am just gonna I think that
because the battery life on that is
really couldn't handle a 3g connection I
think they're not gonna do it okay I was
disappointed they didn't do it from the
start yes because as everyone was yeah
as everyone was you know there's there's
a several android-based watches that
have their own cellular connection yes
and yeah you have to pay for it but at
least you have the option yeah so I
would like to see the face time though
come on that watch just for just purely
for fun yeah whether you use it or not
the fact that it that's that's one of
the things that Apple used to do they
would have this charming feature on it
that people wouldn't really always use
but the fact that it existed no one else
had it and you could use it kind of made
you use it a little more yeah so I use
face him all the time so it just makes
sense like why not have in the watch so
it's even more convenient you know I
just still can't stand those people that
I've seen walk by me talking into their
wrist pretty embarrassing like it you're
gonna lose major cool points that's all
you're gonna lose cool points total dick
tracy stuff yep ok
here's my here's my hey here's one of my
fun bold predictions Apple is going to
piss off fans and release an apple TV 4k
next year and we'll finally get it's
live TV service but it won't be
different from any of the other carriers
that have locked down the deal so apples
goal of trying to make an exclusive
package that's twenty or thirty dollars
that would truly save consumers money
you have to think about this Apple isn't
in the business for saving consumers
money no so they're not going to be
motivated by that and the network late
networks and content carriers also want
to make money yeah so I think that this
deal that happens that gets done it's
just going to be the standard ala carte
kind of basic passage package pricing
will might be maybe a five dollar
difference instead of a ten or twenty
dollar difference but it won't people
might rave about it because it's on
Apple TV because mainstream media
doesn't talk about sling TV mainstream
media doesn't talk about playstation
view but they'll talk about Apple TV so
to get a lot of publicity yeah but it's
not gonna be any different I do really
think that they'll just do a jerk move
and piss people off and just release a
new Apple TV in here mm-hmm I don't know
why it's happened before yeah it's
happened before right what is that
wasn't that the year you got an ipad has
won six months later later I was like
what I was like all right so that I'm
just we're just this is a prediction
show we're just throwing out stuff out
there it's for fun yeah so that that's
what I that's what I'm that's one of my
brains thinking yeah and uh just so
everyone is aware all you need to do is
go buy an antenna for like 30 40 bucks
yeah then you get all the free
television you want in HD and it looks
awesome it actually looks better it's
all your local rate from the you know
it's straight from the signal so it's
all your local network television
stations when we used to do it in the
old days with the rabbit ear antennas
they have HD antennas at stores i set
one up in my old apartment years ago and
you can get all the networks the basic
networks like the big you know Fox CBS
NBC ABC you know those will be all there
just
antenna and then you can buy these extra
packages for the cable pal plans through
this digital subscription a la carte ish
not truly a la carte but um you can you
can make it happen and save you know you
could save around it's free money but
yeah it's awesome if you love sports
though it's hard that's why I've never
been able to do it that's the thing
sports but Sports is on all the big
networks you know so someone golf
football baseball so yeah you can go
that way if you're down okay do you have
did you have one more yeah let me see my
last prediction I predicted that in 2016
we will see our first glimpse of the
Apple car maybe in a commercial or on a
stage at a keynote just a glimpse tiny
glimpse like they've been hinting at it
this year I think they're gonna like
give us a little little more of a hint
next year um you know cuz like cars and
apps apps and cars is huge right now
it's like the biggest thing right now
our cars are becoming our entertainment
center of us you know like you leave
your your entertainment center at home
and get into an entertainment center and
go wherever you want to go and all the
traveling apps you know navigation stuff
so Apple is way behind and I think that
they're going they have to do something
just to get everyone's attention well
that that leads up to my next prediction
Apple will build their own hoverboard
they will not they will i I'm just I
just made that up that's not why never
Rex is dead so why wouldn't let you know
I saw that someone made a mock-up of an
apple drone and it was full of tons of
people and it look kind of cool it was
like oh my gosh yeah we're making a
dress so crazy look like Apple will I
don't know if it's this coming year I
actually now that we're talking about
that just free-flowing I wouldn't be
surprised if Apple came out with some
not a VR goggles headset or anything
like that but I want to be surprised in
maybe let's say not in 2016 but 2017
once a VR figures itself out I wouldn't
be surprised of apple released some sort
of product that's an accessory to
capture VR video oh yeah for sure
because yeah they're gonna wait for this
whole market to
itself down and figure it out and then
they're gonna add something or their
iphone will have the ability to capture
VR video it's going to be something like
that I have some 360 camera on it so
that you could contribute to the whole
VR movement I would love that I would
totally get an iOS VR camera there's
already products i think it's rico that
makes one that's just like a little
handheld thing that you can hold and
it's literally it and it's like the size
of like a I don't know maybe an old ipod
shuffle from back in the day the white
wine and you just hold and walk around
it captures audio in 360-degree HD video
that's badass it's already out it's like
300 400 bucks or something nice why not
Apple just do something like that and
just do it okay yes by the real quick
yesterday at her secret santa party
Jason stole my gift which is Star Wars
thing right that's right this is inside
baseball guys sorry but uh I had a Star
Wars toy that I got that the secret
santa party and one of my friends stole
her from me and the gift that he had was
um lenses for an iphone yes macro lens
wide angle lens and all that stuff and
I'm loving it yeah it's like totally
stoked he was all bummed out and I'm
like oh my god lunch kit yeah so I mean
if they can build a 3 3d lens or
something that we dope okay um the last
thing my last prediction here nothing
bold but this year was allegedly
supposed to be the year of the
smartphone SmartWatch right yes I think
next year will allegedly be the year of
the mobile wallet I feel like mobile
payments are finally going to be at
least a thing and what I mean by that is
Apple pay has been around a couple of
years ago I've been around a couple
years now Samsung is finally getting
their Samsung pay figured out we are now
at the point where we have enough
point-of-sale displays the business
deals are in place that we're gonna
really start using our phones more like
mobile wallets so I'm just gonna call
next year it's either going to be the
year of VR and VR porn or the mobile
wallet right on i would love to use my
mobile wallet for VR born yeah vr porn
tube ivr porn hahaha
when yeah yeah I'm looking forward to
that I mean I I can't do it now cuz i
have an iphone 5 but oh my yeah okay set
me down we were 27 just wait for the
seven I gotta get on board wait for the
seven probably right now might as well
as wait for the seven how far away is
the seven you think another way sep
tember ish September oh that's a long
way further for the record my mom
finally upgraded from an iphone 4 thanks
to an iphone success this weekend with
us that's five generations of phones
people she might as well been chiseling
with like a hammer in a nail into into
like the walls or something wow so she
was really happy about how does she cook
dinner she rubs sticks together to make
fire we do that uh we've actually
evolved to using magnifying glasses and
a tilting them based on the light to
start a fire that way cool that works as
well nice all right I do you have any
other predictions that's it all right
three that those are those are our kind
of bold / semi-realistic / fun
predictions for the year but now it's
your turn we asked you guys to send your
predictions your calls so I'm going to
hit a few of your calls and kind of
ruminate and see what you guys all
thought as well that we could expect
from Apple 2016 alright let's listen to
some phone calls hey guys it's Michael
calling so now what I think is going to
be introduced like to the Apple world in
2016 as much as I don't want this to
happen and I like the magsafe adapters
for the mat for the macbooks I think
apple is going to start introducing more
USBC cables or the adapters and stuff to
the macbook air line that was rumored to
be coming out like a refresh so that's
my prediction of 2016 and also you did a
great cover of I can't feel my face I
just want to let you know that I love
this show thanks hey we got we got we
got to celebrate when someone gives us
props for a music video yeah we got to
celebrate it it was fun it was super fun
doing that super fun in response the
USBC yeah I mean I think that as USBC is
starting to become a actually used it's
it's been around but now company is
starting to integrate it into their
products I wouldn't be surprised if we
see like a USB see
art you know maybe one but I don't think
we're gonna all sudden see like two or
three or anything like that Apple's
removing ports they're not adding ports
and then Apple still really stuck on
their whole lightning port you know they
they put together that standard and
that's their proprietary cable and all
that blah blah mumbo-jumbo so I don't
think they're gonna get rid of it
anytime soon though no it still feels
new yeah it's still totally feels game
so I don't think so either okay next
call hello this is a line from Houston
Texas and my prediction for next year
for Apple I think that so the next
iPhone I think there they are in the
ditch the 3.5 headphone jack so yeah I
love your show h town and I you see your
lady ace town in the house in the house
represent Houston represent yeah he's on
board with us I think that well maybe
maybe Apple surprised us and they don't
do it until the iphone 7s right maybe
the maybe the iphone 7 is the redesign
and the iphone 7 then removes the k the
headphone port who knows we're just I
don't know they they want to keep they
always keep you just like at least a
change one major thing you know faster
processors for sure okay next call all
right hi I'm Mark Robinson from a smooth
Virginia my tech protection for 2016
Apple would say sorry for sorry podcast
app and put it back the way it was Thank
You Man amen Oh throw the bad apples
sorry i just realized she's listening to
ipad feel my face that's right i just
heard that that's funny i didn't get her
name off the top of my head but i'll get
it back we agree with you ma'am young
lady hi I'm mark Oh Robert Margot Margot
Margot Robinson Margot we're on board
with that she called it the sorry
podcast app this is totally sorry how
about the fact that it's still on the
iPad you can't watch video podcast full
screen
in addition to the fact that is just a
mess I know and that's I mean I pads are
made for consumption of video
practically I can't oh wow I can't I
can't feel my face right now okay last
call all right hey what's going on btz
was going on beach him this is a chamar
from atlanta just wanted to give my
prediction for 2016 i think we talked
about this a little bit as far as Apple
doing a peer-to-peer I think they'll
finally get that situated in 2016 them
probably do it via Apple pay do that a
little fingerprint sensor and everything
so that you can do peer-to-peer payments
I think they'll finally bring back the
bump I don't know if you guys remember
that is where it didn't like a fist bump
and orders share contacts and photos so
but that's my prediction hope you guys
are having a good talk hey Patrick a
chamar bringing the call Apple's paid
app a pure bump bump bump I remember I
remember trying to bump with a lot of
girls but rejected every time I think I
used that bump thing one time to send a
picture or something to my used a bump I
think I used a bump for a skit like a
skit and then we got rid of and then I
never used again yeah was like it had
its moment it was it was silly oh and
then I realized quickly i'm like why do
i have to be next to someone and touch
someone to send them something yeah so
ridiculous it is it is silly but um
doing their whole Apple launching out
that peer-to-peer payment yes like kind
of piggybacking on the fact that I think
that 2016 will be the year of the mobile
wallet mobile payment thingamajigger I
think we're gonna get there I think
we're gonna get there yeah I hope so
it's just so much better so mm-hmm
