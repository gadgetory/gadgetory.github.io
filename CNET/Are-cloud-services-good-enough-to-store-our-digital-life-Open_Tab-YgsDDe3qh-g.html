services and stuff like that out do you
so we talked a little bit about steam is
there any service you use that's heavily
cloud-based that you can't live without
besides netflix minutes right the
obvious one yeah besides that one well
drop box I mean that's use Dropbox yeah
I don't he does i guess i'm a big drop
box i was looking at you yeah i don't
use it but i know a lot of people who do
use made it sort of my it's sort of my
nice fail-safes you pay for it no i
don't i mean it's free i mean i believe
how much do they give you for free uh
not for me to store all my red docket
gotcha right you can't store media files
but movies or photos but I mean that's a
writer tits like invaluable to have
that's right all right I don't hear
anything I only read them no no but it's
a great place to secure your file
somewhere else right are you working on
a novel or so yes they are we all right
right I don't have a book deal come on
yeah no everyone really we all y'all had
book deals mom not me yeah you're behind
the curve okay oh okay what about you
been I got I got this that's all you
need that's the only cloud you need me
right in the cloud so speaking of which
what is your sort of end all cloud
service thing like for me Google Docs is
a huge part of my course work like
you're in my personal life yeah is are
you guys attached by the hip with that
now well yeah I use Google Docs
constantly you know that's that's
definitely helpful I've started looking
into this service through amazon if
you're a prime member you can download
you can put in the cloud an unlimited
number of photos Chris yes yes so I
actually try to take photos yeah google
for is the problems i can do amazon
because i don't know okay I'm calm do
they compress the files I don't know
that isn't it what not but the Google
compression is not it's not terrible
it's like this thing is like eight
megapixels like it's yeah yeah this SLR
quality photos yeah president yeah yeah
needless to say when I tried to take
apparently I have 17,000 photos that I
have stored on my
a laptop can I tried to move them onto
the cloud and my computer basically we
just like I don't feel like it come here
like hey st. happen yes like yeah look
look I'm the mid-2010 model you think
I'm working that hard I'm not gonna do I
got simulated I got a four more weeks on
the clock and I get my message i was
great i throw me in a dumpster yeah you
know I'm gonna get recycled so it didn't
work so i really like this idea of
backing up my look yes me yeah the
question so it didn't work did you befo
toes I could try to use google photos
but I feel like it's gonna take up all
over every like 10 days to upload all my
photos leave them in batches no I just
had running pretend a stray wow you got
to set it up for like at least the
weekend and you get unlimited with me
okay are you in it's ready so you'll be
telling add bits up for your photos but
whatever its yeah yeah yeah cuz at this
point in my life I got baby pics I got
you know all sorts of immortals food
photos so you need already food guess
what coupon we're sending you will you
believe me be very we'd be very upset if
we lost the photos is a very important
course so I'm not gonna lose it you
don't your life photos no I'm saying
that I want to store them in the clouds
I want to have that backup so there was
a cloud phone that you saw yes the next
next bit Robin what the what is that
next bit Robin is this crazy phone it
was a Kickstarter progress okay start
off as a as this kind of crowd-sourced
thing it uses the cloud for storage so
it's got about like 32 gigs I might be
correct I'm gonna be wrong about 32 16
32 gig on a heart or hardware so Boko
itself yeah yeah but once you exceed
that point it starts to offload stuff
and automatically offloads apps photos
things that it knows that you don't
actually use that often your sap in the
cloud is a little suspect it's very
interesting because they they've
offloaded like I saw them offload
Spotify right and then as soon as you
it's or it gets great out on the phone
you tap on it and sort of redownload
really quickly all the settings are
saved everything is logged in you don't
have like re-login anything it's as if
you never really deleted it so what does
it run
runs on android and they've worked their
technology so the reason why next we got
a bunch of hype was because the the key
founders are all part of the original
android teams so they know Andrew they
like they have the institutional
knowledge of Android so they know how to
kind of work the operating system and
really maximize its potential and they
they kind of use this cloud architecture
as the big selling point so how's it
doing idea it's not it's not how it's a
it's about a year old at this point you
know it came in to Kickstarter it was
got ton of height people really pretty
fun too and it is a really nice and nice
looking okay I mean I think it's done
well for what it was but it's a very
niche product I mean there's going after
people who are like super super hardcore
about Android because this is like
basically a pure Android experience with
cloud that it's you know it's a it's
done okay for what it is but it Roger it
is totally on each product I'm not a
face are you getting on the cloud I look
at Arizona on their class almost care
about i think a lot as a lot more than
you can cram onto me it's a huge mass
space it wasn't okay well a full
terabyte it was a massive amount of
space that's still that at least
justifies the concept of the product
right well if you're gonna get like 200
bunny because the ethics gets a reviewer
try to like I was you know talking to
Jessica review the problem it's tough to
review a phone that like you've got to
like intentionally crammed up yeah
you're like confuse it and like put it
through its BS so it's I mean it's and
it works okay but the thing of it is is
especially if you've got like 32 gigs of
storage it's hard for you to fill up
that stores yeah really like after her
like a one month or even like a two-week
review period so that sounds like one of
those weird bridge products where it's
like yeah this makes sense but like
we're just not totally I mean I do think
that that's sort of where things are
going I think phones eventually will
start for sure cloud like as a default
but we're our network connections aren't
there yet right you know if you're
outside your connection spotty and you
like you need to download that crucial
app that's in the cloud somewhere and
it's like busy signal yes it's you're
gonna be pissed right you're gonna be
upset you're gonna do that how is
Apple's supposed to price gouge us right
how's that gonna work you know like you
got to think about that first
I don't know they can they could do the
same thing there I think I guess yours
like a charge of this huge project
twenty dollars a pop for the privilege
of our cloud services they're fine yes
