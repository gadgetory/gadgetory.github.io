surprise because Apple actually met
expectations a lot of the times they've
had a blowout but then kind of more
recently they missed particularly
because analysts kind of up these
estimates so this is kind of the first
time that Apple's provided something
that's a little bit lower and a little
bit more conservative and it actually
worked out really well for them for
today's earnings this is really kind of
a show that Apple still is selling a lot
of products they've made all new records
for iPhones and all new records for
iPads actually surprised on both those
numbers which blew some of Wall Street's
numbers away the the point really turns
out of the future and what Apple is
doing next and Tim Cook today's Apple
CEO really provided this vision that
they're not really going to have
anything till the fall and have a really
good 2014 but that leaves a lot of
questions between now and then there
were a lot of questions today about what
Apple is doing next the company is
totally cagey about it of course there
were questions about bigger iPhones new
products like a watch or a television
they kind of dodge around that by saying
we don't have anything to tell you but
we have some really great stuff in the
pipeline it's really been there kind of
go to way of saying we can't tell you
what's happening but they seem really
bullish about what's coming up next of
course when that is we don't really know
the big news that come out of today's
earnings is really what they expect for
the next quarter which isn't great their
their estimate was pretty far below what
analysts were expecting a big part of
that is their margin that's how much
they make on each of their products that
is considerably lower than what people
thought it would be so that combined
with revenue it's they're just not
making as much as they used to based on
the fact that products are more
expensive along with the earnings
announcement apple also announced a
repurchase plan that was a little bit
higher than what they had before in fact
55 billion dollars higher along with the
dividend that was fifteen percent this
is really something they can do to
potentially raise the stock price but
also make people happy with the stock
which has been going down and value
