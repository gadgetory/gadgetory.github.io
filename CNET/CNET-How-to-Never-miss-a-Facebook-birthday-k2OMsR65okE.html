us acutely aware of everyone's birthday
login and you'll see birthday alerts
right here at the top but what if heaven
forbid you go a day or two without
checking Facebook your bffs birthday
could come and go and then you're the
one stuck writing a belated wall post a
week later don't let this happen to you
assuming that you have some kind of
calendar software out there like google
calendar or ical you can import all of
your birthday's from your facebook
friends in less than a minute first step
login to your facebook account and
select events from the left sidebar then
the drop down menu to select birthdays
you'll now see a listing of all your
friends who have one coming up use that
same drop-down menu and select export
birthdays the link you'll see is a web
hosted calendar file so we'll always
stay up to date with your latest friends
copy that link and then head into your
preferred calendar app I'm going to use
Google Calendar down here on the Left
I'll go to other calendars pull down the
list and select add by URL well paste in
the URL facebook gave us and leave the
public sharing option down here
unchecked click here to add it and now
you'll see your friends birthdays all
plotted out on your calendar but to get
that same info on your phone you'll need
to dive into your phone's calendar
settings and make sure that the box for
friends birthdays is enabled now if you
visually check your calendar every day
this might be enough but I'm going to
take a few extra steps to make sure i'm
also notified over email in Google
Calendar I'll hover over the birthday
calendar i just added and click the
little options list here to select
notifications this is going to show me
all the ways google can notify me about
the events on this calendar if i'm
really crazy about this stuff i could
set up an event reminder here at the top
to email me about upcoming birthday is a
few days ahead of time but since i'm
kind of a jerk and I'm probably not
buying anyone a present I'll just check
this option here at the bottom to send
me a daily digest of each day's events
then I'll hit save now when you check
your inbox every morning you'll see any
birthdays for that day if you're not
using google calendar you can still get
reminders from facebook itself go into
your facebook account settings and click
on notification
in the left bar hit edit on your
facebook notifications and then check
the box for has a birthday coming up if
this option is grayed out you may need
to uncheck a box at the top that limits
email frequency now you can look forward
to a weekly email from Facebook to help
you remember those important dates so
there you go now no birthday will escape
