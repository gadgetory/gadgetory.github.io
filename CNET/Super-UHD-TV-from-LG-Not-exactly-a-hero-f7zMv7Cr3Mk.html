hundred it's a 55 inch LCD TV from LG
the smallest size in a series of TVs LG
is calling super UHD in our review
however it wasn't so super the best
things about the you H 8500 series are
its design and feature set as you can
see it has a very sleek look with a
sweet curved stand metallic finish and
even a distinctive white backside I'm
also a fan of LG's motion remote instead
of clicking around on the screen to
activate different selections you can
move a little cursor much more quickly
by waving the remote itself just like a
Nintendo Wii controller the menu system
is more responsive than last year and
makes full use of that motion control
although it's not as intuitive as some
I've tested
LG's selection of streaming apps is also
narrower than some other systems but it
does offer three with high dynamic range
aka HDR Netflix Amazon and Vudu HDR can
look even better than 4k video and
unlike Sony and Samsung TVs LG supports
both HDR 10 and Dolby vision formats
providing the widest selection of HDR
movies and TV shows this is also one of
the few TVs you can buy these days that
works with 3d and it comes with two
pairs of passive 3d glasses the exact
same kind used in movie theaters so far
so good but the most important part
image quality the uh85 hundred falls
short of competitors from Samsung and
Vizio it produced a lighter shade of
black and with more blooming or stray
light so overall contrast and punch was
worse whether watching standard or HDR
video color and bright room performance
were very good but not good enough to
best the competition and if you're
considering the 55 inch version of this
set you should know that LG's cheapest
OLED model also a 55 inch share cost
pretty much the same and as an image
that leaves the so-called super UHD TV
in the dust I'm David Katz my recei net
