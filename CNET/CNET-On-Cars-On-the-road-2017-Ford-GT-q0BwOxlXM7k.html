technology in the auto industry all the
time but for most car buyers
it doesn't really print but what
lightweight is all about is everything
that a vehicle is all about better
performance better fuel efficiency which
leads to lower emissions and better
handling dynamics in every direction the
vehicle goes
committed to this ethnic is the coming
Ford GT 600 plus horsepower from a turbo
v6 mounted in the middle on an aluminum
subframe behind a carbon fiber centered
tub driving the rear wheels to be honest
that architecture has been done before
and you can buy a 700 horsepower Dodge
Challenger for 60 grand
so what's really going on here it's how
the new GT will seek performance by
burdening itself less lighter weight and
less envelope the vehicle's physical
outline it's the essential story of this
car now Raj this is such a big effort
got a car with incredible performance
but it's got less weight less bulk right
so high performance you know now is a
lot about efficiencies if you look at
our latest f-150 all aluminum body we
took more than 700 pounds out of that
vehicle and there all the attributes get
better when you take weight out improve
your fuel efficiency we can soften up
the suspension the ride gets better so
it all feeds on itself some of the parts
we're seeing that you're also displaying
here have a lot of carbon reinforced
plastics things that were exotic and
used in small volumes you're seeing this
is a high-volume technique to make a lot
of parts in affordable cars well we can
use performance vehicles to prove out
some technologies and then bring it to
high volume iterate the designs take
those learnings and bring it to
high-volume mainstream manufacturing so
what used to be went on Sunday sell on
Monday is now lightweight on Sunday
absolutely for the engineer it's it's
win on Sunday and then take that and
mainstream on Monday
how important is it to use carbon-fiber
versus aluminum carbon fibers lighter
and it's strong and as a designer what
it does is give me greater flexibility
to create unique forms that I can't
create in steel and aluminium one of
these flying buttresses are one that you
point out why couldn't you have made
those flying buttresses out of aluminum
we hear that all the time we couldn't
have done that in the metal steel or
aluminium needs to be pressed it needs
to have you need to have a die and it's
press then you have maximum draw depth
and then you have radiuses which which
are really restricting based on your
maximum depth of draw it would tear or
be too thick there will be too thin I
wouldn't get the draw depth between
between this point and this point yeah
in a tool one of the first things you
notice is you come back like so is this
thing it's real narrow real fast in fact
you could reach across and touch the
other glass it's three key factors in
creating the ultimate performance call
one is lightweight second is
aerodynamics it has a really really
tapered cabin it's really narrow at the
cabin and it allows us also to manage
the air flow much better than on a
traditional full volume car this
tapering here helps the wind to see less
car yes as it's coming yes we would
normally think the face is kind of where
it all red so a normal car you would
fill out this volume that you'd ever
because this would be here but imagine
how much that's a foot that's yeah on
each time which I'm not pushing through
the air we're managing the air flow to
direct it straight on to the arrow
devices like the rear which is it and we
hear so much about lightweight of
products but it's also like footprint
the rage in supercars these days has
been hybrid Porsches 918 is laferrari in
the McLaren p1 but to stay light and
lean Ford skip the added motor big
battery in the inverter that would have
meant weight and volume to put somewhere
less under the skin means less skin to
move through the air main reasons we
chose this engine is it is compact it's
one of our you know mainstream engines
yes it's got a little bit you know few
of the components a little bit more
exotic a little more at the foundations
of this car are the same that's in your
f-150 and it allows us to shrink wrap
all this body around this engine it also
produces high power over 600 horsepower
from this engine it's also fuel
efficient if we didn't need the extra 2
cylinders why did why do we need to put
them on if they added weight and they
added the fuel consumption yeah as I
look at it here I see these buttresses
come back and they seem to almost be
supporting these these pods over the
rear wheels what's in there is an
intercooler there's a vent it's a grill
on the front grille is it's an
intercooler and radiator the air feeds
through the butchers so it's not just
that
so that's your bleed off to go in easy
and 1/2 feet since that's your intake
run yes so we exhaust the air through
the middle of the Lambs
these engineering ideas created great
aesthetic design ideas you know it's a
it's a beautiful looking thing yeah
right but it's also clever and
innovative and in it and that balance
between looking amazing but also
delivering a clever solution is what
this car is all about
now lightweight technologies do have
some hurdles they tend to be exotic in
terms of rapid workflow and production
they tend to be more expensive right now
as we've heard about some of the carbon
fiber technologies and let's face it the
auto industry is one that is known for
inertia doing things the way it's done
things although that's changing quite a
bit lately
still the GTS wholesale light weighting
approach is a leading-edge look at what
is and will increasingly happen to
mainstream cars light weighting is no
longer optional or limited to cars in
the stratosphere like this it makes
every motion a car accomplishes better
and does it with less energy for cars
