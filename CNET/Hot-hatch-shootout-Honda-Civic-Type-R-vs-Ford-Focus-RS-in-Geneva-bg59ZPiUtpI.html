Geneva Motor Show we're seeing plenty of
high-end sports cars introduced from
Ferrari and the Bugatti and lots of
other expensive machines like that but
we've also seen the introduction of two
more attainable sports cars two very hot
hatches and this in my opinion is the
hottest this is the Ford Focus RS and
unlike previous fast focuses this one is
coming to the US it has a 2.3 liter
four-cylinder turbocharged engine that
puts down 315 horsepower - not just the
front wheels
but all four wheels yes this car has got
four wheel drive first for the focus in
the US and it's got styling that is
pretty extreme to say the least
ken Block famous for all of his Gymkhana
videos helped with the engineering on
this car and it's actually got a drift
button yes you hit a button on the
dashboard it retune is the ECU and the
driving dynamics of the car to help you
get the tail out maybe not quite as much
as ken Block does but a little bit more
than it would normally allow it's a
great looking car in my opinion and it
is the hottest of the hot hatches here
in the show floor but I think Antoine
feels a little bit differently
right Tim I'm standing next to the Honda
Civic type-r yes it looks like a boy
racers wet dream but there is a function
to all of this crazy form those wild
fenders they let them get thicker rubber
underneath there so there's better grip
the crazy aerodynamics are actually
creating downforce and underneath the
hood the new type r is powered for the
first time by a turbocharged 2-liter
VTEC engine gonna put out about 306
horsepower in about 295 pound-feet of
torque Honda claimed that this is the
fastest front-wheel drive hot hatchback
of all time and it's backed that claim
up with a Nurburgring time of 7 minutes
and 50 seconds another first for this
generation of Type R is the new adaptive
suspension drivers can actually set
different modes for whether they want to
be soft on the street or hard on the
track I'm guessing all those modes a
pretty hardcore and then there the big
red R plus button that lets you just hit
one button and go to the most hardcore
track mode for all of the systems
all right it's one I know all the vents
and the frills and the flared fenders
are functional but I got to say this is
one ugly car
yeah but form overt weight function over
form that's probably going with that
maybe so but this wing this wing makes
the backend of an FC I looks today's by
comparison I'll agree to disagree with
you there two inches own personally I'm
a huge fan of huge Aero all right let's
talk numbers how much horsepower here
306 horsepower 295 pound-feet of torque
got 315 horsepower on the focus and
four-wheel drive here yeah front wheel
drive here manual transmission only
all-wheel drive on the focus so I don't
know that's stacking up pretty good in
my account yeah yeah yeah but I mean I
think that the Civic is gonna be a much
more hardcore car I think for Honda kind
of came from a track standpoint and then
tried to make it's treatable as opposed
to taking a more I guess a well-rounded
approach well you know they've got a ken
block and a drifter button on the focus
too and I don't see a drift button and
the interior this time we've got our
plus button and everyone knows the best
way around get around the track is
keeping all the four tires done all
right let's talk money Honda they've
give us a price here it's just under
40,000 francs I think so that's what we
write when you factor for the conversion
rates in the different market that's
about what you get before it hasn't told
us what the RIC is going to cost you an
unfortunately but I'm guessing it's
going to come in a little north of the
STI so probably you know right into
thirty five forty thousand dollar mark
somewhere in there it's not a bit more
attainable there now given the choice
you take this guy well for our purposes
it's I'll make this concession the Ford
who probably comes to the North American
market but this thing will never see the
states so this may be in my opinion the
hotheads back on the planet but it's
also the most unattainable
well the Focus RS is definitely coming
to the u.s. for dad said so in my
opinion to clear win but definitely let
us know what you think in the comments
we're eager to hear what you think is
the hottest hatch of them all your
