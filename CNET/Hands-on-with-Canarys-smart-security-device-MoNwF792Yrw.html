first take of canary this is the
all-in-one security device that did very
well on IndieGoGo back in the summer of
2013 and now in January of 2015 it's
finally shipping out to backers
including the two units you see here
that we got at CNN appliances HQ now
canary you can be armed it can be
disarmed you can put it in a privacy
mode that turns off the camera and the
microphone
it also has temperature and humidity
sensors and air quality sensors that
we'll watch for the general conditions
around the home it doesn't have any sort
of home automation capabilities so it
doesn't have a z-wave radio or ZigBee
radio it can't communicate with
third-party devices like smart locks and
smart lights and integrate them into
your system the way that a device like
Piper can and that's kind of a
shortcoming in my opinion I think that
smart lighting especially is a really
good thing to add to a smart security
kit you have someone trying to get in at
night or the motion sensor picking
something up you want to light to come
on that's a really good deterrent you
can't do that with canary at least not
yet
also you have to update your canary with
the latest firmware as you set it up
with your system and that was a real
tough process we had to do that several
times over the course of about two days
before we finally got it updated and up
to speed and able to work once it was I
tried it out in my apartment and the
general functionality of the system
worked but the camera feed was not
really viewable you can watch about 30
seconds of black and then maybe two
seconds of live video and then back to
black it was a bit of a pain was until
we brought it back to work and tried it
again here at the office that we got
that live video feed up and running now
one last complaint that I have about
canary is setup in its current state is
that it doesn't let you set it to
automatically trigger the siren so right
now it's an armed mode that's this green
light at the bottom that means that it
should send me an alert whenever the
text motion it should give me the option
to call the police if I need to but it
won't do any of that itself it won't
even sound the siren on its own so if
someone's breaking in in the middle of
the night I'll get a notification on my
phone saying there's activity but that
siren won't go off canary says that
they're gonna change that they're gonna
add a feature for auto siren mode but
that's not ready right now
now canary is currently shipping out to
backers and pre-orders from last year
and should arrive in retail outlets like
Best Buy and Target by this spring and
at that point those new features should
be baked
and the system should be a little better
developed that Android app should also
be out so at that time before it goes
live to retail we're gonna have a full
review up but for now we're gonna give
it a few more weeks at least to see how
it develops thanks for watching be sure
