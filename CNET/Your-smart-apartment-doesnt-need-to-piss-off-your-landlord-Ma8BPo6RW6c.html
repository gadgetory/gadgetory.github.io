interesting over the past couple of
years but what if you don't actually own
your home if you rent an apartment like
this one you don't want to piss your
landlord off you don't want to lose your
security deposit and that means that
switching out your light switches your
thermostats your door locks might not be
an option fortunately there are still a
ton of ways for renters to take
advantage of smart home tech you just
have to know what gadgets to get and I'm
here in the C net smart apartment to
show you how to do it
it used to be that home automation meant
wiring things like lights and HVAC
systems to a central computer interface
but these days you can just control
everything from your phone that's paved
the way for all sorts of plug-and-play
smart home gadgets that you can use
right out of the box one of my favorites
for beginners is this Belkin Wemo switch
just plug it in and plug something else
in behind it a lamp for instance and
then you can use the Wemo app to
automate when you want it to turn on and
off the cost just 35 bucks automating
something like this cheap space heater
can be a good solution if your landlord
won't let you upgrade to a smart
thermostat just make sure you get one
that has physical controls like this you
want to be able to have the thing come
on right to the settings you want
without any extra input from you because
a smart switch is basically just like
unplugging it and plugging it back in
these controls can help the
plug-and-play approach isn't just for
plugs smart bulbs are also an easy
renter friendly upgrade just keep in
mind that some of them will require you
to plug a hub into your router to
translate their signal for your home
network and be sure to shop around
because your options are more diverse
than ever at this point everything from
lights that work with Syrian Alexa to
color-changing bulbs like this one and
even bulbs with built-in battery packs
like this beyond bulb that'll keep
shining even in the event of a power
outage
one last thing I'm a big big fan of how
smart home tech can help you keep your
living space secure it used to be that
your only home security options were
expensive systems that require lengthy
contracts and professional installation
but nowadays you'll find tons of DIY
options that you can install yourself
including cameras like canary and the
Piper NV here thanks to smart home tech
more people that never now have access
to home security that makes sense for
their living space and for their budget
that includes renters for more tips
tricks and renter friendly smart home
