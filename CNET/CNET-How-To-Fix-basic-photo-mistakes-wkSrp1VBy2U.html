are going to be times when you make
mistakes with your photography
especially when you're starting out here
are the top three mistakes the beginners
make and how to fix them first up is
getting your horizon crooked this is a
very easy fix in your smartphone all you
need to do is turn on at the grid
overlay option before you take the photo
for iPhone head to settings then photos
and camera and toggle the grid switch on
Android it's pretty similar but
depending on your phone you'll need to
go into the settings menu and turn on
the grid icon if you have a DSLR though
it is a similar process you can either
turn on the grid lines or if your DSLR
has it a virtual horizon options so you
can have an overlay of the horizon in
real time when you're using live view
otherwise if you want to do it in
post-processing simply open up your
favorite app and then tilt the canvas
until everything is straight the second
mistake that a lot of photographers make
when they're first starting out is the
photos appear either too bright or too
dark this is because sometimes your
camera meter can't read the light like
your icon and either under or over
exposes for the situation now
fortunately there is a really easy fix
all you have to do is look for the
exposure compensation slider in your
phone app on iphone all you need to do
is press and hold the screen a box will
come up and then toggle the slider up
and down on Android just simply look for
the exposure slider and change the value
to either a positive one if you want to
make the photo brighter or to a negative
one if you want to make it darker on a
DSLR the same principle applies just
look for the exposure compensation
button and to make your adjustments
mistake number three is white balance do
your photos sometimes have weird color
casts then your white balance is
probably wrong fortunately it's a really
simple fix in your phone's camera app
all you need to do is look for a white
balance option and then set it to a more
appropriate value or alternatively if
you have a DSLR you can actually take a
student white balance reading all you
need for this is to grab a white card or
a gray card take a photo of it in the
same lighting condition as your subject
and then look for a custom white balance
option in your DSLR menu select that
photo of the white card that you took
and then you'll have the correct white
balance for the situation or of course
you can always change the white balance
in post-production those are some simple
solutions for problems that beginner
photographers often make if you want to
