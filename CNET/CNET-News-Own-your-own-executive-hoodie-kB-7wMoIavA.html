multi-billion dollar high-tech empire
doesn't mean you can't look like one
take Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg who is
getting just as much attention for his
sense of style as he is for his
company's IPO he's not just gigantically
successful he's never looked anything
other than a kid an online clothing
retailer beta brand.com is aiming to
stay ahead of the less than the versace
asked zuckerberg couture he's the Mount
Everest of hoodie where's founder chris
linn lane' is capitalizing big time on
zuckerberg flair for casual wear that's
how the executive hoodie was born we
made for our standards a very large
first batch of these things that got
snapped up in 24 hours so right now
everything but that people are buying on
the site currently exists in a giant
roll of fabric that's right for a
hundred and forty-eight dollars a pop
you can relax in the boardroom or the
bedroom without a wardrobe change so
we'll call it the law of unintended
consequences for this brand new
burgeoning fashion com who is no longer
held to the traditional laws of the
fashionable in fact this company is
coming up with one or two new designs
and releasing them every single week
we're talking disco pants seersucker
shorts and red devil smoking jackets but
for now the hoodie reigns until the next
big trend and my money's on the dress
pants sweatpants in San Francisco
