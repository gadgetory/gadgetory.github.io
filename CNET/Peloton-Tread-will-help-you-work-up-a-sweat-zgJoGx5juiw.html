behind the smart spin bikes want to
completely revolutionize your workout
routine with their new peloton tread
this is a three thousand nine hundred
and ninety five dollar smart treadmill
so guys I know that sounds super pricey
but this thing actually has a lot of
cool integrated tech that I guess could
make it worth it so there is a thirty
nine dollar monthly subscription service
and you get access to all of these
workouts so you don't have to go to a
gym basically peloton is saying instead
of going to the gym and paying for a
crappy workout stay in your house and
use some of our specialized instructors
who are right here on the screen telling
you exactly what to do but the kicker is
that it's not just training you how to
run better they also have additional
workouts so you can do a weightlifting
workout you can do a yoga routine you
can do all these other types of routines
in addition to the treadmill to spin
bike some of the devices they actually
sell so there are ultimate goal I think
is to become sort of part of your whole
home workout fitness exercise routine
and it's also super super easy to use
which is something that I haven't always
encountered when trying to work out in a
gym the dials are really easy and the
workout routines are also customizable
so you can go from
something simple on up to something
advanced so this device again will cost
three thousand nine hundred and ninety
five dollars the subscription is $39 a
month but you do get access to all of
those cool features when it becomes
available in the third quarter of this
year</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
