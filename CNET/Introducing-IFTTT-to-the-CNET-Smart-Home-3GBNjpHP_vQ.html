here in the scene that smart home but
not all of them work together that's
where a service like EFT comes in handy
it's a free online tool that lets you
automate pairs of web services or social
networks or smart home devices there's a
growing number of these devices that
work with ifs and let you craft recipes
using the if this then that formula if
you apply that to the smart home you can
get your gadgets to start working out
one good example here is the set of Wemo
switches in the wall these are great
smart switches for automating lights in
your home but if you hook them up with
IFFT you can use them to control other
smartphone gadgets as well for instance
by long press on this switch here you'll
see the light flashes and then the nest
thermostat upstairs will go to 68 that's
a nice way to maybe set the thermostat
as you walk out the door as you walk in
another IFFT integration that we've
tried out here that I'm a fan of is what
if it does for Amazon echo that's a
voice-activated smart speaker that could
control a lot of smart home devices
voice commands but it doesn't work with
the nest thermostat again if can make
the nest thermostat smarter by bringing
echo into the picture you make a recipe
that says whenever I say Alexa set the
thermostat that's 68 the thermostat goes
to 68 and there you go you've got a
voice-activated thermostat the real
question of all of this though is can
use IFFT in place of a system like wink
or smart things to kind of control all
of your smart home devices in one
ecosystem I think you can if you're very
picky about which devices you go all in
all I think if does a great way to
introduce yourself to the concept of
automation once you get the hang of that
sort of if this then that formula you
can start to see how it might apply into
your smart</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
