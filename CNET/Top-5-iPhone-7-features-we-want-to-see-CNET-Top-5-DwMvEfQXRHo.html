want to see at number 5 the headphone
jack yeah this is an odd one all the
iphones ever made have included a
headphone jack there are rumors that the
heck phone jack will disappear from the
next iphone don't do it Apple don't do
it at number for a smarter Siri Siri is
being outclassed by amazon Alexa and
Google now Apple needs his personal
assistant to get better the iphone 7
could include either more processing
power or maybe more microphones so Syria
can figure out what you're saying Siri
needs to get as proactive as Google now
with information you want and need at
the right time at number 3 less bezel
more screen yeah we know that touch ID
on the home button is awesome and that's
been used as an excuse to keep that big
bezel on the iPhone but there's got to
be a better way right a lot of other
phone makers have fit large screens in
smaller bodies at number 2 toughness
i'll be honest i seriously doubt apple
will toughen up his next iphone and we'd
love to see that make the iphone 7
waterproof and while you're at it make
that thing shatterproof the iphone is a
beautiful device would be really nice
not to need a case we asked you on
twitter what features you wanted to see
in the iphone 7 Mike thinks the iphone 7
to use a file system Samuel and smay
both sent an awesome lists and both want
to see us bc arrive on the next iPhone
thanks for the input guys and at number
one longer battery life Apple is
obsessed with making everything thinner
and lighter however we are obsessed with
our phones so we need more battery life
Apple knows we want more battery it
introduced its own battery case for the
iphone 6s how about more battery in the
phone instead of outside of the phone
make it happen Apple big fake 16 net
