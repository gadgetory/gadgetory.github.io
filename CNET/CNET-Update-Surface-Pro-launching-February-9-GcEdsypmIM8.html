converting to Apple I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your cnet update Microsoft
has finally released the launch date of
the surface pro the full Windows 8
tablet is heading to stores in the US
and canada in two weeks on februari 9th
unlike the surface RT tablet this model
can run any Windows program a few new
surface accessories are launching
alongside the pro including some limited
edition edge design touch keyboard
covers which cost 120 dollars each and a
surface optimized version of the wedge
Touch Mouse for seventy dollars the
surface pro starts at nine hundred bucks
it doesn't include the keyboard cover
you see in advertisements but it does
come with a pen stylus worldwide android
phones are the top selling smartphones
but in the US the iphone is still king a
new research report out says Apple has
51 percent of the u.s. smartphone market
and there are more people who are
converting from android to iphone in the
past year thirty-six percent of people
who bought an iPhone were converting
from Android but if you look at the
other side only nineteen percent of
android owners converted from apple and
the report says verizon subscribers have
the most people jumping the android ship
for iphone verizon also shed light on
its iphone sales in its recent financial
statement almost two-thirds of the smart
phones verizon sold during the holiday
season more iphones but only half of
those were the new iphone 5 so half of
these iphone customers thought it was
just as good to have a cheaper older
model to save money or perhaps it could
indicate that the iphone 5 was in short
supply several tech companies are
releasing their financial statements
this week and Apple will share its sales
numbers Wednesday afternoon and 80
announced it is spending 780 million
dollars to buy up the US carrier I'll
tell which operates in six states if
approved by regulators it would give ATT
more wireless spectrum to expand its 4G
LTE network the launch of Facebook's
graph search has folks more paranoid
about how their profile appears on
Facebook since now it's easier to
uncover old posts or pages you like that
don't show you in the best light so if
you're someone who may have questionable
material on Facebook that can make you
look bad check out the web application
called face wash you give the app access
to look into your account and it scans
all comments photos captions links
status updates and group pages that
you're associated with and I'll let you
know if they have any bad words tied to
them it even shows you the junk your
friends posted on your wall to help you
tidy up your online image that's your
tech news update for more details on
