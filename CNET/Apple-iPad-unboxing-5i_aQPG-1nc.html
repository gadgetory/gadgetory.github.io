this is your unboxing of the much
anticipated Apple iPad this is the Wi-Fi
only version so let's go ahead and take
it out of the box it comes with this
protective case there's a lot of
fingerprints online so it looks like
someone has been playing with it but it
still does have the plastic on it okay
let's take this plastic off and it's
very shiny and new so they say it weighs
one and a half pounds and the screen is
nine point seven inches diagonally from
here to here so let's go ahead and put
that down and see what else comes with
it so we've got a standard iPod charger
USB port and the AC power adapter okay
in this envelope if you have some
information about our iPad how to turn
it off what the different buttons are
just a little quick how-to card and then
the information guide and some Apple
stickers under year it's not quite so
easy to get under actually there's
nothing under here so all of this is
kind of empty space which is unusual for
an Apple product well let's turn it on
for the first time in see how it works
let's go ahead and slide to unlock so we
push the power button at the bottom and
slide it just like an iPod Touch or an
iPhone the home screen has the standard
operating system applications that we
expect such as calendar and contacts
YouTube videos it also has I work
applications that have been optimized
for iPad such as keynote and pages and
the iBook store which is new to Apple so
this is the place where we're going to
be able to find all of our books in a
library just like this you tap one to
open it and then you can just drag the
pastries across and drag them right back
which is very nice on the side you can
see there's a screen rotation lock on
the top so if you don't want it to
change
tation from landscape to portrait you
can lock that and then these buttons
here are volume up and down so first
impression is that it looks exactly like
it's supposed to it's very elegant and
responsive and basically like an iPod
Touch or an iPhone we've also got some
peripherals so let's take a look at
those the iPad doesn't come with these
peripherals that we have them here
anyway in case you want them we have a
case a dock and a USB power adapter so
let's open up this case and see what it
looks like this is Apple's version
although we already know that there will
be third-party at versions of the iPad
case we'll take it out of the plastic
and try it on for size so there we go
with the case on let's go ahead and
stand it up this dock also comes
separate this is for sitting your iPad
down on a desk the iPad does come with a
power adapter but if you need a longer
cord you can always buy this as a 10
watt USB power adapter so it's got a
longer cord it's gonna be for you to sit
it down on the floor or something and
string this power to your couch from
your wall outlet or something like that
so when you buy an iPad you get
basically the iPad the manuals the
charger and the power adapter you do not
get this case this is extra but it's
very nice case if you don't like it you
can always buy third party cases if you
want a dock that also is extra this is
what the dock looks like and again if
you want an extra power charger with a
longer cord you can buy that extra as
well so that is your unboxing of the
brand new Apple iPad this is the Wi-Fi
version not the 3G version which comes
out in a few weeks i'm natali del conte
