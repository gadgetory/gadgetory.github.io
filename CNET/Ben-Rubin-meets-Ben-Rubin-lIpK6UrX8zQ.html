here at TechCrunch Disrupt in new york
and i'm here with meerkats CEO dan Ruben
so that's actually the other way around
we switch we switch shirts I am Ben Fox
Rubin from cnet and I'm daddy's the
meerkat and it is the founder and CEO
meerkat apparently I don't give me
flowers is this is going to get really
confusing so anyway I have a couple
questions for you first of all been
Ruben so you have an app that lets
people live broadcast their smartphone
videos it was a huge hit at South by
Southwest first of all my first question
is will you apologize to me the other
ben rubin for getting so much attention
using my name yes I'm apologizing that
was easy all right i have another
request for you do you agree to step
down as CEO effective immediately uh-huh
so people can stop you know confusing me
for a notable tech entrepreneur would
you take this job I could do you want a
good job I'm more than happy to all
right no problem this is this is going
much better than I expected I know
you're gonna say no to all this stuff
okay okay how's this how's this will do
this instead what have we become co-ceos
okay kind of like the Olsen twins that's
that's bad to the company I don't
believe in co-ceo know you don't want to
go together if you make it a go though
maybe the job but you owned the
responsibility well I don't know that I
want to answer all those periscope
questions maybe let your the copyright
quiz where the copyright questions we'll
see how's this why don't we agree to
this why don't you change your name and
I got a couple couple ideas for you and
this is this is a tener boobing I don't
wanna I don't want to insult you okay
really but you have a terrible name I
don't know that anybody's ever told you
that it's just awful your parents
insulted you when they gave you that
name what is the really big occasion
that happened to you I want to know I
think I they're better off just
switching names so i will consider you
know so like love you let me give you
some ideas okay Mel Gibson that's good
that's okay i think magnificent I don't
want to be man okay you don't want Mel
Gibson I'll try another one Ashlee
Simpson ashley is the last name I'm
Ashley all right Ashley I am now here
with meerkat CEO ashlee simpson ruben

Eliza good flowers to do ben rubin in
fact every time I'm going to meet Ben
ruby in my life from now on I'm gonna
give them I'm gonna hold you that I
should do that it's a nice thing Jerry
