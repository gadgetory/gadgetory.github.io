things like Netflix and YouTube stream
music from the web and even let you
access your own media files you already
own it today I'll show you how to turn
your PC into the hub of your media
center experience from my couch I can
play youtube videos stream Pandora and
here throughout my home theater system
or access music and movies I already
have on my drive there are lots of ways
to rig a PC to TV setup but here's what
we want we need it to be Wireless we
don't want any wires between the couch
and the TV it needs to be easy to
navigate from a distance and you need to
be able to easily access all the videos
and music you want first things first
let's hook this up to the TV pick a spot
where the USB ports are visible and
there's easy access to the CD drive if
you plan on using it depending on your
PC's outputs you might need a mini
DisplayPort to HDMI cable which also
carries audio or you might go with DVI
to HDMI take a look at your computer's
video out port to find out which cable
you need if your computer doesn't have
HDMI or mini DisplayPort out which both
carry audio you'll need this audio cable
connecting your PC to your TV so that's
working but before I can head to the
couch there are a couple more things I
need to tweak on my PC first I'll set it
so that my PC doesn't go to sleep when I
close the lid I'll also make sure my
display settings are set to duplicate
the display and I'll play around with
the resolution settings until I find the
one that best displays my desktop on the
TV finally I've got Ethernet right here
so I'll set up a direct connection
between my network and the laptop you'll
be doing a lot of video streaming so
having this direct hookup will make that
playback really smooth this looks pretty
good but my laptops over there my couch
is over here and I need a way to control
the setup from a distance wirelessly
this full-size Logitech Keyboard is one
option it's got a keyboard on one side
and a touchpad on the other good if you
think you'll be doing a lot of typing or
just want the real estate of this
touchpad the thing is once you're done
with this you don't want a huge keyboard
crowding the coffee table but the best
and cutest option is this handheld
QWERTY keyboard with a built-in touchpad
if you've ever had one of those
slide-out smartphones like the sidekick
you'll like this design there are a few
versions of the favi smart stick
keyboard starting at about 25 bucks this
one is great because it's got backlit
keys and it can also be used to control
game consoles to set it up with your
computer plug the wireless receiver into
a USB port and you're set with the
hardware setup the last thing I need to
do is to make the computer easier to
navigate from a distance
right now all I see is a bunch of tiny
text and a pointer that I've already
lost track of that's where a program
called Plex comes in the free Plex Media
Center is a TV friendly interface that
lets you cue things up like Netflix
YouTube videos or even media on your PC
it's a full screen program designed to
be controlled from a distance with a
remote control or a keyboard I've
already set it up to access music and
movies I have on my computer's hard
drive I've also added a bunch of
channels like YouTube Vimeo and even
CNET TV since I have my handy keyboard
it's super easy to find something to
watch like on Vimeo select the video
quality HD please and sit back relax and
enjoy
obviously there are a lot of ways to set
this up if you want to know more about
the accessories I used some of your
other options or how to set up Plex see
my full written guide on how to see
Netcom and don't be shy about hitting me
up on twitter with any of your questions
along the way for cnet.com I'm Sharon
