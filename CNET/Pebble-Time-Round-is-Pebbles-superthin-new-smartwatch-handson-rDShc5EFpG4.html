square
now pebbles ready to make one that's
round the pebble time round is the third
in a series of pebble smartwatches going
back to the original pebble and this one
is a lot thinner it looks much more like
a regular watch but it's still capable
running watch faces and apps using the
same pebble time OS and has the same
timeline for looking at dates
appointments and other hook ten bits of
information there are some compromises
here in order to do this the new pebble
time round will only have a two day
battery life instead of the up to seven
day or even ten day on some of the other
watches but it's clearly a lot thinner
than anything else in the SmartWatch
landscape and deliberately designed to
feel a lot more comfortable on a lot
more wrists it will also be capable with
smart straps which are an upcoming
concept that we'll use the back power
port to connect and add a lot of
independently connected strap
accessories that might add things like
GPS or lasers or fitness elements like
heartrate monitors
although a lot of that will not come
until probably next year at the earliest
the pebble time round will cost 250
dollars it's available for pre-order now
and it's coming out in November what
Owen alone errs do well all of the
pebble watches are being updated to the
current pebble OS including the original
pebble so they're all meant to feel like
one connected ecosystem</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
