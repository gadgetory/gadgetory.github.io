Google and Apple and we're throwing them
into the prize fight ring get ready for
a prize fight punch out between the
Nexus 9 versus the iPad air 2 our judges
for this fight are Eric the tank man
Franklin
Xiomara the k.o Blanco and you-know-who
ring-a-ling containing Tom we'll take
all three judges scores and average them
out to the nearest tenth of a point the
final prize fights for will be an
average of all rounds using the same
system leggo round one is designed the
Nexus 9 gets its design thanks to HTC
with the familiar rubberized backing
that's eight millimeters thick with an
eight point nine inch screen at a 2048
by 1536 resolution and 281 pixels per
inch density the iPad air 2 goes even
thinner at 6.1 millimeters with its
streamlined all-metal body design that's
the classiest out there the screen
measures nine point seven inches and
it's anti-glare coating really makes a
difference at the same resolution of the
Nexus but a lower 264 pixels per inch
density the Nexus 9 gets a three point
three and the iPad air 2 gets a four
point three next round the user
interface the Nexus 9 is a showcase for
Android 5.0 lollipop and it's a modern
refresh take on Android there's new
navigation and features while keeping
notifications and multiple users that
make you sing
some apps will need to catch up to run
smoothly it's still not as simple as iOS
really nothing is the lollipop left us
all impressed now you know what you're
getting with iOS that's easy enough for
a two-year-old to figure out touch ID
isn't as useful compared to an iPhone
but it's a nice addition both platforms
bring an always-on voice search and
commands but we still side with Google's
for speed and accuracy of information
now I really enjoyed lollipop maybe
because it's the new kid on the block
right now and we're giving it a little
bump with the 4.3 and iOS gets a four
Apple leaves two rounds in next round
this features user profiles in a battery
saver mode that purportedly adds an
extra 90 minutes of juice our standouts
here it's 8 megapixel rear camera is
solid but can't match the image quality
or the myriad shooting modes of the iPad
but the Vegas design advantage here is 2
front-facing speakers for real stereo
sound and every tablet needs it now the
iPad Air's camera is hands-down the best
camera on a tablet even if it pains me
because we'll see more idiots at a
concert pulling them in the air and
blocking my view of one direction
disclaimer Brian does not actually like
one direction now touch ID is an extra
level of security an Apple pay
integration works in apps right now but
not in third-party mobile sites this one
is up for grabs but we're giving both
sides a 4.7 the final round is
performance
the 3d ice storm unlimited test shows
that the Nexus 9s graphics prowess
Bestine the iPad air 2 but when it came
to the Geekbench 3 benchmark test for
multi-core processing the iPad air 2
flexes its custom a8x chip muscle with a
dominant score now based on initial
battery drain tests the iPad air 2 less
roughly around 10 to 12 hours depending
on real-world usage and the Nexus 9 does
the same now in everyday use the iPad is
still the snappiest most responsive
tablet we've seen and even though the
Nexus 9 is a zippe performer as well
some apps still lag loading and we still
give the edge to the iPad the iPad air 2
gets a 4.7 and the Nexus 9 gets a 4.3 so
let's have a talk all four rounds and
you can do the math but Apple's iPad air
2 takes this battle 4.4 24.1 and is your
prize fight winner
I'm Brian Tong thanks for watching and
we'll catch you guys next time for
another prize fight well the paw has
been cut due to time constraints</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
