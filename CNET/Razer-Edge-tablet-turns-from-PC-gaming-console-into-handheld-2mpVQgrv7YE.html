it was playing on a tiny little Windows
8 tablet
I'm Scott Stein and this is the razor
edge what is it it is a tablet designed
for gaming and it is very versatile it
comes in a variety of different forms a
base 10 inch tablet that is touchscreen
the coolest thing about the razor age
are the accessories and this gamepad
that it docks into really turns into
something that looks like it escaped III
but it's gonna cost you this is $249
extra that's the cost of a regular video
game console ladies and gentlemen on top
of a tablet base price which can range
anywhere from $9.99 up to 1449 for the
unit that we have which is a core i7
processor 256 gigabyte SSD eight gigs of
ram and then nvidia geforce 640 le
processor 2 gigabytes
those are nice specs they definitely
compete with the high end of the
Ultrabook market and with a decent
laptop but they're not going to match
what you would get on a sort of
quad-core CPU or higher end Nvidia
graphics the sort of stuff that comes to
the Territorian that you'd be paying for
with this so you're paying up for the
design but it's a very cool design keep
in mind though that this interesting
gamepad which docks nicely and cleanly
is heavy it's about 4 pounds for this
entire configuration here so it's not
sunk you're gonna want to hold in your
hands although it's kind of comfortable
to do that it's more of a lap gaming
system and hey you'll impress your
friends on the train the buttons here
match where you expect on a console dual
analog pads that click full backlit LED
buttons here analog triggers shoulder
buttons dual shoulder buttons on each
side and vibration feedback so you know
soup-to-nuts it's got it all though the
layout feels a little bit different than
you get on a gaming console maybe a
little shifted to the front sometimes it
can feel a little bit awkward but far
better than you get on a gaming handheld
like a 3ds or a PlayStation Vita there's
also a battery pack an additional
battery pack option inside the gamepad
itself which is good because the battery
runs out fast when you're playing games
maybe as only as little as an hour if
you're playing with all the game
settings a ratchet
so put in that sliced battery which
costs extra again and you're gonna be
able to boost up your gameplay a little
bit the tablet has decent specs similar
to a surface pro in terms of a four hour
ish battery life enough to get your work
done but nothing that's going to not you
know blow you away in terms of battery
performance in the tablet landscape who
is this for
clearly gamers this is a gaming device
they got a credit razor here because no
one's entered this landscape yet
nobody's come up with this type of
versatile solution to gaming and you are
really kind of paying for that design
and that concept more than you're paying
for something that is a top-of-the-line
performance product although what's nice
is that this all works as advertised
there's no and a special software or or
features that you're waiting to be
unveiled later everything plugs in and
goes it worked with steam it works of
origin you know and then the controller
buttons map very nicely and if you don't
like that again you can use the
touchscreen you can use a mouse or a
keyboard you could even set this thing
up like a little PC in the corner and a
lot of the games look pretty nice just
looking at this 1366 by 768 screen but
keep in mind that's not a great
resolution compared to other ones you
get in this landscape the surface pro is
a 1080p screen so other tablets at this
point are really ratcheting up the the
resolution and this lacks a few extra
features that you do see in those there
is no SD card slot in here and there is
also no rear camera although I don't
know if you want to take pictures with
this thing there is a single USB 3.0
port right up here now if you connect
the dock you get three more USB 3.0
ports which covers your bases there is
no built-in HDMI on the tablet itself
you'll need the dock for that and it
connects via the same pin port that this
game bag controller and the charger pop
into and connecting this game pad is
really not so bad there are latches on
the bottom so you pop it out here and
then you detach it and that's it once
it's in it's pretty solid it doesn't
like to detach you load it in the top
you put it in yes snap it in it gives
you a little bit of a vibrational
feedback to tell you that
locked and it won't fall out and you
know actually feels kind of nice and
sturdy to hold next-gen consoles maybe
around the corner and there's a lot more
to come this year
where will the Razer edge fit in this
kind of feels like the future of PC
gaming and the fact that it can work
just as well on your TV or in your hands
or with a keyboard and mouse is a great
sign of where pcs could go the question
is will the Razer edge be the ultimate
product in that territory or will it be
stuff coming down the road that might
even beat it at its own game we'll have
to see but if you want something that
does for gaming what the surface pro
does for computing well take a look at
the Razer edge and be ready to pay up
I'm Scott Stein and that's a look at the
Razer edge Windows 8 gaming tablet</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
