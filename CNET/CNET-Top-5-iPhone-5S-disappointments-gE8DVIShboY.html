dominated by new phones like the galaxy
s4 the HTC One the Lumia 1020 I have
been dying to know how Apple would
strike back with a killer new iPhone and
then we got the iPhone 5s now I'm sure
is a great phone but even the most
hardcore Apple fans have to admit that
it's not quite the Android obliterating
phone they were hoping for I'm Donald
Bell and in this top five we're counting
down the five biggest disappointments
with the iPhone 5s starting off at
number five catchup features not as
tasty as it sounds
whether it's the improvements to the
camera or control center in iOS 7 many
of the most appealing features in the
new iPhone could have been pulled from
any Android device this year I mean the
best feature in the iPhone used to be
the smug feeling of superiority I felt
over other people but now unless I buy
the gold one I don't think anyone's even
gonna try to mug me for this thing at
number four no 128 gigabyte model still
the cloud is nice but I'd much rather
hoard all of my apps and media on my
phone making things worse is the fact
that these apps have been getting more
bloated ever since that Retina display
and once things get all retooled for
64-bit it's going to get even worse
Apple you are the world's largest
digital Empire of games apps music and
video and your phone only lets me hold a
tiny thimble of it it makes no sense
coming in at number 3 battery life now
it does seem like a minor miracle that
Apple shoved in a 64-bit processor and
is still able to keep the same battery
life but we want progress phones with
monster battery life like the Droid RAZR
MAXX have been around for two
generations now so we know it can be
done I would gladly trade in that 64-bit
processor for an extra hour to of
battery life even if it meant a slightly
thicker phone and just think of all the
drunken iTunes purchases Apple will get
if they can just make a phone that can
stay up past 8 p.m.
coming in number two NFC it's not there
we've been asking for this one for years
a near field communication sensor like
the one found in most hero Android
phones out there would finally pave the
way to making Apple's passbook a real
mobile payment solution the fingerprint
sensor gets you half way there by
verifying who you are but you'll still
need something like NFC if you're going
to use this at the grocery checkout no
one's really made this work yet but
Apple is shown that they're pretty good
at succeeding where others have crashed
and burned all right now before I fall
too far down the snark whole let's get
some perspective the iPhone 5s brings a
lot of new features that are a
meaningful step in the right direction I
mean we finally come out of the world of
black and white we have colors now
especially if you include the 5c the
compatibility with OpenGL is going to be
a big step up for graphics the camera
definitely got more awesome the
dedicated motion processor opens up some
new possibilities for fitness and
augmented reality and most of all a
fingerprint sensor you know you're going
to feel like James Bond for at least a
week alright but now back to the big old
CNET jug of haterade for the number one
iPhone 5s disappointment the screen how
stubborn do you have to be to sit back
and watch the entire smartphone industry
adopt bigger screens to the delight of
customers and still insist that a 4-inch
screen is the perfect size things have
gotten so far gone that the brand new
HTC One mini the mini is still larger
than the iPhone 5s I know this is an
issue that's as much Freudian as it is
practical but come on Apple surely can
go a little bigger without Johnny I've
thrown a fit so there you have it five
disappointments with the iPhone 5s that
make you wonder if Apple is maybe lost a
little bit of their mojo be sure to read
rick boyd is full post over on CNET and
for a full rundown of the iPhone 5s
