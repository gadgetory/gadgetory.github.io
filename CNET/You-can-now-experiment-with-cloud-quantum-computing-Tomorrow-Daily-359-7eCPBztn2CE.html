welcome to tomorrow jelly the besties
talk show in the universe I'm Ashley
skele and i'm jeff cannata are you ready
for headlines cuz they're ready for you
hey are you interested in quantum
computing it's really in its early
stages right now but here's an
opportunity to actually experiment with
it on your own pretty cool IBM launched
an online simulator for its quantum
computing research and you can run your
very own experiments on it this is a 5
qubit computer that's cryogenically
frozen to help it function and anyone
can request access to the online portal
once you're in you can create basic
logical equations and either run them in
the simulator or send them off to IBM's
actual quantum hardware to be processed
quantum computing relies on a premise of
being able to represent bits
simultaneously so scaling up technology
like this could prove to be useful as
research improves this is really cool I
don't think I'm going to be actually
taking advantage of it but I love the
fact that it's open to anybody yeah and
that quantum computing is happening
right now yeah this is amazing stuff and
you can get in on if you have any
interest and I know IBM wants to kind of
encourage interest in quantum computing
future generations and also just you
know young people who are interested in
the in the science of quantum computing
which is pretty cool uh well ladies and
gentlemen we're gonna go from the
highest of highs the peak of Technology
of quantum computing to the lowest
Valley and by that I mean of course a
working robot tongue youtube user man
suno does what everyone else does when
he sees his favorite anime character on
his computer screen he licks his monitor
every one and the one thing about that
is is clean up as kind of gross so he
did what anybody would do if you were in
his shoes or I guess in his face anyone
anyone he made a robot tongue yes that's
right he built a robot tongue to lick
the screen for him a servo Arduino and a
silicone tongue so realistic I don't
want to know where he got it from his
all it took
for matsudo to make his really weird
dreams come true so I guess there's
something to say here about living a
dream know what kind of world do we live
in when licking your own screen becomes
too much work I sincerely hope that you
the viewer are licking your screen right
now you watch you guys are you sure you
love that yeah I do automating the
licking it feels like come on buddy if
you can't even lick your select
automation I don't know that tongue
really freaks me out you guys move I'm
afraid to find out which of these
stories you want to talk about on
thursday you know uh I could really go
on about this robot tongue but you know
what I think the more important story to
civilization is going to be caught in
computing that's true so I think we're
gonna get us as many clicks as well
little dumb store ever but yeah we
should definitely talk about quantum
computing how cool is it that it's open
to anybody IBM's doing a really cool
thing here and we'll talk about it more
in our deep dive episode on Thursday yes
and if you want to get in on the
conversation you can talk about any of
the topics we've chosen to the best
homes on Thursday you yeah you can even
talk about honestly like you just talked
about talked about the robot tongues
with us too it's hashtag hey TD on
Twitter and if we like we say we will
feature it on Thursday show yes that's
how you do that should we just jump
right into phone tog refer of the day
let's do it
today is phone tog refer of the day is
bed jum who took this with a nexus 6p
yeah bed John rose hey guys my name is
bed jump pronounced bed gem like gum but
with Jay love that this month's theme is
spring right well I was at the park and
the trees were just starting to come to
life with color these pictures were
taken with my Nexus 6p at night with
very little light yes the sky really did
look that weird color as well I had to
compress the images to send them so I
hope they didn't lose their quality you
have permission to use them on your show
of course I feel like this is lit like a
movie like what's going to happen
underneath this trip front of this tree
I'll tell you what's gonna happen the
night elves are going to emerge and
they're going to make me their prime
warrior and I will save the kingdom for
them that's a really good story I will
buy that somebody called the president
of Hollywood and make that movie happen
bedroom thank you so much for that phone
tog raphy if you guys want to get in on
phone tog refer the desi send in your
spring theme photos to tomorrow at Cena
Tucker yeah be sure you do our four
requirements tell us what device you
took it on give us permission to use it
tell us how to pronounce your name super
key and then tells a little story about
why you took that picture we need those
four things because they make the show
better yes that is very true you can
also find us on social media or send a
friend to the show at tomorrow daily com
that is it for us today on may the 4th
it's not wednesday i do consider star
wars day to be may the 4th I think maybe
