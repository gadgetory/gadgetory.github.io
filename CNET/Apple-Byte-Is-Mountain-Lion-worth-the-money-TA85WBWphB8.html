welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of apple
and the big news this week the cats out
of the bag now apple is released OS 10
mountain line for 1995 through the Mac
App Store you can upgrade if you have
lion and even snow leopard if your Mac's
hardware is compatible and it's the
riskiest operating system yet now it's
definitely worth the upgrade in it's a
real polish OS that I enjoy using more
than my shake weight my favorite
features i've been using the most over
the past few weeks are the notifications
that i can access with the quick swipe
on the trackpad the VIP list and mail
make sure i never miss an email from all
the honey's that holler at me and I
message it lets me directly message iOS
device users like my good friend Charlie
so let's take a first look at more mouth
line with cnet's no-nonsense teddy bear
senior associate editor jason parker the
latest version of mac OS 10 comes with
more than 200 new features that make
several actions easier and make it more
connected to your other Apple devices
the most notable new feature documents
in the cloud gives you a window upon
launch of an app that shows all your
current documents this means that
whatever device you're on you'll have
the latest version of all your documents
everywhere note how the iCloud window
offers quick look preview features like
in the finder next messages is now on
the Mac and mountain lion now you'll be
able to send instant messages to friends
and co-workers from your Mac directly to
other iOS devices running iOS 5 or later
you can also send multimedia message
with a simple drag-and-drop don't forget
that as long as you're chatting with
another mountain lion or iOS device user
your chats won't count towards your
texting plan with your service carrier
mountain lion also offers reminders
originally added in iOS 5 for Apple's
mobile devices the reminders app syncs
up with iOS devices through iCloud so
your reminders are always with you a
mountain lion reminders aren't just
about time-based alerts you also have
the ability to send yourself reminders
based on your GPS location very handy
when you have to remember something when
leaving work for example in Safari
Apple's web browser the company is
adopted
unified smart search field similar to
what you have in Google Chrome so you
can type out a URL or just add a search
term Safari also has a new way to browse
tabs with tab view and iCloud st.
feature that shows you the current open
tabs on your Apple devices even better
with a pinch gesture you enter a new
interface for tab browsing mode that
lets you swipe between open tabs and
reverse pinch to go back to regular
viewing mode sharing is much easier in
mountain-lion as well with a new share
button that shows up in many interface
elements across the operating system in
Safari you can touch the share button a
mountain lion will list the most
appropriate share actions for the
content with this website for example
the sharing button pics appropriate ways
to share our URL that brings us to
Facebook and Twitter integration just
like the one time sign up you do with
Twitter and iOS 5 for iPhones and iPads
you'll soon be able to sign up once on
Facebook or Twitter and mountain lion
then have easy access to sharing items
on both social networks unfortunately
Facebook integration won't come until
this fall is an update but Twitter is
ready to use right now an online simply
touch the share button choose Twitter
and you get what Apple calls a share
sheet where you can type in your message
add an attachment along with your
location and send the updates directly
to Twitter mountain lion is available
right now at the mac app store for 1995
i'm jason parker and this has been a
first look for apple's mountain lion
back to you in the studio brian and q
just stop with the ketchups they aren't
funny why do you have to be so catty
like that Jason me ouch now want to
mount lions new additions Game Center
promises to bring cross game played
between the mac and iOS devices and the
game library will eventually ramp up but
for now is pretty slim pickings right
now with seven games now there have been
reports that some users mountain lion
up-to-date program redemption codes
we're not working through the App Store
and we'll follow up to see how
widespread of an issue that is but
before we move on I thought this would
be a perfect moment to celebrate this
new launch with a tribute to mountain
lion cubs who are so cute and like
cuddly and soft I mean look at them you
just
take your eyes off oh all right back to
the news stories Apple disappointed Wall
Street for the first time in a long time
for their fiscal third-quarter earnings
with profits of 8.8 billion dollars on
sales of 35 billion dollars now those
sound like big numbers and they are but
apple fell short of Wall Street's
expectations with weakening iphone sales
from Europe and China and a slowdown of
sales with all the speculation of a new
iPhone model coming soon now who could
be telling people not to buy an iphone
right now on the flip side apple sold a
record 17 million iPads in the quarter
with apple's tablet capturing
sixty-eight percent of the market
according to strategy analytics CEO Tim
Cook also decided to give fanboys aggie
chasm during the earnings call when he
said we are also really looking forward
to the amazing new products we've got in
the pipeline oh alright well one of
those new products people are
anticipating is an Apple TV set I still
say it's not coming in 2012 but a series
of wild and crazy patents were recently
granted to Apple for advancing the TV
experience to not 3d but get this 5d
that's right mine now some date back to
nineteen ninety nine but they include
interactive gaming teleconferencing
tactile feedback technology while
watching TV and virtual reality data
gloves which I hope we never see so
envision this it's like a kinect like
interactivity with videoconferencing
that you can recognize your handprint as
user while watching TV with a Nintendo
Power glove that's 5d technology or just
going to a rave all right guys on to the
rumors and they have been hot with
Macotakara reporting that the next ipod
touch will use the same in cell
technology that's expected in the next
iphone but the ipod touch will also move
to the foreigners display with the same
longer dimensions and we'll have a
buffed aluminum rear shell instead of a
glass back or the mirrored stainless
steel on the current ipod touch now the
report also mentions a hole on the lower
part of the rear side of the ipod touch
and I'm not going to guess what that
feature could possibly be used for all
right KGI Securities analyst ming-chi
kuo went on fire this past week with
several Apple related product rumors
saying he believes the 13 inch Retina
Display MacBook Pros will be coming in
the september-october time frame he's
also sticking with his prediction for
iphone 5 to launch in September along
with new updates for the ipod touch and
new ipod nano which is what Apple has
been doing with the ipod product line
over the past several years so there's
no surprises there and he also claims
the ipad mini will debut after the
iphone later in that same month of
September all right guys on to the quick
bites and reuters has confirmed that
Apple will indeed be shrinking their
dock connector it's a rumor we've talked
about earlier in the show they say the
move was partially made to make space
for the headset connector to be placed
on the bottom I really hope it wasn't
just to make space for the headphone
port now I've said earlier I'm all for
this if there's added functionality and
a sleeker slimmer device but this is
really a business market move with all
the new accessory makers getting a new
stream of revenue from apples ecosystem
thanks to a new connector now there's
plenty of you who are already mad about
this I know this but is it really going
to stop you from getting the next iPhone
I want to hear what you the Apple biters
have to say and I promise I will read a
few of your responses that's just sent
to the apple byte at cnet com or my
Twitter at brian Tong on next week's
show and then one more thing that you
guys should probably know about the
apple podcast app that's sorry excuse
for a podcast app that's just horrible
it's a bad apple with only two and a
half star ratings yeah well all things D
reports Apple is playing a release an
update by the time you watch a show to
vastly improve the app it needs help
alright guys that's going to do it for
this week's show I'm Brian Tom thanks
for watching send me your thoughts your
wishes hopes and dreams and we'll see
you guys next week for another bite of
the Apple
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
