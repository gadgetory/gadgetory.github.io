we want technological innovation to
continue we have to find ways of getting
younger generations interested in
computing here in the UK public service
broadcaster the BBC has an ambitious
plan for doing just that the microbe it
is a tiny computer that will be
distributed for free to every UK child
in the year 7 year group which means
kids around 11 to 12 years of age very
small and extremely basic the microbe it
is a sort of blank canvas through which
kids can let their imaginations run wild
bending it's many elements to their
creative will to create all manner of
projects set to enter schools in October
this micro computer is built for
flexibility it has 25 LEDs on the front
two programmable buttons a built-in
accelerometer and a compass it hooks up
to sensors or other devices via five
inputs and output rings and also packs
Bluetooth coding happens through a
Microsoft built interface which because
it's browser-based can be accessed from
loads of different devices the micro bit
follows in the footsteps of Raspberry Pi
which similarly aimed at getting kids
into coding but with buttons and LEDs
right on the front of the device plus a
huge push into schools the BBC's new toy
could potentially make more of an impact
than other micro computers to date the
BBC says it hopes the micro bits
flexibility will push forward the
Internet of Things a term that describes
all the tech in our lives becoming
interconnected although kids using the
micro bits won't remember the BBC does
have form when it comes to computing
aiming with its newest gadget to match
the success of the BBC micro in the 80s
a machine that was hugely influential in
getting a whole generation into
programming and into computers more than
30 years later can the BBC repeat that
trick let me know what you think and
stay tuned to see net</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
