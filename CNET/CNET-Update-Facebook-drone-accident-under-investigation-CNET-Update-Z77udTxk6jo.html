Facebook's massive solar power drones
and now the US National Transportation
Safety Board is investigating the
accident the US agency said the craft
experienced a structural failure when it
was coming in for a landing during a
test flight in June and the damage
compromised the aircraft some are
calling it a crash the low-altitude test
flight lasted a little over an hour and
a half the drone called Aquila weighs
less than a thousand pounds it has the
wingspan of a Boeing 737 and is designed
to stay in the air for 90 days at a time
to deliver high-speed internet access
facebook is testing these giant drones
as a way to get more people online in
hard-to-reach areas where there isn't
built out infrastructure you see if
Facebook can get more people connected
to high-speed Internet more people will
use Facebook this accident certainly
puts a snag in those plans although back
in July Facebook called this first test
flight a success this isn't Facebook's
first setback on the mission to get more
people online facebook also was planning
to test out a satellite to deliver
internet access to parts of africa but
that plan went up in smoke literally
because it was stored aboard the SpaceX
Falcon 9 rocket that exploded during a
test in September Facebook's not the
only tech giant on a quest to sell
internet services to underserved parts
of the world we're in the middle of a
broadband space race the company one web
backed by virgin group and other
prominent companies is working on
building 900 satellites that will be
used to provide internet across the
globe and Elon Musk's SpaceX has a
similar idea last week SpaceX filed an
application to the Federal
Communications Commission to launch more
than 4,400 satellites into low orbit for
its own internet service it's expected
to be a 10 billion dollar project I'm
