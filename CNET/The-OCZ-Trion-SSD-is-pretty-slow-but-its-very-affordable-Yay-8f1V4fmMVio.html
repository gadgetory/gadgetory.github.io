sunset drive form ocz now this is a very
first ocz SSD that is entirely toshiba
can poland from the controller to the
flash memory and if you wonder why this
because OCC has been part of toshiba for
more than a year now it also the first
ocz SSD that used the new triple layer
itself or TLC flash memory basically
that means you can crap myself into the
same space resulting in cheapo SST at
expand of the performance and indeed
this one was one of the slowest SSD ever
seen in a long time is not that slow by
the way you could compare with regular
hard drive like this one here is still
so much faster and the dry doesn't come
with much either there's no accessory at
all basically what you see here is what
you get and on inside it does not
support an equip shin but to make up for
that it has very high level of endurance
for example this phone 80 gig by drive
here can handle up to 120 terabyte of
data written to it so basically if you
write hard on 10 gig per day and every
day it would take you three year to wear
this Drive now of course if you write
less of course you will you can take
even longer but three years is the
warranty time okay now the price the
trial here is quite affordable costing
as low as $57 420 gigabyte all the way
up to three and seventy dollar for not
an 80 gigabyte now note that that it
suggested retail price and the street
price expected to be even lower so
chances are you're looking at the most
affordable drive on the market so if you
have a no computer that's still run on a
regular hard drive the trial here is a
great cheap investment that will bring
about great returns in terms of
performance but if you consider yourself
an SSD connoisseur the new dry here
might not cut it but hey that's your
problem for more on this one and check
out my full review as cnet com basically
is a fast in app of four bowls on state
drive to replace that Oh hard drive you
still have so do it and you can thank me
later
go ahead and thank me now I'm fine with
that and that's because I'm double this
has been the first look at the Tryon 100
sort of state drive from OCC</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
