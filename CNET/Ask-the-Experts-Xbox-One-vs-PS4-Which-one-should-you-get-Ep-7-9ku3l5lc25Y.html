of ask the experts it's the final
episode with myself Jeff Bakalar and
Peter Brown from GameSpot that's who I
am that's who you are this is upsetting
it's bittersweet we're in the last sort
of category don't know it don't feel
sorry sorry I have a feeling you and I
are gonna be doing this again I'm gonna
make you guys come to New York and we're
gonna do this again
all right now we're gonna talk all about
our opinion on what this all means are
the consoles worth it are you getting
your money's worth
should you upgrade all that kind of
stuff so the first question we got is
from Alexander and he says if he has a
ps3 is it worth upgrading to the next
generation the ps4 is it worth it I
almost don't even want to consider it
upgrading for all intents and purposes
going from a ps3 and then upgrading to a
ps4 there's really no upgrade no wonder
there's no backwards compatibility right
so there's really no sort of migration
it's just a new system within a new
generation so do you think it's worth it
for the bump in multi-platform games
like your the the graphical and
performance bump do you think that's
worth maybe I know some people are
interested in better graphics primarily
right and that's really what this new
hardware is about for the most part so
something like battlefield for
Assassin's Creed 4 those games that are
appearing on ps3 and 360 as well as the
Xbox one and ps4 are gonna look a little
bit better but again like do more
polygons at a higher resolution mean
that I'm cool spending 4 or $500 just to
get that I mean this has been the
longest gap between console generations
right right so people are obviously
hungry for new hardware and there's an
anticipation in the excitement that
comes with getting something that's new
and shiny and different but at the same
time you know winner you fooling
yourself or what are you actually doing
yourself a service right so maybe
neither one of us actually sees value in
picking up a new console right well
Michael wants to know do we think in our
opinions that these systems are worth
they're asking price that is sort of a
tough question I think yeah I mean we
already answered it about the games but
I think about the hardware and the added
value that these things brain just to
your living room in general you know
when you look at the price of each Xbox
obviously being $100 more in my opinion
that hundred dollars does not feel worth
it
right at launch because I lived with
Xbox one in my living room I've got the
scars to show it and prove it and my
wife did not enjoy using Xbox one as a
remote control for our cable box she
watches a lot of HGTV I didn't know that
channel exists it's all about fixing up
houses and whatnot you say Xbox go watch
HGTV and it just doesn't know what to do
it it has never worked yeah but when you
deconstruct the hardware inside each
console I mean let's call a spade a
spade
there's more horsepower in a ps4 there
is yeah yeah the GPU is more powerful
the RAM is so much faster for sure you
know each of these consoles - as much as
they are Hardware in games there's also
this service that gives them a lot of
the functionality and entertainment that
right will really look for so now you've
got to balance Xbox Live vs. PlayStation
Plus both are required for multiplayer
on their respective consoles and I
should say both of them give you free
games but Sony is giving you free games
every month for ps4 right PlayStation 3
Vita yep I mean it just it almost
doesn't stop like if you remember you
just have a list of free games but Xbox
Live Gold is a hose job I mean let's be
honest yes the fact that you need to pay
$60 a year to watch Netflix yes that is
vannacutt mind blowing that that's even
still a reality when you line them up
and you look at what each sort of bullet
point equates to Xbox Live Gold really
does feel like you're getting a
runaround yeah and even I think even
Skype requires Xbox Live Gold yeah I
think it sounds crazy
yeah think how crazy is that because
it's it's it's be mind blowing some of
the game DVR functionality is tied to
that as well Sony is being a little more
flexible a little more generous right
and they're not trying to bombard you
with things that you're 90
asking brand man this has just it's just
been a goddamn pleasure is what happens
at Hell right yeah more of this more
obscene mmm James paya
alright let's promise me I promise you
pinky swear f yeah we got a pig I need
that back no you know what let go how
could you blame him this has been
fantastic sir thank you so much for
watching thank you for the questions
hope you guys learned a lot that I'll do
it for this round of ask the experts I'm
Jeff Bakalar from C net and Peter Brown
from GameSpot thanks so much for
watching guys we'll see you soon take
care</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
