can take anywhere you want to go a
jacket that shows your mood to everyone
and finally a robot that's going to help
you running by feeding you a food that
you probably don't want when you're
running it's tomorrow daily
hey guys welcome to tomorrow daily your
source of all that cool futurology
robots tech 3d printing and of course
all your source for Maude Garrett hey
guys that's right ashley is not here
today she's dealing with her dogs again
but anyway more importantly we have
Maude Garrett one of my favorite human
beings in the world Thanks yeah I just
say that cuz I'm right here it's true um
but Maude you are you are actually a
host on many many things what else you
go host on oh my goodness Australian
radio I do entertainment reports I run a
thing called geek bomb yeah your your
geek blood is is real thick you got real
thick e blood yeah I do look at you got
star war if you're not if you're
listening and I got Luke on my butt Star
Wars like yeah Luke but and she's got a
Batman chest so we're off to a bad start
we are uncomfortable already alright so
yeah let's get on with our stories it's
a good thing we're friends well it's a
good thing we're hey looks it's time to
try something more than that at me
alright so I we start off with 3d
printing I don't know if you know but 3d
printers are like you know big machines
and yeah it's they're just they're
gigantic machine don't bring anything
yeah you can print anything you want
well why not be able to take that
ability anywhere you go well one one
creator actually did that this guy's
name is jean-luc yellow Mets no way with
that I choked it through but he created
a 3d printer well he didn't create a 3d
printer but he made a 3d printer you can
take anywhere it's basically a case mod
it's extremely portable take a look at
this it's just in this little tiny case
and he just it in seconds I think the
the cell is that it's in seconds he's
able to open it up plug it in and start
printing he even printed that little
head over there um what's really cool is
that John Luke made this mod available
so that you can make it yourself there's
um there's detailed layout filled it
like an idea point yep yeah right so he
gives you all the tools and all that and
apparently it takes it takes like a few
hours to make and it takes like I think
he said 10 hours to make which is
alright and then only two hundred
dollars to actually put together so okay
that's not so bad so there you go if you
always wanted a 3d printer why not make
a portable ones that you can take with
you to your friend's house I feel like
the 3d printer is something that no one
ever thought they needed until they had
it and as soon as I had it there like
I'm going to print everything and
they're even using it in surgeries like
building prosthetic limbs now because
they're printing everything up but the
portable factor mm-hmm what I've never
really found myself going I need a
printer I can print this oh no what
about if you're like at you know
someone's like someone's like oh you can
borrow a pen you're like yes you can
jiddu did it and you just depends done
like you have to wait for a while I mean
obviously I mean it's it's pretty cool
it's just it's a case mod a lot of
people haven't been doing really
anything cool with the three printers
themselves so it's cool to see yet not
yet but this is the first step in to
portable 3d printers so there you go
what would you print there was a head
displayed in the video yeah um I mean
what if you broke your heel I'm sorry
too I wouldn't break away I've said what
in the world would you print and you've
said a broken high heel I was talking
about why you want to like have a
portable if you want to take it portable
why would you need it to be portable if
you broke a heel with you on your car
what if you travel a lot that's true
that's probably so what did you bring
today what is it what story do you have
today well this is something that's kind
of combining not only spirituality and
your aura but also fashion and
technology you remember back in the day
they had been your break heels yeah mmm
oh that's what you're trying to nice
segue remember those mood rings that you
would put on and it would change color
depending on what mood you're in yeah
yeah there's like three dollars at the
corner store yeah all right I got mine
no like alia all right um so they're
doing that but with a hoodie a jacket
this is kind of really weird everyone
has an aura right so this is like
electric magnetic field that everyone
projects and they're different colors
and it can only be seen either if you're
a little bit gifted in that area or if
you have a particular lens
well this particular Alchemist she's
calling herself Lauren vaca she has
designed a jacket that not only fuses
that technology but captures your aura
and is able to display it within this
garment now it kind of looks like a
Python shedded itself and it's having a
trippy Technicolor experience yeah
there's ceramic weaving all the way
through it but they've teamed up somehow
compatibility and collecting data that
wirelessly transfers it into this hoodie
and displays the color of your aura it
reads your aura yes and this is a hoodie
it doesn't look like a hoodie it like
you said it looks like somebody's skin
like right time right at all okay all
right all right this is like the
prototype and this is something that
they're displaying for the very first
time at london fashion week and you can
book in to wear the jacket and you can
get your live or attested govt g have
you ever done this before have you had
your aura tested no ok so i went to
sometimes that sounds kind of hokey yeah
like we're on like a science and tech
show so we're already a little skeptical
in other words like that I'm gonna go to
a psychic apparently at this psychics
and spirituality exhibition that happens
in Australia you get your photo taken
and it shows your aura off and whether
it's strong or weak or different colors
you know you get to see what kind of
person who really so you've done it and
what is your result i had like purple oh
no that me not purple that means
everything's great in here what does it
mean peple I forget I think it's like a
lot of creativity that's kind of you
circumvent elating within my body but
the derivative on the inside yeah that's
it but this particular jacket will
either go red blue green or white so
when you wear it if you're feeling very
nervous or anxious or angry it'll turn
red if you're feeling very calm and
tranquil it'll be blue if like a lot
right now I'm teaching and being social
it is big green Wow and if I am feeling
psychic and intuitive it'll turn white
okay all right yeah I things like
there's a lot of technology involved in
a lot of algorithms just to kind of
wirelessly transfer an aura which no one
can see to the human eye on to a jacket
and I think right why not just go hey
see what about you and by the second I'm
kind of angry yeah Oh like know your
jacket says you're angry that brings us
of our to our hashtag of the day which
is TD senses mm-hmm so we want to know
if you can have a new sense what would
it be and how would you use it I would
like a sense of humor I would like that
so much more a joke anyway what about
you what would you I would like well I
don't know there's what six senses at
the moment or the sixth sense was you
seeing dead people yep I saw that really
ok no but wasn't here additional sense v
um oh god do maybe Lucy with Scarlett
Johansson yeah so you know how like she
unlocks the capacity of her brain and at
one stage she unlocks telekinesis yes
that I want that you want telekinesis
yes ok that can be a since you brought
up a good point that like what you into
like the Lucy thinking when she can read
the technology in the air I would love
to see people's incoming texts like as
it was they're coming down to their
phone and be like oh that's bad news but
I mean oh no that's not with this jacket
Oh bad news it's processing and there is
data for a wavelength so that i think is
totally doable yeah you can have guys
that we need that hacker system alright
so that is TD sense you can tweet at us
with a hashtag TD census make that yeah
tell us tell us what since you want yeah
again sense of humor would be real nice
over here one day anyway so check this
out meanwhile in japan that's the way
I'd like to title this story a crazy
crazy robot that's my first it's always
a robot they think they can't stop and i
love it i love all their robots so this
robot his name is Toma Toma ton again
with the name you an ailing miss ya Toma
Todd this tomatina has been introduced
and he's here to help you by feeding you
tomatoes while you run thought it was a
pumpkin he's gonna feed you to Tomatoes
while you're on which is kind of helpful
are you laughing at him yeah he's like
doesn't it look good offensive a dome
light to moderate look tomato tomato
yeah we're gonna fire you after this but
so the function is simple you press a
button on Toma Toma ton who is writing
on your
you're back whilst you run and he grabs
a tomato from his his abundant stuck and
holds it in front of her face while also
mimicking chewing do you see that I did
I thought he was laughing he's he's
enjoying you eating look at him go and
it's like a dance move ho over the head
and into the mouth someone's like it
that guy must be a serious runner if
he's eating tomatoes from a robot what
is it about its Mata that you need to
sustain you whilst you were running so
check this out it's a kogami alright so
let me back up Toma town was created by
kogami which is a very popular tomato
juice company in Japan and their logic
is tomatoes have lots of nutrition the
combat fatigue and then they drop the
mic they literally set nothing else they
said tomatoes combat fatigue okay so of
course very big it's like it reminds me
of Luke when he's on the Dagobah system
and Yoda's on his back that's true no
don't feeding him yeah yeah it should it
should it should spat out things and
like jumbled words Oh tomato you need
more of like no Yoda this is screwed up
so anyway of course this is a sort of
like artistic type promotion for the
juice it was but but however tomatin
will be in a race he'll be in a fun run
coming up soon in Japan in Tokyo and
then he's going to be in the Tokyo
Marathon with like a legitimate marathon
writing on a running writing on a runner
but they'll be a smaller one okay so
that is actually leave yeah dad dr.
Singh I said we hope that he squashes
the competition I see what you did I got
another one you're juicing lost jerrick
that's good uh I hope he leaves the
competitors red with envy okay um I just
still can't process why on earth you
would ever put this on your back while
you were running nobody's ever been like
I really could go for a refreshing
tomato oh but that's why I picked this
story because I thought it was really
great it's a fantastic use of technology
but also confusing by the way the the
robot ways I'm so happy he weighs about
like eight pounds like he's not a light
robot it's like he's thanking you for
showing him the world he's
so soon he's just here to help all right
so that is that is the that's all for
the stories that we have today we're
going to be right back with a round of
new releases we have user feedback and I
need it tomorrow we're going to eat a
bunch of tomatoes so don't click away
it's tomorrow daily nado
moderate thought I should have eaten 14
it's like a man yeah I gotta run a mile
that's ridiculous anyway welcome back to
tomorrow daily it is Tuesday and Tuesday
means we get a whole bunch of new media
that includes movies and uh you know
games sometimes not usually movies well
maybe you also get came some music and
stuff like that but that means today new
releases we do we have a graphic for
everything help i was think if I was the
cough it would go to the coffee traffic
alright so we start off we've got we've
got movies and then uh one other thing
but so we start off with focus comes out
on Friday on the 27th yes we'll miss
Margot Robbie yeah this one's gonna be
good Margot Robbie is they're both gonna
be in a they're both gonna be in a movie
coming out they're both going to be
suicide squad so it's very interesting
to see if their chemistry works out this
is about 22 heist people and iced women
yeah that do a heist and then split up
and then meet up six years later and
their end up there on the opposite sides
of the heist so it's a lot of tension
sexual tension and criminal tension and
who's gonna come out on top and it's
Margot Robbie of course she's 23 man
she's 23 really that's it that is all
she EES age wise she's just 23 yeah
she's just born yesterday no that's
pretty cool what do you think you gonna
see it well apparently these guys were
in the headlines during filming because
their chemistry was so rife that they
were actually saying that they were
having a bit of an affair and Jada
Pinkett Smith went no that's not her own
suppose at all my man's happy with me
well she did that she had yeah then what
am I have 40 mike-mike she said she told
me how satisfied she used in her
marriage um Oh Ben Margot Robbie oh
she's gonna be Holly queen and I'm like
yeah that's gonna be great she's perfect
is she yep that is like the number one
role we haven't really seen in a movie
yet and if she's gonna go hi is the J
she's perfect put in we'll see I loved I
loved her transit cuz she's British no
she's not is she what is she
tralian you need to go I'm sorry where's
it tomorrow there's a UH the fuzzies I
hard to handle also this weekend coming
out the Lazarus effect this stars of
Olivia Wilde Olivia Wilde and this is
about regenerating dead dead bodies it's
kind of like Frankenstein so it's kind
of like Frankenstein and reanimator it's
more like reanimator and that when you
and when you bring somebody back to life
they're crazy and in this one they have
like powers looks like a lot of jump
scares yeah a lot of cool like death
scenes what's his name Donald Glover is
in this movie is and he gets like killed
in the trailer its military i watch the
trailer and the trailer scared me i'm
not a horror person remotely and
especially with jumpscares i would
rather be doing almost anything else
than watching that there's 10 don't
overrun look at the dog yeah that's real
weird a very low budget though but for a
low budget really it looks really good
and Olivia Wilde or mark Duplass their
names aren't even in the headline on the
end in the billboards really yeah yeah
nobody waldron issues a household name
but the dog got top headlines yeah yeah
that's why does he's got a ride don't
wow wow you're gonna write B movies
that's pretty cool are you gonna watch
the fun oh maybe a wait till I
accidentally watch it yeah okay yeah I
don't know are you but you like that I
was gonna make a reference to you being
a young scaredy cat with the dog except
I wasn't gonna use cat I was gonna use
another word and didn't I refrain oh I'm
an adult alright so moving on to what's
coming out on blu-ray big hero 6 I love
this one yeah big hero 6 the animated
film from Disney and uh it's it's about
a a max hey max is your personal
healthcare professional little boy with
a health robot that helps him out and
then he trains them to be a fighting
robot and it's based on a graphic novel
did you know that I did not know that
yeah it's based on a graphic novel it's
not very similar to it they use kind of
the same characters silver samurai is
actually one of their enemies ya in a
second he's not in this what no they
couldn't get the rights to him
he's the evil dude yeah it's really
great you haven't you know if you love
all the like Pixar and Disney films this
is solid do you know what I love about
fun we see so many superhero movies and
yes it does get there in the end about
saving the world San fransokyo I think
it's called yeah Tokyo yeah um but this
one actually really promotes science and
it's encouraging everyone to say hey if
you really love building robots and if
you love technology go to university and
study it because there's a huge program
there and you know you'll have
university university lecturers and
everyone on site and all of these
resources available to you to make the
ultimate robot and in this case it's
baymax you're absolutely right it's all
about it's all about intelligence that
yeah the kid wins because he's smart and
he's he's dedicated to his work and his
brother was also a scientist it's like
it's fantastic you don't have to get
bitten by a mutated spider to have
powers yeah you can produce her Logan
really connected with the character cuz
he kind of looks like him oh yeah I see
that and he works on this show so he's
like I'm kind of like the main character
i was like no producer Logan you're not
yeah until you're out the robot that
kills everyone yeah well yeah he then
you'll take that back baby here's a
robot that kills everyone and the last
thing that we have is criminal actually
don't know anything about them I know
it's coming out on iOS uh coming out on
ipad this one is made me nervous do I
I'm a gamer so this one's called
criminal with an e which is probably why
you did the Ron Burgundy yes in the in
the end of it they've just released this
trailer out there basically it looks
like order 1886 oh that's where anyone
else that's playing that on the
PlayStation 4 yeah that's got a lot of
bad press right all I'm saying is that
you can see that it's set in France in
Charis right there or what it's a murder
mystery adventure I believe it would be
something like a point-and-click this
reminds me of device 6 which cleaned up
a lot of awards last year which was
available on mobile and iPad but I kind
of like the motor mysteries out there
and you know when you have it on an iPad
you do you go get to explore around you
look at the evidence there you solve a
mystery if it'll beat something like
heavy rain I'm in who's the developer
mm-hmm oh alright well anyway there's no
story well I didn't heard about they
just dropped this one in
me all right all right so that's all we
have for the new releases hopefully
you'll get to check out i think you
should check out big hero 6 I do too I
actually interviewed the I'm just
dropping names i'm sorry but i
interviewed the cast of big hero 6 and
and I kind of love what they're all
about and the TJ Miller yeah one of the
plays like kind of like the character in
there the stoner risk dude who has
apparently a lot of money he gave one of
the weirdest interviews I've ever had in
my life he just explained unknown
giraffe facts that's it that was my big
juicy ask him about rope nope I think it
must be my spirit animal yeah I can see
that your sister Deborah yeah brah Zebra
tomato alright well we'll get away from
that our next thing of course as always
we like to hear from you guys every
episode so it's your user feedback so
yesterday we asked you uh what kind of
show you would create because there's a
YouTube kids app that came out so what
kind of show you would create for this
this app so it was TD kids yeah Neil
said an after after an hour of watching
youtube vids r l ly ohh Emry pops up and
screams at them go outside my way Amy
yeah there you go Arlene R me you and
not allowed us I names anymore screams
and tells them to go play outside that's
pretty good hi I'm after an hour after
an hour tells the kids to go outside and
play that's gonna do that's what
Nintendo already does have you playing
the wii or the 3ds it's like hey
shouldn't you go outside and it shows a
picture of the outset it's like a window
it's like there's beautiful this looks
like uh there's a tree it's got peaches
on it not once did I look at that went
yeah that's a get out my way I was like
are your first although I could one
named me links gonna fall in love of you
don't stop all right so uh next one we
have is Matt he said I would like to
create a bill nye the science guy /
tomorrow daily colab stem show for
five-year-olds that'd be awesome I don't
host with Bill Nye the Science Guy oh
just shut my mouth while he was talking
I've been rewatching alias again and
there's a
program in there where they realize that
five and six-year-olds have them their
brain is growing at such a rate where
that's the age where they can retain the
most amount of information and well so
what they would do is brainwash these
kids to become assassins and then they
would use it over to trigger it and all
of a sudden they've got this you know
this this army of trained assassins
because they were brainwashed when I was
six so maybe that's what they're kind of
talking about yeah we should show the
violent way yep get him get him smarter
when they're five that's what I'm yeah
tell him to stop watching I don't know
Blue's Clues Clues is supposed to be Ben
Ben 10 big hero 6 there you go all right
up next Joseph said I would like to help
kids understand the universe how it
works and how it came to be plus the
show's would cause me to learn more hey
Joseph I think it's a great point and I
think that usually kids will go through
either a dinosaur or a space or both
phase I remember sensors I was nine
space dinosaurs who love them um I was
nine when I really i had this book and i
wanted to know more about stars the Sun
and found out that the star was a Sun
and the Sun was a staff that careful
thought that being nine yeah but I also
think it's recognized square squares
with whatever yeah but knowing that you
know trivial matters on the planet as
well they're so small you know anyway I
just expect a glimpse in like a whole
lot of almost nothingness so to know
more about space I think will help keep
with possible mental complex I agree I
mean this is why we like Bill Nye the
Science Guy cuz he tapped into that the
kids must Dale interest into yeah when
we were younger so it was like yes
really I we didn't get bill nice suckers
our next one is from Rick he says a show
about teaching kids the etiquettes of
the internet yeah good look at that
that's nice belt etiquette I know but
I'm just reading it Oh light TTI qu this
isn't okay like why you should not use
LOL and a personal conversation like
wait so somebody's like lol like
actually LOL and head height if i write
something and i just get lowell as a
response or if it's a normal sentence
for like hey you wanna grab lunch Lowell
I'm like how was that funny nobody said
did you laugh because I wasn't laughing
because that's not a funny thing to say
hello but teaching the etiquettes of the
internet is great yes
I think that'd be cool but it's it's
gonna be hard to unlearn it's gonna be
hard down and learn everything that
we've learned so far responsible for
what you put out there I'm the comments
that you make juggling is dumb I don't
know that they put that on every
tomorrow daily to go juggling is dumb
who's juggling I can juggle all right so
last our last buddy's a user feedback is
of course our photog refer of the day
yeah you do need it okay so uh Hanlon
Lou yes sent us a picture this is from
an xperia z1 that's like the first time
we've ever had like an xperia on the
show so that's impressive uh there's no
story for this it's as cold as ice yeah
we don't know where it is can you guess
where it is where this photos from well
I know that there's a huge Blizzard all
throughout like New York Chicago all of
that area so i'm guessing it's just
yellow dinner phone hey you're in los
angeles where it's perfect weather all
year round including winter check out
this paul dudes bike oh yeah no it's ice
man's bike I don't think it's pretty
cool I talk in Celsius again sorry being
the Australian and the foreigner in here
