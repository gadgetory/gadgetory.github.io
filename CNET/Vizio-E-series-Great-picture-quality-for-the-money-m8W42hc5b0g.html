of the company's least expensive TVs for
2015 but it still has great picture
quality and is excellent overall value
no it doesn't have 4k resolution but for
a 1080p TV this thing produces a really
good picture we'll get to all that in a
little bit but first let's check out the
styling of this set it's black all
around there's really very little accent
going on here along the edge is a very
thin bezel seen from the side it's
actually going to be deeper than some of
the LCD TVs out there but again nobody
watches TV from the side the big
difference from last year styling wise
is it uses these two feet on either side
which are splayed relatively wide
instead of a central stand it's a little
bit more stable than we tested last year
but on the flip side if you have a
relatively narrow cabinet you want to
put this thing on top of you got to
watch it make sure this TV fits the
e-series is available in sizes from 24
all the way up to 70 inches above but
only the 40 inch and larger sizes get
local dimming local dimming is the real
feature improvement here it allows the
TV to dim different areas of the screen
according to picture content to create
great contrast and in the lab that
really improved the picture compared to
some other LCDs the TVs that don't have
local dimming we really like the
contrast and pop on this TV and again
for a 1080p TV that's relatively
inexpensive great picture quality good
enough for pretty much everybody
color accuracy and bright word
performance on this TV were also very
good in terms of features you get Smart
TV which includes a good selection of
apps they're available through a
relatively simple interface here along
the bottom now it's not going to be
updated or respond as quickly as
something like a Roku or an Apple TV but
on the other hand it's pretty good for a
smart TV suite depending on size the
e-series has from 2 to 4 HDMI inputs and
plenty of connectivity in terms of
analog and other jacks there's also a
USB port for photo video and music
playback otherwise the feature set is
pretty basic including a relatively
simple remote which is what you'd expect
from TV in this price range and that's a
look at videos eseries when the least
expensive and best values for 2015 I'm
