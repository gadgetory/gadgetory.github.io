Volvo thinks yes we're taking a look at
it phone as key app here at Mobile World
Congress in Barcelona so the way the app
works is it uses a Bluetooth connection
with the car so that when you're nearby
the car automatically unlocks now Volvo
says that there are three main
advantages to having a phone handle your
car keys responsibilities the first is
personal convenience it's just one fewer
thing that you have to carry around with
you you can leave the car keys at home
the second is that you can share access
to your car so for example if you're in
another country and your car is back
home and someone else in your family
wants to use it you can grant them
access on their smartphone so that they
can get into the car the third could be
to hire and unlock a rental vehicle so
you can see here we're using the app
this is just a demo of course but you
can go to these screens find the car
you're looking for pirate and that car
is yours to use if you're loaning
someone access to the car then you can
set the end time for that access and
they can also virtually return the key
to you now obviously if you're watching
this you might be immediately having
some security worries like what if
someone steals your phone will they then
be able to get access to your car
without your permission
that's a valid concern I suppose one
thing you have to weigh it against is
how secure a car key is at least if
someone steals your phone then you can
disable access via the app you will also
of course have to make sure that your
phone stays charged you wouldn't want to
be traveling home from work at the end
of the day having left your car keys at
home and your phones died you might be
looking up bus timetables on a friend's
phone in that situation over Volvo's
keen to point out that this isn't going
to replace car keys in the near future
it's just a nice little extra so this
system is going to get a pilot scheme in
the spring let me know what you think
obviously we're putting loads more
information on our smart phones is that
a sensible use of great technology or
are there potential hazards ahead that
we might not have foreseen let me know
