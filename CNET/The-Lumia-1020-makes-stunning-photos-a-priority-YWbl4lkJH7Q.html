we're at nokia's launch event in New
York for the new Nokia Lumia 1020 this
basically Falls up the 920 and it runs
windows phone 8 Microsoft's operating
system it has pretty much the same basic
specs on the inside as the 920 I see a
very large LCD screen and the same sort
of polycarbonate coating but on the back
you have a a 41 megapixel camera from
Nokia which is extremely powerful it has
a xenon flash and that's something you
only find in you know pointed shoot
cameras things like that and it
basically can do something called over
sampling which essentially takes a ton
of information that wants and packs it
into your photo so you can zoom in
extremely tightly and you know share
that and see a lot of details that you
would have missed in another more
standard photograph as you can tell it's
running a Windows 8 operating system I
have the same menu features here
learning a lot of apps some of the
things that they say that they've been
talking about today has been the nokia
camera app which offers lots of ways to
adjust the exposure settings and a lot
of the other camera features just by
sliding a little display on the screen
as you can see you can you can pull this
out and get this really funky sliding
interface here you can adjust the iso by
going like this you can can change all
sorts of features here just by using
this interface on the touchscreen pretty
nice you do actually have a choice of
accessories that you can get with the
lumia 1020 one of them is a camera grip
which will actually attached to the back
cover screen i believe stick on the back
and add extra battery capacity as well
as a grip so you can hold the camera
better while i was taking photos you can
also get a a backing that will actually
add wireless charging to the device it's
not actually built into the phone itself
but you can add that
the fact it does believe make the phone
a little bit thicker so that's something
you might want to think about before you
go that route another feature that the
Nokia is talking about is their new
updates the map software and there's a
feature here that they call which
enables you to look at an all automated
reality view of the places and items you
search for so here we are we're doing a
little search for the subways around us
you can see we're looking through the
camera and we see a little radar of that
turns as you tilt the device and it
shows items of interest and how close
they are to you you can see you know the
results that are nearby all in all it's
a pretty interesting way to sort of get
augmented reality into your search and
that is the nokia maps feature we're
just taking a little twirl here just to
see what it's all about it's a little
bit thinner than the the first 920 the
original 920 device so that's pretty
nice there you have it folks we took a
first look at nokia's brand new Lumia
1020 I'm Brian Bennett for cnet com</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
