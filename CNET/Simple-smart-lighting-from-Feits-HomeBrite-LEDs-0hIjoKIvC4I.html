smarter lighting but you don't
necessarily want to have an extra hub
plugged into your router to that end
it's home bright line of smart LEDs will
connect directly with your phone and
with each other over a Bluetooth mesh
network that means you can use each one
straight out of the box just screw it in
connect with your phone you'll be able
to turn on and off remotely or set a
schedule for when it's supposed to turn
on or off on its own the cheapest is
this a shaped bulb here for fifteen
dollars and then this candelabra LED
cost about nineteen the BR 30 floodlight
here sells for twenty the par 38 you can
use outside and even in the rain about
thirty dollars and this recessed fixture
here sells for thirty five still they
aren't cheap and you want them to work
well the most part in my test they did
they're nice and bright they do a very
good job managing heat better than other
Bluetooth bulbs that I've tested and
these scheduling features do work well
you can set them to turn on when you're
out of Bluetooth range and they'll
remember to do so by reminding each
other what time it is
that's a cool feature and it worked most
of the time there were a couple of
hiccups times the bulbs wouldn't turn on
or wouldn't turn off at the right time
and that was a little bit frustrating I
kept needing to go back into the app to
tweak an automation or reset a schedule
that sort of defeats the purpose you
want to be able to program these lights
and then never use that app again for
the most part just let them do their
thing automatically I couldn't quite do
that with these bulbs you also can't
control these bolts from outside of
Bluetooth train the way you can in bulbs
it used Wi-Fi or connect to a hub and
even when you are in Bluetooth range I
sometimes found that the app wasn't that
accurate I'd pull up a bulb that was
shining right in front of me and the app
would say it was off still I like these
bulbs in spite of the glitches
especially because you get such a
variety of shapes here there aren't a
lot of par38 shaped bulbs you can use
outside or candelabra LEDs that have
radios in them this is kind of unique
and kind of interesting if you have a
single light you want to upgrade but if
you're doing the whole home I probably
go with something more alive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
