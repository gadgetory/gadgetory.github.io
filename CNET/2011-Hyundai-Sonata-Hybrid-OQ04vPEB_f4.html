enough just for earning a seat on the
board alongside the Camry the Accord and
the fusion now it joins the Green
Committee let's drive the 2011 Hyundai
Sonata Hybrid and check the tech the
Sonata Hybrid is the sister ship of the
Kia Optima Hybrid which you may have
already seen our video of the two differ
mostly in styling and a few features
they share a hybrid powertrain and
importantly with a newish technology
like that also share about the best
warranty in the business now most
hybrids these days have some kind of an
eco mode even greener than standard
hybrid drive on this guy it's this
button here they call it blue or with
that weird accent mark is that blue a I
don't know anyway you can see it
happened here on the centre display that
turns into blue Drive brings you to this
display here which is almost identical
to the same head unit we saw in the
sister ship the Kia Optima Hybrid fuel
economy this gives you a set of two and
a half minute time slices of how greenly
you drove in that window the more of
those little Leafs the better obviously
energy flow is one of those things you
won't see in a few years it explains
what a hybrid does car is the one that
tells you what your eco level is in the
driving session more bars is better they
get green toward the right if you last
one that I have no idea what it does is
Earth this is telling me apparently that
my engine and my electric motor are
contributing to turning the earth I
don't think that's the case
now all that technology in the Optima
that's also in the Sonata is wrapped in
a different look and feel look around
this car it's a little more I don't know
what kind of competing with Camry where
the Optima is competing more with out
ease it's a different language this may
strike you as more handsome or you might
think it's kind of gaudy the Optima may
strike you as handsome or you may think
it's kind of faddish it's kind of a pick
your media options on this car are
really good they load it up nicely all
the way from your aux USB ipod down here
which they've been doing along
time in these cars these guys were early
on in that they do want you to use a
special hybrid cable to get your iPod in
there now one choice on the gearbox as
is common on hybrids because the whole
powertrain is carefully balanced with
its different power sources and the
all-important transmission logic here
it's going to be a 6-speed automatic
it's a true automatic by the way not a
CVT so it's actually got six actual
specific gears and you've got a basic
PRN D gate on the left you've got the
shiftable gate over here as well no
paddles though now the hybrid powertrain
in this car begins with this 2.4 litre
inline-four gas engine of course it's an
Atkins and cycle motor that's an engine
that is laid out with its timing so that
it really fully burns the whole fuel
charge almost to a fault scrubbing off
some of the torque you amplify that back
in by having an electric motor here of
course being a hybrid so all in we have
206 horsepower 195 foot-pounds of torque
that's total for both power sources gets
this guy 216 about nine point two
seconds not bad for a 3600 pound car and
your mileage is of course the point 3540
city and highway and this guy tends to
deliver real world right smack in that
range let's go find out
as with the Optima Hybrid I was kind of
disturbed by the cars powertrain
communicating too much about all the
different modes it switches between that
switching is something a hybrid does yes
but it's not something I want to be that
aware of as in the Optima Hybrid this
package delivers real-world mixed
driving mpg in the low to even mid 30s
and that includes highways traffic and
Hills it's a good number
okay let's place this Hyundai Sonata
Hybrid the blue form of green twenty six
five delivered and rather well equipped
but to take it seen that style you got
to spend five thousand more for the
Premium Package it's actually quite a
deal you're gonna get the GPS navigation
good clean interface you've also got
that incredibly responsive touch screen
HD radio infinity sound leather seats
rear camera that's lit panoramic sunroof
17-inch special alloy wheels it's a
steal at five grand
so load it up that way it's a great
value and you get a nice car that does
what it says it'll do</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
