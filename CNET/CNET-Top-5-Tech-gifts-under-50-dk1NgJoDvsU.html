shopping for the holidays can get
expensive very quickly fortunately cnet
is here to help i'm donna bell and this
top 5 i'll be cutting down some of our
favorite tech gifts under fifty dollars
pulled from the cnet holiday gift guide
and arranged really in no particular
order cuz they're all great gift ideas
starting off at number five a new Wi-Fi
router around $35 the tiny yet mighty
d-link dir-655 end your home Wi-Fi woes
it supports up to 80 22 levin n you can
remotely manage the whole thing using a
smartphone app and it may not be the
sexiest gift in the world but if it
means one less reset of your old dusty
router they'll be grateful at number
four headphones i can't stress this one
enough whether it's for a little extra
base or a little extra style twenty to
fifty dollars can go a long way when it
comes to headphones and over the ears
set like the panasonic rph TX seven gets
you a little bit of both for thirty
dollars more for the same amount there's
the understated motion myth row
headphones are also a subtle
encouragement for your loved ones to
stop blasting those ipad games over the
built-in speaker that said for those who
appreciate a little extra noise there's
number 3 bluetooth speakers now the
speaker dock is dead if it a lot of
people are still mystified about how to
get big sound from their smartphone or
tablet fortunately there are some great
affordable portable bluetooth speakers
out there such as the philip sound
shooter and the cambridge soundworks
boots the names may be silly but a
bluetooth speaker makes a great gift
another wireless wonder comes in at
number two the chromecast Google's $35
hdmi dongle lets you wirelessly beam
your digital media over to your TV it's
a great gift especially for android fans
who already like tinkering with the
latest Google stuff it's also one of the
least expensive options out there to get
your older TV a little bit smarter that
said for an extra fifteen dollars why
not go all out at number one the roku LT
this guy's been around since 2011 but a
steady pace of software updates have
kept it very current $49 this is the
appletv killer that started it all and
it's still a critical weapon for any
aspiring cord cutters comes with nearly
endless amount of apps and contents and
channels but you can also just skip all
that and hit the netflix button right on
the remote and be done with it so there
you go five tech gifts for under fifty
dollars for more great ideas check out
our full holiday gift guide at cnet as
well as videos for the top five gifts
under a hundred dollars and the best of
the best the editors picks from our top
five product categories including phones
laptops tablets TVs all the good stuff
until next time I'm Donald Bell have a
happy holiday</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
