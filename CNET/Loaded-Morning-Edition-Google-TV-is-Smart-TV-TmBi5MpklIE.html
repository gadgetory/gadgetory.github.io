del Conte and it's time to get loaded
google announced details of its TV
project it will be called Smart TV and
it will be built into Internet connected
TVs blu-ray players and set-top boxes
Google is going to work with sony and
logitech to make the gear but then they
will release the software to developers
first in hopes of having applications
and programs for Smart TV by the time it
actually comes to us consumers so
basically this is like Android for
television AT&amp;amp;T is getting the palm pixi
plus the network just got the pre plus
last week it appears as though it will
launch on june six for 4999 with a
contract and a mail-in rebate google has
been ordered to destroy personal data
that was collected from home wireless
networks in 2008 in the UK Google
admitted to having collected this data
last week while the company Street View
vans were gathering images for Google
Maps the information was never made
public but the UK government doesn't
want them to have it at all a new study
shows that consumers are more happy with
their cell phone service than ever
before this comes from the American
Customer Satisfaction Index Sprint's
showed the biggest signs of improvement
the carrier score rose from 63 add 100
to 70 out of 100 let's hope they don't
screw up 4G when the ebo launches next
month and there's a new facebook virus
on the loose if someone sends you a link
telling you to watch the quote sexiest
video ever you must refrain it is not
the sexiest video ever that is a virus
even though the thumbnail image shows a
woman in a miniskirt riding an exercise
bike so you know what to do do not click
and why would you anyway that's not sexy
those are your headlines for now we will
see you later this afternoon with more
so stay tuned I'm Natali del Conte you
seen at TV and you
just loaded</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
