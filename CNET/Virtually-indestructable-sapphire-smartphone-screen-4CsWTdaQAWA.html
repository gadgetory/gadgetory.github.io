screen that's made entirely out of
sapphire sounds pretty crazy expensive
right I'm Jessica doll for CNN here at
mobile world congress 2013 in barcelona
and this is a demo of a sapphire screen
now this isn't the same sapphire jewelry
mind out of the ground that really would
be expensive instead companies can
actually grow crystallized sapphire
which is used today already in many
different industrial applications
military also in aeronautics like in
satellites what I have here is a demo
device that has a piece of solid
sapphire display on top of it so this is
an iphone 5 and they've actually used
some clear adhesive to glue this
sapphire screen on top why would you
want it one of the benefits is that only
diamonds are harder than it so it really
is not going to scratch unless you
usually rake a diamond ring or cross
phone screen demo this we've got a piece
of Barcelona concrete and I've been
plowing away at this phone I've been
hitting it I've been rubbing the
concrete on top of it there are little
dust particles but that's from the
concrete so you can imagine that if you
drop your phone that has this kind of
screen on top of it even if it lay out a
pretty hard impact you can smack this as
much as you want phones fine wipes away
clean what we've got in screens right
now is very good corning gorilla glass
is one of the materials we often use
this is said to be two to three times
stronger than that it is more expensive
to make maybe three to four times more
expensive so it's not something that
you're going to see on every mobile
phone today even tomorrow even probably
in five years you are going to see it on
really specialized phones this would
make a lot of sense on a rugged phone
for example and I'm told that the
sapphire screen is already on premium
phones like ver.2 sapphire is also used
by Apple in the iphone camera
as a lens cover so it does exist today
you're probably wondering if it's as
good for navigating around and it seems
really responsive again this is a
regular iphone with a regular clever and
an extra cover on top of it and it is
very responsive to my touch so that's
pretty cool right good look at our
future I'm Jessica doll court for cnet
