accessories for mobile phones and
tablets but lately it's been making a
serious push into the headphone market
with a line of inexpensive bluetooth
headphones now it's going a bit more
upscale with a set of totally wireless
earphones called the solo liberty plus
it hopes will put a small dent in Apple
earpods sales the earphones aren't due
out till October but anchors launched a
Kickstarter campaign to spur pre-orders
with some enticing sub $100 pricing
eventually the Liberty Plus is set to
retail for $150 and it's worth noting
that it's sweat resistant so you'll be
able to use it at the gym or even run
with it I got a chance to try a
pre-production sample for a short
listening session your phone's fit my
ears snuggly and comfortably
I got a tight seal and thanks to the
little silicone ear hooks that cover the
earbuds they stayed in my ears I did
think they sounded quite good for this
type of totally wireless earphone
offering decent clarity with relatively
plump but well sculpted bass I'll
reserve final judgement on sound quality
until I get a final shipping sample but
my initial impression was that they
sounded better than apples air pods
anchor says the liberty plus will be
Amazon Alexa enabled and support other
voice assistant but those features
weren't available in the early sample I
took for spend battery life is rated at
3.5 hours in the included charging case
allows you to charge the earphones more
than ten times on the go that $150
retail price isn't terrible but the
liberty plus is certainly a more
attractive option at less than $100
while China based anchor is an
established company with lots of
products with any Kickstarter there's a
chance the product will never ship so
proceed at your own risk I'm David
Carnot for cnet.com thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
