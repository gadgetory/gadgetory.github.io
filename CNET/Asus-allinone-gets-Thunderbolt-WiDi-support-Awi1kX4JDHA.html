going to take a look at the Asus 8020
300 inti so this is a 23 inch Windows 8
all-in-one from Asus it costs about
$12.99 so this is a touchscreen
all-in-one like most current Windows 8
PCs but what's probably the most unique
about this PC is that it has pretty much
every current feature we can think of to
add to a system like this so as far as
the basics it's a perfectly serviceable
Windows 8 PC the touch screen works fine
it's nice and responsive
it's a 19 by 10 screen so it's not the
highest resolution we've seen but it
certainly gets the job done the wireless
mouse the keyboard work easily enough as
well there's an external subwoofer here
that plugs into the back it doesn't put
out the best audio quality particularly
at higher volumes but it adds a nice
little boost if you will keep the volume
low enough there's an NVIDIA GeForce GT
6 30 M graphics chip inside so it's not
the fastest for gaming but it'll
certainly play most titles figure if you
keep image quality down for memory and
storage you get 8 gigs of RAM and a
terabyte hard drive at full speed 7200
rpm that's kind of what we expect and in
general the system has some nice
flexibility if it's not the most
attractive new PC out there the screen
tilts down to the point where you can
lay it flat if you want to get into that
sort of tabletop touch experience well
you notice when we tilt it back and
forth it sort of lowers that display
down at the same time now it's certainly
much rather have the ability to lay it
down flat than not at all but it would
be nice to have a little bit more
independent range of motion in terms of
going front to back and up and down no
it's probably most interesting about
this PC though is that asus has included
both thunderbolt ports as well as
intel's wide i wireless display
technology now those features are
interesting that you don't really see
them in a lot of current mainstream all
in once in a PC like this it's targeted
at mainstream consumers and not really
professionals who might want to connect
the fast data array or some other sort
of higher-level peripheral that takes
advantage of the thunderbolt port and
for the wireless display technology yes
I suppose it might be interesting to
send a signal from this computer out to
a TV with a wide receiver on it but why
do I still far from perfect and from set
of difficulties we had connecting it to
an LG TV as well as in general the
latency you get it's really not the best
experience in addition to the core
components that it has HDMI in HDMI out
time 2 USB 3 ports as well as an eSATA
put now all those various ports give you
a ton of flexibility in terms of what
you can connect to the system and it
really makes it a pretty versatile
all-in-one now you can find other
all-in-ones in this price range maybe
look a little better than one from Visio
comes to mind but in terms of pure
features for the dollar the ASIS right
now is one of the best we've seen in
this price Sark's brown this is the asus
