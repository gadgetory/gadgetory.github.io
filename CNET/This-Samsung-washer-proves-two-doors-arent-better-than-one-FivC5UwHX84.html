love about this Samsung front load
washing machine it has 14 cleaning
cycles a massive 5 cubic foot capacity
and it looks really nice in its black
stainless finish I also think the touch
panel is really simple its intuitive
it's easy to use and control so that's
all the good stuff let's get that out of
the way the problem is this gimmicky
hatch like device on the front here it's
called the ad wash the idea is that
you're adding things that you forgot to
add to your cleaning cycle mid-cycle a
sock something else random that you just
forgot to add you can just stick it in
and keep going with your cycle but it
doesn't actually work that way you
actually have to push pause on the
machine anyway and that unlocks both the
main door and the ad wash door so you
might as well just open the main cabinet
to get whatever you want in especially
if it's a bulky item because I'm always
forgetting all kinds of different stuff
not just my tiny items so it's kind of a
cool feature in theory but it doesn't
actually add a lot of value the good
news is that you're not actually
spending a premium on this this is
actually a really high performing
impressive machine so even if you don't
love the ad wash you can still get this
machine and feel good about it
definitely a model I would recommend</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
