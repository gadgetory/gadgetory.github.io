cnet.com and we're taking a first look
at the sony smartband it's a fitness
device and also a activity tracker and
it also logs a whole bunch of stuff that
you do all day long so we're at more
congress 2014 taking a look at the sony
smartband so what exactly does it do so
smart band together with the lifelog
application helps you to record the
things that you do in your life and then
show it in this application here so
you're a different kind of timings
during day would you do different
activities so for instance that twelve
o'clock at noon I was doing some
facebooking and so you can actually see
throughout the day your activities what
you can say is that you have these sony
elements of entertainment activities
that you do that we want to capture here
so going forward in time for instance
let me so basically you can see you can
capture your sleep how much you've
walked on the daytime what music you've
listened to movies I see like even games
there so you can see like where games
you played so all the activities that
you're doing whether it's physical
activities or communication or
entertainment this will be logged in
this journey of you together with having
it in a dashboard view so you can
actually either see it as a graph
and you can set goal for yourself so you
can decide whether you want to walk a
certain amount of steps yeah and then
you can see where you're compared to
gold gotcha and then the band itself is
like a little rubbery silicone sleeve
that you put in the tracker unit which
is called the store by believe or the
core I'm sorry which basically will you
know do all the electronics and sync
wirelessly over bluetooth with any
Android device than that be a sony
xperia smartphone or tablet but it can
be any Android device right now the
smart man is not available but it will
most likely hit the market in about like
q3 I'm assuming it said much March oh
that's right even sooner so in the
spring time you'll be able to see this
in store shelves there's no word yet how
soon is going to come to the US but
hopefully pretty soon after that maybe a
few weeks or a month or so and the
proximate pricing is 99 euro so it'll
probably somewhere in that price range
in the US if you see it and approximate
pricing for that worldwide as well so
there you have it folks we just took a
first look at the brand new sony
smartband i'm brian bennett foreseen it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
