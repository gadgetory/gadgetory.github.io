it's time for episode three thirty two
of the three fifty nine podcast your
host today our Ben Fox ruminant dammit
David Katz Meyer damn it that's in the
cradle oh yeah I'm rocking I'm rocking
welcome welcome back we're gonna be
talking all things TV and CES 2018 today
ready
you just published a story about this so
that's why I wanted to have you on as
always everybody sending your questions
and comments we'll get to as many as we
can at the end of the show and let's try
to get through as many I have so many
questions for you so let's try to get
through as many as we can during the
four minutes and then it'll spill over
into the post show yep stick around
alright hang out everybody we're gonna
record the podcast and then meet you in
the chat in 3 minutes and 59 seconds
from 3 to welcome to the 359 I'm Ben Fox
Ruben David Katz Mayer the CES tech show
is coming in January and with it the
introduction of a lot of new TV
technology I invited David on to walk us
through some of the biggest expected
trends let's start with the easy stuff
HDR 4k how significant are those gonna
be for the show well they're gonna be
kind of the baseline so 4k TVs and HDR
TVs there as cheap as 300 bucks now so
they're everywhere the dissin TV
industry has moved on so CES is kind of
where you see the next step beyond these
technologies what do you think you're
the most excited about as far as any of
those tech so I'm most excited about the
the competition between the
manufacturers at this point so right now
we have a situation where at the high
end of the market its OLED OLED oullette
LG's organic light-emitting diode
technology is kicking everybody's butt
it is the high-end TV that people want
to spend extra money to buy how much is
it like on average like how much would
you spend for something like that well
the cheapest price for a nullity V
actually happened over Black Friday 1500
bucks for a 55 inch TV ok that's
expensive
totally but what I learned myself when I
wrote this article asked MPD which does
a lot of market research the average
selling price is 1700 for TVs that are
more than $1,000 for that coveted high
end of the market that's actually you
know
terrible now it doesn't Samsung make oh
let's I mean like they're very well
known for that for the smaller screens
for the phones funny you should ask
so Samsung is by far the most dominant
brand in televisions the United States
they don't make an all the TV they make
something called Q LED which came out
last year and that I thought they were
trying to be a little you know imitative
of LG well came up with what what is
Hewlett I saw that at Best Buy recently
and I was like I have no idea what that
did they try to write an O and then put
a little thing on it and hope nobody
noticed you know and maybe go home and
people like I have an OLED TV actually
you know there's like there's a little
dot there across the bottom of the oh
it's Q so long story short it's an LED
LCD TV like we've been selling for
they've and sell for years it's not a
brand new technology like OLED the
difference is it uses quantum dots
hence the Q which kind of enhanced the
color of LCD but really it doesn't make
that much of a difference since men of
yeah LED you're not gonna really notice
and I didn't notice when I did
side-by-side comparison with earlier
models it's really subtle the
improvement OLED on the other hand is
like holy crap this TV really looks like
a $1,500 to $2,500
so right now Samsung has been responding
this question for a long time because LG
wrote the book on OLED and they've been
coming out with him for a while
Samsung started actually making OLED but
then they pulled back and made more LCD
LED technology one of the things that
they might do is CES this year is
introduce another competitor to OLED I'm
thinking it might be micro LED or actual
another version of Q LED that's better
tell me about micro LED so LEDs are you
know in lights and pretty much every
lighting thing right now
they also power televisions but they
were behind it LCD liquid crystal
display panel micro LED is gets rid of
that liquid crystal display panel and
just has a bunch of little dots that are
LEDs that can change color the advantage
there you can turn them all the way off
so you get perfect contrast like OLED
they're brighter it's kind of the holy
grail for led Texas pretty similar to
OLED why would it be called something
different well because it's a slightly
different technology yeah and it doesn't
use the same types of
of material so that the LEDs are
different kind so they're not organic
they're they're actually they're saying
them more durable they're actually used
today in industrial lighting and and
those gigantic signs at you know Cowboys
Stadium for example like those are all
LED true LED displays with no liquid
crystal in front of them so for some of
the more futuristic tech stuff voice
control is something that's that's
really growing do you think like gesture
control is really gonna grow at any
point no we're gonna see some of that at
CES no I don't think it well I don't
think the gestures are gonna go anywhere
I think it's all about voice is so much
easier to talk to your TV than wave at
it oh that's too bad but anyway if you
want to read more about these stories
check us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben
David Katz Myer thanks for listening all
right I understood about 2% of that IRA
sweet Hagley fast we packed half an hour
worth of show in four minutes
way to go dude isn't it you're gonna die
and unpack right now but yeah there's
there's there's a lot of leaves and get
into emissive quantum dot which which
I'm guessing is similar to micro LED
it's so much fun so instead of LEDs
their actual quantum dots what is that a
quantum dot is a real thing it's like a
little light emitting device just like
an LED but not they can create color and
they're brighter and the
electroluminescent ones are kind of the
super cutting edge of display technology
they've been again talked about at a
level where there might be concept
display I threw it out there because hue
LED when people really seems like person
ask you let people who follow the
industry were like oh they're coming out
with a mess of quantum dots no it was an
LCD with with LEDs behind it that's
enhanced by quantum dots but now they've
been talking about Sampson to talk about
a concept form actual quantum dots again
without the LCD in front of it so I
guess all these guys want to do is
finally ditch that LCD it's gonna take
years so that all the new technology and
this is extremely simplistic needs to
make tiny tiny dots yep
that can be turned on and off yeah and
so that you've got the true black mmm on
one side and and really bright on the
other it doesn't bleed one way into the
other so Ben you should do this really
yeah did I actually get that right I was
beautiful so yeah I can't wait no
let me ask this how does a lite-brite
technology play into this um it those
dots are really big yeah that's so we
have 4k TVs that's like point zero zero
zero zero 4k TVs but you know what you
got XP and stuff with this man yeah we
didn't even get to also I wanted to
mention streaming apps mm-hmm right
before we went on t-mobile made in
announcements right let's let's touch on
that a little bit so it's not really an
announcement it's kind of like we're
gonna make TV in 2018 so to announce it
announced yeah we haven't give you any
specifics I think there's actually a
call going on right now where CEO John
magar is gonna be talking about it
taking questions and people are gonna
ask so how much is it gonna cost is it
gonna have any channels ago be like
sling TV your Netflix pay TV cuts yeah
so t-mobile the the phone company is
making television just like everybody
else is YouTube this year Hulu DIRECTV
yes sling TV which is run by DISH
Network all these guys have their own
cord cutter TV packages that you know we
cover in depth and and there's a lot of
them out there so this isn't like you
know they're reinventing the wheel this
is like oh a phone company's doing this
- we actually a phone company AT&amp;amp;T
already does it because they bought
DirecTV and they have a DirecTV now
which everybody jump into it is getting
the phone the field will get called at
some point well I don't know it seems to
be just expanding at this point you know
it's it's an opportunity and people
looking into there's no cable companies
and going wow people really hate them
let's see if we can make some money off
of that don't you think
does you think that could create a
problem for t-mobile that like they
would be viewed as a cable company and
then people would hate them I don't know
that all that like edgy reputation yeah
they're doing their best not to they're
using a lot of pink you know there's no
cable company that does that so I think
they're they're there and good all right
let's take some questions from the
comments section on the video today
Michael Brown by the way then you want
to say something happy birthday Michael
Brown happy birthday Michael Brown we
will we be raving about buying 8k
televisions in 2018 Best Buy
blockbusters well funny you should ask
because another rumor out of Korea is
that Samsung will be producing well 8k
TVs will take a step back have been
shown at CES for years in fact in the
article is a picture of me looking
really close at an 8k TV because that's
the problem is that you can't frickin
tell the difference yes you get a bus
but I was about that are so small that
but 8k gives you a justification going
back to LCD for using LCD technology
because that is a big limitation of
these you know individual diode
technologies that you can't really get
those things really small and really
bright with an LCD in front you can get
them small enough to make 8k
so all these LCD TV that you wouldn't
throw out LCD technology entirely no and
and and if you're an LCD TV maker you
got us money vested in making you know
LCDs you go wow how can we keep this
around and 8k is a really good reason do
that the problem with 8k obviously is
unless you're in Japan and you know
you're watching a couple things there's
nothing there's nothing in 8k I don't
like how big does your TV have to be and
how close do you need to be sitting next
to it remember that is from a few years
ago and 4k came out and it's really
similar because it needs to be even
bigger and you need to have even better
eyesight and sit even closer I have to
see horrible eyesight right so you're
fine with the 720p or the like right
television part looks great you look
like a giant blob to me so I don't think
I'm a customer for a cake so in your
experience and what you're seeing
developed right now where do you think
the priorities lie between the actual
quality of audio video and integrating a
lot of more smart home technologies what
are you seeing what do you think they
should be focusing on well I I really
have always been a video quality guy but
there is a point of diminishing returns
so you get to a point where everybody
goes that's good enough
where's that's really good right
absolutely we're at NIST the point the
the TCL Roku TV which have been kicking
butt on Amazon is the most proper TV on
Amazon for more than a year and I
recommended everybody they're great
televisions they build smart right in
there and they do a really good job make
them easy to use and they're hella cheap
and for most people they look good
enough so you know unless you're in that
10% of the market that's buying a TV
that cost more than a thousand dollars
you know you don't really care about all
this stuff you just want you know a TV
that's gonna turn on and give you you
give your stories whether it's on
YouTube or you know a Netflix or regular
cable
I want my stories yeah and as long as
you can do that
and wash yourself with a broom on a
stick you're in good shape yeah you
definitely need to wash yourself with a
broom is that good I want my MTV Danny
Green I want to when they are going to
start shipping TVs with ATSC 3.0 to
nurse ooh so that's still a little bit
far out I don't think you're gonna see
any announced at CES they just finalized
the 80s c 3.0 spec in fact I think
they're still working on some aspects of
it so that's not gonna be a 2018 thing
maybe 2019 the other thing that this
brings up is hdmi 2.1 which is another
future spec i totally know what these
things are yes ATSC is sorry a standard
for transmission of over-the-air
television broadcasts so if you turn on
your TV and into oakum antenna to it the
reason you're able to get a picture is
because of DTSC so all the tuners and
televisions now are ATSC compliant and
this is the latest standard of that got
it
HDMI is how you plug stuff into your
television so all those HDMI inputs are
gonna be upgraded not next year but
probably the following year to a 2.1
spec which you know gets them ready for
8k and 16k and you know all that good
stuff that's eventually coming taking
taking this a step back for a second
here what what do you see the TV TV
market doing as far as like how excited
are people about these TV technologies
are they working and actually getting
people to upgrade TVs I remember a
couple years ago there was a lot of
concern that you know hold on to your TV
for five ten years whatever yeah so is
it working to actually convince people
to move to 4k or you LED or whatever
well I think it's working by attrition
so right now it's really hard to find a
1080p TV at a certain screen size if
you're buying a 50-inch TV it's gonna be
4k for example and that's just going to
continue to be the trend and and the
larger picture of the TV markets flat
you know it's not a high-growth market
the same thing with cell phones by the
way you know those are relatively flat
marks but you're not seen as the huge
money maker that they used to be and
with TVs you know all they're gonna do
is iterate on the technology that they
have now and you know again try to get
ahead of trends like streaming
and you know all these things that voice
things that are happening in the larger
technology space and integrate them in
the TVs make them work better so one of
things I'm excited about is this
improvement of voice technology being
able to talk using an Alexa or a Google
home that can control your TV you don't
use you the remote or anything like that
you can just say you know hey Alexa you
know I want to watch stranger things and
your tv turns on which is super
beneficial and you think about the
keyboard for every single one of the
remotes just stinks and it's dunk for
years yeah so very few people I know
that actually have a physical keyboard
to operate their television and we're
ready for voice in the living room to
play a large bigger role and the TV
manufacturers that get ahead of that and
more importantly partner with the guys
that already do voice really well that
are well entrenched Amazon and Google
you know then they're gonna get ahead we
were ready decades ago for voice control
I can't tell you how many tutorial
classes I had to give my grandparents
and how to use a TV remote yeah yeah
Roku does have its own voice control yes
have a streamer yes a Roku streamer that
does that and it's it's okay yeah it's
not bad
yeah and the issue there is that you
have to hold the remote yes so what
we're talking about is is Alexa is
Google home is one of these far field
speakers that's listening all the time
ready to help you watch the TV show you
want without having to you don't even
have to pick up there you know what
that's we had to like pick up a remote
it sometimes was across the room and you
get a freaking get up no hold it
sometimes the remote got lost I didn't
get a remote all the time I can't stop
thinking about this scene from 30 rock
when Tracy Morgan's character is trying
to eat he thinks he's got a voice
control TV so a television and some of
your recent comments might have actually
been beneficial to Jesse gaben in the
chat who's wondering if it's worth
buying a 1080p TV or should you just go
ahead and jump forward to 4k as a
baseline it all depends on the size so
you know we really liked TCL's s 305
series which is their 1080 P series in
43 and smaller TVs if you're putting a
TV that's smaller than that bedroom you
know secondary TV even if you know you
really don't have a very limited space
there's no reason
- the main thing is that you just can't
find them in the larger screen size so
don't go out there oh I really want a
50-inch 1080p TV because I can't tell
this with 4k I'm gonna save some money
you go to the store and you're like
there aren't any they just stopped
existing right why yeah they're there
this year was basically a turning point
for that sighs and then next year they
might be only 40 you know - and lower
you know whatever it's not only that
like you said the the pricing on the 4k
and HDR TVs 300 bucks yeah 300 bucks is
a pretty good price for a TV yeah yeah
for you know forty three inch so you
know and and you're not there's very
little premium again there's just
there's just a cut-off where we're 1080p
is is is gonna exist at the smaller
sizes and that's it
let's jump back and take some more
questions the okay Channel how much of
the TV market goes back into the actual
television studios like how much do they
put in towards this market how much do
they invest as far as content creators
is there any contribution towards
development of new technology to deliver
their content mmm
well I don't know yeah I I think the
best answer to that is HDR so one of the
things that is techn outing with with
the TV technology recently is high
dynamic range which is a kind of thing
that nobody really asks for but is
awesome
so 4k is one thing it's more pixel but
HDR you know the easiest way to say it's
better pixels and the idea about HDR is
it allows the camera which captures way
more the cameras that the you know
producers use to create movies and
halloween particularly these days are
freaking awesome to get the picture that
they see in their mastering studios to
your house it gets dumbed way down so
HDR is an attempt to get the directors
you know awesome picture onto your into
your living room TV and and and it's a
whole set of standards that creates a
much closer to what the director wants
to do picture then on your television
home so now they have a system for doing
that and and HDR is is exciting a lot of
people in Hollywood Netflix is really
leading the HDR revolution they have
Dolby vision kind of a mandate for all
their original series if you go on to
give any HDR TV you flip through all the
Netflix originals almost all them are an
HDR and Dolby vision and all the new
movies coming out are taking advantage
technology and directors love it because
all
sudden all the stuff that they were
cutting out colors dynamic range which
is the pop of the image is is you know
when you have a blu-ray that doesn't
have HDR on it it looks completely muted
compared to HDR in general so I think
that's one of the bigger wins for
content creators is this new HDR
standards and and they're just gonna
keep getting more and more affordable
right and that's what's interesting to
me is that some of these technologies
you actually signify a real improvement
from you know your past 1080p as opposed
to just telling people oh the the screen
looks nicer yeah
spend more money getting another
television and and and especially if you
can't see it you know if you got a sit
two feet away from a 65 inch TV to tell
the difference and it doesn't matter to
anybody and with HDR it really is a
noticeable difference especially because
it's early days now but they're gonna
get it better and better and better
and it's a great you know reason if
you're especially your high-end buyer to
upgrade yeah hey yo remember see Artie's
no painting dreams reminding us like
once upon a time you had to get off your
butt and go twist a knob and further
right so ya change a channel I was when
I first came up reviewing TVs we had
like 34 and 38 inch CRTs you know we
guys you put them on a wagon you know to
get Sony made the flat ones so they're
the flat Trinitron tubes so the problem
was you have to curve it to get the
electron gun to work but the corners of
the flat were like these chunks of glass
they're massive these tvs weighed you
know two three four hundred pounds
depending on the size the Lord they're
insane Mitsubishi made a 40 inch CRT so
yeah they're not really missed by me I
had one that was close to 100 pounds and
it was in a wood box yeah and I had the
the rounded edge curved screen inside
but it was encased in a plastic flat
panel it's almost like it was some weird
like like a protection yeah and it was a
total detriment cuz that thing got
scratched the hell yeah right so I'm
already looking through like a filtered
screen to get on the screen yeah that
thing was my daughter box replacement
for that I lived it on the porch of my
apartment at college when I moved out
was like that's not coming with me
that's though along the side of
everybody's throwing up the CRT monitor
is in their TVs one thing I also wanted
to mention from your story today why's
there there's some maybe these are
gimmicky tell me if they are but there
were some flashy ideas for
recent CES is yeah one of them was the
the first wallpaper TV oh yeah there was
another one where what was it it was
like a rollable television and then a
third one I wanted to get to why's the
screen itself was the speaker yes
something weird like that did any of
those like excite you or you were
interested in them or were they more
gimmicky kind of like let's show it off
at a tech show mhm so good question
because that's what CES is for the most
part a lot of the news at CES is concept
crap that you're never going to make it
to market the two of those three are
actually right now available for sale
the the the wallpaper TV LG makes it
it's an OLED TV it's literally like I
think it's two millimeters thin yeah
that was the whole deal the show yeah
that was the coolest thing ever right
and if I mean literally like who
wouldn't want that who does like
minimalism it's freaking awesome and of
course it's really expensive but you
know that's the future of television I
think it's easy to for anybody to see
and and the roll up roll pun was a
concept but they're actually saying this
year that LG might try to commercialize
it so that's another rumor out of Korea
is what end
I don't know question smokable you know
I'm not sure what you do with your old
of television if you want them you get
you know your dog with it when they
misbehaves that's that's terrible
speaking of smokeable let's get
existential right for a second ready
smokeable televisions yeah well dad's
asking what is smaller than quantum oh
my god
as Rin Joyce says string theory
streaming technologies string technology
you know how close you have to sit to a
string TV to tell the difference you
have to be in the string TV you do if
you sit too close to the string TV you
will get sucked into it and you'll end
up in a black there's a 3d TV died right
but with string TV you can have eight
DTV amazing and you just keep going you
might meet they're all held up in really
small these dimensions but that's right
I got it smoked my TV alright so to
close it out let's do a couple of just
rapid-fire ideas about where we think
we're going industrially is that word
yeah sir enjoy as a should Samsung take
a different route of voice assist and
push big speed into the Smart TVs try to
take
lead in the market we may very well see
that it already announced it it won't
fail just like everything else but yeah
they now sit yeah and Michael Brown I
think TV manufacturer should mainly
focus on vertical integration of audio
and video I love how Sony productions
shot with Sony hardware and software
look really good on Sony televisions no
I'm not enough of a connoisseur to
really tell the difference yeah me
neither
but good on you if you can maybe a Sony
makes some of the best production the
the reference monitor for all Hollywood
studios is an OLED 34 inch TV that they
use Sony makes an older TV and it's a
frickin awesome unit I think it's the 40
grand the liberal media industry is
going with like the Amazon Studios and
being all pissy with YouTube and yeah
but you can still get Amazon Prime
original creations on your amazon firetv
stick that we think we're gonna see more
stuff like that like more while
gardening noni studios special featured
bonus content on sony sony doesn't have
like it sony is not a new tagging
company anymore they don't have the ego
or to play well if you're Sony Pictures
do you want to be only on Sony TVs or do
you want to actually be on you know the
other 95% of TVs out there I mean they
did there are two separate businesses
and the hoos sony to be you know watch
better than they feel as possible but
yeah I think vertical makes a little bit
sense but I think just working together
is the things proven with Sony for
example their televisions work with
Google's Android TV yep and that got
them on board with Google home before
anybody else the operating system is is
almost as good as Roku in some ways
that's better and you know they're
they're really smart for ditching their
own you know frankly crappy Smart TV and
going with Google's much more well
developed one that's got better apps in
the audio yeah and going back to the
YouTube Amazon oh yeah this fight going
on right now dirty it's it's hurting the
both of them so the expectation at least
for me is that at some point it is going
to be settled because because they're
neither of them are winning it's just a
simple pissing match well aim this
before reminds me of cable must carries
where you get the note like oh horizon
is about to drop see be it whatever it
is you know that CBS never seen never
ever no natural
yeah so all these guys you know it's
it's a it's it's the new age of you know
carriage of disagreements sounds so
wonderful yeah I can't wait til the
broker suddenly drops you Hulu or
whatever hopefully hopefully exactly
like just just wait like that all right
we are out of time we do have one more
show this week though and that'll be the
fine one more like and that'll be
tomorrow morning just want to let
everyone know we are going to be going a
little early around 10:00 a.m. Eastern
Time tomorrow morning for the grand
finale and we'll really all be all that
