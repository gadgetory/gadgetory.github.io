performance modifications and the Shelby
gt350 was born fifty years later Ford
has a new Shelby gt350 a heavily
modified new generation Mustang and it
is pure manageable muscle during a Ford
sponsored event at the Mazda Laguna Seca
Raceway I got to experience both the
Shelby GT 350 and the shelby gt350r
variant on the track and it was a
revelation
quite a bit has changed in 50 years the
2016 Ford Shelby gt350 sports a 5.2
liter aluminum block v8 making 526
horsepower and 429 pound-feet of torque
without the aid of a turbo or
supercharger redline is all the way at
8250 rpm Ford noted the Shelby uses a
flat-plane crankshaft which allows
better exhaust flow from the cylinders
and contributes to the tremendous engine
sound from this car I was expecting a
beast of a car but the Shelby gt350
turned out to be completely manageable
rolling out a new the due to Sega's pit
lane I could easily modulate the power
in first gear for a gentle start
flooring it up the tracks main straight
growing through the gears from second
third and up to four
I easily hit a hundred miles per hour it
turned one the grip was amazing making
the gt350 feel less like a muscle car
and more like a nimble sportscar
equipped with the Track Pack option
gt350 also has a magnetic ride
suspension my favorite type of adaptive
suspension system helping to hold the
car flat in the turns the gt350r variant
uses the same powertrain but his better
Aero effects and comes with carbon fiber
wheels knocking the wheel weight down by
about half putting this car through the
turns it felt light and easy with even
more precise turnin and strong grip as a
performance car the 2016 Ford Shelby
gt350 is a bargain coming in at a base
price of forty thousand six hundred
ninety five dollars delivered it is
tremendously satisfying on the track and
yet easily manageable on the street</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
