get into their dream schools they have a
new tool LinkedIn the professional
social network recently launched
university pages which offer online
snapshots of colleges you're in the
right place that's right LinkedIn it
just made sense to work in conjunction
with the universities so that they could
communicate to say prospective students
or help students understand where they
could go post graduation or help alumni
re-engage back with the University there
are 23,000 pages representing
universities all over the world of those
about 1,500 pages are managed by the
school's themselves the university pages
can also reveal the types of students
the school is seeking I can start to
look at the freshmen sophomores of a
university look at their profiles how
they develop their profile what they put
on there it starts to give me an idea of
the breadth of experiences they brought
in for young self-starters like 17 year
old Canadian student Patrick Mont
LinkedIn is a virtual career counsellor
well it allows me to create people in
all honesty it allows me to find people
that I think have a really cool job and
see where they went to school what their
first job was kind of the path that
they've taken to get to where they are
today but even with limited work
experience kids can create strong
profiles using LinkedIn's
student verticals feature so as you edit
your profile you can add things like
coursework things that you're learning
in the classroom publications that
you've been quoted in high schoolers
should also emphasize volunteer work and
tap their network for endorsements
another LinkedIn benefit it could give
you a direct connection with someone in
admissions Geoff Schiffman of Tulane
admissions says he recently received his
first LinkedIn request from a
prospective student he accepted it
unlike the Facebook request sent his way
whereas Facebook is going to be pictures
of your social life and I think LinkedIn
I think it's universally recognized as a
different form a form that's much more
for advancement in your career or
allowing others to see your resume and
your skill set and what your
she knew about you know in the workforce
another reason to give your LinkedIn
profile the old college try
in San Francisco I'm suma das Cena for
