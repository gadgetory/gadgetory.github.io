conference in Los Angeles checking out
all oculus new announcement today we saw
some new after Samsung's gear VR we got
two new touch experiences for oculus
rift and the touch controllers we got
check out a bunch of cool games let's
hit the highlights first up was the
arcade for the Samsung gear VR now this
was really cool I got to check out a
bunch of arcade machines playing classic
game I started with Santa Hedgehog too
but it gets a little distracting because
you turn to your left you tend to your
right and there's just another coup like
a game you want to check out next up was
twitch this one took place in a virtual
reality skater you're sitting with the
bunch of strangers and pretty comfy
looking chairs and you're watching a
twitch stream and there's the usual
twitch banter going on the sides but
you're having conversation of your own
turn to your left to your right and
there's a flower or maybe a blond lady
or sitting on the chair next to you now
my favorite virtual reality experience
has always been job simulator 2050 it's
exactly what it sounds like you're
simulating someone who has a job now
there are lots of robots having around
and they're all really rude to humans
which kind of explains where there are
no humans around but you sort of pretend
like you know you're sending a fax or
you're making copies or you're turning
on your computer but you've got a plug
of interest and there's lots of weird
hand motions you've got to figure out
but it's a lot of fun and the last game
I checked out with bullet train now this
one is ridiculous it's a first person
shooter sort of you have to grab guns
that are lying around the environment
and you're shooting at enemies the
enemies are kind of dumb it's more of a
tech demo than a proper game but the
enemies are sort of charging at you and
you're shooting at them but you can slow
down time you can teleport to different
areas of the map you want to dive away
from enemies but why you slowing on time
you can pluck bullets and missiles out
of the air and throw them at people it
doesn't make any sense really but that's
why it's so much fun and finally there's
medium now this is probably my favorite
out of the entire Bunch it's putting it
to clay sculpting simulator in one hand
you've got a paint brush and the other
hand you've got a tool that modifies
that brush maybe turns the brush into an
actual spray cam that's going to
paint whatever you're playing maybe is
going to turn the brush into something
that's going to extrude clay or shrink
it or inflate it or race it or smooth
out rough edges you've got a lot of
tools to work with but they're all
really simple to figure out and then you
pretty much left to your own devices so
if and this is piqued your interest you
can pick up the new gear VR for ninety
nine dollars in November and you can
pick up the oculus rift early next year
I'm late Ralph be sure to check out all
