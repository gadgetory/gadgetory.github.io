impress in the specs Department its
price was hard to beat this year
Motorola is back with another version of
its budget priced Android handset the
Moto e 4G LTE and not only does the new
phone have better hardware but a brand
new design both inside and out I'm Bill
Detweiler and this is cracking open
compared to the Moto e the 4G LTE s
hardware is a definite step up
it's 4.5 inch display looks good hello
it's not 1080p it has a 1.2 gigahertz
quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor and
Adreno 306 GPU eight gigs of internal
storage one gig of ram a 5 megapixel
camera a 30 290 milliamp hour battery
and of course 4G LTE connectivity it
also ships with Android lollipop 5.0
point 2 now those specs aren't stellar
compared to most high-end flagship
phones but given the Moto E's $150 u.s.
price there are pretty good value now
along with the hardware changes Motorola
also significantly changed the phone's
external and internal design instead of
a removable back cover the phone has a
removable plastic rim that hides the SIM
card and microSD card slots also gone
are the external case screws now to open
this phone you'll have to go through the
front so let's get cracking
after removing the phone's plastic rim
we can use a heat gun hairdryer
microwavable warmer or other heating
device to warm the edges of the front
panel just enough to loosen the glue
that holds it to the plastic body then
gently pry the front panel and display
assembly away from the body disconnect
its ribbon cable and ultimately set it
aside next to come out is a thin metal
plate that covers much of the main
circuit board after removing more than a
dozen screws including one hiding under
the earpiece and disconnecting the
battery cable you can remove a black
plastic bracket along
the bottom edge of the phones case and
then ultimately the circuit board now
unfortunately the metal shields that
cover the board's processor Ram storage
and other chips are soldered in place
likewise the battery is glued to the
plastic case now as I want to put this
phone back together in working order not
destroy it I'm afraid our cracking open
ends here from a teardown standpoint the
Moto e 4G LTE is a mixed bag on the
downside the front panel is held to the
case with adhesive and not screws or
physical snaps there are more than a
dozen screws inside the case and many
internal components are soldered to the
circuit board making them impractical to
replace now on the plus side once you're
inside the phone removing the internal
Hardware is relatively easy and at least
all the screws are the same size now for
more information on the Moto e 4G LTE
including real world tests and pricing
