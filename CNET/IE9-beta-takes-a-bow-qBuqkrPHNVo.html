Bakalar and it's time to get loaded
Microsoft has released a beta version of
internet explorer 9 and early reviews
are quite positive the new browser now
extensively supports web standards like
html5 and css3 features a new
minimalistic user interface and
microsoft claims that everything is
hardware accelerated in a bit of a
surprise ie9 also allows users to pin
web apps to the taskbar unfortunately
the new beta only works with windows 7
and windows vista machines so if you're
running XP you're out of luck craigslist
has announced that it will not be
reopening its adult services section
after shutting it down earlier this
month following pressure from lawmakers
William Clint Powell the company's
director of customer service says those
who formerly posted adult services ads
on Craigslist will now just advertise on
countless other venues and he's exactly
right the open-source facebook
competitor diaspora has released the
source code to their project for now the
software is still in heavy development
but intrepid geeks can install the
software themselves on their own servers
for now diaspora can share messages and
photos privately with your friends all
in encrypted form the developers plan to
add facebook integration and data
portability in their next release apple
has released a developer version of iOS
4.2 the new software finally brings the
ipad up to par with the iphone and ipod
touch but also packs a few new features
developers will now be able to test
airplay which will stream movies photos
and music to any compatible device and
airprint which will let you print to any
printer shared on a mac or pc or
wirelessly to compatible printers eager
testers will need the latest version of
Mac OS 10 Snow Leopard to try it out
finally starting on September 21st a
PlayStation 3 firmware update will bring
along 3d blu-ray support now the console
has already been able to play
stereoscopic 3d games thanks to an
update back in April of course you're
going to need a 3
p HDTV to enjoy these features so head
