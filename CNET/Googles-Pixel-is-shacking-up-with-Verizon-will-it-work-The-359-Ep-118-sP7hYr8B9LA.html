it's time for episode 117 of the 359
podcast with rock not Roger Cheng with
Ben baj juven and Alfred Aang thanks for
joining us everybody how are you guys
doing today okay I when was the last
time I was even on the show I don't
remember how this works you were on the
show before yeah whoa I used to be I
used to be the co-host okay yeah now
it's now we've rotated people in which
I'm very happy about I get to go home
and just sleep on the couch I guess it's
no longer a burden on your life it's
thank God yeah absolutely so today we're
gonna be talking about the Google pixel
again Alfred wrote a great story about
verizon exclusivity deal that they have
in the u.s. we're also talking about a
new park with Amazon it's called prime
reading wrote about that this morning
and the last story is about the samsung
galaxy note 7 because we can't do a
podcast without mentioning those guys
it's blown up it is not i but this story
hit yeah so like with every other show
sending your questions and comments and
we'll get to them Brian will get to them
at the end of the podcast four minutes
from now and I guess we should get
started let's do it here we go let's
take it off in three two welcome to the
359 where we talk about the top tech
news of the day plus whatever crap we
want to throw in I'm Ben Fox Rubin imap4
dang first in a throwback to the olden
times of the phone biz Google is locking
itself into an exclusivity partnership
with verizon for its new pixel phones so
i offered you wrote about this today
does this make sense is this a good idea
for google um well Google is actually
getting the most out of this deal you
know they're going to be able to get
their phones in stores which the Nexus
wasn't in people can go in and you know
pick them up feel them test out that
camera that Google has been bragging
about they're also getting you know
verizon's customer support from it
they're getting distribution they're
getting all these deals that you know
Google can't provide you know if I go to
a verizon store I can trade in some of
my phone old phone
ones for three hundred dollars off
that's pretty small yep you're not going
to be able to get that from google
itself I mean if you don't want to be
tied down you know you can still get it
unlocked you're just going to have to
pay full price for it or get project get
it with project file and pay about 27
bucks a month plus Google's plan so it's
not a complete lockdown kind of like how
it was with the motorola droid which was
really the beginning of Google and
verizon's relationship so Google is
getting the most out of its verizon gets
basically look at this crazy you know
awesome phone and were the only ones
that have it if you want it up straight
with a carrier with you know a pretty
good deal that comes with it too so
verizon also talks a lot about how its
data network is one of the strongest
there is out there and with the Google
pixel they have google assistance so you
have to ping the cloud a lot to actually
get that voice assistant working and it
also has unlimited photo and video
storage at like full resolution do you
think that that's a reasonable talking
point or do you think that that's a good
idea or is that going to get people
tagged actually by the pixel because
it's going to go on the verizon network
and you know they're claiming that their
data is the best I think that's why
Google you know specifically picked
verizon for this exclusive partnership I
mean any other network that's not as
reliable as verizon you know Google
assistant might not seem that enticing
to them where it's you know oh it's not
working something's messing up here I
think Google wanted its rollout of this
very coveted AI program to you know work
right out of the box and I think that's
why it was kind of hey let's go with
verizon on this exclusively yeah we'll
see if it dies next amazon rolled out
yet another new perk for Prime members
called prime reading which offers a
rotating selection of about a thousand
ebooks as well as magazines &amp;amp; comics
it's a smaller benefit than like prime
day or the unlimited free shipping but
it's just another reason to try to get
people to keep reupping their prime
membership do you think that that would
do it for you as far as like okay keep
taking my money every year well I
already have a prime membership I also
buy ebooks a lot I'm interests
to see what the selection is so far I
haven't raised mohabbat yeah I haven't
really seen that much that that's
impressed me I don't know I i think you
know most people already are buying the
books that they want and then I if this
is a I don't I don't really see this as
being a perfect you know oh I gotta get
on Amazon time now yeah I wouldn't think
so either and last a chicago-based
casting agency has posted a call for
current or former owners of the note 7
the samsung galaxy note 7 to share their
experience with the galaxy note 7 the
note 7 recall and their overall
experience with Samsung why this I feel
like this ad campaign is going to blow
up in their face that is a pretty good
college Hey look at all these devices
that messed up please come tell your
story about I don't see anything
positive really compelling it could be
really compelling I'd like to see what
it actually looks like so anyway if you
want to read more about these stories
check us out on cnet on Ben Fox Rubin
I'm out for dang thanks for listening uh
late to the game but but don't thanks
that was nice I like that a lot I'm
interested in this amazon reading yeah i
mean i'm a pretty dedicated prime user
shipping videos everything as am i and
i'm already subscribed to comixology
which they are yet they only gal like
comics and ebooks netflix for common yes
well it's not netflix for comics it's
just a digital platform for your
subscriptions so i'm opting into
specific issues but there are they have
comiXology and limited out there now and
that's like netflix where you're paying
like a flat fee for a month for archive
of available titles yeah i don't know
how much they'll be you know people will
be using it for the books as much but I
mean the comics and magazines part that
might be interesting yeah but even that
is a rotating selection and I think they
were really promoting the ebooks portion
of this where it's about a thousand
ebooks right and then in addition to
that we're going to have a rotating
selection of some light like sports
illustrated National Geographic Traveler
I think there were just the
and also by handful of comics I don't
know the comics off at the top of my
head but some of them were in the press
release so I I wouldn't really get too
excited about this specifically if
you're like crazy about comic books but
i don't know maybe if you find one of
them in the rotation that you're really
into you could check it out I would say
that I kind of feel like this is a bit
of a ploy on Amazon's part to get you to
get Kindle unlimited which is a ten
dollar a month service with over a
million ebook so if you actually look at
the kindle app where you can c prime
reading now they they they constantly
reference like Kindle unlimited they
have like Kindle unlimited branding all
over the place so it's kind of a
reminder to Prime folks like hey like
this thing exists maybe you want to use
it and that's a decent enough incentive
though especially for a power reader
somebody who's just constantly reading
and forgives of us who have longer
commutes in the morning taking public
transportation this might be really good
program I'm definitely interested hmmm
curious as if to anyone in the chat is
interested as well let us know if you
think you might opt into that know what
else did we talk about today yeah I'm
already checked out cuz I'm not after
today for this week sorry guys I got I
got you have I've got comic con on the
brain I'm there tomorrow you know what
I'm curious about is if any of anyone in
the comments would actually appear in
this advert for samsung oh yeah all are
you know note 7 owners out there who
I've seen in the comments before you
know when we warned them you know hey if
you have one with the defective battery
please return it there were all these
comments no I'm fine I don't care Evan
you know I just want to see like I just
put it in a baking tray didn't
everything it's all good you know how
many of them would actually appear in
this advert I'd be interested to see I
would if I was a note 7 owner I
absolutely and I was in the Chicagoland
area I would because if you're chosen
for it you're paid like six hundred
dollars or more so you at least like get
back the money for I don't know like the
the pants that they've burned off of you
or whatever it's enough to buy a pixel
yeah yeah someday for your new phone
that's not a no
7 this is not completely related but did
anybody see the latest Grand Theft Auto
mod oh yeah where they modded the
grenades and the Samsung no sevens oh
really yes that's pretty brilliant yeah
they like that a lot the gift that keeps
on giving yeah yeah do we have any
questions today not really people are
talking about pricing and the Google
home and going back and forth about the
pixel yeah I'm still I'm into the pixel
idea that might be my next move on I
need to upgrade again are you gonna get
it through horizon though are you
getting it unlocked I'm gonna have I'm
probably gonna do it unlocked because
I'm eighteen t well not only that but
like they actually add some bloatware if
you lie directly through verizon Alfred
you mention that in your story so that
was the biggest issue that I had with it
to be honest yeah it comes with it comes
of go 90 my verizon and verizon
messaging which is I've never even tried
verizon messaging I've been a verizon
customer since like I was in college
which was a very long time ago
apparently so I didn't even know what is
verizon messaging have you tried that is
it any good I have it on this company
phone because i have a galaxy for that
you know seen i gave me it's it's just
like a whole cluster of things I I just
use google hangout on it just to talk
and like facebook Messenger because one
none of my friends have my number on
this anyway oh yeah and then so it's
just like all online stuff but I just
looked at and like I had already been
getting spam messages on it like the day
so I was not a fan of verizon messaging
it's unfortunate that it is going to
come with the pixel though if you sign
up with verizon which is the exclusive
carrier just because the pixel is
supposed to be and google phones in
general is supposed to be this pure
Android experience free of bloatware and
now here's all these apps that are by
definition bloatware so yeah yeah but it
has a headphone jack this is which which
I guess we'll get some people pretty
happy about it today yeah I'm actually
pretty impressed by I I like want to get
my hands on a pixel I think the problem
is is that one of the last major phones
to do an exclusivity deal was the fire
phone I think we AT&amp;amp;T and it completely
flamed out it did really really poorly
so my expectations are not that high
that this thing is going to really be a
blockbuster at least out of the gate it
looked pretty cool it looked pretty good
but you know it's still got to go up
against the Samsung Galaxy s7 the iphone
and nobody even knows what the pixel
name is at this point like folks like us
do but it still has a long way to go to
really get a lot of recognition of them
yeah they Google today actually took out
a huge ad blitz in newspapers so I guess
kind of spread the word if you look at
the new york times today it's like a
whole like cover like four page press
that like literally wraps around the
times do you read the physical newspaper
i saw a tweet of it okay good wow I was
good you almost scared me and be like we
need to send Alfred de la spells are all
this guy hey do we have any idea when
some of the Google home products are
gonna actually start coming to
international markets specifically India
I was so focused on pixel yesterday that
I did not I was not that focused on the
Google home I had written about it in
the past but no I don't know the answer
to that okay off the top of my head we
have a really fantastically dedicated
Indian audience and they're a little bum
that they're not getting chromecast
ultra and Google home products right
away so yeah yeah i think the pixel is
going to be coming to india the
pre-orders start if i remember correctly
october 13th 13th or 14th it looks like
yeah some of the the chatter going back
and forth yeah but with the Google home
I mean if the Amazon echo is any
indication the echo existed only in the
US market for more than a year or a year
and a half before they ported it over to
the UK market when they had to do a
handful of different things like you
know like Alexa spell color you know and
like color had to have a you in it in
the UK market so as you can imagine like
bringing it to different international
markets there are all these additional
nuances that you have to add into these
assistants I'm not saying Google can't
do it I just know that with the echo it
did take a little bit of time so sure
yeah yeah do we have any idea
case manufacturers are starting to work
on the pixel models specifically like if
otterbox is going to make a case i can't
imagine they wouldn't I would hope so
yeah there's already cases out for it
like that's that was part of the
original leak yeah when it happened in
you know the one was from a case company
and then verizon's offering these like
live cases whatever it's kind of like
interactive with your with your pixel so
one of them has like a Google Earth kind
of thing where like you put it on and it
shows like it like sets a live wallpaper
for you on your phone and all this stuff
I hate those yeah so it's not only
exclusive deals I kind of kind of add
yeah they did show off a handful of like
pretty cool-looking cases yesterday but
I think a lot of them were directly
through google yeah right I imagine yeah
for now but yeah yeah yeah there should
be I mean if it if it takes off and it
does well yeah you're gonna see a ton of
cases for this and it looks a lot like
the iphone 6 and 6s and seven frankly so
I don't see how it would be that
difficult we have a case around it do
you think it really looks alike though
like that hold back it's like how about
yeah not the back but the general form a
Fed is definitely very similar but like
different forms can you really take on
I'm totally I agree with you I agree in
in that sense but um I think that you
know I don't know too much about the
nexuses but I feel like the Nexus is
didn't look as much there are more
square they had like uh more like edges
you haven't yet and instead of like a
round like a circular kind of thing I
definitely like the circular look more
yeah then again i also have an iphone so
do you think androids next update will
have the same google now like the pixel
comes with what the nougat update I
think so I allegedly I think we kind of
talked about this we kind of touched on
it yesterday about if there's going to
be any retroactive firmware updates for
like the Nexus phone they will and they
will do it for the video signal sent
nexuses I don't think they're going to
go beyond that but I think they're only
I don't think I think like other android
phones might be out of luck he has one
re dr you guys
is aware of any heating issue with the
821 processor no not two minds that is
that something that's already being
rumoured somebody's asking about it in
the chat I I have not heard anything
either so I know with previous Qualcomm
models they had a lot of issues with
overheating I haven't heard but that was
while it was on the chips beat so I was
much more aware of when it was happening
but it turned into you know a full-blown
controversy I believe with the 810 or
the 820 when they tried to move away
from that processor as quickly as
possible even though it was in a bunch
of flagship phones from last year I
haven't heard a single thing about the
a21 but then again I haven't been
covering chips the way I used to
Snickers bar Jamal that's a great name
by the way says he's mad that the pixel
isn't coming bundled with the tango
software being that it's a flagship
phone and giving it to lenovo fab to pro
i know about three of those words what
do you know about the tango software
it's times like these i wish roger was
here he would probably be able to answer
a lot of these questions a lot better so
he has a money start over yeah he has a
much deeper knowledge on like every like
phone ecosystem see how one good thing
is is that what is it withdrew verizon
this comes with date that like the
daydream vr headset yeah if you preorder
it before the before the release date
you can get a free day dream with it
which I'm excited jhansi had to see to
it I think it's like luxury google
cardboard so i can live with that I'm
looking forward to I think the
controller things got a cool feature I
was really into that like space shooting
game that they showed off I don't know
you were it was like furiously writing
the pixel story I had to like jump off
like I didn't maybe I should go back and
like watch the rest of it because for me
the Google home is like a really like
fascinating concept i think that right
out of the gate it is really going to
give the ecco run for its money and will
solve the venture into what do you think
about the google assistant voice some
are criticizing for being too robotic um
it's a machine i don't i don't
understand why people always think like
oh it needs to be like a human voice you
might disagree with me on this one I
just I think it
weird when like oh you know it sounds
like a human being I'd rather it be
robotic to be honest so you know that
it's not the comfort challenge before
becomes Hal 9000 uh Snickers bar Jamal
cleared up tango was augmented reality I
didn't even know that oh thank you very
much Snickers bar Jamal will keep an eye
out for that for sure yeah it's it could
potentially be something that they had
in some time later again if pixel is
something that takes off I would mention
too that I talked about this a bit in my
story that there's a big potential
frenemies problem that if the pixel does
in fact turn into a blockbuster phone
and I'm not saying that it will then it
turns into this complicated issue with
LG and Samsung and HTC and all the
different phone makers that use Android
software all of a sudden they're at a
luck with their primary you know OS menu
be there are 0 s providers yes what are
they going to turn to exactly that's it
turns into a complicated situation for
them because there isn't another option
out there like it's not like iOS as all
of us I mean it'll just make better
hardware that's yeah it's a marketplace
there's competition ooh that's this
harsh what stuff ok ok there are world
you always hear I guess that's true make
a better OS yeah i mean like they have a
right to complain though to google to be
like look you guys are stealing our
market share but i can say sicily
although it's their own product and
their own OS well again I don't know
that the pixel is really gonna take off
so yeah if but it could be it could
create complications for Google if it
did I guess that's all i wanted to
mention but yeah I mean I can understand
that I you know companies that are upset
that you know this google you know who
made their their OS or now you know
beating them during yeah yeah yeah so
yeah so let's close it out with one last
compare and contrast we want to know
what the difference is between google
assistant and google now and then take
that beyond a compare and contrast them
to the performance of Syria or Cortana
okay I can deal with that Google now
from what best I know about it was kind
of the precursor to the Google assist
I think that they're going to sunset
Google now and it's going to turn into
Google assistant you're going to be if
you're a google person you're going to
see a lot more of google assistant and a
lot more places the pixel is going to be
the first phone that's built in with
google assistant they're also going to
have google assistant in the google home
and they're probably going to find a lot
more places to put it so you're going to
they're not going to focus as much on
Google now they might use google now I
think it has like the different like
cards you're probably still going to see
those as far as like you know for like
what the weather is or like a sports
games and different things like that for
four different voice assistance it's I
found that it's fairly subjective it
really depends like what you tend to use
it for I've been pretty disappointed
with Siri for years and I use her a lot
with Cortana I haven't used that as
often but from what I heard it seems to
be pretty good a lot of it really has to
do with voice recognition and then in
the back end how good that voice
recognition is with finding what it is
that you actually want so my expectation
is is that Google system is going to be
one of the top ones really really
quickly because that's google's bread
and butter I think the Amazon Alexa is
also pretty good for what it does but it
still seems to be pretty limited
compared to Google assistant an
assistant will still respond to ok
Google yeah yeah of course I would think
so yeah but you could also like I think
you press the home button yeah oh that's
great yeah yeah I pretty much only used
it to set timers yeah the the pixels
getting a lot of criticism about its
design people pointing out the chin and
some people aren't too thrilled with the
name of the phone let alone blandness of
Google assistant and I just had it wrong
with tae shin I don't every phone as a
chin these day said this one
specifically too big and I just had a
thought the next model for the Google
pixel phone baleno the leno okay that's
not about Axl for extra Leno yeah just
lean into it just own it and I wish I
astron I am confused by the pixel name I
do agree with the branding of it I don't
understand why they couldn't have just
left it as nexus just quit I don't
understand like the there's always some
kind of like symbology or something
behind
Google's names words products right and
I don't understand like they're they're
gonna have to explain pixel to me on
this one I don't get it I know what a
pixel ways I don't understand how it
fits into the branding on this new
device so fair enough ad the other day
or sure google has a history right down
to their actual namesake of them a
little abstract with their title mine I
like the name pixel you know we've just
we've come to accept the google to and
no one knew what that was in the
beginnings yeah but it did it did have
yeah I some sort of like as you said
like like there was a definition because
it has a good camera maybe that could we
could argue for that that's probably the
most logical that's the only way i can
think of house I don't you think they
should they pull the name out of a hat
to sound it's part of the alphabet as
like we didn't have something with a pea
yeah that's entirely possible actually
that is definitely possible all right
let's uh let's wrap it up let's do it
all right if you liked what you saw or
heard check us out on cnet com the
podcast is also available on itunes tune
in stitcher SoundCloud feedburner google
play music and of course on cnet com i'm
going to say that again alright thanks
for watching and we'll be back tomorrow
so thank you guys
