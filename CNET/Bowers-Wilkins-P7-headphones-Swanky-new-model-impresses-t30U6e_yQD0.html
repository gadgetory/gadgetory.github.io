cnet.com and I'm here with the Bowers &amp;amp;
Wilkins p7 headphones this is now the
flagship model in the BMW headphones
line this is an over the ear model yes
we've been waiting a long time for
Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins to do an over the year
headphone and this is it
it does offer more dynamic range deeper
bass more detail than the P 5 which we
reviewed and liked a lot this one offers
richer sound I was also impressed with
the build quality and how comfortable
they were what's nice about them is that
they offer a tight seal but they don't
press too hard against your head so
they're very comfortable to wear for
longer periods of time the headphones do
fold up they don't fold flat but then
you fit it into a carrying case that
does get them a little bit more compact
they also come with two cables one is a
standard straight cable and one is a
cable with an integrated remote and
microphone that is an Apple friendly
remote so all the features may not work
with Android phones like the other
headphone models in this line the ear
Cubs do come off they adhere
magnetically and to access that
headphone cord you simply pull off the
ear cup so all in all another impressive
headphone from BMW of course there's a
lot of competition in this price range
this is a $400 headphone so read the
full review to find out how this stacks
up against the competition I'm David
Carr Noy and that's the BMW p7 headphone
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
