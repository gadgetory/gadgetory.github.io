know what this is all I own forest I've
been away he means no way it's beautiful
right it looks just like the boy yeah
but it has a faster processor it has
serious ism yeah but it looks just like
the floormat
enjoy that iPhone for Brian it's the 4s
what's happened to Brian Tong here and
welcome to the Apple buy for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
now the iPhone 4s is here Apple launched
a barrage of updates and I know there
are plenty of you that probably haven't
talked to real person since then and I
wouldn't blame you now Apple store lines
were not as long as normal and who
really cares what the tech experts
originally said with their lukewarm
impressions the 4s already established
itself as the best-selling iPhone ever
on launch day with over 1 million
pre-orders now those same experts are
now giving it rave reviews and calling
it the best iPhone yet and it's true a
dual-core a5 processor an 8 megapixel
camera and Siri now the biggest thing
everyone is talking about is Siri the
Cupertino kids even threw in all these
crazy responses that you can ask her
just like a person such as how many more
use do I have to work on the Apple bite
let me check that for you why am I here
I don't know maybe the Genius Bar folks
can answer that okay really now I'm not
one to judge but maybe you guys should
get out a little more you know talk to
real people you know it's just a
suggestion
now that the iPhone for us isn't the
only thing Apple dropped on us
iOS 5 was released and a breeze new life
into your previous phones so we let one
of our interns who's about to be let go
to do the video with some major features
and some nuggets that you guys can find
hey guys Brian song here with cnet.com
with the official iOS 5 release from
Apple its new core features have pretty
much remained the same from our other
preview videos but there's plenty more
to talk about so we'll show you a few of
the major ones and also dig a little
deeper now this video will not include a
look at Siri which is available only on
iOS 5 for the iPhone 4s so look for our
video once that's available but the
first feature that will impact you the
most is notifications Apple takes a cue
from Android here and you'll just swipe
down from the top to see them but
improves on them with their level of
control in your settings you'll be able
to set the order for notifications
displayed also pick the alert style for
the notification to appear as a banner
that will go away the standard on-screen
pop-up or not at all and there's a
weather and stock widget included as
well any app with notifications can be
set up this way
iMessage is Apple's own version of
blackberry messenger and it lets you
send messages to your other friends
using iOS five devices without using any
text messages from your cell phone plan
now you'll see a blue bubble so you'll
know you're using iMessage and you'll
also get read and delivered message
confirmations now you can still send
normal Texas tune on iOS device users
but some people might be able to get rid
of their costly text messaging plan with
this feature also iCloud integration is
everywhere in iOS 5 and it allows all of
your emails contacts calendars and more
to be synced across all your devices
with iCloud enabled now the syncing of
media content is the slickest part you
can download a song on one device from
itunes and it will appear on the other
take a picture on one device and it will
show up on your photo stream synced from
the cloud in seconds on another device
as well now sticking with photos the
camera app has been improved you can now
get to it from your lockscreen by double
tapping the home button and you can also
use the volume up button to take a
picture in iOS 5 there's also some basic
Colten photo editing the crop rotate
auto enhance and remove redeye and
twitter fans will be happy with iOS 5
and Twitter integration everywhere plug
in your account info and you can tweet
directly from your photos Maps Safari
and more now another new app is find my
friends that is similar to Google
Latitude where you can let close family
and friends know where you are if you
want to now one cool feature is allowing
specific people to know where you are
for a specific block of time that
eventually expires also new is magazine
apps with subscriptions that will now
appear in your newsstand app now not all
of them are compatible at the moment but
that will change soon
you also get reminders and there are
plenty of third-party apps out there
like it but many users will like how its
integrated into iOS and you'll really be
able to take advantage of this feature
with Siri on the iPhone 4s now there's
still plenty of other features in iOS 5
but we want to give you an overview of
some of the major ones i'm brian tom for
cnet.com and there's a first look at
iowa s5 excellent stuff guy that wears
way too many colors now next week you
can look for our secrets to iOS 5
because who doesn't like secrets well
actually I don't especially when it's
your ex has been cheating behind your
back
another news apple also released a few
new free apps in addition to find my
friends cards lets you send a physical
greeting card that gets mailed right
from your phone fellas don't overlook
this one trust me on this this app will
save your relationship and keep your
girl around for at least another week or
two then there's also the new airport
utility that lets you directly manage
your Wi-Fi network from your iDevice and
change the settings and for those of you
who feel like the Apple TV has been
getting no love at all the new iOS 5
update now brings AirPlay Mirroring from
your iPad NHL and Wall Street Journal
content a new way to browse movie
trailers and the new iCloud photo stream
feature
unfortunately not all has gone so
smoothly with the iCloud and iOS 5
launch servers were hammered leaving
many people with unusable iOS devices
for half of the day and the iCloud
services specifically mail it was up and
down since its launched and when you
can't get your email it really does feel
like the end of the world at least four
people on Twitter now things will
improve we get it the servers were
slammed but with the large and growing
numbers of iPhone users maybe it's time
to at least roll out future updates to
people over at
day or two in chunks as long as I can
get it on the first day now to the quick
bytes and sticking with the iCloud
you can now redownload your purchase
songs and TV shows from iTunes but what
about movies according to the LA Times
Apple is working on finalizing deals
with Hollywood studios to allow movies
to be streamed to their devices without
manually transferring them and music
fans we didn't forget about you all it's
not just the iPhone 4s and iOS 5s time
to shine the Nano and the iPod touch all
receive their subtle updates the Nano my
favorite iPod to hate on well it gets an
improved interface with larger icons for
easier navigation and then this pains me
to say Apple embraced the atrocious nano
watch movement that I tried to kill and
will now offer 16 different watch faces
including Mickey Mouse now the new nano
starts with the lower price of 129 for
the 8 gig and 149 for the 16 gig the
iPod Touch brings more subtle changes
bringing a white version for all three
storage capacities it'll be compatible
with iOS 5 and it drops its price to the
magical $1.99 for an entry level 8 gig
model all right there were tons of
stories we could have done but that's
gonna do it for this week's show
we want to know though one question from
you what do you want to ask Siri what
have you asked her and what has she said
back email us at the Apple buy to see
Netcom and we'll ask her directly for
you next week and that's gonna do it for
this week's show
i'm brian tom thanks for watching I will
see you guys next time for another bite
of the Apple
