relies on one of these it is a printed
circuit board now know what you're
thinking it's just a circuit board but
this one is different it's actually been
3d printed on this machine by nano
dimensions it's called the dragonfly now
3d printing a circuit board gives you a
couple of different advantages over the
traditional method of sending it out to
a manufacturing plants the first one is
that your intellectual property can stay
safe and be produced in-house the second
is the time it takes rather than a
couple of weeks to get a prototype of
the circle's brought back for testing
this takes a couple of hours or even
overnight so it's pretty rapid indeed
now the tech inside this particular 3d
printer is a little different - and any
sort of other 3d printer on the market
because of the inks it uses there is a
nano silver conductive ink that's used
to print on the boards as well as a
proprietary dielectric ink that's used
to make the board's size ranges between
7 by 7 inches as the maximum you can
even print down to as small as 2 by 2
millimeters now because this machine is
so large and bulky it is not for the
maker community it is not for you and I
it is for engineers and companies
looking to quickly and rapidly test
circuit board designs and for that
reason it's not going to be available on
the market until the end of 2016 the
pricing is yet to be disclosed but if
you're in engineering or developing some
products and you need a rapid
prototyping solution for circuit boards
this could really change the game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
