sensors over the last couple of months
and basically all of them work using the
same logic you've got two or three
probes that are coming out of the sensor
and when those probes touch water the
circuit is completed and the electricity
that flows through the water sets off an
alarm in the sensor the thing is after
talking with one of our tech wizards
Steve I was kind of struck by how simple
the basic mechanic to make one of these
things would be so we got some supplies
from online and from some local hardware
stores and we put together a flood
sensor that will set you back for under
five bucks here's how we did it first
things first you're gonna have to get
your supplies that means you're gonna
pick up a door window sensor some
electrical tape some copper wire a
MOSFET and a resistor then there are the
tools that you need we wanted ours to
look really nice and professional so we
wanted it to actually live in the body
of the original door window sensor in
order to do that we had to use a
soldering iron but really this circuit
could really easily be set up using some
alligator clips like these so the first
thing you can see Steve doing here is
opening up the actual case of the
door/window sensor now it's really
important here that you get a door
window sensor that has a simple on/off
switch if you get one that has more
options or an LED light built-in then
you'll run into some problems with the
circuitry the second step will be
disconnecting the wire that is currently
connected to the negative battery
terminal then you'll connect that wire
that you just removed from the negative
terminal to the drain terminal on the
MOSFET next you'll take a new wire and
connect that to the source terminal on
the MOSFET then you'll connect the
opposite end of that wire to the
negative battery terminal basically at
this point we've broken the circuit
using the MOSFET and the only way that
that circuit can be completed is if we
activate the gate terminal that's that
middle terminal on the MOSFET
so what we'll do now is create that
connection take the resistor and connect
one end of it to the gate terminal of
the MOSFET connect the other end of that
to the negative battery terminal now
take a new wire and attach one end of it
to the positive terminal of the battery
now take another new wire and connect it
between the resistor and the negative
battery terminal then you'll want to
wrap each of those MOSFET terminals
those three side-by-side terminals in
electrical tape that way they won't
contact each other and set off a false
alarm at this point you'll want to make
a hole in the side of the door/window
sensor case finally you'll want to
arrange all the components in such a way
that you can close the case again with
all of them inside except for those two
lead wires which should be sticking out
the side through the hole that you
created
now if you've done it right those two
lead wires if they are touched together
or if they're joined by a body of water
we'll set off an alarm so at this point
you might be thinking that's a lot of
work to save just ten bucks the problem
with other $15 off-the-shelf sensors
though is if you want to cover a whole
house you've really got to buy quite a
few sensors and even if they're $15 a
pop that cost really adds up but with
this sensor that we just created for
under five bucks you can add just a
little bit of extra copper wiring and
turn it into a device that will cover a
whole room so what we've got here is our
makeshift flood sensor and we have two
copper wires that run parallel out of
the body of this thing all you have to
do is use adhesive strips like the ones
that we've used here to make sure that
the wires run parallel to each other
never making contact
so no false alarm is ever sent then if
water pools anywhere along this track
it'll set off an alarm so for a couple
of bucks a little extra copper wire and
a little bit of gumption you've got
yourself a device that not only replaces
a $15 flood sensor but could actually
secure whole rooms against water</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
