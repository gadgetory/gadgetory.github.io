today we're taking a first look at the
Motorola Droid 4 available for $1.99 99
on Verizon now this phone has been
eagerly anticipated by diehard keyboard
fans for quite a while now that's
because it essentially is what the
Motorola Droid 3 should have been if you
remember the Droid 3 brought dual core
processing to the party but sadly lacked
access to Verizon's 4G LTE data network
the new Droid 4 Shores us up by boasting
a faster 1.2 gigahertz dual-core CPU an
excellent 5 row QWERTY keyboard and
finally 4G LTE let's take a closer look
at the phone so you open the Droid 4 its
keyboard like this just slide it open
and here we have the QWERTY keypad here
which has 5 rows which is really great
and it also has a dedicated number row
right up the top here and the LED
backlit lights here surround each key as
well the keys themselves feel really
great so here we see the Droid fours 4
inch LCD q HD screen unfortunately it's
not quite as high contrast as say an
AMOLED screen but it's still pretty
high-res so on front is a 1.2 megapixel
camera that's capable of doing 720p
video and on back is an 8 megapixel
camera that's capable of doing 1080p
video and there's also an LED flash here
as well one thing that seems really
inconvenient to me is that you have to
use a special key to unlock the back
battery plate so over here we have an
HDMI port as well as a microUSB port and
around the phone coating the whole thing
making it water-resistant is a nano
water-resistant coating also what's cool
about the phone is that it supports
optional docks that will turn it into a
laptop connected to home theater systems
and also let you use it like a desktop
computer for more be sure to check out

has been a first look at the motor
