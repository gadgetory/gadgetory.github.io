being one of Santa's elves just ain't
what it used to be kids used to love my
fine craftsmanship but now kids all want
these high-tech toys that look alive
it's putting me out of work I mean have
you seen what's hot now everything has
got these newfangled sensors like this
little fingerlings monkey it's the
year's hottest toy it just senses when
you hold it different ways swing it
around give it a pet on the head it even
listens for kisses and then there's the
fur real roarin Tyler the Tiger he knows
when you pet him in certain places and
reacts when you roar at him rah every
toys just loves to chat it up like
magical princess Twilight Sparkle she
knows when you pet her cheeks and touch
her horn
breakfast is a wonder and powerful thing
even the worst enemy can become first
you need understanding and she just goes
on and on about friendship and magic
yada yada yada hit me yeah well my my
little horsey gets magical hiccups too
here's a minion MIP turbo Dave you drive
him by waving your hand around in
different ways no remote control needed
there's even a mode where he could be a
guard to look out what anyone gets near
such a pleasant sound and parents are
gonna love all the little accessories
that can be lost which each have their
own special sensors like with Zoomer the
show Pony she responds to different
items like her carrot her Apple and if
you give her too much of the sugar cube
she's gonna spin off into a sugar
overload
and get this she knows when you brush
her hair who can compete with this but
in all my elfin years I have never seen
anything as realistic as lava Bella she
learns the talk the more you play with
her she can be tickled she plays
peekaboo
she also interacts with accessories like
this little lamb toy she'll suck on a
pacifier or she'll drink from her bottle
when it's near her lips but don't try to
feed her when she's full but this one
really puts a jangle in my jingle the
hero droid bb-8 that actually follows
you and obeys voice commands bb-8
how are you
parents need to spend some time learning
how to get the head and body all synced
up and charged cause it ain't no is easy
come on bb-8 I need a cup of hot cocoa
let's go a smart toys these days I got
to sign up for that robotics class</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
