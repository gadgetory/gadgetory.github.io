torture testing the 11 inch MacBook Air
this is obviously the portable version
the one that's meant to be tossed into a
bag taken through the airport and the
one that's most likely to suffer some
unfortunate accidents
Hey
two hours in the freezer I shouldn't be
so thrilled about this it's kind of
messed up oh it is iced over oh look at
that also it's so cold that I can barely
touch it
whew it's pretty thick ice all right
at the hang
nothing happening so far to be pretty
sad if the cold test killed it
all right well right now it doesn't come
on we're going to let it saw literally
thaw four out of 20 30 minutes or so and
see what we get
huh I was almost ready to call it whoo
okay it's back and it's working
that was a squeaker but it passed the
cold test
off we go
let's check it out see how it's doing
feels like a hot cocoa yeah that's hot
oh that is super hot well that is one
super hot laptop I don't want to rush
you buddy but let's see who is warm in
there Wow
power
I mean you can tell it's distressed
because it's not just coming right on
like it does when uh nope like at some
point it definitely shut itself off to
protect itself but despite still being
very warm to the touch it's at least
booting it actually smells a little
burnt and the fan just kicked on but
other than that I think we have a winner
working away and maybe like a bee comes
and oh no three two one
it's totally fine it's fine I don't know
what you were so worried about it's fine
didn't even get coffee on it actually
check it for scratches no a couple
little dings here but nothing serious
three two one
oh no good ICU bed oh yeah we definitely
have bended we have actually a full-on
dance here on the screen it doesn't it
doesn't close quite as well as it used
to be let's see really the important
thing is that it still comes on
well-done macbook air to drop test in a
row not a problem
other than the debt
all right several of you sent me notes
on Twitter and said this has happened to
you I put stuff in the back seat I put
my computer right here what I'm going to
do is I'm going to get in the car put it
in sport mode and punch it let's see
what happens
customs
Oh No I drove away without my laptop
okay
well we have a couple more chips to add
to it oh yeah the backs looking pretty
roughed up here I've done a number on
this guy all right let's find out
Oh No did we kill it no it's on oh it's
on alright this thing is now oh no I
think it looks kind of badass
so we've been setting up for our water
tests and I've been assessing the damage
a little bit to our MacBook which I
think might make the water test maybe
even more unfair because there's a lot
more places for the water to get in and
there used to be you can see that the
lid has bent a little bit so it doesn't
close quite as tightly you can also see
that the bottom panel has come pretty
loose so we might be letting in a little
more water there there's chips all along
the back here this is definitely the
most damaged that we have ever caused to
a gadget but it's still functioning fine
which i think is pretty impressive and
three two one
all right now the first thing to do when
you spill water on your laptop is to
obviously take it out of the water I see
our screen is still on which is
impressive now if you have a laptop you
can take apart you should immediately
remove the battery the other thing you
want to do is turn it off looks like it
took care of that all by itself
you want to make sure you unplug it
anything that could sort of cause
circuits to try to connect in there can
short-circuit the device and that's what
it will kill it in the end you want to
hang it upside down so water drips out
of the keyboard all right there is still
water dripping out of this thing so I do
not want to try to turn it back on
because that could send it to its final
resting place we're going to go ahead
and let it dry out for a couple of days
and we will find out whether it's
survived or not how to say I'm crossing
my fingers kiss this little things been
pretty tough so far all right so we let
the macbook air dry out for two or three
days and when we plug it in look at this
it comes on I wanted to say that it had
survived our final water test
but unfortunately look what happens when
we unplug it it will not come on unless
it's plugged in and I'm sorry to say
that although this thing put up a true
ninja battle the MacBook Air has failed
the water test</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
