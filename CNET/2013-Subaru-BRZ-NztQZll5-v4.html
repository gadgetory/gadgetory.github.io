bailed on Toyota in their partnership to
make this car apparently sube thought it
was kind of not them to make anything
it's front engine and rear-wheel drive
it's been a long time for them luckily
they thought about it and thought better
because the result is one of the great
affordable honest sports cars in the
last 45 years let's drive the 2013
Subaru BRZ
four out of 2000gt Datsun 240z Mazda
Miata the pantheon of cars of this ilk
is pretty small but pretty well loved
but the last time Subaru made anything
one engine and rear drive was 1954
something called the 1500 it's not
anybody's Pantheon except perhaps mr.
Magoo's
now the BRZ is basically built on a
revised version of the Impreza platform
so you could say it shares some DNA with
the WRX but the familiar relationship is
a bit distant as you can see weight
savings a big part of the story though
that hoods always aluminum that roof
never has glass in it and that back-end
is always a trunk not a hatch now under
the VR Z's featherweight aluminum hood
you're gonna find a 2-liter flat-4
engine classic Subaru boxer stuff four
cylinders horizontally opposed to per
each side kind of lives right over the
front axle line neither four or aft it
has both port and direct injection which
is sort of the new fashion these days
two litres of displacement gets you 200
horsepower a rather tepid 151
foot-pounds of torque however we're
going to encounter that on the road in a
minute zero to sixty though happens in a
happy enough 657 seconds for a car that
is a little
2800 pounds that's pretty stoked by
today's standards you're gonna get 20 to
30 mpg with a six-speed or a much better
25 34 if you get the automatic but don't
all these cars go out to the 6-speed
manual as a base configuration it's more
for that Auto and they all go to the
rear wheels through a limited slip
differential Subaru put that money in
the right place this is standard so I
applaud Subaru for throwing that in
basically but it's not much to write
home about the interface is just okay
there's also a voice command but yeah
they also squandered the opportunity to
give this car a rear camera here's the
screen but a rear cam is not even
available overall the navigation system
is entirely functional but it's not a
pretty interface on the audio side AM
and FM both have HD radio ability
there's satellite radio as you can see
bluetooth streaming they've also got a
USB and an aux jack down here on the
console and it'll also handle SMS text
now the first thing you notice about the
BRZ
is it's got this little flat spot which
we've seen before and some of the
Edmonds
charts on the dyno and it doesn't have a
lot of torque to begin with as I've
pointed out 150 something foot pounds is
not prodigiously Rev the way a Honda
s2000 used to and the balance of Knights
if you take the rear end out easily if
you look down here I've got this
stability control sport profile it keeps
you a little bit out of trouble you need
to keep this guy on cam more or less for
thousands and above keeps you in the
power bands
the way it feels to me very light car
not just in the numbers but it's really
light it the way it feels not every
light car feels light this one does and
it's quite responsive when you want to
get a snap
here we're going to triple-eight on our
track the ass feel stupid the rigidity
of this car is one of the things that
sets it apart from some of the other
vehicles of this type that are open tops
that's got a good top on it to keep
things really firm and rigid and I'm not
a huge fan of the note of subaru Motors
usually but this one sounds great and it
revs real freely and it's a happy little
engine
now pricing the BRZ CNET style is an
exercise in simplicity you start with
the base car 25 for 95 delivered then
add the limited package that's $2,000
more that's gonna get you fog lights
high-intensity discharge headlights
leather trim a spoiler on the back and
automatic temperature control there's an
$1,100 option for an automatic but
you're not going to do that
