follow you around like a puppy then I
have the answer for you it is called the
unique wizard and it is a simple remote
control that's compatible with a number
of unique drones the typhoon joins
either the 4k the GoPro version or the
1080p version so it looks like a TV
remote but as you can see when I walk
it's following me around so you can use
it for documenting things like surfing
bike riding any number of activities or
just walking around like this the remote
gives you about 90% of the functionality
you get in the fully fledged remote that
comes with the drone itself this unit
runs around $200 but you can do things
you can take it off you can put it into
a smart mode really this is for
beginners so it can help you fly more
effectively and you can also bring it
straight in and land directly using the
home mode there's also a GPS receiver in
here so it can tell exactly where you
are and communicate with the drone
dynamically and when you point the
remote forward so laying flat you can
use it to go forward and back or if you
point it straight up you can take the
drone up and down you also get your
control as well so as I said this is a
wizard remote control or your drone can
follow you around doing you pretty much
anything and it runs $200 if you want to
find out more about the unique wizard
and the rest of the unique drone lands
