Google's Android Honeycomb event there's
some Motorola Xoom tablets inside that
are running honeycomb I'm going to go
inside and check it out see what
honeycomb can do I saw this at CES but
you can actually touch her play around
of it I just great to see that there's a
notification window and that's now kind
of the general setting signing at the
bottom two so you don't have to dive
into the actual full settings menu
mystical to you're getting a to pain
view of everything exactly so this is
again using the concept of fragments
which break up the screen into multiple
pieces so you can jump between them
here's another actual example if you
jump in to manage applications you see
that there's kind of almost complete
from navigation that you get can flick
through the income-tax applications just
the storage and krypton so navigation is
fully it's fully been rethought this
music interface is a new interface for
you guys to correct sort of you know
having the four buttons and things got
another tabs but you have this kind of
drop side navigation universe but really
it's it's kind of again rethought in
terms of how does this work in a larger
space that's nice so the interesting
thing with notification is actually this
is something that's changed in the past
the notification was always there but
now if you press home for example
another app the notification appears in
the bottom there so you yep hey con
they've got your quick controls for play
pause and skip the Menu key has become
part of this top application bar and
some of them are just more important
than others so we decided that throw up
here that will put them to front you
know different immediately visible on
the screen app and the secondary items
that's kind of what are what's relegated
to this like that secondary menu right
so this is kind of where the menu button
is gone it would be pretty and so on all
the all the google mobile sweet kind of
apps like the gmail Maps calendar is
another example of a pregnant to the
action bar so again you have striking on
the right you have this kind of main
pregnant and that action bar the menu
items is there anything that you guys
have done I mean obviously the keyboards
a lot larger there's been some changes
to the actual keyboard functionality
like there's much down
do things like that at the same time
there's there's some other changes their
kind of more minor cousin ah but the
keyboard has had a big
so that was Android Honeycomb on the
Motorola Xoom I got to say first
impressions the hardware is beautiful
the screen is really responsive touch
accuracy is really good the OS itself
honeycomb on the tablet does a lot of
stuff that Android hasn't done well
historically on the tablet sized devices
yet it's killer email web browsers
really great the actual repositioning of
apps and widgets on the screen and be
able to drag down different UI elements
and the repositioning of the settings
down in the corner and the contextual
menu buttons up in the top overall you
can tell a lot of thoughts gone into it
I'm really excited to see this into a
formal cnet review hopefully soon for
cnet com I'm Donald L coming to you from
Google's Android Honeycomb</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
