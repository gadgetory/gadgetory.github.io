offered just about everything but if it
missing one thing a turbo cab that's
been fixed now here is the new ragtop
with the blower in it this is a pretty
serious car five hundred and twenty or
560 horsepower because there's an S
that's your biggest power one three two
or three five or your zero to sixty
times
who's splitting hairs now the 911 turbo
cab has always had kind of the stink of
Beverly Hills poser about it the Porsche
says there is so much serious supercar
technology in here you can ignore the
doubters for example they've all got PDK
is obviously the very advanced dual
clutch transmission Porsche does we've
got adaptive suspension base we've got
intelligent adaptive motor mounts but
this is interesting they've got active
rear steering controlled by a computer
and some servo actuators in the back the
rear wheels can either steer together or
they can steer apart but it's able to do
different things with toe-in and toe-out
to make the car either corner better or
track more stable whatever is needed for
the driving conditions these cars have
always been broad of being these turbos
but it's really accentuated this what's
74 inch width across the hips when the
top is down because there's that much
less height so the appearance of width
really gets kind of nuts from the back
when it tops up by the way it's kind of
got a decent coupe roofline because
they've done this very expensive
magnesium rod technology in the top to
really keep things stretched in kind of
a coupe arc as opposed to that kind of
saggy circus tent look that most cloth
rag tops tend to have when they're up I
talked about pricing but you can't
afford it neither can I</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
