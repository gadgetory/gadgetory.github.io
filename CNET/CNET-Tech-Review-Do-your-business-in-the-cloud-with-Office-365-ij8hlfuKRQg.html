needs I'm Jason Prager for cnet and this
has been a first look for office 365
thanks for watching
now while office 365 aims to help small
business employees collaborate more
efficiently online Apple's iCloud
service aims help all of your personal I
devices work together more easily in
this week's top 5 brian cooley my main
man is counting down the reasons why I
cloud gets it right
Apple's iCloud I bet you're intrigued by
it even if you don't really understand
it I'm Brian Cooley with the top five
reasons that Apple's iCloud rocks number
five back up and don't yawn I know it's
kind of a sleeper but with iCloud an iOS
device can back itself up to apples
cloud servers once a day when it finds
Wi-Fi that means photos settings apps
app data all that fiddly stuff and not
only is it backed up that way you can
restore all that to a new iOS device you
buy easily and wirelessly as well that's
pretty slick number for all your music
even the stuff you stole Apple's tight
with the record label so it was kind of
a surprise that the new itunes match
component of iCloud will recognize and
sync all your music to all your devices
even your pirated music sure you pay 25
bucks a year for that part but that's a
lot cheaper than dealing with the
lawyers they could have sent number
three hiding the sausage and now I mean
you don't see sausage being made in
iCloud now a certain faction of people
think I cloud should have been more
literal and folder based with you being
able to get your hands dirty dragging
and dropping stuff across directories
and network shares Apple decided no and
they're probably dead right most of
their consumers have lives and don't
want to administer a server number two
just do it I cloud is largely a
synchronizing service that happens to
use the cloud to make that work that
means a high degree of automatic
background just do it pneus that you
won't find and say Amazon Cloud Drive or
Google Music if it works right tylenol
sales and a certain amount of harsh
obscenities should plummet and the
number one reason i bet you find iCloud
at least a little bit irresistible is
the freeness the heart of mobileme
contacts calendar email that used to be
99 bucks a year is now part of iCloud
for the approximate cost of nothing free
ninety-nine dollars off one hundred
percent discount you get it Google hates
this part but you're gonna love it now
for more top 5s like this including next
week's top 5 things that are wrong
with icloud head to top five cnet com
I'm Brian Cooley thanks for watching and
be sure to come back next week for
coolies top five features that could
make iCloud even better yes there's
always room for improvement now there
are over 300 million Twitter users in
the world today but are you one of them
if not what are you waiting for maybe
once Sharon Vaknin explains how easy it
is to get started you'll change your
mind hey everyone I'm Sharon Vaknin for
sina com with your guide to getting
started on twitter now this is twitter
101 so we'll go over the basics like
setting up your account Twitter lingo
like RT and pound signs and finally I'll
give you a basic strategy for tweeting
on Facebook and Twitter asked you guys
to give me your best tips so i'll
include those two and i should also
mention that there are a ton of twitter
apps for your desktop or your mobile
devices but i'm just going to focus on
what twitter does and you can decide
which app to use after we cover the
basics ok so let's get started at
twitter com first pick a username which
should be short and sweet refrain from
picking weird handles like dog lover XO
we just don't do that on twitter now
edit your profile there are only a few
things to do here so it's important to
get it right upload a profile picture
and add a bio as ashley laurel explains
your bio should include who you are
where you're from and what you're
interested in it'll help people decide
if they should follow you or not good
now that you've got your profile setup
let's talk about tweeting this is where
you tweet and below this is your
timeline where you see updates from
people you follow for tweets you're
limited to 140 characters or less which
you probably know but there is some
Twitter lingo you need to learn if you
want to talk someone in a tweet use the
@ symbol followed by their username your
tweet will show up in their mentions tab
and anytime someone tags you you'll see
it in your mentions tab so if I want to
say something to eric franklin or need
opal on twitter ID right at need opal
than the message this tweet will only
show up in eric's mentions
the timeline of anyone who follows Eric
and I but if I tweet something and
include at need opal somewhere in the
middle it'll show up in the timeline of
everyone who follows me at replies or
mentions our public so if you want
something a little more private send a
direct message you can send a message to
anyone who follows you just go to the
messages tab and send one here now let's
talk about retweets if you see something
interesting from someone on your
timeline you might want to repost it to
your followers just click retweet under
the tweet you want to repost and it'll
show up in the timeline or you can copy
the tweet and preface it with rt than
the person's Twitter handle and that way
it'll show up in that person's mentions
tab but now that you know how to
communicate on Twitter you might be
wondering what the heck you should tweet
about unless your Kim Kardashian or
Charlie Sheen you're not going to get a
million followers instantly be patient
and use my tips to build your following
assignment Everard points out please
please please don't talk about what you
had for breakfast instead find a niche
and tweet about things that you're
interested in or good at like if you
decided that your niche is gaming post
links to articles you found new games
you're playing and retweet other people
in your gaming community when you
retweet your building relationships and
getting the attention of other people
like you which is important for building
a following talk to people or you'll get
really lonely send them at replies and
ask questions comment on their tweets
and make conversation if you're looking
for people to follow twitter will give
you suggestions over here on the front
page like this person said be active in
other people's conversations and don't
be discouraged if others are not active
in yours another key Twitter trick is to
use hashtags which are like keywords for
tweets just put the pound sign before
any word for example I can tweet I found
this awesome recipe on chow com I can't
wait to try it then you click that
hashtag and see who else is talking
about recipes sometimes hashtags become
so popular that they end up in the trend
section in the sidebar it's a quick way
to see what people are talking about so
those are the basics of using Twitter
but before I go here's some advice from
Joe sigler when starting new try not to
follow too many people too quickly you
can get overwhelmed I've seen a few
friends quit Twitter because of too much
information thanks Joe
now if you do get overwhelmed or just
have any questions feel free to ask me
on twitter or facebook fits more than
140 characters and if you want to see
more how to videos visit how to cnet com
for cnet I'm Sharon Vaknin and i'll see
you on the interwebs see that's not so
hard of course once you do sign up make
sure you follow me shameless plug at
Bryan underscore Tong and you know don't
forget to follow mollywood too now
they'll probably better known for their
laptops and tvs the sheban Vizio are
just two of the latest companies to dive
into the tablet deep end let's take a
look at what these new models have to
offer I'm Scott Stein senior editor at
cnet com and this is a look at the
toshiba thrive tablet now you're seeing
a lot of Android Honeycomb tablets
around but this one's a little bit
different what makes it different well
its got a 10.1 inch screen it's getting
Android Honeycomb 3.1 but it takes a few
steps that make it a little bit more
like a netbook in terms of its
customizability it's got a back cover
that's replaceable including a battery
that's replaceable behind it it's got an
SD card slot that supports up to 128
gigs of extra memory and Toshiba built
in a file manager so you can actually
browse pictures and music from it and be
able to play them back so it expands the
memory that's usually pretty limited on
these tablets now the pricing is pretty
aggressive although the memory starts
limited 8 gigs for 429 16 gigs for 479
or 32 gigs for 579 and it's available in
mid-july also what's really great is
that despite its thickness it also is
able to work in a number of full ports
that you don't see on tablets very often
hdmi full USB and a mini USB as well
also as you might expect from Toshiba
there are some built-in AV enhancements
that are supposed to improve the quality
of standard definition video common to
what we seen on toshiba laptops I'm
Scott Simon that's a quick look at the
do Sheba thrive tablet from the CEA line
show in New York
I'm Scott Stein senior editor at cnet
com and this is a first look at the
vizio tablet at the CEA live show in New
York now you want to talk affordable
this Android Gingerbread tablet is 349
now that does come with four gigs of
memory two of which are assigned apps
two of which are user specified but it
does have a micro SD card slot for up to
32 gigs of add-on memory it also has an
8 inch screen which is not something you
normally see in a tablet it affords a
lot more space and has a 1024 x 768
resolution that also comes with stereo
speakers that aligned vertically or
horizontally giving you a little more of
a home theater feeling either
orientation also really interesting Lee
this acts as a remote it actually is an
IR blaster that's the great part of it
and if you pair it with any variety of
TVs DVD players receivers what have you
it can recognize them and be used as a
remote and universally really don't have
to use it the vizio tv or any other and
that's a really nice of a great appeal
for many people in addition i are in
bluetooth this vizio tablet also comes
with video output and USB courtesy of
hdmi and USB outputs here it's priced
really kind of above the e-reader market
below what most people think of and is
an Android tablet price whether or not
these internal storage will bother you
depends on whether you're going to think
of investing in those micro SD card
slots can be worthwhile and maybe you
really think of it as more of kind of a
super smart remote that you also can use
as a tablet there's a first look at the
vizio tablet that'll be available
starting in july i'm scott stein and
this is the vizio tablet at the CD a
line show in New York I can totally see
the vizio via you know propped up on my
coffee table if I didn't already have
this piece of junk now will I see if I
can find someone who wants they use the
iPad let's take a break but we've still
got a lot more tech review right after
this
welcome back to the Cena tech review our
weekly video digest of all things good
and bad we've seen here at Cena TV now
continuing on in the good with so many
versions of Android phones out there it
can get pretty confusing if you're
trying to decide which one to buy but if
you happen to be a t-mobile customer I'm
about to make things a whole lot easier
for you what's up prize 5 fans i'm brian
Tong and this is a matchup between 24
inch 4g touch screen phones on t-mobile
it's a prize 5 foot out between tmobile
g2x and HTC Sensation 4G our judges for
this fight our senior editor Bonnie boom
shakalaka cha senior editor Nicole it's
so coldly and myself ringing tone now
we'll take all three judges blind scores
and average them out to the nearest
tenth each round the final prize fight
score will be an average of all rounds
using the same decimal system it's five
rounds to the finish to let's get it on
round one is design t-mobile g2x has a
solid design with a matte finish on the
back it's camera lens puts a little bump
in its trunk but this is a classy phone
with a vibrant 4 inch 800 x 480
touchscreen display HTC Sensation 4G ups
the ante with a 4.3 inch qhd display
that's even crisper with the 960 x 540
resolution but not as bright now we all
liked it's contoured body but it's
sweeping three tone pattern on the back
reminds we have a girl skirt but it
doesn't hurt it here the sensation 4g
takes the first round with the 4.7 and
the g2x gets a solid four next rounds
controls and user interface this round
isn't easy when the tmobile g2x brings a
pure stock Android experience there's no
bells and whistles and it makes for a
clean design you'll still get widget
customization and if you want more good
news it feels a tad bit snappier to use
now HTC Sensation 4G brings the next
generation of its user interface with an
even sexier design yep i just called an
OS sexy now there are seven home screens
and flash your animations across the
board the sense UI has always been a
favorite of ours and it
gets the edge with a perfect five and
the g2x gets a 4.7 so after averaging
two rounds the sensation 4g leaves by
half a point with plenty of fight left
next round is features both of these
phones are pretty evenly matched with
dual-core processors 8 megapixel cameras
androids turn-by-turn maps and voice of
text and HSPA+ compatibility Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth now you'll find everybody's
favorite swype keyboard technology on
the g2x it also comes pre-loaded with
eight gigs of internal storage space and
an additional microSD card slot to add
more storage the main difference here is
that it's currently running only android
2.2 with a gingerbread update coming
soon now HTC Sensation 4G is preloaded
with Gingerbread and you'll get some of
the cool benefits like a much better cut
copy and paste an application task
killer or launching apps directly from
the lock screen it comes with its own
flavor of swype called trace but it
tends to be a little less accurate at
times the sensation also gives you
access to only one gig of internal
storage space and the microSD card slot
is occupied with an eight gig card which
limits some of your flexibility out of
the box we're calling this round even at
four next up is web browsing and
multimedia web browsing is a push and a
pretty similar experience on both phones
the sensation was a tad faster at
pinching and zooming but in many cases
the g2x was a beat faster when loading
pages the g2x features an eight
megapixel camera with a single flash and
a micro-hdmi port for video out while
the sensation brings an 8 megapixel
camera with a dual LED flash both
cameras record and playback 1080p video
sources but we had mixed opinions with
the image quality of their pictures the
sensation 4g also brings the watch app
that allows users to rent or buy movies
directly from their phones but in the
end the sensation 4g gets a 4.7 and the
g2x gets a 4.3 so after averaging four
rounds HTC leaves by just three-tenths
of a point the final round that decides
at all
quality and performance t-mobile's g2x
was excellent with its clear and crisp
sound quality with little to no
distortion or static in the background
it was also the snapper you're
performing foam between the two with its
dual core tegra two processors and menus
that jump instantly from one to another
now the sensation 4g sounded excellent
as well the speakerphone wasn't as
strong but regular voice calls we're
pretty clear Qualcomm's new dual core
processor kept things running smoothly
but maybe the sense you eyes animations
were a little too taxing but this phone
was still a tiny step behind and you can
feel it the g2x gets a perfect five and
HTC gets of four let's average out all
the scores and in a prize fight where
ACC sensation 4g took an early lead
t-mobile g2x storm back but it just
wasn't enough and the sensation takes
this battle 4.5 to 4.4 and is your prize
fight winner t-mobile brings two heavy
hitting contenders that you can't go
wrong with but the final decision as
usual is up to you i'm brian song thanks
for watching it will catch you guys next
time on another prize by
so the sensation just barely squeaked by
with the win over the g2x but really
like I said you can't go wrong no matter
which one you choose which is more than
I can say for the two phones we have
coming up in the bad ok so these phones
aren't terrible but with so many choices
out there I wouldn't waste too much time
considering either one of them well why
don't you guys just see for yourself I'm
Nicoli senior associate attorney common
this is a first look at the samsung dart
for t-mobile it is a very basic
entry-level android phone for t-mobile
and as you can see here it's a very
simple silhouette on the frontiers a 3.1
inch display it's a little bit small by
most smartphone standards on the back
here is a 3 megapixel camera lens the
samsung dark ships with Android 2.2 but
it has Samsung's own TouchWiz interface
on it the TouchWiz interface means that
instead of the main menu scrolling up
and down like most Android phones it
Scrolls site to site in multiple pages
the screen is quite small as we
mentioned before and the resolution
isn't really dead sharp either however
it's quite colorful as you can see the
Samsung dart as we said is quite basic
but it does with a number of basic
Android features that include support
for google apps and services it also has
a very unique featured courtesy of
t-mobile and that's Wi-Fi calling that
means you can make calls over Wi-Fi the
samsung dart is a quad-band 3g gsm phone
so you can be used internationally as
well the samsung guard is available for
free after a new two-year service
agreement from t-mobile I'm Nicola this
has been a first look at the samsung
dart
hi everyone I'm Jessica doll court for
cnet taking her first look today at the
Samsung friender this is a new phone for
sprint but it isn't exactly trendy why
is that because it's got a user
interface right here that really takes
me back especially to the days when
Samsung was really big into its
proprietary user interface and that's
what you've got right here there are
tabs along the bottom and then grids to
select the apps and the phone features
on this phone these days we see mostly
Android as the operating system of
choice for this type of phone it's not
the proprietary software on this phone
that bugs me it's some of the features
there is webmail on this phone the app
is fine although it's a little bit
outdated but really it's the Twitter and
Facebook apps they're not native and so
you have to reach them from the mobile
web and these days do you just have many
more better options to do that than this
method there is threaded messaging on
here which is nice other tools are
driving mode and their voice commands
the trender has a 2.8 inch qvga screen
so it's a nice compact phone there are
hardware buttons below the screen on the
back there's a 1.3 megapixel camera I'm
not impressed with the photo quality so
far the camera doesn't seem to focus
very well behind the back cover there's
a microSD card slot that takes up to 32
gigabytes of external storage there's
also the slide-out qwerty keyboard on
the keyboard itself the spacing is good
for my hands because it's it's kind of
compact also the problem though was that
the keys are pretty flat so even though
they're comfortable the flatness really
slowed me down and typing call quality
on the trender totally acceptable so
there was no real issue there either
right now the phone costs 2999 on sprint
site it's not a bad phone at all but
there are other budget phones for sprint
that cost the same or less and you get a
lot more especially if those are Android
phones and some of those are even free
on promotion so I'd say keep your eyes
out for that because there's not really
a compelling reason for me to get this
phone instead of one of those I'm
Jessica doll court this is the Samsung
trender read my full review for more
details on cnet com
we don't mean a beat up on samsung but
trust me neither of these phones is
going to be trending anytime soon which
brings us to this week's bottom line
let's wrap up this week's show with one
more tablet rather than cluttering up
the marketplace with another Android
device HP's new touchpad is based on the
often-overlooked Web OS platform well
that might help HP stand out from the
pack this tablet has some other notable
issues to overcome hey I'm Donnell bail
on this is the HP TouchPad it's a tablet
that runs palm's webos and uses a 9.7
inch screen just like the ipad and the
price is the same with a 16 gigabyte
model going for four hundred ninety nine
dollars and a 32 gigabyte model going
for 599 the hardware itself isn't that
impressive the thick glossy design feels
a little like a slippery imitation of
the original iPad and the finger smudges
AQ out you should know that the back of
this thing looks like a crime scene just
minutes after you take it out of the box
also there's no camera on the back
though you do get one on the front
personally I'm fine without it but it's
something that every other tablet offers
that's in this price range now there are
some hardware tricks that are pretty
cool there's an optional dock that can
charge the tablet regardless of how it's
placed HP also sells a Bluetooth
keyboard if you prefer typing on
something with real keys and if you have
one of HP's phones like the pre three
you can physically touch the devices
together and transfer information it's
pretty cool really though it's the
software that makes this tablet unique
if you're looking for something beyond
the iPad or Android this is one of the
few options out there that really
approach the tablet from a different
point of view one of the main
differences is the home screen which is
treated like a desktop each open task is
represented as a stack of cards which
you can rearrange or throw away what's
interesting is that the stacks here
aren't specific to each app there's
specific to each task so you can be
reading an email opening up web links
and those email and web pages are all
going to be stacked together as a single
task if you want though you can pull
side separate emails or pages by
dragging them out of the stack and
treating them as a separate task
it's a neat trick and for some it's
really going to feel like a more natural
way to manage your work on a tablet one
other thing that makes the touch pad
unique is that it makes a real effort to
be compatible with a wide range of
services on the accounts page you can
link the touch pad to everything from
facebook to skype dropbox aim and lots
more those length accounts are
integrated right into the apps that
you'll use them with so your photo app
will pull in your snapfish account the
messaging app will pull in your google
talk account and the calendar will fold
together your Facebook and Google events
and it all just works together so that's
a brief look at the HP TouchPad more
details be sure to read my full review
on cnet com the bottom line this week my
friends where is the hand sanitizer like
look at those smudges and fingerprints
in Donald's full review he said the
slippery backing felt like a plate at a
pizza party yeah it may be called the
touch pad but I won't be doing any such
thing okay folks that's our show come
back next week for an all-new Cena tech
review until then there are tons of
