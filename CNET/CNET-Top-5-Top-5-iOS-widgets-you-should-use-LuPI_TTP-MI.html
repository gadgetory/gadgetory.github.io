you're insane or at least doing yourself
a disservice Android users know the
majesty of these mini apps today here
are the top 5 iOS widgets you should use
at number 5 the ESPN widget
you've gotta track your team's the ESPN
app lets you select your favorite teams
and have the latest scores in the
Notification Center you can also check
out the widget from the score which
gives you scores with odds along with
sports news at number 4 is Evernote
Apple's newest version of its Notes app
borrows heavily from Evernote but it
didn't bother to swipe its widget if
you're unfamiliar with Evernote it lets
you write notes set reminders make lists
and store photos as notes in notebooks
that are synced in the cloud the
Evernote widget lets you quickly make a
new note with inspiration hits at number
three a data widget my wireless carriers
app includes a data widget that lets me
know how much of my data I've burned
through in the month if you're Carrie it
doesn't have that in widget form there
are a lot of options including data flow
which is free and lets you input your
data cap the date the month rolls over
and you can let it know how much of your
data you used up already at number two a
weather widget there's no way we're all
gonna agree on which apps got the best
weather widget but it's probably not the
default one here are some other options
Weather Underground zap comes with two
different widgets one with weather
conditions and the other was radar now
I'm partial to the freebie weather app
because you can customize how much
weather information appears on your
todays screen be the power user feel the
power before we get to number one I
asked you find folks on Twitter what
widget you like to use Steve I had a lot
of pics including fantastical and dark
sky Alex's favorite is the transit app
which I just downloaded thanks Alex and
RB McAllister suggested the pedometer
widget thanks everyone and the number
one type of widget you should have is
something like AI launch or a launcher
Pro sure iOS this control center gives
you access to a couple of apps and
features toggles for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
but it's not customizable here a bunch
of apps that bring you all kinds of
shortcuts to your Notification Center
I launcher is a free option you can put
shortcuts to apps
specific sections of the Settings app
web sites and
even create a shortcut to message people
with OneTouch launch a pro is a paid
option that works in Italy and is less
buggy both of these apps at a great
number of shortcuts to your iPhone or
iPad for more top fives like this check
