their new adventure camera it's meant
for outdoor life you can see right on it
it says adventure proof shockproof
crushproof
cold proof waterproof big words for a
small camera we're gonna put this thing
to its paces and see if all that is
really true look at the look of this
thing it looks like it could be Tony
Stark's camera the Iron Man we'll see if
this thing really is like iron and can
hang out in what I like to call my
adventure life it may be cold where you
are this time of year but in Southern
California it's still super hot so I'm
going surfing that's right we're gonna
take this bad boy into the ocean and see
if it's bold claims are really true
alright I'm headed to the beach first
thing we need is supplies can't go to
the beach without supplies so I got my
cooler got my beers stuck into my ice I
throw in a couple sandwiches maybe mmm
yummy sandwich is my camera I think
maybe my camera needs to go into the ice
see if you can handle the cold on the
way to the beach so we made it the dog
beach still have the camera in the
cooler we're gonna pull it out and see
it's been a few hours
sandwiches are looking good beers are
nice and chilly
oh hello camera definitely cold to the
touch
very cold but you know it says right on
the front cold proof so I'm assuming
there will be no problems when we when
we when we
doesn't seem to be turning on does it
doesn't seem to be turning on
oh there it goes there it goes
we have a logo it's just really bright
out here
take it to picture
working no problem it was more a Sun
issue glare on the screen so it clearly
survived the cold it's very cold and I
think the pictures are a little foggy
because the lens fogged up a bit but
this is nothing for this bad boy we're
gonna step it up a bit take it into the
ocean I'm by no means an expert surfer
so this should thing should be going
through the wringer as I tumble into the
water over and over here we go let me
make this perfectly clear I am just
learning to surf so this probably won't
end well surf is up in a big way here in
Huntington Beach
I got you got the camera secured to my
person I'm sure it will black me in the
face repeatedly that's how that doesn't
happen I'm gonna try to get some some
photos in the water as I'm surfing I'm
gonna set it to underwater mode which it
actually has so that's pretty cool
you see if the saltwater does anything
to it and we'll see if I can catch some
waves wish me luck
in the beginner
let's do this
tell you one thing Molly it's a heck of
a lot easier taking a picture leaping
out of a helicopter
on a surfboard I took a couple with this
thing so taking underwater photos have
no idea how they're gonna look probably
ridiculous I got beat up out there
humbled by those waves but it's uh you
know it's doing fine it was beating me
all over my torso and whacking into the
board and slamming into the waves and
it's held up so water test
now my delicious sandwich have my
delicious beverage have my sunshine have
my Beach have some pictures on my camera
that came through with flying colors
underwater but there's one bit of
business we still have to take care of
that is the drop test this thing claims
to be shockproof well guess what folks
we got ourselves a nice little cliff
right here check that out I think it's
time to take the phone for a tumble I'm
gonna have it take video on the way down
and we'll see if it's still rolling when
it hits the bottom I'm not quite so sure
it will handle it let's find out hmm all
right Iron Man camera see if you can
handle the cliff I'm gonna put it on
movie mode
and I'm gonna begin recording there's
mic recording
there's the bluff that we're gonna go
down just hanging out just having my
beer oh oh oh no
now if I don't kill myself
guy with beer falls down mountain
well it's dirty and we got some serious
scratches on that on the back of that
display
oh it's scuffed all the hell but it
looks like it's still recording we're
gonna try fall number two if I can get
up the mountain
wait all right buddy
enjoy your fall
iron man are you alive the front looks
no worse for wear
and it says it's still recording look at
you iron man pretty shockproof
alright let's top the record data is
being recorded it says take a look at
this bad boy
see how it did dirty clearly we know we
can wash it off in the ocean so that's
not a problem here's where the issues
lies of course you've got glass back
here but it's scuffed and scratched but
it's certainly usable if you took a
spill down those rocks you'd be a hell
of a lot worse for wear than this thing
and it's still you know ready to take
some some photos or video that's a
pretty impressive drop test that last
one I really chucked it down there so
maybe this thing is a little bit like
Iron Man
so you took your WG to to the beach it
handled the surf it handled underwater
it even handle the spill down the craggy
outcropping now you want to relax and
have a nice evening next to a warm
campfire in your outdoor adventure with
your rugged camera will it handle the
heat if let's say it happens to fall on
the fire we don't have an actual
campfire but we got a pretty good
amalgamation of one a pretty good
version of one in the backyard I'm gonna
take the WG too
I'm gonna throw it right on the fire
let's get that bad boy wrapped up look
that's a lot of heat I can feel it on
the fingers oh boy alright it works as
of now let's see if it handles the
burning burning flames that camera just
fell into a burning Ring of Fire oh boy
it's really hot burning flames
oh my god give me my hot dog hot dog
all right I think it's roasted enough
it's gone to a nice golden-brown it's
time to check out and see if we're still
recording look it turned itself off I
think I think that was the sound of it
turning itself off oh my gosh is very
hot very hot poor thing that's pretty
bad that's pretty bad
all right so we got serious melt and
fusion going on and it's still on it's
still on look at that
still on the glass is melted that's
pretty impressive oh my god but it's
still on I can still take pictures data
is being recorded still moving through
the menus it's all melted and very very
hot to the touch
so that's I think a pretty good pass Wow
take a camping folks Optio is a little
banged up we had some emergency tape
action to keep everything in place after
the fire test but as we saw at the
beginning waterproof cold proof
shockproof even held up to fire the last
one on the front here crushproof so
let's see if crushproof
really is crush proof now in the manual
it says up to 220 pounds of crushing
we're gonna go a little beyond that
turns out the footage from the fire
didn't come out so I don't know if that
was fire related or if that was user
error which it definitely could have
been hopefully with some footage of this
crush action here we go down to street
level
Oh
oh wow there it is oh boy it's off again
oh boy
there's a big crack there's a big crack
it's recording again it's recording you
recording me it's pretty reasonable guy
if we've lost half our screen so but
still with wildly exceeded crushing
specifications and it's still recording
fire ice surf crushing rocks iron man of
cameras not just in looks but in
durability as well good job
Pentax the Optio WG - it takes a lickin
and it keeps on clicking</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
