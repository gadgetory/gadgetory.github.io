show the European Space Agency lays out
its plans to build a lunar base for
mining moon rocks a parking structure
that parks your car for you begins trial
operation in China and finally we talk
about the ethics of gene edited babies
and cloning schizophrenic monkeys let's
get into it with the International Space
Station set to be decommissioned in 2024
the European Space Agency believes a
permanent lunar colony could be the next
step in international space exploration
the ESA is vision for the moon involves
four ambitious projects the first is a
collaboration with Russian space agency
Roscosmos lunar resource lander also
known as lunar 27 will be the first
european lander to touchdown on the moon
its mission will be to drill into the
moon's surface to analyze samples and
determine whether or not there is any
water the ESA is next lunar project will
be to provide service modules for NASA's
four-person crew transport vessel the
Orion spacecraft psays modules will
supply the astronauts aboard Orion with
power propulsion water and other
necessities for deep space travel
Orion's first manned mission is a trip
around the moon planned for the early
2020s the ESA is next step will be to
help NASA establish a deep-space gateway
in orbit around the moon the Gateway
planned for 2023 would give astronauts a
place to conduct experiments in lunar
orbit and could make it possible to
control robots on the lunar surface the
ability to remotely control a robot on
the lunar surface could make possible a
concept mission currently known as
Heracles Heracles is a remote-controlled
Rover that would go around gathering
samples from unexplored areas on the
moon's surface the samples would then be
returned to Earth aboard an Orion
spacecraft where they would be analyzed
to determine the feasibility of mining
moon rocks to extract resources like
water or oxygen ESA believes that being
able to exploit lunar resources in this
way could open the door to more deep
space explorations and could turn the
moon into a stepping stone to other
world's a 20-story garage that parks
your car for you recently began trials
in chun qiang china the hi-tech garage
aims to reduce traffic congestion
emissions and land usage by parking cars
without the need for pedestrian walkways
ramps for driving or stairs even the
space usually reserved for opening car
doors has been repurposed to fit more
vehicles here's how it works just drive
into one of the entry points turnoff and
exit the car scan the QR code on the
side of the garage and it'll whisk your
car off to an available parking space
the whole process of moving a car into a
space reportedly takes about a minute I
wouldn't be surprised to see this type
of space-saving automated parking
structure become more widely used as the
world's population continues to grow
these five baby monkeys are all
genetically identical clones of an
original monkey whose genes were edited
with CRISPR CRISPR is a type of gene
editing technology derived from bacteria
that is shaking up the world of medical
science in 2015 the American Association
for the Advancement of science crown
CRISPR the breakthrough of the year in
this experiment the CRISPR method was
used to genetically disrupt the
circadian rhythm also known as the
biological clock of a monkey which was
then cloned five times to make the
monkey clones scientists use the same
cloning method that bored Dolly the
sheep more than 20 years ago so far the
genetically altered monkey clones have
exhibited signs of psychiatric disorders
including anxiety depression and
schizophrenia like behaviors let's start
with the most obvious question why use
the godlike power of CRISPR gene editing
to make monkeys that are destined to
suffer like this
the research team responsible has said
that eliminating genetic variation among
test subjects could make studying
diseases and finding cures faster and
more efficient they argue that this
could lead to an overall reduction in
animal suffering over time though many
others in the scientific community are
not convinced that the ends justify the
means and the ethically questionable use
of CRISPR doesn't end with
last November Jean edited twin girls
named Lulu and Nana were born after
professor ha Jong Kwai used CRISPR
to alter their DNA to make them immune
to HIV Chinese authorities have since
confirmed that there is also a second
pregnancy in progress with another gene
altered human embryo and that
genetically altered child is due in
about six months
the twins birth sparked outrage in the
scientific community because of the
risks and ethical boundaries crossed in
this experiment thoughtless gene editing
could put the infants at risk of health
problems later in life and could even
someday affect the health of their
children to accomplish this scientific
first doctor hub reportedly forged
ethics documents and could now face
criminal charges as the scientific
community rallies to create rules
regulations and guidelines for CRISPR
and its implementation
these infant humans and infant monkeys
serve as stark reminders of the
tremendous power modern humans wheeled
and the tremendous caution we must
exercise as we decide how best to
utilize our new tools and abilities what
are your thoughts on gene editing love
it hate it
join the conversation down in the
comments thanks for watching with the
future I'm your host Jesse Orel see you
next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
