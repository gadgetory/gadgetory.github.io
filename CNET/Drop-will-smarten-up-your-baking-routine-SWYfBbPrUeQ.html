and appliances standing here with the
adaptiq strop smart kitchen scale this
$100 device actually connects to an iOS
app via bluetooth 4.0 and lets you
follow a recipe from start to finish I
really like the minimalist sort of
streamlined design of the scale it
doesn't have any display it's just
really really sleek and simple the app
is similar it kind of looks like a page
off of Pinterest you can scroll through
the recipes and select the one you want
I made double chocolate muffins and a
quick bread with time and both ended up
turning out very well
similar to perfect baked a competing
product the app let me know when I had
added the right amount of ingredients so
as I was adding in those chocolate chips
it let me know when I had added just the
right amount and then proceeded to the
next step I ran into a couple issues
where I overfilled an ingredient or the
app actually proceeded to the next step
before I had finished with the previous
one but overall it worked really well
even though I prefer the design and
style of the drop app the perfect baked
app actually lets you add in your own
ingredients and edit existing ones to
your exact specifications I really wish
drop had this functionality it does say
that it's adding that at a later date
but right now it isn't available but in
general in the drop versus perfect bake
debate I would say drop is more of a
sophisticated product something that I
would get for my mom or a good friend
and perfect bake seems like more of a
family gift something that would involve
kids because of the color coded bowls
and other accessories it comes with drop
is a little bit pricey at a hundred
bucks but I think it is a really clever
product very well executed and could add
a new level of fun and
to your baking experience thanks for
watching be sure to check out my full
review of drop on cnn.com I'm Megan
