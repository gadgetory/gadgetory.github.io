announcements and hurricane sandy we got
ourselves a perfect technology storm I'm
Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
update the initial supply of iPad minis
available for pre-order sold out on
apple com in less than a half hour and
Friday morning the shipments for the
Wi-Fi only version were pushed back for
two weeks shocking I know some of the
first people that ordered a mini with a
4g wireless connection won't be getting
it until black friday that's november
23rd meanwhile apple's fourth-generation
full-sized ipad which has a faster
processor didn't suffer from the friday
rush if you want to buy a 4g ipad mini
from a wireless carrier you should be
able to do that in the coming days since
that model doesn't hit stores until
november 16th the windows 8 era has
arrived the system is available at
stores now and Windows users can
download the forty dollar upgrade to
Windows 8 probe will you be upgrading or
buying a new computer did you already
make the leap send a video reply using
the Tao tap or you can email update at
cnet com to share your thoughts about
the new system and your upgrade
experiences and those of you with a PC
or tablet running Windows RT or Windows
8 can now use SmartGlass with your Xbox
the smart glass app puts additional info
on the tablet screen about what you're
watching it can also be used as a way to
control and navigate game shows movies
and music it's coming soon for Apple
Android and Windows Phone 8 looks like
Google isn't caring too much about
keeping the Nexus 10 tablet a secret
Google's senior vice president of
engineering uploaded photos taken by a
nexus 10 tablet or at least that's what
it says when you click on the image
details there are also images of a
tablet leaked on the site brief mobile
this nexus 10 tablet made by samsung is
said to have a better display than the
ipad but we'll find out for certain soon
when google unveils it at a monday event
and a message for my east coast techies
that are in the path of the frankenstorm
hurricane sandy you don't want to be
caught unprepared if there's a long-term
power outage now is the time to see what
kind of backup cell phone recharge or
you can get at the store you can find
some solar chargers like this case by
mobius but solar tends to take a while
to charge some iphone cases have a bill
to
backup battery or you can buy an
external battery backup pack like this
one by monoprice and it has a USB port
for multiple devices make sure you have
a car charger handy since that might be
the only way to recharge until your home
powers restored and if there's an
emergency and you're having trouble
getting a call to connect send a text
message text messages go through even if
it's busy and there's a delay that text
will just wait in the queue until things
free up and it also uses less resources
on the network don't count on your cell
phone to be reliable a transistor radio
and a pack of batteries can be your best
friend that your tech news update for
today from the cnet studios in New York
