a whole new layout and that means it's
time to relearn how to navigate through
the network these changes will gradually
roll out to all users first you'll
notice there's a new left navigation bar
it's similar to what you find in to
facebook mobile apps hover your mouse
over to expand and you'll see shortcuts
to the newsfeed messages events photos
marketplace as well as some groups
you're a part of and below that are
shortcuts to really close friends the
chat is now also in this section it's
all the way at the bottom and if you're
totally and completely bored clicking
the Browse icon will take you to a
random graph search results such as all
the cover photos of your friends or a
list of TV shows your friends like I'm
sure you'll find the experience
enriching but let's go back to the
newsfeed you'll notice every updates
much larger and that also includes the
advertisements and sponsored posts
photos you share take up more of the
screen and the captions are displayed in
white on top of the image it kind of
looks like Google Plus let's just hope
you're sharing good photos since they'll
be huge now on everyone's feed if you
want to mention someone in your post
you'll notice their name is no longer in
blue links to other people and pages are
black and in bold Facebook's goal is to
get you to hang around longer on the
site so now there are more types of fees
you can scroll through you'll find the
list of fees at the top right first is
the all friends feed it takes you to a
page where you get all the status
updates from people you are friends with
and it's in chronological order the all
friends banner shows a random photo and
it's refreshed every time you go to this
page you have no control over this the
photos are cropped awkwardly and the
photos might be years old so you might
even be greeted by the face of a person
from your past you rather not talk to
any more surprise in the following feed
you'll see every single post from the
group's you like and the people you
follow like news outlets brands and
celebrities it also has a banner that
randomly shows an image from one of
these pages you like on the Left you'll
find a quick list of all the things you
follow hover your mouse icon over one of
them and hover over to the like button
see if you get these posts in your main
news feed the photo feed is all recent
photo posts because we live in an
Instagram world now and we don't have
time for words I must warn you though
about venturing into the most recent
feed this is Facebook's most irritating
feed because it shows every single bit
of activity from your friends every
comment they've left on any post every
photo of they've liked and they're
usually photos of complete strangers you
won't even know what you're looking at
half the time if you're lost and are
questioning what you've done with your
life you might find yourself in the
recent feed zone there are other feeds
to just one for music related posts one
for groups you belong to and games but
remember you can make your own feet if
you want to narrow things down a bit at
the bottom of the list click on manage
lists and that's where you can create a
custom feed that's your quick
walkthrough of the new facebook news
feed if you want to be among the first
to get the new design go to facebook.com
slash newsfeed to get on the list thanks
for watching I'm Bridget Carey and happy
oversharing
