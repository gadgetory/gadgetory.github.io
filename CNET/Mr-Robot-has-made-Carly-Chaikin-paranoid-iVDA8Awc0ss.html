I'm Jeff Bakalar with me on the stage
right now is mr. robot star Carly shaken
you might have seen her yesterday when
she was our guest at sea that's next big
thing panel on the smart home and Carly
was nice enough to join us today as well
hello Carly thank you so much for being
here
rotten floors for Carly shaken ladies
gentlemen yeah that's nice that feels
good yeah um so next big thing the panel
you did yesterday that kind of
surrounded the whole smart-home stuff
obviously we talked I'm sure about that
opening scene in the second season of
your show mr. robot so like what what is
that where does that come together I
mean obviously that's like the way
extreme sort of side of things yeah they
had actually it said worst-case
scenarios right like this is the
apocalyptic sort of smart-home situation
I mean what you know what are where does
that tie in to like the real world sort
of like application of smart-home stuff
like I guess from your point of view
having dealt with that topic a lot in
the show I mean I think a lot of our
shows kind of worst case scenario of how
hacking and Technology can kind of
affect the world / destroy it for sure
um and I think I don't I think it kind
of just plays into everybody's fear
about you know what could happen and
just having your kind of life hacked and
taken over in your home and all that
stuff and I think with everything going
on about smart houses and all you know
technology in the world today it's kind
of I feel like it's kind of like a
warning it is and I feel like it's it's
never been more you know relevant in my
in kind of like the world we're living
in right now what I mean before you
started on the show what was maybe from
that point to now the thing you're able
to take away the most are you are you
like more paranoid now I feel like I
might be I'm so much more paranoid and I
also bet you know technology and hacking
and any
that stuff was never never even crossed
my mind it wasn't something I thought
about and so now since then it's kind of
every room I walk into I'm like oh I
could hack that no I could do that they
said like your reconnaissance like every
time you walk yeah or I think like
people are constantly like recording me
or watching me or tracking or something
that I'm like now in my head everything
is what's the worst case scenario and
think it's actually happening right oh
that doesn't sound like a lot of fun
good life like that that's it's great
it's great it's one of them definitely
looking over my shoulder yeah who
doesn't want to live like that
um what what do you think maybe like the
next generation of people who don't
remember a world where everything wasn't
connected like what do you think they're
faced with it's so weird to me because I
feel like you know I'm I was born in
like 1990 I feel like I'm like kind of
almost the last generation that
experienced you know printing up
MapQuest directions and not having a
cell phone and you just pile up in the
shotgun seat right can you get lost like
there's nothing to do um and so it's
crazy to me seeing all like younger kids
living on iPads and learning on iPads
and it really it really scares me I feel
like there are a lot of the art of hand
written things or reading a book or you
know it is like lost for sure I think a
lot of people kind of take umbrage with
the fact that no one really knows how to
develop a relationship with somebody yes
like you can have a conversation as much
as you want online and we can send
little emojis back and forth and really
express the way we feel about each other
but you know sitting down at a bar with
somebody and like observing someone's
facial expressions in their body
language that's going away and I don't
know I just that kind of just like makes
me wake up in the middle of a night it's
crazy thinking you know when you go to a
restaurant or go somewhere and be
waiting for your friend you don't have
your phone to play with or distract you
and you know you kind of would just be
looking around and sitting
there but what did we do I don't know
twiddled your son yes instead with the
car butters
yeah I don't know but I just you know
now it's like we have this false sense
of intimacy and relationships with
people and connect you know a connection
where we see you know pictures on
Instagram and so I know what you did for
Christmas so I don't feel the need to
call you and ask you what you did for
Christmas right um you know and I think
so much of it is we feel so much more
connected but at the same time we become
more and more disconnected because we're
not having actual human interaction yeah
I worry that you know this
overindulgence that we seem to be having
with social media I don't know like do
you think there's a way back from that
yeah I mean this is oh you know so we're
we're too far gone yeah it's over and
we're done everyone yeah that was nice
wild laugh yeah that was fun I don't
know I just feel like uh you know the do
you like I want to say yeah but cuz
where do you know you just what take all
that away because I think there there
are so many benefits to social media for
me personally I've been able to develop
relationships with people via Twitter um
and I think it gives people such a great
way to reach out and have you know a
bigger platform and a way to express
themselves but you know there also is
kind of the ability to hide behind a
computer screen people think they can
say whatever they want I think to me
that's the scariest part yeah I mean I
think you know I think when this
exploded it's I think social media is
the best and worst thing that's happened
right agree simultaneously right um I
don't know if there will be this sort I
mean we are kind of like you know the
guinea pigs for it where it's like oh
look let's see if humanity can survive
this right and then as the dust settles
maybe they'll be you know sort of like a
withdrawal of it a little bit I don't
know like when you when you asked like I
can we come back I make when they come
back does that mean find a balance
right I don't think we can find a
balance for anything this world though
apparently Wow shows really I'm so
cynical
I'm like we're all gonna die it's fine
it's fine
um so going back to the show mr. robot
what I mean you know there's obviously
the huge sort of socio-political you
know impact that eff society has on the
world you know the the culture sort of
stuff I think a lot of that is also
about privacy right like people kind of
having the line blurred about what
privacy what digital privacy is to
people do you think we're living in a
world now where people just have no sort
of concept of the fact that they're
giving that up unwilling not unwillingly
but you know there's no sort of warning
anymore it's just sort of I'll hit okay
I'll scroll through that hit okay and
move on I mean the biggest thing for me
was when Pokemon go came up yeah and
people would just accept it and do it
and didn't realize that then their
location their phone like everything in
their phone everything that they were
doing was being tracked right and
everyone just wants to play games so
they say okay nobody thinks about you
know what they're actually signing
themselves up for sure but I think you
know and I kind of had the same thing
about well I have nothing what do I care
yeah if if someone you know
hypothetically like has that information
that meant a like I got nothing to hide
right yeah about you know all those
things about um even like not to get
like so political but let's go all that
you know with Snowden and and you know
what and like exposing all that that
it's like well I don't care if someone
is listening and all my phone calls I'm
not saying anything bad right and one of
the one of the coolest things I actually
did went to this like panel that he did
via like robot okay but he was he was
saying he was like you know saying that
that you don't care is kind of like
saying we don't need freedom of speech
because I have nothing to say right
and it's a slippery slope like that and
I think that's something that the show
really does a really good job at warning
people about I think I think the reason
mr. robot is so compelling is because
it's not it doesn't really clamor eyes
the entire situation and I feel like up
until then the notion of hacking was
this sort of like you know superhero s
kind of thing like no it's real bad it's
like real ugly people died you know it's
the the the ramifications are intense
well I think the coolest thing was you
know season 1 the whole our goal is to
have to start this revolution and to
take down the 1% and you know what
helped the 99% and take down like the
biggest conglomerate and then you see
that that we weren't you know it wasn't
everything we thought it would be and
the consequences that we suffered and
you know the reality of that of kind of
not being like oh we're superheroes and
now everybody's saved and here's the
real world about sometimes starting
starting a revolution can do more damp
like thinking you're doing that can do
more damage and all these things with
technology and so you know I feel like
everything that's going on is a catch-22
all these things that you know people
think are helping or benefiting even
like social media there's always that
like double-edged sword of it all right
it's a it's a fine line to walk
absolutely McCarter this has been
fantastic thank you so much for being
here
round of applause for carly everybody</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
