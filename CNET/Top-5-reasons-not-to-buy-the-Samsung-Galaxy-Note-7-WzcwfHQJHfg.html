Samsung Galaxy Note 7 if you're looking
for a reason not to buy it
you've come to the right place here are
the top five excuses not to buy a
Samsung Galaxy Note 7 at number five
it's big the Samsung Galaxy Note has
always been a big phone this latest
version packs a 5.7 inch screen if you
thought the galaxy s7 edge was too big
that thing has a 5.5 inch screen however
the note 7 is shorter and lighter than
the iPhone 6s plus at number four you
already have an s7 edge the s7 edge in
the note 7 are very similar on the
inside they have the same processor same
amount of RAM and the same cameras the
s7 edge actually has a slightly larger
battery than the note 7 unless you're
dying for a stylus the s7 edge is still
an excellent choice at number three
no nougat Android 7.0 otherwise known as
nougat will not ship with the galaxy
note 7 updates to Samsung phones can
take a while especially when it comes to
getting carrier approval however some of
the cooler features of Android n like
multitasking are baked into Samsung's
version of Android at number two the
price the galaxy note 7 is expensive it
starts at 850 dollars there are a number
of phones including Google's Nexus line
of phones that cost less than the note 7
the Nexus 6p starts at around $400 while
the smaller Nexus 5x starts at $350 the
1+3 costs $400 even the galaxy s7 edge
is less expensive starting at 750
dollars before we get to number one
let's talk about reasons to buy the
samsung galaxy note 7 first up it's got
an iris scanner they can be used to
unlock your phone and authenticate you
to sites the note 7 also is the first
phone to ship with Gorilla Glass 5 which
is supposed to be much tougher than
older versions that's super important
for that wraparound screen plus it has
USB C and is water-resistant and the
number one reason not to buy the galaxy
note 7 is the new Nexus phones are
around the corner Google's flagship line
of phones are expected in October
rumors say there will be two phones made
by HCSC Nexus phones will receive the
latest versions of Android first and
they traditionally pack a lot of power
for the price if you can hold off for a
few months maybe pause your purchase of
a note seven until you see what Google
has to offer
oh also the next iPhone should be out by
them if that list didn't convince you I
don't blame you the note 7 seems awesome
