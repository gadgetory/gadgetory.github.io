middle school and I won six big
definitely awesome late if I was playing
farmville and I was only five and I
thought maybe I should make games I
think I remember starting to use a
computer when I was five years old it
can be a little intimidating to enter
this world when there's not really this
substantial role model I was like I have
no idea how this process works how do
you make an iPad up there like loading
the Miss you do it more and I and I can
help them I know how much I'm capable of
because I could go you know when you
really enjoy something you know you
don't always think about like oh I'm the
only girl in the room I didn't really
care cuz I liked programming and so I
just wanted to do what I wanted to do I
think that the earlier that girls are
introduced to the field of programming
and the things that you can do with it
the better it will definitely into
college it's I definitely see myself
doing it as a career I like little games
he's very creative and he never gives up
when you get your first error or problem
that's not doesn't mean you're not good
at it that's the reason why we're here
what this is why this girl's can bring
this new perspective to an area that is
so gender imbalanced I love it cuz you
could make whatever you want with your
imagination I think my computer science
teacher is definitely a role model um
just because she also worked as a
computer scientist in the fields I like
making games cuz it's much more fun than
playing games I think just persevering
is the biggest piece of advice I could
give it has allowed me to feel empowered
to change other lives don't give up and
they get difficult at times but you
could do it
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
