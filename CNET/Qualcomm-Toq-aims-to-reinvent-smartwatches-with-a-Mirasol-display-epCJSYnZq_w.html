watch its 1142 am Qualcomm is in the
SmartWatch business and you may have
heard about this around the time that
the Samsung Galaxy gear launched but
Qualcomm's release run for this watch is
pretty small the idea is more of a
reference design for we're smart
watchers are headed according to
Qualcomm and the talk is more of a
bare-bones SmartWatch that's built
around the screen that is new and
different and that they think will take
smartwatches into a more battery
conscious direction this is a mirasol
display now Mirasol has been kicking
around for a while in the e-reader world
and what it is is a reflective color
display more like what you'd see on an
e-reader but it does have the ability to
show a bunch of colors it does look very
crisp and highly readable and that's
Mira Sol's advantage it's like Ian gets
very very reflective the qualcomm toq
does have a backlight right on the top
you DoubleTap and bring up it sort of
looks it's a side lighting and it looks
a little more like an old-fashioned Game
Boy Advance with lighting than something
like a you know a fancy backlit tablet
or phone the feature set is a lot like
maybe a pebble it's built largely around
notifications you can turn on
notifications for any apps you can also
connect it with built-in apps for you've
got the stocks you've got whether you've
got messaging and that's what's
interesting is the qualcomm toq will
allow you to give can responses directly
from the watch and you can set those up
on your phone it's kind of useful and it
has a music player connectivity that can
work with any app on Android now the
talk is only on an Android connectivity
right now it will work with android 4.0
point three phones or later and you've
got to have bluetooth of course but it's
not as restrictive as some phones and
watches that have for instance like the
year that makes you go through a samsung
galaxy family in order to use the watch
what else can it do well if you're into
the Internet of Things this does connect
with Qualcomm's all join but that's
pretty in the weeds right now as far as
what you would do for that with that as
a normal human it's not cheap the
qualcomm toq is three hundred dollars
and comes with optional fully wireless
stereo
earbuds and a little fancy charge case
that uses its own little contact charger
so you don't have to use cables you put
your watch right into it and there you
go wireless charging for your qualcomm
toq because of its reflective low-power
display a low-power processor and a
battery tucked into the watch band the
qualcomm toq should last for up to a
week of use which puts in a territory
that only the pebble watch really
matches you have to cut this band
yourself though which is a little weird
and it only comes in two colors black
and white you might also have noticed
that the touch elements are not only on
the screen but they're also outside the
screen on the face and even on the band
to control some functions don't think of
this as qualcomm entering smartwatches
think of this as qualcomm trying to sell
their technology into other
manufacturers smartwatches in the future
this run is limited so you may see a
mirasol display in another watch in the
future for now stay tuned for a full
cnet review it's an interesting if
limited watch that's entering a very
crowded market i'm scott stein and
that's a look at the qualcomm toq</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
