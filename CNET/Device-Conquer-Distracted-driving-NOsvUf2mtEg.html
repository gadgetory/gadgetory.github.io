distractions been around as long as
driving some forms of it you get at the
drive-through window other forms and
spring from your loins but the kinds
everyone's talking about today come from
silicon brought an in-car technology
let's learn what those types are how to
survive
distraction comes in three major forms
really Han I and mine that's about the
order we've recognized them and about
the order of their difficulty to solve
now of course going back to the days
when cell phones first proliferated
everybody was carrying him in the car
you were freaking people out because you
were doing this you had one hand off the
wheel so of course the answer became a
rash of hands-free laws you can go
hands-free several ways bluetooth
headsets are common and convenient
built-in in car bluetooth hands-free
that's almost universal in new cars
today or you can add it on or call me an
underachiever my favorite is still the
wired earbud sounds the best costs the
least and nothing to charge but you know
what after the move to hands-free in
some places accident rates actually went
up so we learn the baby hands-free
wasn't the issue we've been doing that
practically since we started driving and
then the attention moved on so now eyes
on the road became the new rallying cry
as hands on the wheel was kind of proved
to be a red herring let's face it you
can have both hands friendly on the
wheel and still plow right in the back
of someone because you're not looking
that way this is where voice command
technology gets a lot of love telephone
navigation car makers began to offer it
and then to make it good which
unfortunately happened in that order in
car voice recognition doesn't usually
command all the parts of your car and it
seldom works as well as what's on your
$200 smartphone 235 second street san
francisco california
Solutions buying a new car look for one
that offers full command over nav media
calling even climate control seek out a
car with app support usually only in the
newest cars but it allows apps to be on
the dash in a car friendly way that
reduces distraction if it's done well or
just clip your phone to the dash use its
voice command and it's car mode screen
so finally after worrying about hands
and eyes and all kinds of peripheral
stuff we finally got around to what it's
really all about mind on the task that's
the elephant in the room and also the
hardest one to deal with new federal
guidelines have tried to measure and
shape it with tortured metrics like no
more than six key presses per task or 30
characters in a single readout yeah you
can punch all kinds of holes and
guidelines like that but to my mind
they're really about putting carmakers
on notice that they are responsible for
these new temptations are putting in
dash Facebook Twitter movie listings
Google search now yes often these are
locked out when the car is moving but
some manufacturers don't do that
solutions really just one here
autonomous cars yep cars that drive
themselves they aren't that many years
away some cars are eighty percent of the
way there now like some of the Volvo's
that have just about complete driver
intervention google has a small well
known fleet of self-driving cars that
have only had accidents when humans took
over and in Nevada they just passed laws
to make self-driving cars legal there
okay the easy solution to all of this
you know what I'm gonna say just put
down the phone most of the time turn off
the camera and just drive for a while
it's actually kind of a refuge
