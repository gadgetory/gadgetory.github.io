foreseen it
I'm here to tell you how to get your set
looking it's best for the big game this
weekend the first step is to make sure
you're watching in the best picture
quality if you have cable double check
that your box is connected by HDMI and
outputting the highest resolution
typically 1080i
that's important because the game is on
NBC which uses that format the broadcast
and of course you want to make sure
you're watching an actual high-def
channel which looks nice and sharp not
the standard def version which looks
comparatively soft another thing to
check is the aspect ratio most TVs are
widescreen so the output from your cable
box should match if the image is
stretched or cut off change it on the
box and/or the TV so it looks right the
next step is dialing in the picture
itself starting with a picture mode you
might be tempted use a setting called
sports or vivid but I think you should
go for a mode like cinema movie or
calibrated because they deliver more
accurate color on the Sony TV for
example the cinema home and cinema Pro
presets are very accurate so colors will
look more natural and the sports mode on
the other hand everything looks to blue
and oversaturated sometimes movie modes
can be a little dim especially if you're
on the west coast and it's still light
outside during the pregame in that case
go in and boost the light output on this
sony tv the control is called brightness
but on most TVs you should actually be
adjusting the backlight control to get
more light not the brightness control
finally if something looks a little
wonky with motion you might want to
adjust that control look for the word
motion usually found deep in an advanced
menu somewhere and try the different
settings there sometimes it's best to
turn it off completely or to play around
with a custom adjustment just be aware
that not every TV has these kinds of
motion controls so those are a few
tricks that you can use to get your TV
looking its best this Sunday enjoy the
game</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
