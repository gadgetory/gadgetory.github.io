a look at the LC 60 le 757 new
television not to be confused with the
Boeing 747 which is an aeroplane he
sharp le 757 is a television sharp 7
series TVs are the company's mid-range
displays and include many
non-aeronautical features like 3d and a
four color LCD like an airplane though
the TV features aluminum in its
construction with a very slim aluminum
bezel and certainly the company's
thinnest yet and even though the bezel
is small the TV still packs in a 35 watt
speaker which sounds half decent for
music and movies the le 757 comes with
the smart TV suite which now includes a
full screen view active 3d with two
glasses and four hdmi ports with MHL
compatibility MHL lets you control and
charger connected smartphone or use the
Roku streaming stick for plug and play
smart TV Sharp's biggest suppose a
drawcard over the entry-level TVs is the
quattron LCD system which the company is
used since 2010 it uses an extra fourth
yellow pixel in addition to the normal
RGB which is supposed to give you better
color but in effect it gives you less
colors this TV couldn't produce the
secondary color cyan properly making it
appear blue Quattrone enables more light
to come through the television and this
could have a negative effect on black
levels which are much lighter on this TV
than the step-down le 650 off-axis
viewing is also a problem with this TV
it has a very small sweet spot off
access blacks turn blue and colours get
even more muted as I say this the le 757
is about three hundred dollars more than
the same sized le 650 but a worst
performer quattrone is more expensive to
make but it's still not a compelling
technology get the cheaper sharp instead
and spend the change on an airplane
ticket this has been ty pendlebury for
