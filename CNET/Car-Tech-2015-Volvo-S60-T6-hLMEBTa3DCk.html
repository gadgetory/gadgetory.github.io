that Volvo's are basically Birkenstocks
on wheels it's time to change into your
puller let's drive this 2015 Volvo s60
t6 check the tech quite a bit of it now
an x6 e is us felt rather unbold oh
looking Volvo you don't see those big
square angles and broad shoulders at
Volvo's typically have and a lot of the
other ones still do this is kind of a
3-series competitor so they've got to
get it right in terms of style not just
function one thing you'll notice very
lately on this car is a new front clip
kind of from here forward
they've reshaped the face a more
aggressive larger grille and recontoured
fenders and hood it's a nice-looking in
front on this car something also want to
call your attention to this may be the
most cameras I see on a car these days
there looks to be at least four lenses
in three positions here later on we'll
see what those are for but this car has
perhaps the most amazing level of
driving assistance Tech and awareness at
this price point now inside the s60
you're finding a very modern interfaces
more than I could say for some previous
Volvo's look what's missing no more of
that kind of crunchy monochrome LCD
8-bit graphic look that they had for
years everything is beautifully rendered
LCD this is one of the most cohesive
cockpits on the market today let's go to
the instrument panel that's what's
really new you've got video throughout
there's not one moving needle on the
whole thing the gauges on the left side
and around the bottom are always in that
position your fuel level your gear
position your shift status range to
empty things of that nature but if you
hit this button on the left stalk you
can change into three personalities
there's one that is elegant there's one
that's eco and there's one that's
performanced a couple things I've never
seen before notice how the turn signals
are rendered in video and this one down
here that shows your instantaneous mpg
when you come to a stop it does
something else new it changes to gallons
per hour because that's the relevant
calculation when you're not moving very
clever not very useful but very clever
and of course you have auto start/stop
technology that should make that zero
unless you defeat it like I do we'll
talk more about that later what's not on
our car unfortunately is the census
system this is they're connected and
apps based layer that goes on top of
what you see in the center screen it
lets you find restaurants that's pretty
common stream music same thing handle
and dictate texts it's also got a module
to find and pay for parking that's kind
of a new wrinkle shifting is one choice
only you've got an 8-speed automatic on
this car now straight PRN D gate for
manual come on back and kick it over
here for sport automatic or initiate a
shift from there or the paddles and now
you're in sport manual mode and also in
a faster shift mode the transmission
becomes quicker and more twitchy and
optionally a rear-view camera
I said optional that's right but it's
going to have a lot going on you've got
distance you've got trajectory and
you've also got sonar overlaid visually
as well as audibly so it's a very
comprehensive backup system
you can also option a front camera I
don't find those really
up here in the engine bay all those
doing some really interesting things
this is not a small car but it's got an
inline 2-liter four-cylinder but hold on
they start to stack on the power
generating tech it has both a
supercharger and a turbocharger the
supercharger of course is belt driven it
works great at low rpms delivering boost
right off the get then later on the
turbocharger takes over sort of mid rpm
on up when it can use all the free
energy that comes off that exhaust gets
rid of turbo lag gives you boost at all
parts of the rev range which a two-litre
needs with a car this size horsepower is
306 out of that combo torque is 295
respectable foot-pounds 0 to 60 is 5.9
for a car that weighs over 2 tons by a
bit mpg is 24:35 also a nice highway
number by the way though this car wants
premium for sure you can also get this
powertrain in an s60 with all-wheel
drive but you've got to step up to the
much pricier our design level we'll put
a sticker on that later now the main
driving grade new the s60 out of power
is gone interesting they really have
dialed out a lot of that low-end initial
tip in lag or turbo lag by of course
having a blower a supercharger that
starts first and the turbo that takes
over the result is I gotta tell you I
was shocked that this was a 2-liter four
when I was first driving at an imagining
one engine it must have under it that
would not have been my guest so that's a
compliment it doesn't make a very nice
sound either the exhaust or the engine
itself
I think they've missed an opportunity
there and getting into the sport mode
here and shifting yourself makes it very
noticeable and and measure difference so
they have a nice delineation of their
different personalities on this engine
good for them on the other hand the ride
quality is what's the word awful it just
translates everything to literally if
the road goes to chunk one inch the car
goes could chunk one inch that's not
what a suspension supposed to do it's
supposed to modulate that but the
handling is tight the car feels lighter
than it's
on paper I'll tell you that that's
always a good thing I've got a little
more used to these seats but man they're
just too narrow and they're not
adjustable I'm a big guy I'm 6 to over
205 and these seats are just annoying
it's like someone who's seeing next to
it's a theater and they're touching you
the whole time it just irks me you may
like that I don't and I got to say the
more I Drive this car the more I love
the cohesive beauty of this cockpit this
is one of the most well thought-out
really beautiful cockpits on the road at
any price leave it to the Swedes right
they know how to do that all s60 s have
city safety standard that means a Carl
stop itself when it detects a rear-end
collision and up to now 31 miles per
hour a higher speed level on top of that
they've now layered cyclist and
pedestrian detection which they say will
pick up the presence of a bike or a
pedestrian stepping into your path at
least from your direction of travel and
again up to full braking will be applied
the headlights are automatic but they
default to high beam and then when
there's an oncoming car they cut out
part of the beam pattern but try not to
turn off the high beams entirely those
front lights of course are also
steerable but now they also have auto
switching cornering lights that come on
and off as you turn very tightly blind
spot and cross traffic alert tech
nothing new there except now the rear
facing radar looks further so it can
detect fast approaching cars that are
about to be in your blind spot and one
of those cameras in the windshield reads
speed limit signs it then puts a little
mini speed limit sign on your
speedometer and puts a little red puck
at the speed on the dial makes it easy
to index the needle to what you should
be doing or at least how much you're
exceeding what you should be doing
okay let's price our s60 we're starting
off now at a little over 39,000
delivered if you want all wheel drive as
I mentioned it gets pricey because it's
part of an are designed sport package
4500 bucks plus seen that style premium
package is the big one little over three
grand for rear cam navigation power
mirrors premium Harman Kardon sound and
a home link garage door opener 1400 get
you the blind spot technology and the
active parking the tech package is 1,500
adaptive cruise Lane Departure
technology forward collision technology
with that cyclist and pedestrian
awareness the one I wish we had was the
census infotainment system for almost
nineteen hundred and eight hundred more
if you want the bi-xenon headlights
which with this intelligent headlight
technology kind of makes sense to me
we're pushing forty eight thousand
dollars now the s60 is mostly strong on
it's amazing drive and awareness
techniques it does things that few other
cars do in a roll up like that on the
other hand I found the ride quality to
be if the engine note to be kind of it
as well but the power delivery is great
that turbo and supercharger combination
and I think it looks good</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
