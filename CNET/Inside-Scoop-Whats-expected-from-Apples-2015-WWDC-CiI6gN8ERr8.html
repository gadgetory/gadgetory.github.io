avedis foreseen it joined by senior
audit shower tube can we're going to be
talking about apple's WWDC kicking off
on jun 8 now Shara traditionally WWDC is
all about software and developers what
are we expecting to see this time around
yeah we're definitely expecting the same
thing we're not going to really see any
hardware here it's going to be all about
software and also some new services
which should be pretty interesting and
on topic of services I know that music
is going to be a really big push at this
WWDC with Apple acquiring beats can you
tell me a bit more about what we might
see ya so apple lot beats for 3 billion
dollars last year it was their biggest
acquisition and we haven't really heard
a lot since then this is finally going
to be the debut of what they've been
working on for the past you know six
months past year so we're expecting to
see a new streaming music service
probably costs ten dollars a month which
puts it on par with Spotify some of the
other competitors but we're just gonna
have to wait to see what all of the
details are and in terms of the other
software install we're probably going to
get iOS 9 and probably an OSX update do
we know any extra details on what we can
see there I think this time around we're
mostly expecting kind of refinements bug
fixes you know minor additions iOS 9
might get something that's kind of like
Google now where it tries to better
predict what you want or kind of show
you the information you need when you
need it so it'll be interesting to see
how Apple does that and a lot of people
have been speculating about that invite
kind of shape like an apple TV now are
we going to see any apple TV hard way
because I know there's been a lot of
rumors about deals done with TV
companies and yeah on that front yeah so
that the Apple TV box is three years old
at this point which is just crazy
because you know people are still buying
it and it's you know at this point it's
outdated technology essentially but we
are not going to see Apple TV
at this show they originally had planned
to show off the new TV box as well as a
new online streaming service but it
sounds more like it's going to be either
later this year or even next year of
course now Apple watch this year was a
huge launch couple months ago in terms
of updates can we expect to see anything
there there will definitely be new
software for Apple watch so right now
all of the apps that you get on the
watch are an extension of the phone app
so you have to have your phone to use
the watch or to really do any of those
those apps with it some of the apple
apps are actually you know loaded on the
device made for the device so we're
actually to start seeing that from
third-party app makers you know that's
probably going to come out later this
year but it's something that should just
allow the apps to take advantage of more
features that are on the watch you know
run a lot faster you know just kind of
make a better experience for the watch
users great sharra thank you so much and
make sure to tune in to our live show on
cnet com starting at 9am on jun 8 thanks
so much for watching inside scoop and
we'll see you next time</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
