around your city or your suburb they
have a lot of fun doing it this is the
gens e 2.0 electric scooter by Mahindra
this is really my first time on the
thing this morning and it's just really
simple to get a handle on it's got a
twist throttle just like a motorcycle
but being it's electric power the
acceleration rolls on really smoothly
there's no gear changes no torque bumps
very easy to modulate and control
Russell falton there's the operations
manager for densey that's how we turn on
our bike here you turn on the power
button you hit the start button hold it
for three seconds or your security code
shows you your battery charge how many
miles you have left in it LED lights on
the front of the bike and the back of
the bike front light on it it stays on
at all times reverse button on here that
it helped you back up horn eat the only
fluid on the bike is in the disc brakes
there's a kickstand down here the front
tires are 16 inch back tire 12 inch
gives you more stability at slow speeds
makes the bike want to stand up straight
booming them frame all one piece welded
powder-coated cargo bay in the back eye
box under the seat here the motor is an
integrated hub motor no change no belts
it's all integrated in one hub
ride quality is really nice and
comfortable too that's because we got
this full suspension and these pretty
nice size tires on this thing starting
from a stop I can pretty quickly put my
feet on the central platform here I have
three drive modes which I can choose
from the touch panel here there's a safe
mode econ and sport safe mode is just
for first-time riders really easy to get
started very little throttle required
port mode gives you full torque and
that's gonna want your more experience
you can write it like that the Jemez e
2.0 electric scooter goes on sale later
this year for price of three thousand
dollars that's actually really low I'm
