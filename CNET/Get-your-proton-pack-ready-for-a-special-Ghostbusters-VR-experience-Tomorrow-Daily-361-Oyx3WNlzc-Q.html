to smart daily no that's muchacho and
i'm jeff kannada and it's time for
headlines with a something weird in your
neighborhood who are you going to call
you the void is expanding its hyper
reality experience business into custom
installations and this morning it
announced it would create ghost busters
dimensions and experience designed to
replicate much of the sights and sounds
from the upcoming Ghostbusters reboot
you'll strap a pack on in real life that
will turn into your proton pack and gun
once you're inside the experience and
you'll spend your time investigating a
ghost invested apartment with two other
players it will launch this July
alongside the film at Madame Tussauds in
New York City which means I will be
buying a ticket to New York City I want
to do this one day I know I want will
the void we've talked about on the show
before and it's really exciting stuff
and I have seen people who have done
previews of it and they are oh yeah
they're converted when they come out so
I I feel like I need a go I have a
friend who said he experienced this and
he said it's the best VR experience he's
ever had so opposed idli there's one
coming in Anaheim so I think we need to
save me a lot of New York trip well save
us a lot of cash for those of you who
like to watch the show you probably know
that we love robots but robots can be
really difficult to get to walk on two
legs without some assistance but
engineers at the University of Michigan
are making algorithms that can help
bipedal robots particularly it's marleau
robot Traverse terrain like steep
inclines and even snow-covered ground
Marlow is a simpler robot than say atlas
but a library of fifteen different gates
makes it possible for Marlow to adjust
to differences on the ground without
special sensors the goal here would be
to gain enough information to implement
this technology into prosthetics to help
amputees walk completely normally
without worrying about uneven terrain
that's crazy to me
fifteen different gates but it doesn't
sense which to use it just cycle through
them no I think they have two actuators
that can go laterally and also this way
so it's like the robot can sort of
figure out what exactly it needs based
on these 15 different gates and it's I
mean it looks hey guys the video looks
ridiculous this robot looks very stiff
but actually it's because it's a simple
robot but it does really really well in
these tests so nice job guys amazing
what do you want to talk about on
everything I have a feeling I know what
you want to say we are proton I think we
got to talk about ghostbusters because
this we got to talk about the void I
think we got to talk about VR I mean
this is one of our favorite topics to
talk about yeah I think it'd be fun if
you want to participate in this
discussion yes I would love to know what
you think the future of VR is these big
installation destination pieces or in
the home like which is gonna be the most
prominent it's a really good question if
you want to answer that you can use the
hashtag hey TD over on Twitter yeah
that's how you let us know you're
talking about it and we'll incorporate
your your discussion into our discussion
on Thursday when we do our deep dive
indeed all right and that being said
let's check out our phone Tiger for the
day
this lovely picture was taken by Mary
using her Lumia 640 yeah Mary wrote in
and said hey Kumar Daly
loved the show and it would be amazing
to be featured on it especially because
I love photography and would like to get
my photos out there my name is Mary and
I'm from Yorkshire in England Yorkshire
not York Shire I give you permission to
use my photo in your video this is a
photo of a dandelion which I found
growing in my garden I took it because I
thought it looked very springy and it
would go well with your theme I took it
on a Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE I love this
picture this is beautiful it almost
looks like she's holding a carousel
she's about to make a wish that's what I
that's what I see the beautiful photo
beautiful pre wish Mary I love that
shallow focus stuff that's really cool
me too me too and my wish if I had a
dandelion would be for you to submit
your phone tog Rafi to tomorrow at
cnet.com yeah and my wish would be for
you to remember to tell us what device
you took it on to give us a
pronunciation of your name if it's
confusing and to give us permission to
use it on the show we also like a little
story as to why you took that
particularly yes those are lots of
different wishes definitely more than
one well first I wish for more wishes
okay a man roll that
I got it perfect a compound wish also
make sure you tell us what device you
use to take your picture because I love
to know that is it for today's show we
will be back tomorrow with a brand new
jhaggat of science fact meeting science
fiction and this week our deep dive show
we have a very special guest one of the
co-creators or one of is it the creator
the creator of honest trailers oh so if
you have questions about honest trailers
