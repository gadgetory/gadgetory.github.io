the latest update to Apple's Mac OS
desktop operating system 10.1 for do you
want to install it here's some thoughts
Apple's made a big deal out of the dark
theme and it's certainly nice to have
you can toggle it on and off and mail
but otherwise you get a mix if you
change the wallpaper from the default
Mojave the translucent menu bar changes
based on the background that actually
turns out to be a plus in some cases for
instance I like as much black as
possible in my interface and now I get
it in the menu bar you've also probably
heard about stacks for automatically
organizing the desktop that's good if
you're okay grouping them by one of the
old sort types or they use the color
tags and as someone who uses screenshots
a lot but who can never remember the
shortcuts the new command shift 5
shortcut to bring up all the options is
terrific being able to jump straight
into the new markup view to edit and
annotate from the screenshot thumbnail
is also really convenient but you still
can't easily choose a folder to save
them in other than the system defaults
the new gallery view which you may also
know as a filmstrip view is really
useful for scrolling through images and
finally being able to see metadata is
great I love the ability to combine
multiple files into a PDF right there
but at least in this beta there are some
drawbacks like the tiny thumbnails as
well as some bugs with selections and
they don't want to leave out some
passing little changes that deserve note
like separating the operating system
updates into its own system preference
and the site icons that appear in Safari
tabs but some of the new features
require iOS 12 to use like the
continuity camera so if you're not
updating your phone to the beta as well
you'll have to wait on those there's so
much more that won't fit here so check
out my hands-on of the public beta on
CNET</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
