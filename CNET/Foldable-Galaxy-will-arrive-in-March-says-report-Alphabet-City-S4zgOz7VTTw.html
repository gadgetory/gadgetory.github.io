show that covers everything related to
alphabet Inc the company that owns so
many things I'm your guy daya's Akhtar
and you are the outstanding audience
today we're talking about some serious
Google issues again Chrome changes your
comments and more but first up let's
talk about the future
let's visit galaxy gateway Yonhap news
just published a report on Samsung's
2019 plans the Galaxy S ten would be
revealed in February the foldable phone
we just recently saw would be shown off
at Mobile World Congress in February and
launched in March during that same month
of March a 5g version of the galaxy s 10
would also arrive the folding phone is
not expected to handle 5g but will be
able to drain your bank account with the
price of around 2 million won or around
$1,700 Samsung gave out some official
specs on its unnamed flexible phone the
front display has a 4.5 8-inch screen
with a resolution of 840 by 1960 the
main 7.3 inch display has a resolution
of 1536 by 2150 - what are you gonna do
with a 7.3 inch Android tablet Sina -
Roger Cheng has a great analysis piece
trying to pin down an answer if you've
got ideas let us know and other folding
phone news evan blast said to expect an
LG folder at CES 2019 which will take
place in January
also another company called royal
introduced a folding phone / tablet
before Samsung did Royals flex PI yes
that is the name is available for
pre-order for around $1,300 let's go to
the garden of Google
guys we spent some time explaining
Google and its history with sexual
harassment if you want full details
check out our last episode here's the
very very short recap until this point
New York Times piece explained
incredible sexual harassment claims
against Google executives executives
being protected by Google with payouts
20,000 Google employees and contractors
walk out in protest protest organizers
post demands for real change within the
company google announces changes to
harassment policies right before we
publish the last episode of this show so
let's talk about Google's changes to
policies since we haven't done that yet
Google posted a blog entry credited to
CEO sundar Pichai in it he apologizes
and explains that the company will
provide more transparency on how it
handles concerns Google will no longer
force workers into arbitration in
harassment and assault claims Google
will also change methods of reporting
channels as well as update and expand
mandatory sexual harassment training
organizers are the walkout publisher
response
in it they say we commended this
progress and the rapid action which
brought it about however the response
ignored several of the core demands like
elevating the diversity officer and
employee representation on the board and
troublingly a race to focused on racism
discrimination and the structural
inequity built into the class system
that separates full-time employees from
contract workers in addition the company
must address issues of systemic racism
and discrimination including pay equity
and rates of promotion and not just
sexual harassment alone let's wrap up
the news with uptown updates Google
announced that starting with Chrome 71
coming in December of 2018 chrome will
show a warning when encountering unclear
subscription pages the idea is to avoid
sneaky scams a site must have three
things to be considered clear billing
info must be visible and obvious to
users customers must easily see the cost
they're going to incur before accepting
the terms and the fee structure has to
be easily understandable if a site fails
any of those three criteria you'll see a
warning according to 9:00 to 5:00 Google
Nest might get a rebrand remember nest
Google bought it back in 2014 the nest
became its own independent company under
alphabet then alphabet decided that
should be a division of google again
nine to five google says discussions are
still early and nothing may happen we've
seen nest products become more
integrated to things like the google
home hub should google have two brands
for its smart home ambitions
could you imagine that multiple brands
for similar products
it'd be like youtube in google video or
google play music and YouTube music or
Gmail and inbox or hangouts and allo and
do other messages that's just crazy one
more tidbit YouTube is out for the
Nintendo switch in the Nintendo eShop it
even supports 360 degree videos to
comment though this is the part of the
show where we shine a spotlight at the
most amazing lottie's of the world view
on the topic of folding phones cipher
360 clothing said can't wait for the
foldable productivity and fun at the
same time imagine playing a game of
fortnight on that when Samsung came out
with larger screens people were saying
why do we need larger screens then Apple
implemented larger screens in their
iPhones and then it became so suddenly
clear why we needed them let's see if
history repeats itself with the foldable
Leon Jimenez says it's an unfolded a
phone or foldable tablet a phone that I
can actually unfold into a tablet and
not carry two devices a tablet I can put
in my pocket how is that a gimmick you
know who thought it wasn't a gimmick
Steve Jobs and Bill Gates agreed in
their final interview together that
unfolding screens was the next step in
the evolution this is the definition of
practical use if you're a daily tablet
user on the go you know exactly why you
need this press the young says do you
guys realize that he shave his beard
Presley yep it was for a Halloween
costume
I was Bob Belcher from Bob's Burgers
