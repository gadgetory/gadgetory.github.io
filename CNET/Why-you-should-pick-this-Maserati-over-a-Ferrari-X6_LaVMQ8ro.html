myriad of SUVs saloon sports cars GT
supercars you naina and they're each
perfect for their intended audience but
when it came to the likes of Maseratis I
was always left a little bit blank why
should you go for a Maserati or a Lambo
the Gran Turismo may be a little on the
older side now it was introduced in 2007
after all but it manages to look fresh
you can't not think that it's a stunning
car to look at its lines just work now
it's fresh look maybe because you don't
see them all that often but still it's a
thing of beauty you'll also notice that
the Trident is a theme that recurs
around the car is dotted all over the
place and even features in the wheels
the interior is a pretty decent place to
be yeah it's a a bit dated and that
might be being a bit kind but I think it
will overall aged quite well providing
you a timeless bubble to enjoy your
journeys in and enjoy your journeys you
will especially in this one because the
MC Stradale isn't a softly-softly GT oh
no this is one of the mad ones
it's back in a 4.7 liter v8 with 454
brake horsepower and 384 pound for
naught to 60 2 takes four and a half
seconds it's top speed is just shy of a
hundred and ninety miles an hour but
it's not just big power that delivers
those numbers there's also lots of aero
trickery going on so the side skirts the
spoiler at the back the splitter at the
front and it's carbon-fibre bonnet
there's three vents in there one feeds
cold air into the engine and the other
to relieve pressure and get rid of
excess heat as the longer side effect
are not only reducing drag but also the
way it's sculpted means it adds
downforce for when you're really tonking
it the MC Stradale is a hundred and ten
kilos lighter in the standard gran
turismo
as well it's all very race inspired
especially the exhausts at the back they
remind me a lot of the ones you find on
the Maseratis Trofeo race cars in theory
then this is kind of like Maseratis take
on a gt3 but not quite let me explain
the original MC Stradale
have no rear seats it was more pared
back more race bred if you will but now
they've popped those back in it's really
quite a comfortable car when it's in
these normal auto modes you can just
cruise up and down the motorway the VA
isn't too intrusive if you want to give
it a tickle it'll get very noisy then
there's sport mode which is sporty but
race is where it's at because everything
just gets better
the steering gets heavier and the
exhaust is just out of this world or in
sport now but if I switch it's a race
drops a cog and you get a little bit
more noise or it sounds proper
this car does have an Achilles heel in
the form of its 6-speed automatic
gearbox it's a robotized manual what
that means is there's a normal gearbox
in there and a robot is doing the bit
that you would be doing that's very late
member that's how I get my head round it
so if you flip a paddle or if the car
decides to change up a gear while you're
driving along the whole thing lurches
forward it's not pleasant at all it's it
does feel it's aged remember this is
technically a seven-year old cars
Ferraris dual clutch gearbox Porsches
dual clutch gearbox all these BMWs they
all show just how dated this really is
however there is a workaround for it if
you want to change up do it on the
paddle so when you do flip up flip and
there's lift off the throttle and then
get back on it as you would a normal
gearbox and then you'll be okay but
still in a hundred and ten thousand
pound car that's quite a concession to
have to make the acceleration you get
admittedly in the lower modes is quite
muted but in race it is Savage
it is truly savage it just fires you off
into the distance or if you have a day
like today when it's a bit greasy in a
bit slippery it will want its bottom to
go exploring elsewhere it's something
you have to be very smooth with as with
any car like this big power up from
wheels driven at the back so yeah
if the weather's a bit adverse maybe
keep it out of race no matter how good
the noise sound
negatives aside it's a really really
lovely car the noise just ah it's
beautiful is the kind of noise that you
end up thinking about for days and days
after just how rich and how smooth it is
it'll really really leave its mark on
you and the fact you can drive it
admittedly in Auto mode you can drive it
and you won't be uncomfortable the
suspension won't jar you it's a proper
GT all that said I want to know who
would buy one now look at the
alternatives Ferrari Lamborghini Porsche
Aston Martin McLaren even Aldi Mercedes
BMW and jag to an extent they're all
very very good at what they do so
maserati's has to offer something
different it has to offer something
special I really don't think that's a
problem
you
2014 saw Maserati centenary its past as
seen racing cars take World
Championships in the hands of legends a
wonderful collaboration with Citroen the
form of the SM and some genuinely
beautiful cars the 3200 GT the birdcage
the MC 12 and the Bora to name a few the
company was founded in 1914 in Bologna
Italy by the Maserati brothers and they
made racing cars very very good ones as
it happens they want championships and
things like the Targa Florio and all the
time the Maserati Trident logo stood
proud on their cars the logo got its
inspiration from the fountain of neptune
in the piazza maggiore in the lawn year
not only is it a symbol of strength and
all that malarkey but it's also a really
nice nod to the company's heritage in
the late 30s the Maserati boys sold up
to the Aussies and the company moved
from its original home belonging to
modern aware it still lives today
Maserati has been owned by a handful of
people the Aussies Citroen de Tomaso
Fiat and Ferrari now it appears to be in
rude health the lineup is strong the
Quattroporte the Ghibli Gran Turismo
Gran Cabrio will holding the fort for
now but soon they'll be an SUV and the
Alfieri
named after one of the founding brothers
a sports car with a 911 f-type and Merc
AMG GT in its sights so that's what a
Maserati is today is luxurious its
powerful its elegant it's really quite
quick and it makes a hell of a noise and
it's
pretty damn good fun to draw so why
should you go for this over all the
others well that's easy because it isn't
a Ferrari and a sterner McLaren a
Porsche a Lamborghini or any of the
others Maseratis are undeniably more
rare than the rest of the pack and that
means are the people that do choose them
they want to stand out but not be
obnoxious about it they want the power
the luxury the elegance the speed and
the style but they don't want to look
like the rest of the Italian supercar
owning masses they want something they
can call their own and you can't blame
them for that especially when it's one
of these
