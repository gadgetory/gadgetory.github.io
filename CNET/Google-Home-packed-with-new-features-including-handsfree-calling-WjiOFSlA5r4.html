Google home to offer a truly personal
experience today I'm excited to announce
hands-free calling coming to Google home
for example let's say I forgot to call
my mom on Mother's Day well now I can
call her while I'm scrambling to get the
kids ready for school in the morning I
just need to say hey Google call mom
sure calling mom so you're finally
calling Mother's Day last three days ago
yeah sorry about that they maybe
rehearse for i/o on Mother's Day and
since the assistant recognized my voice
we called my mom if my wife had asked we
would have called her mom we can
personalize calling just like everything
else but you also have the option to
link your mobile number to the Google
assistant and we'll use that number
whenever we recognize your voice so
whoever you call what's notes coming
from you now we're rolling out
hands-free calling the us to all
existing Google home devices over the
next few months today we're announcing
that Spotify in addition to their
subscription service will be adding
their free music service to Google home
so it's even easier to play your Spotify
playlist we'll also be adding support
for SoundCloud and deezer
to the largest global music services
today and these music services will join
many of the others already available
through the assistance and finally we'll
be adding bluetooth support to all
existing Google home devices so you can
play any audio from your iOS or Android
device and today we're announcing
additional partners including HBO now
so just say what you want to watch and
we'll play it for you all on a
hands-free way so today we're announcing
that we'll be updating chromecast to
show visual responses on your TV when
you ask for help for Google home for
example I can now say ok Google show my
calendar for Saturday showing it on your
TV it'll show up right on the TV screen
I'll mmediately get results from the
assistant and since the assistant
detected my voice we're showing my
calendar others will see their calendar
by using door there voice we can
personalize the experience even on the
TV you can continue to follow up the
conversation
looks like I have a biking trip to Santa
Cruz what's the weather in Santa Cruz
this weekend this weekend in Santa Cruz
it will be clear and sunny most of the
time so it's really easy it's all
hands-free your assistant could provide
a visual response to a TV to a lot of
different types of questions you know we
talked about easy it is to play what you
want to watch on the TV screen but what
about those times you don't know what to
watch well sue you could just ask hey
Google what's on YouTube here you go
and show me my personalized results
right on the TV screen if I don't like
any of the options I can continue the
conversation with my voice show my watch
later list alright play send my love

again no remotes or phone required in a
short conversation I found something
really interesting to watch using go
