okay let's talk in a minute okay what
talk you know what get out of here I'll
need you anyways forget this crap man Oh
What's My Line
what's happening guys Brian song here
and welcome to the best apple bite for
all the good and bad inside the ruled
Apple that's right I called it the best
show I've ever done now let's jump to
the stories and it's official Apple
announced WWDC in 2012 will be held in
San Francisco from June 11th to the 15th
this year but if you thought you even
had a remote chance of getting in
tickets sold out in under 2 hours which
was totally awesome for developers on
the west coast since Apple made the
$1,600 tickets available around 5:00
a.m. local time while people were still
cuddling their hug me pillows but don't
worry you can always find a ticket at
our friends at eBay like this one that's
already at two thousand eight hundred
and fifty dollars with three days to go
now we know Apple can't afford one and
they announced their quarterly earnings
this week with our best ever second
fiscal quarter with over thirty nine
billion dollars in revenue and a net
profit of eleven point six billion
greenies the standout products were no
surprise iPhones selling over 35 point 1
million units up 88 percent
year-over-year and iPads selling nearly
eleven point eight million units up 151
percent now Mac's sold four million
units up seven percent and there was a
drop off with the seven point seven
million iPods sold down fifteen percent
now the interesting nugget of news came
from the Q&amp;amp;A session where Tim Cook shot
down the idea of a hybrid macbook iPad
like device Cook said anything can be
forced to converge but the problem is
that products are about trade-offs and
you begin to make trade-offs to the
point where what you have left doesn't
please anyone you can converge a toaster
and a refrigerator but those things are
probably not going to be pleasing to the
user I personally would like a
refrigerator now Cook's comments aren't
discouraging they're just making it
clear Apple won't be doing anything like
it in the near future but there's more
and more accessories serving this
purpose like the Logitech ultrathin
keyboard cover that earned the
prestigious editors choice from seeing
it so let's check it out I'm Scott Stein
and I like writing on my iPad well I
usually like writing on it if I don't
have to do too many other tasks other
than pure typing and then when it comes
to finding a keyboard for my iPad it's a
bit of a trial and error because some
keyboard cases are really pretty bulky
and I don't always like typing
on my iPad screen directly lo and behold
the new Logitech ultrathin keyboard
cover for the iPad it looks like it's a
laptop right no it's an iPad with this
new keyboard cover attached to it it
connects the same way that a smart cover
attaches via magnets and this little
thin case doubles as a keyboard that you
can lay and set up with your iPad right
through this little docking connector
and it even has magnets on the bottom
pretty snazzy
this thin little case when it's
assembled gives you access to a pretty
full sized keyboard that connects via
bluetooth and gives you some really nice
feeling keys in the middle some cramped
keys on the sides but an experience that
nearly matches what you're gonna get in
a Bluetooth keyboard that will be sold
separately but here you're getting
something a lot thinner and some of the
unattach is in a really sexy way with
your iPad now there are some caveats one
it's not a case maybe that's why they
call it ultra thin keyboard cover in
fact it's not really that great a cover
for the front it's nothing like a smart
cover in the sense that it's kind of
thick and awkward to close but it does
have rubber bumpers that protect the
iPad from contacting the keyboard you're
still going to need something to cover
the back of the iPad however so you
might want to get a smart cover or you
might want to keep it in a folio case
when you're not using this unfortunately
if you try to put a smart back cover on
the third generation iPad it won't dock
with the groove on this keyboard but if
you have an iPad 2 you're in luck I
tried the Belkin snap shield cover and
at least in that instance it worked just
fine now you can also dock this iPad in
portrait mode although it's not kind of
supported with the magnets it does work
it does feel a little bit tenuous here
I'm not sure I trusted at a cafe with a
lot of jostling people but you can do it
though this keyboard is really meant to
be used in landscape mode and only in
this one orientation where the magnets
are to dock and when it does it's strong
enough that it can hold the keyboard on
the bottom it's ninety-nine bucks which
is not cheap but compared to a lot of
iPad keyboard cover accessories that's
kind of right in that ballpark and
Logitech says that this will last six
months on a charge although that will be
with two hours of use a day still that's
a lot of hours of use and it charges via
a micro USB cable
that comes in the package all told it's
not going to reinvent the world of
keyboards but it really may change your
habits in terms of how you carry a
keyboard with you you can't get much
sexier than this ultrabook keyboard
cover and the way connects back with
your iPad as simply as this alright
thanks for that Scott now everyone is
hoping to see the next-gen iPhone and
iOS 6 at WWDC there are no guarantees
but if you like any tidbit of iPhone
news check out these parts from Chinese
vendor TVC mall which has begun offering
what they call iPhone 5 home buns for
sale in black and white now the parts
have a rounded square shape and are
designed differently from the iPhone 4s
is home button and will help hold the
button in place aren't you glad you guys
know that now also in more iPhone news
seen its own Roger Chang reports that
Sprint will continue to support the
iPhones unlimited data plan even if the
next iPhone is a 4G LTE phone and set it
apart from the others on the market CEO
Dan Hesse told C net that if the next
iteration arrives with LTE Sprint will
continue to offer a no strings unlimited
plan and that's a strong differentiator
and I'm all in for that and you've got
to love some of those analysts that make
up an idea and publish it a KGI
Securities analyst reports that Apple
may be preparing to drop the 17-inch
MacBook Pro from its lineup due to weak
sales now I haven't heard any chatter
about this and our own C net poll the
majority of 45% of respondents say they
shouldn't kill it
35 percent say the 13 and 15 inch models
are good enough for them and 20 percent
say they'd like to see a 17 inch MacBook
Air backing up the idea that even if the
17 inch is its least popular model it
still serves a specific user and the
creative professional market and finally
guys we wanted to send you off with some
happy thoughts
Apple owns the patent to an iMac touch
concept all the way back from 2010 we've
seen all-in-one touch smart desktops
from HP but check out this sweet concept
video from Joaquim ole Seth showing off
the idea in action incorporating a
touchscreen Mac OS 10 lion functionality
with Siri and more it's really really
pretty but how do you the Apple biters
feel about a touchscreen iMac have you
been waiting for one do you hate the
or is there something else you'd like to
touch let us know at the Apple bita
cnet.com and we'll read some of your
responses next week that's gonna do it
for this week's show thanks for watching
I'm Brian Tong we'll catch you next time
for another bite of the Apple it was
great guys all right yeah all right guys
I'm gonna see you guys all right</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
