entry into the full-size headphone
market is a Bluetooth wireless headphone
it also has noise cancelling and it
retails for 250 dollars hi I'm David
Carr noise and in the past Plantronics
has made a lot of in ear headphones for
its backbeat line but as I said this is
the first full-size headphone and it
really is designed for someone who
really is working in an office
environment Plantronics says it really
isn't going after the beats customer
this does have many of the same features
as the Beats Studio wireless headphone
it is pretty good noise cancelling isn't
necessarily as good as the bose
noise-canceling and the sound quality is
also good once a it's quite up to the
par of the Beats Studio wireless but
it's a good sounding headphone with
pretty well balanced sound it is a
little bit aggressive does have kind of
a little bit heavy bass a little bit
push in the trouble but all in all a
pretty decent sounding headphone it does
have a few extra features of NFC tap to
pair technology for phones that support
it as well as apt X support that's
supposed to make Bluetooth sound a
little bit better again that's for
phones to support it and there is a
wired option you can connect to court to
it so if it does run out of batteries on
a plane or something you can still
listen to it Plantronics says you can
get about 24 hours of battery life from
these headphones and as far as the
controls go they're all built into the
headphone ear cups they're well placed
and easy to operate by feel you can
advance tracks forward and back raise
volume and answer and end calls very
easily so well designed from that
perspective it's also worth mentioning
that this is a Bluetooth 4.0 headphone
and there is enhanced range for devices
that support it so this can go well
beyond the 30-foot range of usual
Bluetooth devices if your device
supports that enhanced bluetooth this is
a comfortable headphone not necessarily
the lightest headphone but it is
designed to be worn in office
environments as I said and I did wear it
on a cross-country playing trip and the
noise cancelling did work well it does
get a little steamy in warmer
environments but that is the case with
all full
headphones so there you have it
Plantronics entry into the full-size
wireless headphone market solid entry
it's a $250 product I'm David Carr noise
and that's the Plantronics backbeat pro
