Kiva robots at this fulfillment center
in Tracy California more than 3,000 of
them cruised the warehouse floor helping
employees fill millions of orders the
little orange robot goes out and picks
the right pot of inventory and brings it
back just at the right time for the
person to pick the item out to go in
that customer shipment before the Kiva
robots the workers used to walk the
warehouse aisles picking up the items
but now they stay on these platforms and
the robots bring the shelves and the
items directly to them the three hundred
and twenty pound robots can lift up to
750 pounds they've motion sensors to
detect objects in their way and can
travel between 3 &amp;amp; 4 miles per hour
amazon says the robots small footprint
allows it to squeeze in 50% more
inventory into this warehouse which is
the size of 59 football fields they've
also improved efficiency by 20% so it
only takes 15 minutes to fill some
orders instead of 90 on Cyber Monday
last year Amazon customers ordered 426
items every second Amazon expects that
number to be bigger this Cyber Monday
the process at an Amazon Fulfillment
Center starts when products arrive by
the truckload the items are sent up to
one of the 4 floors where kiba robots
operate in this new generation
fulfillment center we have associates
who were taking products off the carts
and putting them onto the shelves that
are that are moved by our Kiva robots a
worker finds a space to stock the item
on one of the moving shelves it doesn't
matter if there are paper towels next to
board games just as long as the robots
know where to find it among the 21
million items then the robots way to
retrieve the item when someone places an
order from their items are hand-picked
and whisked away on miles of conveyor
belts to be sorted packed and shipped
there's even a robot that folds the
shipping boxes well some may worry about
robots taking jobs away from humans
Amazon insists that is not their
intention you're going to see there's
4,000 people working in this bill
even with all the automation that's in
place here that's because our focus on
automation is about helping people do
their jobs not replacing people so far
ten of the 50 amazon fulfillment centers
in the united states have integrated the
Kiva robots in Tracy California I'm Kara
