this is the latest version of a vision
that I have had for gosh 4 years now
it's it's basically a a device that lets
you scratch with audio tape
what what makes it unique from other I
know there are other people that
describe with tape out there what makes
it unique is that it's essentially it
there are two different mechanisms of
movement there's there's the physical
movements of these moveable play heads
up and down these strips of the strip of
audiotape and then also there is the the
physical movement of the tape itself
which is controlled by a motor that's
inside here and I have you know these
controls that make make the tape move
forward or backwards and by combining
these are two different kinds of
movements I I can really get a lot of
you know fun fun stuff you know I can
record to the tape and then scratch with
it as I'm recording to the tape because
the tape has multiple tracks I in like
in this example I can have one scratch
playlist recorded on one pair of tracks
at another scratch playlist on another
so here I've got parliament-funkadelic
on one pair of tracks and then on the
other pair of tracks I have you know a
series of scratch samples the way I find
is comfortable for me is it feels more
natural to move from left to right with
my right hand and then from right to
left with my left hand so what I do is I
I record one one playlist running in one
direction and then the other running in
the other direction so so then I can you
know I can do this
so these these play heads our play heads
that I pulled from old reel-to-reel
decks oh and by the way that yes that is
a Safeway card that I I cut up and glued
to the bottom of this the reason for
that is because it's actually really
important that beat the play head
doesn't press down too hard on the tape
because if it does then the motor will
struggle because it's putting too much
pressure on the tape so that that
basically was the purpose of that was to
make it a little bit higher so anyway
yeah these are these are play heads that
I pulled out of old reel-to-reel decks
that I bought on eBay I spent a lot of
money on ebay working on this project so
this is the tape loop it loops under the
board the motor the motor that's driving
the loop is actually something that I I
pulled out of an old an old printer I I
was actually looking I was trying to
figure out how to build the the pinch
roller and the guy here at the Fablab
Jordan he he suggested that I try just
buying an old broken printer and taking
it apart and and and it turned out to be
perfect so this rocker right here makes
it run forwards or backwards but if
you're doing two headed scratching like
I was talking about before obviously you
can't have your hand on this so I build
I built this foot pedal which is it's
basically like a foot rocker and it you
you know you press down the toe to make
it run in this direction press down the
heel to make it in that direction but
anyway so you can see how it like I use
the I use the foot pedal so I can I can
do two headed stuff
about a year and a half ago I built the
first version that had an actual
motorized tape transport which could
actually record but it was still
completely all handmade still really
crude and that the video of that one
ended up getting like over seven million
views it was it was crazy a lot of
people started reaching out to the web
and so then somebody told me about
Fablab this which is where I am now
and this place is like this place was
like made for me it was it's so perfect
and I was ultimately by by coming here I
was ultimately able to make a prototype
that does almost everything I wanted in
my it was it was almost a full
realization of my original vision and
it's been such amazing experience this
is like this idea that I got years ago
and I just I just couldn't get out of my
head so I I just I had to do it</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
