million dollar unmanned aerial vehicles
that take high altitude photos and rain
down death from above right well yes but
that is not the end of the drone story a
new wave of smaller low cost and
hopefully civilian friendly drones could
soon be flying in the skies above at 3d
robotics in berkeley california former
wired editor-in-chief chris anderson is
flying high with this new trend so
cameras are everywhere they're in your
pockets they're on our street corners
except for the sky why are cameras and
skype is too expensive too dangerous
drones are an opportunity to take
sensors which is what cameras are and
put them in a place where they have a
new perspective on our world and what we
do with that data is up to us these
kinds of drones started as DIY hobbyist
projects Anderson made his first UAV out
of a lego robot kit and toy plane with
his kids a few years back we just did
this around the kitchen table and then
we put in a plane oh my gosh and this is
now in the lego museum in Billund
Denmark the world's first Lego unmanned
aerial vehicle today Anderson's startup
designs open-source drones for use in
all sorts of fields like real estate
search and rescue aerial photography and
even literally in the fields with
agriculture do you feel like there will
become a tipping point where people
might start noticing drones whizzing by
their car windows or whatever it is
where will I think in five years time if
you ask you know my kids what mile they
know what's wrong but yes sir our
neighbor kids it what drones are they
say oh those are those things that buzz
over farm fields yeah they think we
missed farm equipment because when you
think about it you know the place where
we don't have a problem with drones is
away from people
I confess to feeling a little bit
terrified with the drones whizzing
overhead but I have complete faith in my
pilots and this one looks like it's
quadcopter yep this one right here is a
quadcopter meaning it has four rotors so
right now that closer quadcopter is
flying itself it's in a mode called
loiter it's about I'd say you know 20
feet 30 feet off the ground right just
kind of hovering there it's compensating
for the wind so what's in there like a
bit there's inside a gyroscope there's
owner like yeah there's the the 3dr
autopilot the RG pilot is inside there
and that has an IMU so that includes a
gyroscope accelerometer magnetometer GPS
so all of those things 3d robotics l's
compleat UAVs that range from 500 to 700
dollars plus individual components and
the standalone autopilot module that
runs about 200 bucks the goal is to
simplify and also crowdsource autonomous
flying robots and then see what happens
you've got this touchscreen interface
and it's really high level in the sense
that if you want to plan a mission you
know you click here point point point
you get all these waypoints I'm gonna
change this Wayne point to a land
Waypoint and then we could if we wanted
to now just click go and that plane
would go fly over the hill ok would do
that loop and would come back and we
just landed our feet what's great about
our software so it's open source as you
know and because of that I think it
fosters this community of people who
want to come out and just build cool
applications program based autonomous
flying that anyone can implement and I
mean anyone imagine drones delivering
pizza oh nice you guys are like the Blue
Angels of drone pilots you're killing it
right now oh hey day I should totally
stop taking pictures and focus on this
important story
the possibilities for virtual reality
are dizzying literally the 3d robotics
field ops team let me try out their test
plane equipped with an oculus rift AR
headset alright so this is my first
person virtual reality perspective
flying an airplane that's it put it on
hop in the rift I so yeah we got sake
let's rev yep controlling what so we
have the oculus rift here which is a
first-person view virtual reality
headset and it displays video but it
also does head tracking so that is
actually controlling the camera over
here on the front of the plane ok and
with that you can fly this plane far far
far out of the field of view over the
hills and you can see where it's going
through the perspective of the plan so
when i turn my head or these goggles
that cameras move in can try it on yeah
ok oh my goodness alright noses so you
can move your head to the right and to
the left weird of course all of this
cool technology is right now kind of
bordering on illegal FAA guidelines
state that drones can only fly up to 400
feet even though many can and do soar as
high as a thousand feet add to that the
privacy implications and concerns over
domestic surveillance and you have a few
red flags but with the new legislation
like it or not we might be seeing these
six hundred dollar drones flying in all
kinds of unexpected places in the not so
distant future
