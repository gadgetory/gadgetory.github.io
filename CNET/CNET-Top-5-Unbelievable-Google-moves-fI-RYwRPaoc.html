Aya's Akhtar let's talk a little bit
about Google the company is famous for
its April Fool's gags but Google has
made some very real business moves it
were really hard to believe today we're
counting down the top 5 unbelievable
Google moves at number 5 driverless cars
let me get this straight
Google a search engine company
advertising wizard built a driverless
car sure it did no really it did back in
October 2010 Google told the world that
it had developed technology for cars
that can drive themselves why Google
said our goal is to help prevent traffic
accidents 3 up people's time and reduce
carbon emissions by fundamentally
changing car use it still sounds
futuristic and it still sounds nuts
number 4 Google bias YouTube
in October 2006 Google announced it
purchased YouTube for 1.65 billion
dollars in stock back then YouTube was
mired in copyright infringement lawsuits
why on earth would Google buy a company
with such liabilities on the same day as
the acquisition YouTube cleaned up a
couple of spots with Universal Sony BMG
and CBS display mercy net is owned by
CBS YouTube at the time was about two
years old
this was a huge gamble for Google and it
seemed to work out just fine
at number 3 google announces Internet by
balloon that sounds made-up to right it
does sound fake but Google announced
Project loon in June 2013 loon was the
product of Google X Google's
experimental lab the company said it
believes it could be possible to build a
ring of balloons flying around the globe
on the stratospheric winds that provides
internet access to the earth below the
pilot program started in New Zealand
with 50 testers number two restructuring
Google becomes a subsidiary of another
company that sounded crazy enough that I
had to check the date twice after
realizing it was August and not April
and reading the press release a couple
of times I finally believed it
Google's co-founders moved to a newly
formed company called alphabet which in
turn owns Google Google stock turns into
alphabet stock many of the crazy things
that
necessarily make sense for Google to be
running became their own entities
outside of Google but owned by the same
parent company you got all that google
chrome head who used to be the head of
android is now the head of all of Google
to story it's time to check Twitter I
asked you fine viewers what moves you
thought were unbelievable Mary Jo
pitched in with this idea Google+ being
a competitor to Facebook Eloy mentioned
Google's contact lens that measures
glucose levels yes that's a real thing
David mentioned the killing of Google
Reader however a lot of you picks a
certain announcement and it's the number
one unbelievable Google move the
introduction of Gmail this couldn't be
real Google will give you one gigabyte
of email space in 2004 oh and Google
announced this on April 1st 2004 this
has to be a joke right obviously we know
this turned out to be completely true
and the service has been around so long
that you snickered people with other
email addresses don't you by the way
Google didn't make this easy to believe
when it announced the service and a blog
post quote the idea that there could be
a better way to handle email caught the
attention of a Google engineer millions
of Eminem's later Gmail was born should
this list be the top results were crazy
list on a Google search let me know on
Twitter I'm at Aya's if you want to find
me on Google+ I'm there too I'm plus I
