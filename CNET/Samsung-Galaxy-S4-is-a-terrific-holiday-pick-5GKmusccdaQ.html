smartphones that you could buy it
yourself for somebody else this holiday
season I'm Jessica doll court for cnet
and I'm going to tell you why you should
seriously consider making the samsung
galaxy s4 here your top pick this is a
top-notch smartphone that does all the
important stuff really well it's crisp
colorful 5-inch screen with the 1080p HD
AMOLED display makes viewing everything
from articles to videos to games really
immersive the Qualcomm Snapdragon 800
processor is also the fastest you can
currently find on a smartphone which
makes mobile gaming extra satisfying for
casual gamers all the way up to those
who invest in consoles image quality is
big deal to me personally and the galaxy
s4 is right in the top consistently
capturing lively detailed 13 megapixel
images and 1080p HD video low-light
photos are a little bit of a weakness
but flash a night mode both helped turn
out high quality pictures that are
usually good enough to frame an easy
mode option will appeal to newbies as a
way to ease into Android and it will
also appeal to anyone who likes a
simpler interface on the other end of
the spectrum no phone offers more built
in software extras for power users
adventurous types who dig into every
feature will find a TV remote a pile of
photo tools and crazy gestures to
control parts of the phone with a wave
of the hand or glance of the eye the
galaxy s4 certainly isn't the best
looking phone you can buy in my opinion
that honor goes to the HTC One and the
iphone 5s but it is attractive enough
and also very light and slim best yet
nearly every carrier has it and you can
expect the prices to drop during holiday
promotion off once again i'm jessica
Thal court for CNN shining a spotlight
on the samsung galaxy s4 you can read my
