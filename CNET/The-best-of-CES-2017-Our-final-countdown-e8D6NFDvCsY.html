special edition fit the last edition for
CES 2017 it's a good that field
I'm Brian Cooley joined again by CNET
senior editor my personal physician
Scott Stein happens to be an
anesthesiologist don't you talk about my
life we've been in Las Vegas for fedora
the jokes over after this you can go
back to normal while I go to sleep five
long days and today we revealed our top
picks for the best products of the show
this is are the ones that want us over
here at CES but that have real legs not
just G wizna stu them so we can do this
a year from now and look at it with you
when we come back here next January and
say you know what those products all did
pretty well now if you're wandering the
halls taking briefings and lots of
strange and sometimes bad smelling hotel
rooms and out in parking lots even we
are now here to distill it all for you
first up laptop Scott and we have Dan
Ackerman here with hi mr. laptop mr.
Loftin and you are sitting in front of
the most amazing this is not three
discreet monitors this is one unit this
is one laptop this is the Razer project
Valerie and it's a concept piece it's a
prototype and it's a big 17 inch gaming
laptop and the lid is extra thick
because there's two extra monitors
inside and the way it would work in a
final version is you'd press a button or
use a software command and these two
screens would come out from the side and
arrange themselves and you have a multi
monitor display built into a single
laptop that's pretty amazing it's pretty
wild it's got it's got a video 1080 and
it's so high-end graphics I played some
games on one of these the other day and
it played a game just fine and you just
have this gigantic super wide view of
what you're playing you know this is
I've been to it so far so it's actually
really cool to see how the screens work
it reminds me very much of the razer
laptops but with that added it was funny
at the show somebody was mentioning how
they immediately thought it made a lot
of sense to them and then the first I
saw they thought it was crazy but then
yeah we're connecting monitors all the
time you're connecting tons at the lab
and you're doing multi screen gaming
there's no setups and maybe it's an
alternative to VR my head went on this
which is odd being a non gamer I looked
at this and thought if they did a little
more articulation of those screens so
they could also have one of them fold
back all the way it becomes a great
business tool so you can do a quick
PowerPoint at a conference table with
will you do an ad hoc meeting with just
putting that out there razor it's not
your core market by any stretch but you
know it's an idea we can put your email
on one and the spreadsheet on another
thing on another yeah great great
machine for not just gaming but everyday
use me people think three months three
monitors is some huge luxury until you
use them and then they become
indispensable unfold this on an airplane
without the extra legroom so make you
buy an excess seat yes believe me yeah I
want to see that with like peel off OLED
screens that become like the wallpaper
see now you're really going up in there
all wireless yeah you stick them where
you want a sheet of post-it notes see
networking for you now here's another
one Dan that you brought over and you
get this guy back awake this is the Dell
Inspiron I 5 7000 it's run 1517 there's
a weird space there ok and this was the
opposite of that this is this is super
you know prototype a concept D high-end
this is super practical you can go out
and buy it if not now very soon very
inexpensive it's it's Dells basically
entry level gaming laptop and they added
a little bit of game reflet to some red
highlights to it and they've got the new
Nvidia 1050 graphics card which is the
new part its main street if they're kind
of less expensive one but still really
good and they pack that in there with a
new 7th gen Intel Core i5 chip for $7.99
and if you want to go get a gaming
laptop that will play pretty much any
new game at pretty high detail levels at
full 1920 by 1080 and you don't want to
spend more than 800 bucks I started
around here it looks so badass from the
back with these it's pretty much isn't
it and they got the cooling outlets here
it doesn't look like a budget laptop but
it's so much less expensive than that
level performance last year would have
been then they Vivek what a lot of car
designers do these days this looks like
the exhaust outlets on a lot of hot cars
there's no way that's a coincidence are
you of course and they bring up a lot of
stuff from the Alienware in the XPS
lines the more high-end lines they bleed
it into this Inspiron line so it doesn't
look like you know your budget mid price
laptop yeah nice build quality
feels nice ok good laptops were actually
pretty exciting at this show yeah a lot
of cool gaming stuff which I always like
to say I know thank you very much Dan
thank you all right good deal all right
Dan Ackerman they're getting us excited
about laptops in two very credible ways
one futuristic prototypical don't know
the price yet really want one on the
other one a great value or
right now and available so it's great
and way under four figures love that
practical next up TVs LG really wowed us
that means him this year as well as me
but Scott Stein's but in love with the
product we're about to show you now our
own brian tong the inimitable bt is
standing by at the LG booth in the main
hall here at CES to tell us all about
the LG w7 for the first time at CES the
show is about a thinner TV not just a
bigger TV BT you've heard about LG's w7
OLED TV this wallpaper TV right here I'd
nauseum here at the show but every time
we see it we do not get tired of it this
thing is still just amazing it is the
most beautiful TV we have ever seen
during the entire course of CES and
again right this is their wallpaper TV
it's 2.5 7 millimeters thin and then to
really add a structure to it right they
had to get that frame on it that made it
three point eight eight millimeters now
in a second you'll see it peel off right
we have this ribbon there you go huh
that is your TV you can put on the wall
of magnets and only weight 8 pounds even
my scrawny little body could put this up
on a wall right you don't have to melt
it anymore
I've been connecting down to the sound
bar on the bottom Dolby Atmos sound bar
this television supports 4k HDR do you
know Dolby vision HDR 10 this is TV to
get and really the standard that we're
gonna see it set the bar now for all
television manufacturers moving forward
this is the hottest thing here at CES I
love it so much and again like just look
at how beautiful that thing is there's a
reason why we have made that we have
called this the best thing we saw and
again LG dropped this on day one the
ferti note of the show so I'm gonna
throw it back to you guys you guys can
gab a little bit more but one thing that
I want to leave the show floor with is
this guy VT Thank You Man
$8,000 we've learned will be the price
now that's for a 65 inch I think and
they make several sizes I think it makes
a 60 65 and a 70 if I recall they have a
few in that large size range not cheap
now but actually not I mean in a way not
super expensive as some people might
expect 8000 is not ultra insane it's
just
in say normal insane but it's not
prototype pricing right no a $30,000 yes
real product pricing and I don't know
maybe it's just till I hung a TV in my
house recently or I didn't I had someone
else do it
that's right yeah and that so it was
like you know 40 pounds and you have
that pass-through and you have to deal
with it although I deserve someone that
will break up box but not as nice as
that but you got to find a stud to mount
the mount thing on right screws in just
right and that's holds why people back
from doing a really elegant mount of any
TV they buy they end up often using a
table Stanga it's just easy or they have
to hire someone for a couple hundred
bucks right to come in and do all that
work which is an impediment this kind of
thing here we mean that magnetic
background frame route it just clips
onto the wall and you from what I can
tell you don't need to find a stud you
just put this thing onto a sheetrock
wall and just click I think we really
used to even imagine that in smaller
sizes like we didn't talk about that but
what do you start making monitors and
other things that that used to no stick
on walls yeah so then you put something
at the office or you're traveling here
and you just you know create your little
space stick things on an back of an
airline seat there's a market for that
too yeah and we are oddly enough with
all this talk about fairness we're
leaving out the image quality which is
OLED it's as good as a TV gets this is
the son of the best TV we've ever
reviewed yeah the curandero are the best
TV that we like right now the current LG
OLED and this was just more amazing and
dramatic so it's coming off of great DNA
and great lineage let's catch a
freighter bending it I wouldn't I
wouldn't struggle and tweak it too hard
yeah once you're that little crack sound
you go oh there goes eight grams that's
true staying with LG for a moment they
had a new refrigerator as well the smart
insta view fridge a follow-on product to
last year's which had a remember this
video door that you would knock on and
it would suddenly go clear right right
they've got they've they've really
supercharged the information abilities
of what goes on when it's not clear and
it's an actual interactive screen and we
kind of rolled our eyes a little bit
about the fact that they went to make it
webOS now yeah you know it just pipes be
coming back all the time and we were
joking like you know webOS here it
doesn't it really now it's gonna be in a
family member next you know some sort of
robotic dad yeah
whoever it might be it's going to get
custody or something well so that was
really cool but it's also Alexa
compatible so that was the really
important news like everything here
except my left shoe is all become Alexa
compatible here at CES and this was
another one of the product but that
makes absolute sense to make everything
at least compatible with Alexa as well
as multiple other platforms right and
you know I was giving one of the tours
here and around showing that off and you
know my first thought is I wouldn't want
to get one of these fridges and then I
got a lot of people who disagreed with
me because over a couple at least two
were passionate and said that first of
all the idea of going shopping and and
reordering things which they don't
really go so much into but you know that
is something that we intriguing and then
the if you're going shopping the whole
idea of the snapshot inventory of and I
for some reason I didn't think about
that I thought about going to the fridge
and turning it into a screen but it's
when you're away from it knowing what's
in your fridge and inventory ago I why
did I buy more milk that was ridiculous
they've added cameras to this one for
this year is that right yeah so we can
show this they didn't have it last year
Samsung beat him with that it has a
snapshot of the content okay so it's got
the snapshot that's where you can
actually see the contents as video on
the front door without opening the door
but also you can do a translucent white
something a magic wind you have two ways
to look into the glass door now with
your eyes or with a camera view right
right so it's a I think is it's
intriguing and I think it's like the
idea of I mean no not letting our cold a
or sure but but but really the idea of
it's like a monitor for your the baby
monitor for your food I know I'm like
now my mind's justify might start to be
a little bit gilding the lily but the
core features here makes sense and if I
understand it right being less
compatible doesn't mean you can just
drive it through Alexa but it it can
form it can operate as an Alexa is that
right or as an echo um it's it's it's
Alexa connected but I wasn't sure about
primarily to control your home sure
about the question and I'm not sure it's
ever really you know we talked about
like connected devices that is an
important distinction you know terms
like what you know whether it's gonna
hook in as a device gonna be a spoke is
this an echo right is this my echo echo
okay so let's say with you
for a minute this this was very
understand we were doing the press
conference coverage on this the samsung
flex wash and flex dry a new washer a
new dryer
they have large central front loading
chambers but as you can see here they
both have an auxilary top loading
chamber that is the washer that has what
is that about a quarter the size of a
main chamber maybe a fifth for doing
either delicates or doing small loads
yeah and we'll see the dryer in a minute
which has something on top as well and
you can set them separately and so if
you have laundry with different you know
requirements you can run four things and
we were totally joking about this one
too because you have to joke about
having a washing machine in a washing
machine and a dryer in a dryer nested
you know but but on the other hand it's
an accomplishment because you don't have
to set up a separate system and you know
it all runs through one you know source
for water our hall managers were very
impressed with this it's a it's an
appliance innovation more than putting
smart in you know it seems like it's
it's it's an actual physical engineering
innovation right tend to see a lot of
software innovation here but that's this
in the appliance category you see a lot
of real heavy iron engineering and this
is it looks very well done and it seems
to have a practical purpose I think a
lot of people would say why do I have a
light load knob why isn't there just a
light load chamber that's much more
efficient than just using a big tub a
little bit absolutely and as much as I
you might think it's silly I would think
if it got to an affordable price where
it was a feature on many models I think
most people would go for it because if
you're doing a load of laundry and then
the machine is taken then the first
thing you want to do is say well what
about a backup yeah what about this
thing I have to do this little thing we
always have want a luxury thing needs
special care you put that at the top do
it at the same time save time so it's
connected Chrysler's go to the cars now
completely different area from the
garage where the washer lives to the
driveway out front where the car usually
sits and this is the Chrysler portal
concept this kind of opened the show
this went out on Monday early in the
week they've one of the earlier press
conferences what they've done here is
you could say it's minivan like I think
it's more kind of large urban utility
it's got those doors you see there that
split open like an elevator door that's
kind of interesting innovation I haven't
really seen before they kind of go out
and wide that's never gonna make it to
production but what you do see
interesting here is
obviously got full autonomy with all
kinds of sensors lidar ultrasound radar
the full kit of every sensor made and
then inside we'll see in a moment the
interface is extremely I think well
integrated without being too futuristic
that you just don't believe it you're
gonna see a big strip of led a LED
across what we call the eyebrow display
there it is the top of the dash that's
one huge long narrow wide eyebrow
display of course Chrysler is really big
on utility they've they were the ones
that invented stow and go there's that
OLED eyebrow display another huge one is
down in the center sort of Allah Tesla
it's electric as well now it's a concept
but it shows how we're starting to see a
lot of things come together in a mature
way and not necessarily in extremely
fanciful manners the roadshow team was
very impressed by this one give it their
nod those doors the way they open make
me feel like the men are at airport car
you know they give me that feel and
don't be caught when they close and
there's a software bug all right we're
gonna like an elevator gone nuts gotta
hold the door me my arm back well I'm
always afraid of those at the New York
City you know think the cab doors that
do that that's slide opens they're
automatic sometimes they're not
automatic whatever I never know yeah you
pull out the driver says stop I've got
it and then you go back and forth swipe
and check having a cell phone call the
Nvidia shield this is interesting you
know this is in the category of Roku's
and Apple TVs and Amazon fire sticks but
it does a whole lot more this is a more
powerful box than any of the streaming
devices we've got gaming and streaming
here right yeah and it plays games
locally it streams from your PC also
streams from the cloud NVIDIA has a
cloud gaming platform so there are three
different ways to stream if you have a
gaming PC there's a third and it has all
these connected streaming video apps and
services and it connects with Google
assistant now so it connects with smart
home meetings and it's a crazy good
package it already was our favorite what
are our very favorite streaming boxes
David Katzenberg has been raving about
this I used to use the shield a lot and
I just thought it was great and so you
add all of that in and I think is that
right yeah and you can get you know with
extra storage if you want that's right
and it really is like a litigator 500
gig I think of the two storage levels
and you get Eckstein has a whole 16 gig
it's almost like you know almost just
like a basic no storage you standard
like Apple TV or saying Roku and then
you go for the larger one for storing
lots
okay so one has almost no storage one
has that's the fact that I have a
terabyte yeah okay gamer you get the
other one and it has I understand of
smartthings dongle to make it a smart
things compatible devices yes it does
and the controller now is always
listening if you want it to to become a
microphone to talk to and they have
plugs that will go throughout your home
they're gonna sell later that will add
listening capability so they'll make a
smart home network around the Nvidia
shield so you really that would be all
you need it made me smile it's vibrant
it's misting hybrid of a lot of
functions that we haven't really ever
seen mash together in one think from a
credible company right and it also does
4k HDR so oh yeah and it supports a lot
of apps like Plex that was an exciting
one so it's it's a really great ones
coming out right now and I think of
existing shield owners get a lot of
these updates too so yes some of the
hardware upgrades obviously exactly push
it out when this goes live the software
update will go live for those of you who
have the existing shield to get almost
all these functions yeah which is which
is a nice thing that's good corporate
citizenship awesome upcoming real pay
let's go put something in our ears
doppler labs yes stuck it in beat easier
they have something called the here one
which you see here that's the case it
comes in there's one of the earpieces
they're they're cool i got to try these
two and I'm excited about this get this
product because these go in your ear and
what they do is they don't just give you
the ability to have wireless high
fidelity earbuds that's nothing new but
they also digitize the world around you
so that normal pass through hearing
becomes part of a manipulable digital
stack of signals yeah so they can also
do a mix of the real world which would
otherwise be really hard if you left
that analog but they redid you ties it
on the fly and say now I can mix I can
do anything I can mix game streaming
alerts and me talking to you yes and
they want to create some sort of like
ambient augmented reality for audio but
I don't know what is that really level
it's yeah and so but and in the now
there's an array of microphone so
there's spatial you know it's like an
array of micros around it so I can
listen behind in front and all around
and you could start listening behind you
if you want to and start listening
people it's actually a little bit yeah
exactly
you can and it works you could listen
forward you could create different sound
effects they had a one that was just
audio filtering is last year now they
mixed in music and they they're like air
pods and the says you put them in a pack
and
charge them music battery life left the
test a bit you know a little bit less
but and they cost more but they do so
much more what do we hear about a price
do you recall that powerful and doing
that much work and appears to be very
nicely made looks like there's really
good build quality they they feel good
they're good quality I tried a prototype
so we make sure they look like when
you'd better when they come out they're
coming out soon and and that idea is
going to be echoed a lot of different
places it's smart hearing and an
enhanced hearing and the idea about a
building I mean you're gonna see Apple
do that eventually in things like the
air pause you're gonna start seeing more
intelligent noise cancelling and
filtering yeah and I think they're
leading the way in where we were calm
Hiro bowls or headphones are going next
and that's an exciting trend yeah bring
us some really multimode DSP to things
as opposed to just plain noise
cancellation we've had that for years in
headphones now let's do some more
creative things that can also involve
mixing signals having signals pop up
with certain priority the AR for audio
like your talked about a very good way
to describe you mix it with AR and that
could get really interesting oh yeah
3d audio is important for that stuff
interesting okay that's that that one
was very very interested a lot of folks
would say ah what's the interesting
about an earbud those have a lot going
for them here's one that we have never
seen I don't think ever on our show
stage before a hi-tech breast pump from
a company called willow now neither of
us know a whole lot about this directly
anyway but it's our it is our one
wearable peg this is the wearable take
yeah so the big win here
the mothers tell me is that is very
quiet it doesn't have that loud motor
going and notice what you see right
there on the right that is an integral
reservoir for the breast milk so you
don't have this separate reservoir with
a tube going on and all this stuff you
have to do and it's worn underneath a
nursing bra so people might not even
know that a new mother is wearing this
thing and as I was walking around they
have some of those some of those
lactation chambers here we can go and
get some privacy and do though and do
the breast milk and I thought this no
one's ever gonna know that you're even
doing this process if this product takes
off and does well and it's able and it's
able to sense and and when you need to
pop and and I think what's really
interesting is wearables returned about
with that need to push and work health
directions medical dry
that's the wearables and find other use
cases beyond your SmartWatch banter
fitness tracker which we don't have in
our lineup because it's been a really
quiet year tonight
well not a year for that but a week for
that yeah it was kind of the spring I'm
told 429 dollars to be the MSRP on that
one
one of the most lovable products here we
don't often have lovable products at CES
this one was was a robot called curry
not the only robot part of a major trend
of humanoid esque robots now it doesn't
even have arms it doesn't talk it does
hear you though with excellent quality
it has very interesting personality
limited functionality even though it's
still coming out a year from now but
right now it's basically an audio-video
home patrol robot to run around and
recognize what's going on alert you to
it which is interesting as it doesn't
talk but it makes little bleeps and
bloops r2d2 esque that gives you a lot
of indications of what it's trying to
tell you it's kind of like when you
watch an old lassie episode and the dog
barks and somehow they know what the dog
means Oh lassie someone so is in the
well I'll follow you it's it looks like
those little patrol robots in the first
Star Wars movie ran around the Death
Star the little the little things that's
that's Skinner ground I'm not a Star
Wars encyclopedia guy you people know
the names are but it's like that it's um
it's suggesting how you could
communicate beyond voice and we're
talking about this before like I think
there are other payoffs there Alexa and
others are voice controlled but I think
you need more than that maybe yours are
developing ambient ways of recognition I
think so you could put in other
technology maybe it's not a head that
blinks or eyes that blink but ways that
could L incorporate that waking
headlights or who knows what that nigga
feel developing minor ways to talk to
you without literally talking to you if
you're like a pedestrian let's say the
car will signal to you and as we were
talking earlier sometimes that makes
more sense
to try to be literally human if that
goes bad it goes bad wrongly yes whereas
something like this it's a little more
nuanced and a little more pulled back
it's it's got its own domain so who says
it's doing it well or not it does as
opposed to I'll use not gonna diat when
you're talking right now you
yeah I'm losing the illusion right your
attention words you don't expect it to
respond to you and with your family all
does yeah interesting yeah we were
really blown it sounds probably
underwhelming unless you get up close to
and actually interact with it a little
bit so I won't blame you if you're
thinking while these guys are idiots if
you get a chance to check out curie i
think could be impressed part of a trend
here a little humanoid helper robots ok
that was uh that was a good run down i
think we had as good a meaty show we had
a big show not to interfere err we
didn't talk about that b know what that
is gonna come tons of stuff and how much
I was truly exciting here sorry those
people that shows up but they know this
stuff is coming later and it's all gonna
integrate so that to come soon this is
not I don't think this is the show for
that but it's a show for a lot of other
technologies at this point that will
begin to all dovetail together we turn
out to have a pretty good shopping bag
coming out of Las Vegas so there are our
top 10 products for CES 2017 thanks for
joining me and my personal physician dr.
Scott's done you'll never to listen to
that stupid line again ok him she's very
