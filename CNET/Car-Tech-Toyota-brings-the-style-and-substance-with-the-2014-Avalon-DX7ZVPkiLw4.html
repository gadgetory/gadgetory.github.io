it's the top of the line and it's
Toyota's largest sedan this side of the
Lexus divide now previously the big
Avalon tattoo a bit unfairly deal with
the reputation as an old people car but
let me tell you this 2014 model is
anything but your grandma should end
let's hop behind the wheel of this
limited model pretty close to the top of
the line and check attack here in the
capital we've got nice materials in this
Toyota Avalon that are not exactly Lexus
quality but you'd be splitting hair is
telling them between this and an
entry-level Lexus yes we've got nice
leather with real stitching we've got
wood sort of a brushed metal feeling and
some nice chrome trim you got a nice
variety of shapes and textures that
makes this dashboard a really
interesting thing to look at here in the
main touch area we've got capacitive
buttons not really a big fan of
capacitive buttons but these do have
these interesting little cutouts that
add some haptic feedback when you touch
them so that you're sure that you're
touching the right area there's also a
nice little beep on some of them to let
you know a little bit of extra
confirmation here in the center of the
dashboard we've got our LCD display and
that's where you're going to interact
with Toyota Entune system under the apps
tab we're gonna have access to things
like Bing search the ability to make a
reservation at a restaurant with open
table we've seen all this before in
previous Toyota vehicles we've also got
a full range of audio sources including
USB and iPod connectivity Bluetooth
variety of streaming in hands-free
calling and satellite radio we've also
got navigation in this version of it and
by popping under the mat menu we see
that we've got a nice two-dimensional
map it's not a three-dimensional map
you're not gonna get any building or
terrain data like you would in an Audi
or BMW but it's fast and it gets the job
done
now on the limited version down here
you're gonna get another color LCD
that's going to control and correspond
with your climate control systems and le
and xle models you're just gonna get a
monochrome display here and one more
cool feature in this version is the
optional wireless charging station
keye wireless station down here and
that's actually going to work with
dozens of key wireless Android and
Windows phones basically what happens is
when you have a compatible phone you put
it on the pad right here you get that
little light and your phone starts
charging that's really cool if you're an
iPhone user you can buy a case that's
gonna add compatibility to that but
generally speaking you're looking for
only about a dozen phones on the market
that support that but we're gonna start
seeing more and more in the future
unless you're getting the hybrid version
of the avilon there is only one engine
option available that's Toyota's 2 gr
3.5 liter v6 engine that's gonna give
you about 268 horsepower 248 pound-feet
of torque and I've prepared two there
six-speed automatic transmission there
are no surprises here this is a
workhorse engine that Toyota puts under
the hood of pretty much everything that
they make but that doesn't mean that the
performance isn't pretty good this
vehicles actually does a very good job
maybe it's the tuning of the
transmission maybe it's the flatness of
the torque curve but it does give you a
really good acceleration and fuel
economy is not bad either 21 City 31
highway 25 combined frankly I've driven
this and I've driven the Lexus ES and I
really have to wonder why would you even
upgrade to the Lexus yes I mean there
are a couple of creature comforts that
you can't get in this car but pretty
much everything that you need to be
comfortable and to enjoy this vehicle on
a day to day basis is right here at the
Toyota level one thing that really
surprised me about this grandma sedan is
that JBL synthesis audio system it is
surprisingly bass heavy like tuned for
rap music shake the windows bass heavy I
didn't really expect to see that in the
Avalon but it is really good to hear it
the 6-speed automatic transmission is
actually pretty good as automatics go
you do have a sport program for that and
a manual shift program and you can use
your paddle shifters to manually select
your gears you'll probably never do that
unless you just need a little bit more
oomph for a pass what you better off
doing is accessing one of the three
different drive modes
down here on the center console we've
got the normal drive mode which is the
default tune the Avalon is pretty
responsive in that mode the Eco mode
actually adjust the throttle response
the transmission program and even the
climate control system to make the
entire vehicle just a little bit more
efficient you lose a little bit of
responsiveness in doing so now the
Avalon does have a sport mode it's gonna
sharpen up the throttle response make
the engine feel a little bit more
responsive the transmission a little bit
more willing to downshift and to stay in
lower gears when you're driving but this
isn't a sports car you don't want to go
whipping around corners really quickly
in this car because your phone's gonna
slide off of the wireless charger and
the suspense is not really set up for
that it can take a corner but it doesn't
really seem like it wants to again
comfort is the name of the game here now
this 2014 Toyota Avalon limited
pretty close to the top of the line as I
fix so it's gonna start at 39 650 pretty
close to $40,000 we've also got
seventeen hundred and fifty dollars in
our technology package it's gonna add
our lane guidance and our radar based
cruise control we've also got two
hundred bucks for that key wireless
charger that I thought was very cool but
maybe it's not gonna work with your
phone add in destination charges and a
couple more eyes and then that brings
you to our F if the price of forty two
thousand six hundred and thirty five
bucks now for that price you're pretty
much getting almost Alexis and if the
lexus ES is a budget alternative to the
German competitors this right here is a
steel</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
