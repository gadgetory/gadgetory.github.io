its rumored iphone 7 on sep tember 7 so
what can we expect from its newest
flagship I'm Annessa hand Rihanna
filling in for is with the top 5 iphone
7 rumors most likely to come true the
home button may be getting a makeover a
report from Bloomberg and August
suggests the iphone 7 will debut a
pressure-sensitive home button that
vibrates on contact similar to the four
such technology found on the new macbook
trackpads now this doesn't mean much in
terms of design but it may mean less
clicking and more functions we say this
before every new iphone launch but this
could finally be the year Apple gets rid
of the 16 gigabyte model according to a
report in the Wall Street Journal the
base model for the iphone 7 would start
out with 32 gigabytes of storage with a
256 gigabyte option on the plus model
now with 4k video recording and no
prospect of an SD card slot this may
seem like the bare minimum for Apple but
at least it's a step in the right
direction a better camera is basically a
given in the next iPhone but by the
looks of this year's invite photography
is going to take center stage the
smaller model may finally get optical
image stabilization for better low-light
shots while the plus model is said to
have a dual camera setup that will allow
you to manipulate the depth of field for
a DSLR like effect if the leaks are true
the iphone 7 will come in two sizes one
with a 4.7 inch screen and a plus model
with a 5.5 inch screen both enclosed in
an aluminum body with curved edges and a
metallic Apple logo on the back sound
familiar say for a few subtle changes
and perhaps a new space black paint job
the new iPhone will look strikingly
similar to the old one breaking with the
redesigned tradition that we've come to
expect with every number change and the
most likely rumor of the bunch the
missing headphone jack there have been
multiple sources stating that the 3.5
millimeter port will be replaced with an
extra speaker that means you'll be
plugging those earbuds into the
Lightning port or springing for
bluetooth earphones if you're planning
on charging while you listen Apple
wouldn't be the first to make the change
Motorola's Moto Z phones both use the
USBC port for plugging in headphones
and even though my money's on these
rumors coming true take them with a
grain of salt because until September 7
they're all still here say after all</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
