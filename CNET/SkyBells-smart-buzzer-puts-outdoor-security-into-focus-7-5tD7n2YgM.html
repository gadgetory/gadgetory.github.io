appliances here on a front porch on a
chilly January morning with the skybell
Wi-Fi video doorbell
now we've reviewed a couple of smart
doorbells in the past and had some
middling results that isn't to say that
Sky Bell is perfect but it's definitely
a step past the other ones we've seen so
far so this camera doesn't have an HD
video quality so you're gonna get a
grainy r video feed but it won't have a
lot of that streaky unpleasantness that
doorbot and ring had that made it
difficult to see who was at your front
door to begin with you also won't have
as many bandwidth concerns if you don't
have a super super fast Wi-Fi connection
so here's the gist when someone rings
the doorbell or if someone's just stands
in front of the motion sensor for up to
10 seconds you'll get a push alert that
will link to the video feed from there
you will have a two-way talk function
where you can hold down a button to talk
and then release to listen this part
actually didn't work that well it was
kind of like a poor phone connection
where you hear every few words that
aren't quite sure what they're saying I
experienced some other limitations
during the installation and setup
process so the other smart doorbells
I've reviewed have both battery-powered
and wired options so if you don't have a
wired doorbell you can still use it
this one is wired only which allows for
the live-streaming and some of the other
more advanced features but it means that
a lot of people will be left out of the
equation you won't be able to buy this
$199 doorbell and install it if you
don't have a wired setup
it also doesn't work with an intercom
system and if you have a digital
doorbell that's a computerized door
chime that comes from a speaker rather
than a traditional Bell you will have to
spend some extra bucks on sky bells
adapter which will take a little bit
more effort you'll have to go to the
source of your doorbell chime and
actually do some more installation work
to get everything up and running one
other thing to note is that if you had a
traditional doorbell installed before
this round shape might not fit in the
same space quite as well for example the
doorbell previously installed was right
here and it fit very seamlessly but you
will notice there's some overhang so
while I would say that Sky Bell is the
best DIY smart doorbell I've seen yet it
does have a few kinks that it needs to
work out so it's not perfect but it will
get the job done if you want to see who
is at your front door thanks for
watching this review of sky Bell be sure
