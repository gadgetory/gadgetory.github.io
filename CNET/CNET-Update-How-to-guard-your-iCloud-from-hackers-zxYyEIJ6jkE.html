you share to the cloud I'm Bridget Carey
and this is your CNET update many folks
are thinking twice about the security of
their cloud storage after several female
celebrities reportedly had their online
accounts hacked resulting in private
nude photos from their devices stolen
and posted online the hackers say they
grabbed the images from the celebrity's
iCloud photo backup accounts in light of
all this there are some things you
should keep in mind to keep your data
more secure from attacks some think the
hackers use software to crack an Apple
password by trying multiple combinations
of passwords over and over again without
getting locked out now Apple has patched
that possibility but if anyone ever does
get your password you could be extra
protected by using two-factor
verification on your accounts it means
that if you're logging in from a new
computer once you enter in the password
you have to enter in another passcode
that is sent to your phone or your
tablet just to double-check that it's
really you trying to log in you can turn
on this extra layer of security by going
to your my Apple ID security settings
many other networks and services offer
2-step verification including Gmail
Facebook Twitter and LinkedIn a second
thing to remember is that deleting a
photo from your phone doesn't mean
you're really deleting it on the iPhone
the iCloud service backs up all the
photos that you've taken in the past 30
days and saves a copy online those
photos automatically appear on your
other Apple devices like your iPad and
your Mac computer so if you delete a
photo from your phone there could still
be a copy floating around in the my
photo stream album that's saved to Apple
servers you can turn off the photo
stream in settings under iCloud and then
click on photos Google+ and Microsoft's
onedrive have a similar service that
automatically saves a copy of all the
photos you take and you may just want to
avoid taking photos of sensitive things
altogether because deleting a photo from
your phone doesn't really delete it even
if you do a factory reset before
reselling a phone it's possible to hook
up your Android phone to a computer to
recover old deleted file
sometimes the file has to be re-written
over to be truly erased from the memory
meanwhile in other tech news if you're
looking for a way to stream music across
multiple rooms in your home Sonos has a
new solution a software update allows
the Sonos speaker system to work
wirelessly with your home Wi-Fi network
before it required one device to be
hooked up to your home router but now it
can be completely wireless well except
for the power cable that's your tech
news update you can find more details at
