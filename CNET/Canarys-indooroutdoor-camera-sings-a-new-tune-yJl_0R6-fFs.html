probably because we reviewed the
startups inaugural product also called
canary a few years ago but now the team
is back with a whole new product also
for $199 called the canary flex it has a
116 degree field of view and has 720p it
has live-streaming and motion alerts
night vision all that good stuff but
it's also rated for indoor and outdoor
use so in addition to that it has a ton
of accessories that you can see right
here this is designed to go into the
grass in your front or back yard this
one provides a secure screw so that
people won't steal it if it's installed
outside this one is just a really fun
accessory for installation kind of
wherever there isn't access to a regular
power outlet and you just want to hang
it and this one I'm really excited about
is a 4G LTE mount it's a partnership
with Verizon that actually provides
cellular backup so if your Wi-Fi goes
out you still have this around so this
is definitely a flexible option for
indoor outdoor Wi-Fi cellular so many
different options and I'm really excited
to try out the canary flex</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
