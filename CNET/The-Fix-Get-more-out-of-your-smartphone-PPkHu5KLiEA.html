show about do-it-yourself tech and how
to's I'm Donald Bell i'm eric franklin
and in this show we're gonna give you
all kinds of advice for your smartphone
people love smartphone tips we're gonna
give them to you that's right everyone
has a personal digital assistant on
their phone yeah they're always worked
perfectly we're going to show them how
to make them work for you syrian can be
your best friend or your worst enemy
it's all about how you talk to her so
here are a few ways to make sure the
personal assistant works a lot smarter
for you for instance siri doesn't always
let you finish your sentence text my
best front just like that she totally
cut me off so there's an easy way to
make sure this never happens again when
you say your command tap and hold the
microphone and keep holding it until
you're done saying what you need to say
like this text my best friend i finally
figured out why the pizza didn't arrive
! wait a second she got everything I
wanted problem solved okay how do you
pronounce the name sometimes Siri can't
figure out how to pronounce a name or
recognize one that you're trying to call
so the next time that happens do this
that's not how you pronounce also
Bugatti okay how do you pronounce the
name
celso okay thank you which pronunciation
should i use so so that sounds right
select ok how do you pronounce the name
bull got to okay thank you which
pronunciation should i use pull a gun
mm-hmm o ngati that's right okay okay
I'll remember how to pronounce celso
Volga tea from now on perfect now we
won't have any other problems with that
name even though she has her quirks you
have to give her some credit SI r you
can actually understand commands that go
beyond the basic calls an appointment
setting let me show you one scheduled
dinner next wednesday at five-thirty
p.m. at boca nova with ellis and tom
okay i set up your events with Alice and
Tom 4 jun 25th 2014 shall I schedule it
yes I scheduled their event with Alice
and Tom 4 530 p.m. jun 26 2014 and since
i have allison in my contacts she'll
also receive an invitation for the event
if you need to launch an app or toggle a
setting using Siri can be a lot faster
than digging up an icon Siri can handle
both tasks so i can say something like
turn bluetooth on ok i turned our
clutter and she'll get it done for me I
can also do something like launch
Spotify and there's my app Siri is smart
but you can make her even smarter by
giving her constructive feedback so for
example give me directions to Barbra co
ok which matt go after what you want at
this point swipe down to reveal the
original command and use the tap to edit
function to correct her
hit done and your correction will be
sent to Siri for a new answer Plus
she'll understand you better in the
future getting directions to barback Oh
personal assistants like Siri aren't
perfect but with a little bit of work
you can make the relationship a lot more
beneficial for you okay I'll send it I'm
surprised Syria might actually be useful
for once yeah I've been mostly using
your for comic relief just asking you're
the most dumb question Lisa having fun
with it yes I'm having fun exactly it's
time for a quick break when we come back
we're going to show you some alternative
android software keyboards yeah just get
your typing skills super fast down
you
welcome back you know I'm not really the
best at typing on a smartphone screen
okay but it's probably cuz I'm not using
the right keyboard that's right a lot of
people don't know this but you can
replace the keyboard on your Android
smartphone to really trick it out yeah
I'm going to show you how to do that
right now if you're not a whiz at typing
on your smartphone I'm here to tell you
it's probably not your fault there are
dozens of factors that make typing on a
smartphone a total nightmare it could be
the size of the screen or the size of
your hands or the auto correct software
or the spacing between the keys
fortunately if you and your keyboard
software aren't getting along there are
some great options out there worth
trying i'm going to show you for
keyboard replacements for android that
with any luck we'll also come out to
iphone users this fall with iOS 8 let's
start with the google keyboard one that
you'll probably never see on apple's app
store now just because you're running
android doesn't mean you're actually
using google stock android keyboard in
many cases like on this HTC One m8 you
get the manufacturers spin on the
keyboard if you do nothing else look up
the google keyboard in the Play Store
and give it a shot it's a free download
and for a lot of people it's the
keyboard to end all keyboards aside from
having a nice spacing and a swipe to
type option for one finger typing there
are features here that Google is
uniquely great at one is text to speech
which google has been perfecting for
years the quick brown fox
the other is an intelligent predictive
text software that minds everything
google knows about you to predict your
next word it's the next best thing to a
full Google brain transplant and did I
mention it's free another great option
out there that's free is swiftkey this
one also does a great job of tailoring
its predictive text suggestions based on
the access you give it to your emails
and your text messages I don't know why
it creeps me out more than Google's
constant spying on me but at least the
process is entirely opt-in swiftkey does
a lot of what google keyboard does swipe
typing predictive text custom
dictionaries but what makes swiftkey
unique is that the keyboard itself can
be resized to match up nicely with those
sausages you call fingers just press and
hold the swiftkey icon and you get a
menu of all sorts of resizing options
next up we have swype which is well
worth the 399 price tag swipe was one of
the first companies to come up with a
whole one finger swiping texting method
and are arguably the best at it if you
really want to be speedy with one finger
typing this is the one and because
they're owned by nuance you also get the
whole dragon dictation software built in
which does a great job of letting
dictate your writing the quick brown fox
jumped over the lazy dog but if the
whole swipe typing thing just doesn't
feel natural give flexi a shot it's 399
but this is my choice if you want to
just get blazing fast at typing there's
no swype text no dictation just an
insanely smart and forgiving autocorrect
and the ability to move forward and
backward through your sentence by
flicking left and right you can mash on
this thing and a while drunken stupor
and still make sense when you go full
Jedi you can even make the keyboard
invisible and then just trust in the
force to make a coherent sentence so
there you have it four ways to take your
smartphone typing to the next level now
instead of hunting and pecking you'll be
swiping and dictating and mashing your
way to a better keyboard experience you
know it's kind of amazing that that
swiping thing actually works in Sicily
no it's a mind-blower if no one's seen
that before it's like magic oh it is but
we can really bring them to tears is
when they realize that they don't have a
lot of storage on their smartphone we're
gonna show you some ways that you can
expand your storage on your android
phone most android phones include
storage expansion via microSD card slots
but sometimes you need more than that
i'm going to show you three alternative
ways to increase your storage capacity
the first option is to use a micro USB
flash drive like this one you can get it
for about 40 bucks for 64 gigabytes once
you have a loaded with content download
a file manager like ES File Explorer
plug the drive into your device then an
ES file explorer and navigate to local
then USB 1002 which is usually the name
of the USB port on your device now you
can access all that extra content
another option is to use a Wi-Fi storage
device like the raft power here the
thought being is that you can wirelessly
access your content and you don't have
to be physically connected to your
smartphone in order to do so you can
find one for about 40 or 50 bucks first
insert an SD card that you've already
loaded up with content download the
custom app call Rev file hub once the
drive is turned on and the Wi-Fi light
is glowing go to your phone's Wi-Fi
settings and find the device
now open the app tap home and you should
see a folder with your content in it
open the content you can easily stream
it wirelessly to your phone or tablet
one extra bonus if you connect your
phone the drive will charge its battery
lastly the cheapest way to extend your
device's storage is use a cloud-based
service like google drive dropbox or box
box is probably my favorite because the
interface is so simple once it's set up
which really just entails a quick
download and thumbing through a few
screens it's incredibly easy to upload
and download files just tap the plus
button select file and hit upload
downloading is just as easy just select
the file tap more options select
download and then select the folder you
want to save it in and click OK those
are three ways to save files access
files and consume media when you've run
out of room on your Android device
