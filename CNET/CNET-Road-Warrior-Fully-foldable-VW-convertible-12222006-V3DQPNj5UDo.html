and welcome to Road Warrior where we
take a look at the hottest gadgets for
life on the go coming up to hot cell
phones and a high-tech convertible but
let's start off with a couple of high
megapixel cameras the canon powershot a
6 30 and a 640 the only major difference
between these two cameras is that the
powershot a 630 is 8 megapixels and the
a 640 is 10 megapixels basically just
depends if you want to spend a little
bit more on a little higher resolution
these cameras both have full PASM
shooting modes that's program mode
manual mode aperture priority and
shutter priority you can even purchase
additional accessory lenses for it
pretty nice for a point and shoot next
up a phone that's better than the
chocolate it's the flip phone version of
the chocolate the new LG VX 8600 on top
here is the 1.3 megapixel camera lens
and on the side here are a dedicated
camera button in a voice recorder button
this was a micro SD card slot on the
other side of the volume rocker in the
charger jack also on the front here you
can't really see it unless I activated
are the touch sensitive touch sensitive
glowing red music player controls it
also gives you access to verizon's V
CAST service as well as web email and
text messaging a motorola has given us
the razor the krzr the pebble and the
sliver so of course continuing in their
valid efficient ways we introduced the
riser know we might be wondering why
they call it the riser I didn't think
the krzr made any sense for that name
but it looks like the called the Reiser
because it just rises up like that it is
a slider phone when a motor was first
entry into that space slider phones are
very trendy right now as our thin phones
and Motorola does a good job of
combining the two really like the
overall design also comes with a thumb
grip right here it's see right there
which lets you grab it just like that
and like that so you don't have to go
all the way up with your finger to the
top of the phone ken also notes it has a
262,000 color display he says it's the
best-looking Motorola slim phone he's
seen and finally Brian Cooley shows off
the Volkswagen Eos and its unique
ability to transform first of all you
hit one button here in the console and
you open up what is one of the
widest glass sunroofs in the business
but that's just the beginning hit the
big button near it and we start to lower
the top full metal hardtop coupe or
sunroof coupe or as you're about to see
a full drop top convertible it's
entirely automatic one button does it
all the whole rear trunk section lifts
up and away the top drops down including
its integrated sunroof mechanism and it
seals away underneath hard surfaces
that's fully finished no nasty cloth
sticking up and when it's done it's one
of the most open little cars that is
also a full weather hardtop the EOS also
memorizes different heating and cooling
settings depending on whether the top is
up or down smart that's it for this
edition of road warrior I'm Tom Merritt
check back next time for more gadgets to
keep you armed and dangerously
productive</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
