of Apple music I'm Bridget Carey this is
your cnet update her musical majesty
Taylor Swift has shown great mercy to
Apple and will allow her album 1989 to
be streamed on the Apple music service
just when you think they were never
getting back together Swift tweeted the
good news to her legion of followers on
Thursday earlier this week miss Swift
caused quite a stir when she publicly
criticized Apple in a blog post saying
she would not put her album on the
upcoming streaming service because
apples policy was to not pay artists for
any song streamed during the 3-month
free trial period well hours later Apple
announced it would change its policy and
pay artists for every stream because
Apple knows you don't want bad blood
with Taylor Swift the coolest person
that everyone wishes was their best
friend well Swift is one of many artists
that complain streaming services do not
compensate artists fairly Apple music
launches next week on Tuesday it costs
ten dollars a month to let you listen to
any song you want on demand Swift has
not allowed competing services Spotify
or title to have her latest album she
tweeted that this isn't an exclusive
deal with Apple but rather she's going
with Apple because it just felt right in
the gut maybe it's like that feeling you
get when you have one of those activity
of probiotic yogurts now just before
Apple music launches Google is hoping to
take a bite out of their business by
adding a free radio service google play
music is similar to apple music and it
costs ten dollars a month but this free
version has ads and you cannot pick the
songs that play but you can't pick the
stations which are sorted by different
activities or moods it's just like
Songza because it was created by the
team at Songza if you didn't already get
the memo google bot Songza a year ago
also interesting news at Facebook you no
longer need to have a Facebook account
to use the facebook messenger chat
service the messenger app on iOS and
Android lets you sign up with just a
name phone number and photo it's
Facebook's way of trying to grow its
chat service to people who are reluctant
to join facebook and moving to Microsoft
you remember that iconic wind
is XP desktop background well Microsoft
has revealed the main wallpaper for
Windows 10 and there was a bit of a
process to create it artists were using
projectors laser smoke machines and
crystal dust to create what looks like a
portal to another world personally I
kind of like it has that quantum leap
accelerator vibe going for it after all
with windows 10 Microsoft is trying to
put right what once went wrong with
Windows 8 that's it for this tech news
roundup but there's always more at cnet
com from our studios in New York I'm
