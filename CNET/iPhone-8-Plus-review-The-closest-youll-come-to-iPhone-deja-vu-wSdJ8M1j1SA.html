the iPhone 10
welcome to the question that will linger
through the holidays now the iPhone 10
looks like the complete package
but we haven't reviewed it yet and we
don't know what it's like for a while
until then the 8 plus is the best phone
that Apple sells and it's definitely
better than the 7 plus but it's improved
in ways you're probably not going to
show off to your friends it has a nice
glossy glass back and it's wireless Qi
compatible and the processor is
definitely a nice upgrade but if you
want some of those fancier features you
might want to wait for the 10 this isn't
the sports car but it's definitely the
nice utility vehicle with a great engine
it's upgraded camera sensors take better
low-light photos and it shares a similar
a 11 processor to the iPhone 10 the
eight plus dual cameras are great
portrait mode is improved and allows
extra controls but there's also portrait
lighting a beta mode that adds simulated
3d lighting to photos sometimes the
effects are amazing other times feels
forced new compressed video formats
allow 4k video at 60 frames per second
and 1080p slo-mo at 240 but the iPhone
10 cameras could be even better the 8
plus is extremely speedy but it's 5.5
inch 1080p display is no different than
last year except for adding apples true
tone technology which adjusts color
temperature to match ambient light it
does make the display look better but
the iPhone 10 will get a 5.8 inch OLED
display that could be even better than
this Apple's newest iPhone trick is
augmented reality the ability to float
realistic 3d objects on top of the real
world now a Ark it requires an iPhone 6s
or later so that means that older
iPhones can use it but the new iPhone 8
processors and the iPhone tens should be
able to run them even better if you're
skeptical about the idea of face ID or
getting rid of the home button
completely on the iPhone 10 the iPhone 8
plus offers a great set of chips in a
very familiar body it's available now
and you don't have
- wait then again for an upcharge you
are going to get a larger screen better
telephoto camera better front-facing
camera in a smaller design on the 10 the
safe bet for someone who doesn't want
all that is the iPhone 8 plus maybe the
safest thing to do is wait
