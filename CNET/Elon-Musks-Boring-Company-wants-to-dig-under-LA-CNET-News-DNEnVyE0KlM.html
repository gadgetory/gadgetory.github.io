from soul destroying traffic and just
like a late 90s Jamiroquai song they're
gonna do it by sending you deeper
underground
Elon Musk and boring company Project
Lead Steve Davis announced their plans
in LA on Thursday night outlining a
future where tunnels crisscross the city
and passengers can zoom from downtown LA
to LAX in eight minutes twenty years ago
the idea of a billionaire tunnelling
under la would have been kinda weird
especially if he was selling
flamethrowers to fund it but the boring
company has been pouring onto LA for two
years now all in a bid to create a
personalized mass transit system musk
says his weird little Disney ride in the
middle of LA will be deep enough to
clear utilities like water pipes and
safe enough for the earthquake prone
city and because the tunnels can be
stacked hundreds deep he says they can
solve any level of traffic in the future
the company is starting with a 2.7 mile
test tunnel closed to the public that
will run parallel to LA's 405 freeway
which must described as the seventh
level of health the company already has
support of metro LA for the test tunnel
and musk wants to keep going to
eventually cover the whole greater LA
area to do that he needs to start
digging faster the company's machines
currently go ten times slower than a
snail but pretty soon you could be
paying $1 to speed across LA at 150
miles an hour sure it all sounds pretty
ambitious and there's no word on when
we'll actually get this lightning-fast
public transport network but once it's
built musk plans on hosting a party in
the tunnel the theme pre
post-apocalyptic naturally I'm Claire
Allie for CNN and for more boring
updates head to cn8 calm</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
