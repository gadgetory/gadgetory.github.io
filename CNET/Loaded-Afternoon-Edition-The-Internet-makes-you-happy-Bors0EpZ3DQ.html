del conte and it's time to get loaded
the American Heart Association has
decided to endorse Nintendo products as
health-related products this mostly just
means that you'll see the logo on the
wii but it's an interesting development
because it's the first time that a
National Health Organization has decided
to endorse a video game as something
that's good for you ultimate fighting
fans can now stream matches live on a
roku box the UFC channel now has its own
roku portal that will give you access to
live and older matches this will kick
off with a match between Quinton Rampage
Jackson and sugar Rashad Evans on may
29th and I have no idea who either of
those people are if you are the mayor of
your local starbucks on foursquare you
are now eligible for a discount it isn't
much the current discount is just one
dollar off a frappuccino of your choice
but it looks like the discounts will
change periodically still this is
significant because starbucks is like
Apple they almost never offer discounts
the European Union is expected to find
nine chip makers for price fixing
offenders include Samsung infineon
hitachi toshiba and others finds could
be decided by Wednesday the internet
makes you happy that was the conclusion
of a study by the UK Chartered Institute
of IT they studied 35,000 people and
found a link between internet usage and
the sense of well-being the link was
even higher among low-income communities
and women so surf away it's good for you
those are all your headlines for now we
will be back tomorrow morning with more
so stay tuned I'm Natali del Conte the
cnet TV and you've just been loaded
