next to me is the Roku TV this
television is basically a Roku platform
built into the TV it's kind of a
competitor because existing Smart TVs
from Samsung LG and the like this
particular TV is manufactured by Chinese
maker TCL the Roku TV platform will also
come out on Hisense a little bit later
this year so those two makers are going
to debut the Roku TV platform we first
saw this at CES and we really think it's
very cool it actually just looks exactly
as cool as we saw at CES it's really
fast we played with it a little bit this
is a pre-production version but we
expect to get the normal production
version a little bit to review it moves
around really quickly like Roku but the
real benefit here is you get all of
those Roku apps 1700 apps in total right
now and growing everyday more apps than
pretty much any other platform another
great thing about this platform is you
can move around and arrange the icons
really easily you can set up the apps
that you like at the top and move the
other ones around that you don't like
toward the bottom of course you can
install and uninstall apps very easily
and it really is a very easy platform to
use unlike a lot of the Smart TV
platforms out there another big benefit
of the Roku platform is the search the
universal search that hits a lot of
different platforms you can actually
find out when you're searching on an app
whether you have Netflix for example and
not have to pay for the Netflix movie
that you're getting for free as a
Netflix subscriber so that
cross-platform search works extremely
well and again is a kind of real value
add with roku compared to a lot of their
platforms out there like chromecast
Apple TV Fire TV and of course the
myriad Smart TV platforms but really the
extra thing we got here is this TV has
Roku built right into the television
itself so one of the cool things you get
is instead of a normal TV menu fire up
you have to actually go to the Smart TV
section right here the Smart TV section
is part of the interface so you can see
along the top here you have all the
inputs cable TV Xbox antenna right along
the top and the cable box even shows a
live feed of what's coming into that
HDMI input of course you can move those
inputs around and adjust them and even
rename them so it's all sort of an
integrated experience and it kind of
works just as well as when people watch
TV now so right when you turn on the
television you get all these inputs all
of these apps immediately right on the
interface right there and it's a very
simple very straightforward arrangement
again in counterpoint to many of the
many of the more complex smart TV
interfaces of course it doesn't have a
lot of that Smart TV bells and whistles
we've seen on some of these other TVs
like motion control and built-in cameras
and a web browser that stuff that you'll
never use we really don't think that's a
big deal we think really what people are
going to be using this TV for Smart TV
for in general is streaming video and
audio and again some of these things you
can do with this include plex where you
can actually get audio and video
services from your home network so you
can stream those files pretty easily as
well if you have a plex server set up
again all the great capabilities of Roku
built into a TV itself this TV is coming
out in the very near future and we've
actually heard some extremely aggressive
price points so again they're going to
be competing right against those
wheelhouse TVs like the videos and
Samsung's of the world with their own
built-in Smart TV platforms with the
added advantage of Roku that's a quick
look at the Roku TV from TCL and Hisense
