Stephen Beecham I am antuan goodwin and
i am brian Tong welcome to buzz out loud
CNET's podcast of indeterminate length
today is episode 14 97 and we promised
and we delivered a very special guest
very special I'm telling you light rose
founder and CEO renting in the house for
us we're gonna ask him questions we're
gonna have you guys ask him all the
questions that you want as well we've
seen and talked about this exciting
launch and announcement lighters been
everywhere right Twitter what's your
life been like the past you know say 48
hours first of all thanks a lot for
having me on that last 48 hours has been
absolutely terrific we the response I
think of the world has just been
outrageously positive just a huge amount
of traffic through our website we had a
great launch party on Wednesday too we
had a Cirque du Soleil like character
either i messing around when you talk
about cirque du soleil you're not
messing around it was uh it was amazing
yeah so now can you tell some tell our
listeners and people have seen a little
bit about your background you went to
Stanford correct where you where he had
your dissertation and this is kind of
what sparked everything that's right
yeah I was a member for a long time I
came from Australia out to California
about myself when I for undergrad and
then stayed for grad school as well and
I was doing all this researching
computer graphics and just a very you
know visually driven person just love
pictures love photos taking lots of
pictures lots of photos with film
cameras and the digital cameras
immersing and how you make pictures you
know with the best computer affix and
we're doing all this research on this
thing called the light field and in
taking you know 5,000 you know digital
pictures every three months like well
clearly what I need to be doing is
studying cameras and how the application
of all the best computer graphics in the
world could make cameras better and
that's how my research was born well so
um were you would you describe yourself
as kind of a photo junkie beforehand oh
definitely I did a lot of rock climbing
all my best friends are firm you know
the rock climbing community like telling
us you got guns yeah
less these days a lot more rock climb on
the bass yeah a lot more cameras these
days and you know a lot of candid
portraits and if you're you know you
hanging off a rope and you're trying to
take pictures down you know down a steep
cliff you know focusing on the right
person at the right time when you're
trying not to you know swing around in
the wind is it's pretty difficult and
the good hiking and it was shooting with
these you know these kind of pictures
shooting kind of shoot lots of candid
portraits where I was like you know
cameras are still really complicated mr.
really hard to use when you're trying to
take a great picture and with all the
things that we knew about from Cuba
graphics because you know these days
when you go to the movies right I mean
so much of it is it's computer generated
and in a way that you just can't
distinguish in reality because we
understand how light works so well that
we can simulate it in a way that you
can't distinguish in reality and if you
think about applying all of that
knowledge all that technology to a
camera that's what you get with life
your photography now one of the great
things about this we showed off some of
these pictures and examples that are on
Lytro site it's lyt ro lytro calm you
can check out their picture gallery
where these pictures have been taken and
after the fact you can choose the focal
point that you want to focus on they'd
use examples like flowers for lovely
ladies faces and I click on each other
did you like that one which boy ya know
what if we can find you know what let's
say well if we can find that picture for
ladies will have a vote of which one we
each prefer you when with the cats cuz I
like the one with cat I'm not a fan of
cats LOL Cats man party but the event
the one that we talked about that we're
amazed about the most was the one
through the glass window that had the
human yes on the ground oh yeah you're
able to you know choose the point focus
between the little hole in that kind of
geometric square hey so um well yeah
there's a shot that you like the four
ladies that was taken by michael hsu he
was photographer of the year a few years
back and he shot early on with some
prototype my few cameras we had a couple
years ago actually so he's been a real
fam you know real friend to the company
and then the one that you talked about
with the you know the grimy window
that's taken by richard kochi Hernandez
yeah I love that picture and there's
almost two people of yeah there you go
there you go yeah I love that picture
because
I'm very passionate about taking
pictures that tell stories you know and
I think this picture here really shows
how Kochi is taking life you photography
not just the things you know instant
shutter you know taking picture with no
delay focusing out the fact that's great
for all of us but for people that really
want to push the photographic art
they're all these new opportunities to
take pictures that are inviting you to
explore they're inviting you to interact
in order to discover and that I called
it back in the research phase in my
dissertation too i called it the
sensation of discovery and I think that
sensation of discovery when you can't
quite see something that you want to see
and then you click and it comes into
clear focus is just a magical it's kind
of like kind of like childlike like
people here we were getting giddy about
it we're like a wire now one of the
questions that everyone has is at your
event you did have the cameras there now
they were according to sources wrapped
in a leopard shark type sock stuffed
animal and this is how we you know in
this day and age of leaks all over the
internet you've got to protect your
properties that's right the camera is
still very much under wraps the Sharks
were you know an idea from our director
of photography eric chang eric is you
know one of the premier underwater
photographers in the world he's taking
his amazing you know you ever seen any
of those pictures of a great white shark
jumping out of the water to catch a seal
he has a shot like that where the shark
is like fully in the air like you know
suspended in the air so naturally he has
a lot of sharks around his apartment
stuffed animals and at the last minute
they decided that would be the best best
way to mule the camera yeah now the
question is here we you know I didn't
get a chance to see how really you know
big or small these cameras are is the
technology here is the lytro is this
going a lot of people are asking us is
this going to be a consumer point and
shoot camera or more a DSLR camera like
what is what is the you know I guess the
optics and the technology what form
factor you guys look enough you have to
launch wit ya know your life fields are
applicable to anything with a lens in
front of a sensor the technology is
fundamental in that way and applies to
all you know camera optical systems what
we're really interested to do is to take
this technology out of the lab where it
used to be you know really about very
research oriented large you know large
computational photography systems and
bring it to the masses and we're not
going to do that half measure we're not
going to come up with something that you
know is still for industrial settings or
something that is priced out of the
consumer market this is going to be
consumer form factor consumer price
point for everybody excellent so what
price point are you looking at target in
friend it's going to be a competitively
priced consumer oh no that a buzzword
price right that's just you know the
case if it is we can get right now you
can knows the game can't blame me for
trying though no no that's fine i'll ask
you another question completely related
so are you guys looking to launch this
by the end of the year or in 2011 or
next year 2012 which is going to be in
2011 2011 yep excellent yeah it's a it's
a really exciting time to be this close
to being able to bring this thing out
you know that goes back to the mid 1990s
right i mean this technology from these
two professors Marco Voight Hanrahan
goes back to I think the paper came out
in 1996 and has been cited you know
thousands of times in the research
literature and to be able to go through
these progressions of understanding it
in big camera systems than small camera
systems and now I'm bringing out into
something where it can be for the whole
world is something that I'm super super
excited about yeah you guys talk about
small camera systems and we know how
mobile phones and cameras have exploded
right iphone 4 is one of the number one
photos types of photos from a device
uploaded to Flickr these days yep are
you guys I mean this is a very you know
down the road question but are you guys
looking to will your opt-in technology
fit into a mobile phone or is that
something that you would license down
the road like what are you thinking in
that direction it would definitely fit
it's fully compatible with you know cell
phones with large system small says
industrial all the rest of it
microscopes that technology for life you
microscopy has been put on by
professional avoid Stanford I
collaborate on that since graduating in
the cell phone space you know I think
the cell phones are so important to all
of us because they are they allow us to
be so ultra casual about taking a
picture so you can document everything
in your life right and I think that
really what we see in the market today
is just this exploding interest in more
and more picture taking and I think that
what underlies that is as
human beings we just have this you know
this core need to be able to tell other
people what we've been doing visually
you know if you go all the way back to
the cave paintings you know they
discovered this cave painting in France
nails like from the third 30,000 years
ago right now it's an amazing picture
you know like all these cattle like
jumping over a ravine or at least that's
what it looks like to me I haven't I
mean it's such an action picture and you
can just you know feel like someone that
was out there on a hunt was just really
compelled to want to lay it down for
posterity if you look in like you know
the 1830s the daguerreotype you know
those the first process it really
brought photography to the masses and it
was this you know silver silvered plate
they to put this these chemicals on it I
think it started with you know with
chloride and then went to bromides and
things like this it was really toxic and
in the very first week after de gar
brought this thing out you know portrait
houses sprang up all across Paris and
people would bring their families to try
to take pictures because they were never
able to take a picture of the family
before unless you're really rich and you
could get a painting done and and it was
really hard to take these pictures you
know you had to sit there for a couple
minutes so if you imagine trying to sit
there for a couple minutes to have your
picture taken you know what happens is
that if you try to look at the camera
your eyes are going to blur because you
can't keep your eyes still for that long
or you know your arms will just move is
just not possible so they would have to
close their eyes and they would have to
sit in a chair with an iron collar to
hold himself still enough for these
exposures to work and just just think
about the lengths that these people all
across Paris went to to capture those
pictures I think when you look at you
know digital pictures today you know
that that same energy is there for
people to just want to take pictures
with their smartphones but people just
have this craving for really great
pictures of the people that they love
right so that drives an enormous camera
market dedicated camera market it was
like 38 billion dollars last year in
sales projected to grow to 44 billion
dollars in 2015 and that's before the
innovations that lie field technology
and lecture wants to bring back to the
space so you know the history of
progression of photography something I'm
a very passionate about as well okay um
we definitely will ask you more
questions but we wanted to get questions
that our audiences as
I was asking of you so aunt wanna
there's years of a couple of them
rolling by the the one that I keep
seeing the most is how does the file
size or photo that's captured in this
format compared to something like JPEG
or raw as it yeah i'm in fowler it's not
gonna be an immense file they're going
to be comparable to the regular picture
files and it really comes down to
compression level so it might be a
slightly larger depending on where we
end up but it's not going to be like an
order of magnitude larger than other
pictures of did it will they be their
own kind of file right it inherently has
to be because this information that
we're collecting is is not a photograph
and so it collects all this extra
information and now that said once you
have a life filled engine that's our
software to form the pictures from that
life you well after that you know you
could save it as a JPEG ship it out of
course you lose the interactive
capability right so what we wanted to
make sure is that you know people don't
just have this really powerful
technology under the hood for the
photographer and then you ship them out
and your friends to a nice picture but
they don't even know when you buy a life
your camera it's something that you can
really take some exciting content with
and that is why we have launched the
company with these living pictures on
our website that is what people are
going to be able to share with their
friends and family and if you think
about it right when people are going to
website right now when you guys went you
don't have to install any software to
see it right no no the problem with
formats in the past you know whether
it's tiff or jpeg or raw was that the
modern software infrastructure of the
world with a software structure of the
world at that time hadn't grown enough
so that it wasn't a pain I mean you have
to download software make sure it's
compatible all this kind of things today
with modern web technologies we can
deliver something we're on mobile phones
you know on a web browser now on the
iPad people can see these living
pictures without installing anything and
that's the simplicity and unification of
the experience that we want to deliver
to our customers when the product comes
out now i'm on the demos on your web
page is it is it using html5 to read
these files depends on where you look at
it it's either flash or html5 so on a
browsers like html5 and i think sorry on
a mobile phone its html5 and on a browse
so for someone let's say let's say my
mom who in the future by his electro
camera will she will she need to use
some sort of light row software on her
own computer initially to interact with
the photos yeah initially
yeah that's you know that's probably
going to happen but when she shares with
you or with anyone else in the world
they don't need to install anything to
appreciate the living picture now how
does the duffel the chat room is asking
how does the time between shots differ
is it does it take longer to take these
sort of pictures yeah it's a good
question and you know we're not ready to
go into some of the specifics on the
product right now because a lot of those
things are still in development but if
we do like exclusives Ren right I'll see
you are they solicit exclusive right
here how much more do you want Brian not
ask any one person cannot be in two
places at the same time but keep on
eating a lot of the physics oh yeah yeah
inherently you know with light field
technology this is a single shot right
so it's not taking many pictures and
trying to stitch them together so
inherently light fields are the same
speed or potentially faster exposures
than for conventional cameras because we
can shoot in Les life so you know things
like that shot to shot speed and take
multiple pictures really just come down
to the electronic system is is
independent of life field technology
okay so um you know that we didn't see
too many I guess action shots like let's
say a runner someone throwing down a
slam dunk like we'll be able to handle
that okay definitely and I think there
are some one the west side this I think
a picture of a lot of pictures that are
still coming through and going out
because how the photographers are
working with I think this one of a chain
link fence with a some volleyball
players in the background I think you
know this volleyball players are about
to spike the ball so they're definitely
some action shots out there and yeah
it's to roll and in fact the best one
the one I like the most is there's a
baby shot on there this is this is a
friend of Eric's daughter yeah yeah
there's baby kai this is like the
happiest baby in the world a lot of
pictures of baby kai and the amazing
thing about this picture would you might
not be able to tell baby look closely
it's maybe caught on a swing at the park
and I don't know if you guys have ever
tried to take a picture of a baby on my
nieces and nephews oh yeah see it's a
great shot right because they love I
mean babies just love being on the swing
you know
but it's with a conventional camera I
mean you know you have to focus and
usually convention cameras have that
half press right so you know that that's
that's a by the way a really simple
thing where complication just write the
moving shot you think the picture just
means lots of people take it at the
wrong time or they don't know you need
to do that which is why its focus on the
wrong point and you have to have press
it and then you have to wait for the
baby to try to go through that point
it's basically impossible and that shot
you just click it and then because you
can focus after the fact that any depth
you can make a picture is perfectly in
focus that sounds very compelling right
there we just click it yeah but not in
fact i miss something which is not just
the right focus but also at the right
time right because when you click it it
takes instantly without any delay and
that i tell you is one of the hottest
features going to be the next question I
was asking what about the opposite end
of that people who enjoy things like
long long exposures will you still be
able to do that for definitely and you
know the thing about light feel
photography is I wrote about this in my
dissertation a little bit is you know
I'm very passionate about I was came
from film cameras travel on a slide film
but I love velvia was the kind of film
that I use it takes really saturated
colors outdoors and then with digital
cameras you know the same kind of craft
of composition of the picture and all
the kind of controls that you can have
to creatively as something I'm you know
just really passionate about and my
field photography feels so natural
because it very much is photography as
we've known it right and the focusing
that you see through these pictures feel
so natural because it is just the soft
the life fuel engine doing the physical
work of the lens that would normally
have been done a conventional camera you
turn the focus ring we just do that
physics now in software it's just an
accurate simulation of that the best way
that we can which is white looks a high
fidelity so all the things you know from
photography will continue to work except
now the thing that you get is a little
bit more life in the picture preserved
forever and that's a great point because
I think that's the one thing that
everyone was worried about the like
wolves is a proprietary camera how much
control to actually get but that's
really the after the fact you know being
able to manipulate in deland have you
know enjoy these photos right right
right definitely and you know that
there's
so many capabilities that come from
light fields and it's going to take time
for us and for the ecosystem to bring
all of those benefits to the consumer
over time this is going to take years
right but the amazing thing is that
right out the gate you get a living
picture that does things that you could
never do before and the file that it
came from the light fuel file contains
all of the richness of that data for
forever so we have had an example of a
flying bird it was a pigeon that I shot
in Japan like three years ago with an
early you killed a pigeon no no no
definitely not at all if you know where
I know I'm we're not into animal cruelty
at Lytro in any way no I mean the
amazing thing was that you know I had
this instant shutter so I could capture
the bird just at the right moment as it
was flying by and it used to be focusing
only but then when we developed our 3d
capabilities and built that out last
year the same light feel file from three
years ago I became 3d so now if you put
glasses on you can see a flying bird in
3d even without glasses we have this
immersive 3d that lets you change the
perspective in the picture ran you're
killing me right now I'm juice now I you
know I signed up you can go to the
website on light rail and there's an
email list right to sign up to get it
yeah how long is that list you won't
tell me I can't say but i'll just do it
we have been totally amazed at the level
of interest and are so grateful to
people for you know their support of the
company now we're gonna wrap things up
which is kind of a final question
obviously the camera industry is growing
exploding but it's really competitive
right so for you what do you think are
some of the challenges that you see that
you guys kind of have to address out of
the gates you know to get people to
really not only understand lytro but
jump on board with it yeah definitely
you know I think that what the company
needs to do is to keep our just a
product design philosophy our silicon
valley ethos you know really intact as
we go forward because when you look at a
lot of the cameras on the market today I
think a lot of them are still polishing
technology for technology's sake it's
sort of like you know the CPUs back the
CPU market you know back in the 90s
right it was just like megahertz from
stick I mean more megapixels is not
visible to any of us and we share
pictures and our orientation is to
really use the advanced technology we
have to make a simpler camera faster
more delightful or magical for people
and if we keep that end and product
experience intact as we go forward which
we have our I totally focused and
committed to I think the company will be
really success it's amazing a lots good
question from the chat room can you
apply these the light sensor to video as
well as that protect is that definitely
you saw the flying bird yeah so it's a
single shot in time now you do a video
rate a video is a really important for
thing for us that what that was that was
cool right was right that was yeah i'll
give it that that all i'll say i'll give
you guys one other you know final l
thought it holograms right back in the
research phase single shot of a life via
camera we we could create a full
parallax hologram in color a full color
that you can move around and see things
in in full full 3d yeah i'm a file is
collected with light field camera
provide that you know that opportunity
compatibility for the future awesome mom
Rendon thank you so much thanks Brian
yeah thank you so much for coming out um
please write my name on the top of the
list I signed up two days ago I really
appreciate it um but like sure you hear
that lightlife you got you got like you
guys on the altar on it anyways thank
you run for coming in their studio and I
will definitely keep our eyes on you
guys and we appreciate everything so
we're gonna go to an ad break everyone
and we'll be back with the stories of
the day but Ren thank you very much
that's right cause baby I'm the woman
clapping let's go okay thank you guys
all right right to be here we'll be back
in a moment guys
