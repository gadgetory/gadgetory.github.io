to Google ishes for all the Google
goodness that we can pack inside of a
show each week on this show Google goes
acquisition wild and Samsung likes your
eyes now let's get to it in Google is
keeping itself very busy first with
recent reports from variety and the Wall
Street Journal that YouTube is in early
talks to acquire twitch the live video
game streaming service for 1 billion
dollars now twitch is the most popular
destination for watching and
broadcasting video games I use it all
the time to watch fighting game
competitions and it's attractive for its
45 million monthly unique visitors that
are engaged spending hours and hours
watching tournaments YouTube has its own
live streaming service but it lags
significantly behind twitch it's an area
that really youtube doesn't have a major
focus on and it's fast growth including
the inclusion of the app on the sony ps4
and xbox one make it an attractive by so
we'll keep you posted if and when the
deal goes through now Google is also
picking up companies left and right and
they recently purchased the company
divided a start-up focusing on
enterprise for Android and it keeps
corporate information separate from
personal information on a device that
businesses don't own Android has trailed
Apple when it comes to acceptance in the
workplace across different Android
devices so this acquisition will help
develop and focus their efforts in house
and the boobs also acquired a quest
visual who's responsible for the world
lens app and will be joining google's
translate team the app is available on
both android and iOS and has the unique
ability to translate text in real life
scenarios using the smartphone camera
and displaying the text translated for
you now it's really cool stuff that's
right up Google's alley also let's check
out some Samsung news The Wall Street
Journal reports that the Korean giants
senior vice president confirmed that
biometric sensors for security features
like the recent fingerprint scanner in
the s5 will also be coming to sammys
less expensive devices he also hinted
that iris detection features could be
the next sensor technology that is in
and for their high-end devices but for
everyone that's used it they really need
to get that fingerprint scanner down and
working properly before they start
talking eyeballs and since we're talking
Samsung devices of what could be looming
in the rumor mills well photos of the
Samsung Galaxy s5 Prime with a 5.2 inch
qhd screen and a quad-core Snapdragon
805 processor leaked onto phone arena
here and it's also still keeping its
booty dimples and video footage of an
alleged pre-production model of the
rumored s5 Prime with an all metal
backing show off the phone here as well
but it still feels too soon for samsung
to be releasing this phone to the public
so we'll wait to see when that drops all
right guys let's take a breather and
check out some more info with seen its
own sue me Dawson seth rosenblatt got a
chance to check out the latest with
Google's self-driving cars it's an
amazing demonstration of technology
white SUVs winding through the streets
of Mountain View California yielding to
pedestrians and navigating intersections
sounds ordinary but these are Google's
self-driving cars Google self-driving
car is a car that's been outfitted with
the latest in lidar and other sensing
technologies to drive your car without a
human behind the wheel using that tech
the vehicle detects every car person an
object in the immediate area google has
been developing these autonomous
vehicles since 2009 and aims to make
them available by 2017 previously they'd
been really restricted to freeway test
conditions and now they are working in
an actual city which is a much more
complex driving situation in many ways
the cars handle the streets better than
humans by avoiding other cars blind
spots and shifting slightly in the lane
to make room for cyclists but the
software in these vehicles is far from
being ready to ship in a parking lot
there are no lane lines and many cars
are reversing it's a challenge that
engineers at Google haven't solved just
yet thanks for that first look guys in
is pretty amazing to see how that
project has evolved over time and the
goofs always drops a surprise on us once
in a while with their google doodles and
this week to celebrate the 40th
anniversary of the rubik's cube
Google delivered with a fully
interactive virtual Rubik's Cube now
this is pretty awesome stuff if you
missed it you can go to the link on the
bottom of the screen and I solved the
cube but I just didn't want to reveal to
you how I did it all right guys and gals
that's gonna do for this week email us
at Google licious at cnet com or tweet
me up brian Tong thanks so much for
watching and we'll see you guys next
time for some more of that Google Isha's
get alicious</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
