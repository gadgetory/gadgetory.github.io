on AT&amp;amp;T that the pining began when do we
get it on Verizon I'm Bryan Cooley with
a top five that won't even rehash the
reasons folks wanted it on any network
other than AT&amp;amp;T I mean that bitching is
part of the American technology fabric
at this point no this is top five
reasons that you should not buy the
Verizon iPhone 4 number five it doesn't
do voice and data at the same time
sad but true AT&amp;amp;T z' GSM technology has
it all over Verizon CDMA network in this
respect
AT&amp;amp;T iPhones can do data and voice at
once well that's if you can get a damn
signal at all said I wouldn't do that
anyway bear in mind the folks behind
CDMA technology promise a network
upgrade for Verizon and others to allow
dual mode operation sometime later this
year maybe it's still kind of iffy got
to be concerned about that number four
good luck overseas Verizon's CDMA
technology is a mixed bag for global use
you can roam mostly in Canada Mexico the
Caribbean Asia but not Europe Russia
Brazil and by the way that's roaming
with all those lovely fees that make
your eyes water there's no chip in a
CDMA phone so you can't just buy an el
cheapo sim when you land in country and
be up and running not a great travel
fund number three it's kind of a retool
the iPhone 4 on Verizon was a midseason
refresh with CDMA innards yes but not
designed from the ground up as far as we
know to be a CDMA phone I've just got
this nagging feeling there have to be
some shortcomings around that number two
it's not 4G and that is the biggest
thing going on in cell phone networks in
the next couple of years that you'll be
locked into a contract 4G networks and
there you'll be sitting on your 3G
iPhone 4 deciding between taking and
checking email watching all your fellow
Verizon customers with their hot seat
dual-core 8 megapixel HDMI in and out
Android 4G phone
thinking damn it Apple got me again
before we get to number one another
reason you've got to rethink the iPhone
on Verizon is that you just have to
plain rethink the iPhone check out the
list of non Apple smartphones we love on
Verizon now and pending you can find
them all on CNET cell phone section okay
the number one reason yet gotta think
twice about getting the Verizon iPhone 4
is will verizon be the next AT&amp;amp;T this is
the big question will Verizon's network
dragged to a crawl as a flood of AT&amp;amp;T
defectors and waiting for Verizon side
liners jump on board and hammer their
network AT&amp;amp;T 3G network is technically
faster maybe it just needs to lose a few
million customers to show it and
Verizon's going to offer tube clogging
unlimited data plans for their new
iphone customers till further notice
something AT&amp;amp;T put the brakes on some
time ago so there you might be on a
Verizon for what 2 years with your
single tasking not really global sure as
hell not 4g iphone with a potentially
bonking network the smart money says
give it about 6 months before you make
the jump our complete comparisons and
coverage of both flavors of iPhone are
always up to date over on CNET cell
phone section i'm brian coulis thanks
