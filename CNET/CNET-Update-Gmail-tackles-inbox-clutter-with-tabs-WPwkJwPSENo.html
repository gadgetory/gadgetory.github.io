I'm Bridget Carey and this is your cnet
updates google has redesigned gmail both
for the web as well as its android and
iOS gmail apps now there are new
categories and tabs to organize emails
the tabs are labeled primary which is
your main inbox social which are emails
about social media promotions those are
your daily deal emails and other
shopping offers and there's also a tab
for updates with things like bills and
receipts and if you drag and drop
messages into these tabs Google will
automatically learn how you want similar
messages to be filtered it's basically
more touch friendly for the increase of
tablets and touchscreen pcs the app
updates are available now and it's
rolling out over the web in a few weeks
but you can switch off the tabs if you
don't like them and that's not the only
google update the Google+ app on the
iphone now has the option to
automatically enhance the look of your
pictures and users can edit comments
Android got this update last week when
you log into different apps or websites
you often have the choice to log in with
Facebook or with Twitter now you can log
in with your Amazon account the first
sites to offer this or Zappos and route
which are both owned by amazon but
expect more outside websites and apps to
add Amazon as a sign-in option over time
Amazon's also expanding its video
offerings to compete with Netflix Amazon
announced it will produce five original
television shows for Prime instant video
subscribers there will be two comedies
alpha house and betas and three kids
shows it will begin to air by the end of
the year dish is hoping to make its
television service more alluring with a
new social twist those with the hopper
HD DVR can download a social app that
will show Twitter posts related to the
show you're watching as well as the
ability to post a facebook with a
conveniently pre-written status update
in case you couldn't just write one
yourself from your phone My dear
blackberry keyboard fanatics in just a
week on june fifth you can get your
fingers on the blackberry q10 at
t-mobile for a hundred dollars down
t-mobile's the first US carrier to
specify when this keyboard model would
be available it's been a test of
patience for blackberry
fans since the q10 was unveiled about
four months ago without a US launch date
the Q attends keys are about thirty
percent bigger than the blackberry bold
keys so that should make for more
comfortable typing for those who crave
physical buttons it's also coming soon
to ATT Sprint and Verizon is going to
sell a special white version you can
