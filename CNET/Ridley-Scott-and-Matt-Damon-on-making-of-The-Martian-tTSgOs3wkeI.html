mostly is fantasy what was really
attractive this is the total reality of
the situation I think a lot of people
including myself really responded to the
character in the book that and erode and
well i think the the the humor and the
and the way that I think us kind of mere
mortals are always captivated by the way
people can do this and seem to have some
preternatural calm when they're in these
incredibly high stress situations and
and and that was what was really
attractive about the character how he
kept his sense of humor and uh and and
then and keep this incredible logical
kind of practical solve one problem at a
time type of thinking and and and it's
what these real guys can actually do
it's amazing I'm sitting next to one of
them so um and Andy for you talked a
little bit about this before but you
know i'm so curious what the this
journey has been you know it has been
rather quick even just since the
original ebook was published that now
that this has already happen to what is
the journey been like for you oh it's
been this just ridiculous like
Cinderella Story I mean like you
fantasize about these kinds of things
when you're writing but you never really
think they'll come true it's kind of
like when you're a little kid playing
baseball you're right someday I'm going
to be a bottom of the ninth in the World
Series but it's like this actually
happened um and for dr. Greene and for
true I'm kind of curious you know how
you know sci-fi films like this you know
kind of I don't know a reflector work at
NASA and also you know the kind of bring
it to life in a way and what do you
think that that what do you think
audiences can kind of take from that as
well well you know science fiction is
extremely important in our culture it's
some ingrained in what we do but it
really projects a vision of the future
something that we aspire to what I
really enjoyed about the book in the
movie is how close to reality it can be
it's just around the corner for it how
eager and excited are you to inspire a
future generation of scientists but this
movie well it's funny you know Drew
Goddard who adapted the screenplay when
i SAT and talked with him it was the
first thing he said he said this is a
I want this to be a love letter to
science and and I thought and we had a
long conversation about that and how
that's a really wonderful thing to put
out into the world right now and and and
yeah I hope I you know I I don't have
you know any lofty expectations but I do
hope that some some kids see it and get
and and and geek out on the science and
enjoy it and and and and maybe maybe
it's one thing in many other things in
their life that might push him in that
direction in fact I was coming back from
the cafeteria when our public affairs
official came by running around looking
for me and he comes up to me he says up
can you take a call with Ridley Scott at
two o'clock this afternoon and I said
the Ridley Scott he said yeah I said
sure so I just cleared my calendar I
mean that's it's that easy tell that the
studio's take my call I think that's all
the time we have so thank you so much
