to see in the next Apple watch at number
five android supports got an Android
phone and you want an Apple watch you
can get them both but they're not gonna
work together I know this sounds insane
because Apple is such a closed universe
but Apple does have Apple music running
on Android so maybe this will happen
question mark at number four
waterproofing the current generation of
Apple watch is water resistant however
it's not officially waterproof it's
happening up the Apple watch by making
sure it could survive swimming or taking
a shower could be a great addition
number three a redesigned interface now
this one can be done with a software
update but the Apple watch's interfaces
very unlike other interfaces bubbles
everywhere that resizes you move your
finger why was a simple grid not simple
enough to understand at number two more
screen less bezel Apple did a pretty
good job in the design of the first
Apple watch
however this sure is a lot of bezel
around that tiny screen hopefully Apple
can figure out a way to get more screen
and remove some of that dead space I
asked you folks on Twitter what features
you wanted to see in the next Apple
watch here's what you had to say Richard
wants the watch to still work as a watch
even when it runs out of charge Randy
wants iPhone independence and
Christopher wants a lower price you hear
that Apple now on to number one better
battery life this is the most important
feature we want to see in the next Apple
watch what good is a SmartWatch if it's
not running right now
the Apple watch lasts a little bit more
than one day the less you have to charge
the device the more you'll actually use
it since it's on your wrist what an idea
for more top fives like this check out
