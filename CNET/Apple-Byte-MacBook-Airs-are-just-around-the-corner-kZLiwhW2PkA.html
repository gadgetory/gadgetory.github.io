welcome to the Apple buy for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
let's get to the show and we start
things off with product news from nine
to five Mac that claim the new MacBook
Airs will be coming in mid-july that's
only a couple weeks from now and you
would think we would get a specific date
when it's this close but we're expecting
Sandy Bridge finally making its way into
the ultra Slim's and no major design
change plus the laptops are expected to
come preloaded with Mac OS 10 lion and
you know they're coming soon
when Best Buy has made all four current
models not available for shipping you
know that's always a good way to tick
off the general public Apple Insider
also reports that the white
polycarbonate MacBook and resellers like
Amazon Mac connection and Jnr are
completely sold out one of Europe's
largest distributors who sold out as
well so we could see a revamp with the
new MacBook but as usual none of this
has been officially confirmed now
customer complaints and dissatisfaction
what we more accurately described as
rage with the latest release of Final
Cut Pro X prompted Apple to post a Final
Cut Pro FAQ that stands for frequently
asked questions FYI
now in the article Apple says some of
the missing features from Final Cut Pro
will return with future software updates
like support for more cameras multicam
editing XML export and others
now Final Cut Pro 7 projects are still
unable to be fully compatible with fcpx
and that update it's coming sometime
later this summer but don't worry if
you're still not happy Apple's Mac App
Store appears to be giving refunds to
Final Cut Pro X customers who are
unhappy breaking their all sales are
final policy now according to the next
web users are reporting their refunds on
Apple's support discussion threads the
community is really hammering Apple and
I'm sure we can expect more fireworks
between the two which is perfect timing
since you know July 4th is here
we sometimes get a little carried away
all right let's check out a couple
emails with the Apple binder nation's
thoughts on the potential new Apple
television we talked about last week
Steve's a no slav writes in with I think
that's Apple TV would be great to
purchase but for me it mostly depends on
what it has to offer I would say that if
Apple TV was more Apple compatible as in
where you are able to not just watch
music movies etc but to also transfer
them from your iPad iPhone and iPod to
see and watch the files on the TV then
it would be worth purchasing alright
thanks Steve but Tom proach Nikki
disagrees and says the Apple TV would be
the most overpriced TV with not too many
features just like all their Apple
products Tom I think you need a hug here
here I'll hug you right now
okay you alright
okay see now you should feel a little
better alright guys iPhone 5 rumors
continue to spring eternal the latest
news last week was that Apple was
releasing
not one but two iPhones one being the 4s
and one being the five sure dude you
might want to stop smoking that wacky
tabacky then we had other analysts or
guys who read all the same tech blogs
that we - that countered a claim saying
there will be no iPhone 5 until 2012
more claims say the current iPhone 3GS
will then end up being free with a
contract once the iPhone 5 comes to
market so we'll see how that all plays
out I'll write a few quick bytes the
Apple App Store hit a milestone with
over 100,000 iPad specific apps
congratulations to you even though
you're not a real person
and if you're looking for a video
conferencing with more than one person
gonna get face time for now fring has
added the capability with an update to
their app for the iPad 2 so what's
better than a 3-way 4-way
videoconferencing and a happy
Anniversary goes out to the iPhone June
29 March it's four year milestone and it
was a day that changed my life forever
when I started caring more about a metal
vibrating object that also serves as a
heater for those cold lonely nights now
before I get too depressed let's wrap
things up with our iPhone app
now I've been learning a lot from these
iPhone apps and this week's app is
called girlfriend did you guys know a
girl likes surprises I had no idea so
all you have to do is type a message in
the app it fades to black and then with
the slightest movement of your phone a
message with a reign of animated hearts
to save the day now here if you don't
believe me I'll show you what I'm
talking about look out boys boom goes
the dynamite aces on y'all no damn money
