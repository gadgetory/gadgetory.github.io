welcome to the apple pie for all the
good and bad inside the world of Apple
let's get to the show and we start
things off with product news from nine
to five Mac that claimed the new MacBook
Airs will be coming in mid-july that's
only a couple weeks from now and you
would think we would get a specific date
when it's this close but we're expecting
sandybridge finally making its way into
the ultra slim and no major design
change plus the laptops are expected to
come pre-loaded with mac OS 10 lion and
you know they're coming soon when best
buy has made all four current models not
available for shipping you know that's
always a good way to tick off the
general public AppleInsider also reports
that the white polycarbonate MacBook and
resellers like Amazon Mac connection and
jnr are completely sold out one of
Europe's largest distributors who sold
out as well so we could see a revamp
with the new macbook but as usual none
of this has been officially confirmed
now customer complaints and
dissatisfaction what we more accurately
described as rage with the latest
release of final cut pro x prompted
Apple to post a final cut pro fact that
stands for frequently asked questions
FYI now in the article apple says some
of the missing features from Final Cut
Pro will return with future software
updates like support for more cameras
multicam editing xml export and others
now final cut pro seven projects are
still unable to be fully compatible with
FCP x and that update it's coming
sometime later this summer but don't
worry if you're still not happy apple's
mac app store appears to be giving
refunds to Final Cut Pro X customers who
are unhappy breaking they're all sales
are final policy now according to the
next web users are reporting their
refunds on apple's support discussion
threads the community is really
hammering Apple and I'm sure we can
expect more fireworks between the two
which is perfect timing since you know
July 4th is here
we sometimes get a little carried away
all right let's check out a couple
emails with the Apple by donations
thoughts on the potential new apple
television we talked about last week
Steve's a no Slav rights in with I think
that's Apple TV would be great to
purchase but for me it mostly depends on
what it has to offer I would say that if
Apple TV was more Apple compatible as in
where you are able to not just watch
music movies etc but to also transfer
them from your iPad iPhone and iPod to
see and watch the files on the TV then
it would be worth purchasing all right
thanks Steve but Tom proach Nikki
disagrees and says the apple TV would be
the most overpriced TV with not too many
features just like all their Apple
products Tom I think you need a hug here
here a hug you right now
okay you all right okay see now you
should feel a little better all right
guys iphone 5 rumors continue to spring
eternal the latest news last week was
that apple is releasing not one but two
iphones one being the 4s and one being
the five sure dude you might want to
stop smoking that wacky tabacky then we
had other analysts or guys who read all
the same tech blogs that we do that
countered a claim saying there will be
no iphone 5 until 2012 more claims say
the current iphone 3gs will then end up
being free with a contract once the
iphone five comes to market so we'll see
how that all plays out I'll write a few
quick bites the Apple App Store hit a
milestone with over 100,000 iPad
specific apps congratulations to you
even though you're not a real person and
if you're looking for video conferencing
with more than one person we get face
time for now fring has added the
capability with an update to their app
for the iPad 2 so what's better than a
three way for way video conferencing and
a happy anniversary goes out to the
iphone jun 29 marks its four-year
milestone and it was a day that changed
my life forever when i started caring
more about a metal vibrating object that
also serves as a heater for those cold
lonely nights now before i get too
depressed let's wrap things up with our
iphone app
now I've been learning a lot from these
iphone apps and this week's app is
called girlfriend did you guys know a
girl likes surprises I had no idea so
all you have to do is type a message in
the app it fades to black and then with
the slightest movement of your phone a
message with a rain of animated hearts
