which is available on a number of phones
and it's coming to more phones like
Samsung Galaxy s8 you might not know
about tango which is Google's augmented
reality platform and that has some new
features that are here at Google's
developer conference so this is our
constructor application you can see we
can make a new span so this is actually
showing the depth information the point
cloud if we click the record button we
can actually start scanning the
environment so you can see that it's
making a 3d model of the room as he
moves it around and then if we stop we
can run an optimization as well that'll
make it a little bit better so now you
can you can kind of see especially if
you look at the picture on the wall and
kind of zoom in there we got half a
person in there yeah this is a model
that that we created earlier of a house
so we can use this to do things like
compositing of virtual objects into real
physical scenes and also proper
occlusion and we can make virtual
characters run around your environment
because we know what's the geometry of
that environment looks like and this one
is all about kind of having fun by
bringing characters into the real world
so a tie actually has this 3d scanner
and so they can scan people and other
objects and actually bring them into the
world so this is a guy dancing but I can
make him really small and I can move
them over there and you can see I could
take video with
or put myself in it so here I've got my
sims landscape and you can see I can you
know zoom in on the pool and zoom in on
this seal here but then I can also go
into a first-person view and we can
actually start walking through space and
as we get to door it opens and now we're
just kind of walking through this
virtual house and eventually tango and
Adrian BR are going to fuse you might
start seeing stuff that feels like a
combination of AR and VR down the road
we'll have to see</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
