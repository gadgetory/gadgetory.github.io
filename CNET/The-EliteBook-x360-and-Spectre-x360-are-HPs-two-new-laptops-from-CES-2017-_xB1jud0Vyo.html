360-degree screen and you've never lived
okaythat's admittedly going a little far
but the point is that this handy design
with its thick hinges four
configurations and touch screen makes
for some pretty flexible computing added
to hp's wide upper - new 360-degree
convertible laptops the 15-inch Spectre
x-360 and the EliteBook X 360 the latter
of which are more likely to have as a
work computer The Spectre is a little
thinner and lighter than past models
just shy of four and a half pounds it
has that nice wide trackpad we've come
to expect from HP lots of ports
including one with Thunderbolt support
and windows hello to unlock the laptop
with your eyes there's also up to one
terabyte of storage on the Spector's SSD
and up to 15 hours of battery life now
the more business-focused EliteBook
shows a lot of the same surface features
but it also has a fingerprint scanner
for extra security an HDMI port and
tools to make conference calls and phone
calls simpler the elite bug is a USBC
laptop that has a 13.3 inch display and
comes bundled with HP's active pen for
countries like the US look for the new
Spectre to go on sale February 26th and
the elite bug X 360 to ship at the end
of January</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
