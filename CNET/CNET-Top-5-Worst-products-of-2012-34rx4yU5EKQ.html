a surprisingly boring job there's a lot
of mediocre stuff out there there's only
so many ways to describe a boring yet
functional product but every once in a
while we get products that are truly
awful now those are fun reviews too
right usually our products are going to
fall apart in your hand most of them are
good idea is that must have sounded
great on paper but they just fell flat
in the real world so here are my picks
for the worst of the worst some have
seen its lowest rated products from 2012
starting off at number five with a two
and a half star review these zip buds
juiced headphones this is the perfect
example of what I'm talking about the
idea sounds great earbuds that zip up to
prevent cords from tangling together but
even at twenty dollars these are some
disappointing headphones let's not
forget the name it sounds like an
embarrassing trip to the emergency room
at number four with two and a half stars
the Drobo mini now Thunderbolt storage
is an overpriced category to begin with
but it takes some real cojones to ask
$650 for this one you have to supply
your own high speed two and a half inch
hard drives and even if you max it out
you'll be lucky to get four terabytes of
total storage and on top of that it's
slow you know if you need a relatively
compact Thunderbolt raid drive that
lights up like Tron and sounds like it's
trying to levitate off your desk Drobo
has you covered a 50-inch TV comes in at
number three with a two star rating it's
the Panasonic TCL for 7dt 50 now don't
feel too bad for Panasonic they are
dominating seen its list of the best
five TVs with three killer plasmas but
this isn't one of them this is their
50-inch LED LCD and I think they made it
just to make the rest of their TVs look
better by comparison there's also some
poetry to the fact that Panasonic makes
both the highest rated and the lowest
rated TV on CNET coming in at number two
the elgato ITV mobile with a 2 star
review ever want to watch over-the-air
TV on your iPad me neither
but if I did I would expect more than a
handful of channels and I would laugh at
you
said I'd have to pay $100 for the
privilege of watching free TV folks
little Gatto didn't see it that way we
also didn't see that whole lightning
port change coming from a mile away so
you can't use this on Apple's new
products without buying a 30 pin adapter
and cementing your status as a total
chump and finally coming in at number
one and barring a one-star rating
the duo games do open ball this is a $60
accessory that gives pinball fans back
the physical buttons that are so
glaringly absent from the Apple iPad
sure there's a couple problems here I
mean aside from the fact that you're
paying $60 for a hollow wedge of cheap
plastic of all the pinball apps out
there for the iPad this piece of junk
just works with one of them and because
the buttons work over bluetooth the
actually responds slower than just
touching the screen so unless you're a
pinball wizard who needs the handicap to
keep things interesting you do not want
the duo pinball nor it's $40 brother the
duo gamer so there you go those are my
favorite picks from seeing us worst
weighted products of the year more top
