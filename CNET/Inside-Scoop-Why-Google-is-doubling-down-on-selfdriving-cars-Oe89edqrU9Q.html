Sumi das joining me is senior writer for
cnet news Seth Rosenblatt Seth thanks
for being with us I assuming okay so it
wasn't that long ago that we were
talking about our first test drives in
the Google self-driving cars yep those
were Alexis's yes now it seems that
google has doubled down on the
self-driving car technology they've
created their own car from scratch
they've built it from the ground up yes
tell us about it well they didn't just
double down they shrunk it by at least
half it's tiny tiny tiny little here it
looks a little bit like a like one of
the new Fiats but without the nose it
doesn't have a gas engine no internal
combustion engine it's got a motor
driven by an electric battery and
actually it has two motors one is a
backup in case the first one fails and
the thing that everybody keeps talking
about is the fact that there's no
steering wheel yes no steering wheel no
gas pedal no brakes you sit in you push
a button and you pray although you and I
felt pretty comfortable it was it was it
was amazingly safe okay so the cars that
we were in were these these Lexus SUVs
that had been hacked right had been
totally hacked they'd been adapted with
Google's self-driving technology but
they were standard lexuses they could go
as fast as the lexus SUV can normally go
with a human driver these cars are
something special they are limited to 25
miles per hour and because of the way
that technology works it needs that that
spire on top of the roof to see the
world around it the cars don't have as
many restrictions in terms of what it
can see the Lexus roof was quite large
and it created some blind spots for the
car google says that these cars that
they've designed don't have that issue
any other capabilities that these cars
that they've built have that the maybe
we're limiting factors in the lexuses
and Toyotas that they hacked sure so one
of the things that they've done with
these cars is again change their change
them so they can only go 25 miles per
hour they have the rated for crab
is in the front at 25 miles per hour 30
miles per hour and back to account for
whiplash um and they're they're really
just the kind of thing there's almost
like golf carts yeah they reminded me of
the gem you know those yeah the gems
yeah um I also read that they have
sensors that can see basically the
distance of two football fields in any
direction yes that's something that the
lexus isn't Toyota's I think that's new
I think the sensors that yeah the senses
they were able to put on the Lexuses and
Toyotas we're not quite as developed as
the ones that are involved in this car
Google had gotten quite far with this
technology using lexus and toyota cars
um why did they decide to do this I mean
it's a big effort to build a car from
scratch huge effort and they told us
that each one of these cars cost around
150,000 dollars which you know for you
and I is a lot of money but for Google
it's what they find in their couch when
they're you know after after watching
the game right so why did Google invest
in these custom and somewhat expensive
cars and I think the answer is that they
feel that self-driving technology isn't
just about the car being able to go
where it needs to go without a human
steering it it's also about changing
what the car can be the statistics are
on Google side here between the ages of
4 and 34 the number one cause of death
in the United States it our car crashes
forty percent of those are our
bicyclists and pedestrians which is
horrific google has something to the to
the argument where they say that you
know people who are too old to drive
safely people who have infirmities and
can't drive safely can't you know if
they're blind or they have other vision
impairments or they're on medication
that makes it very dangerous to operate
a vehicle this could be a huge huge
thing for them this could totally change
their lives and their mobility another
thing is a lot of people getting to
their public transportation can be a
huge deal because it's that first and
last mile and something like this could
solve that
google has talked about you know fleets
of self-driving cars and people being
able to get around it's not necessarily
something that you must have to get
around but I think it can solve a lot of
of mobility problems for people and
that's what makes this so exciting right
at the very least yet another indication
that it's not if self-driving cars
become a reality it's it's more when
absolutely okay Seth Rosenblatt thanks
for joining us thank you sue me for
inside scoop I'm city does thanks for
watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
