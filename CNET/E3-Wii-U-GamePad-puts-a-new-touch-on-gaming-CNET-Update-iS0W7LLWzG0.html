dodging flame attacks and looking for a
new direction from Apple I'm Bridget
Carey and this is your scene at update
the video game conference III rolls on
and Nintendo has showed off the new
gaming capabilities of the Wii U console
which will be coming out in time for the
holidays but no price announced yet
players will have to use the second
screen in the gamepad controller to
activate different game controls camera
views and perspectives in some games you
might hold it up to the screen to scan
for enemies but if you're playing
something like the Wii Fit you could
just record your workout on the gamepad
a new karaoke game will turn the screen
into a teleprompter with lyrics for the
singer the survival of this system
depends on how much other game makers
will invest in creating worthwhile
content for the second screen and how
heavy is this thing to hold up Sony made
its media presentation Monday night but
there wasn't much big news basically all
you need to know is that there's a new
game getting lots of buzz it's called
beyond two souls it stars actress Ellen
Page it's very lifelike it looks to be a
creative approach to game storytelling
but don't count on seeing that come out
for a while and if you like super smash
brothers well Sony just stole that whole
concept and made it the game PlayStation
all-stars battle royale where you can
fight with characters from different
video game titles like the twisted metal
clowns sweet tooth vs Parappa the rapper
you can use PlayStation Vita as an extra
controller to play against someone with
a ps3 sony we bringing more titles to
the Vita but it also is pushing this
thing called PlayStation mobile where
some mobile phones and tablets will be
able to access PlayStation Certified
games so basically it's like having a
PlayStation app store in your phone in
other tech news the complex flame virus
that attack computers in the Middle East
has been found to infect computers by
fooling the system that it is a real
Windows Update flame can steal data
listens in on conversations and take
screenshots Microsoft is aware and will
release a patch more reports are out
that Apple will be ditching google maps
in the next version of iOS Apple will be
launching its own version of a map
application and that leaves Google in a
rough spot I mean
just think about how every Apple device
uses a google map and every time you're
trying to find a place on the go or even
just look up a phone number to a
restaurant Google is holding a press
conference Wednesday to talk about some
new map features so they must be trying
something to answer this problem and not
be left in the dust Apple's new map
software will likely be released at the
Apple developers conference next week
and it's also expected that every Mac
computer will get an update so better
hold off on any computer purchases this
week that your tech news update for
