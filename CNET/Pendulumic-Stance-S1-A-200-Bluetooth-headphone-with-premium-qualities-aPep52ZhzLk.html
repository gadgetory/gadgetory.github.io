with a bluetooth headphone from a
company you probably never heard of and
the lumic this is the Stan's s1 plus
which is billed as an affordable
audiophile wireless headphone it is a
good value at $200 the headphone is
comfortable to wear seems well-built
with a sturdy metal headband and it has
some interesting extra features those
include a backup triple-a battery option
that kicks in if the built-in
rechargeable battery dies and an
analogue knob to adjust the volume that
knob also is used to pause playback and
advanced tracks forward and back as well
as answer and end calls yes there's a
built-in microphone you can also listen
to the headphone in Wired mode with or
without amplification and the headphone
is equipped with Bluetooth 4.0 and apdex
support for compatible devices apdex is
supposed to improve the sound quality of
Bluetooth trimming but it's unclear how
much of a difference it really makes the
headphone comes with a decent carrying
case and a little pouch to store the
included cable and charging cord battery
life is rated at an impressive 30 hours
and as I said you can do even better
with the backup battery if need be
since the headphone has a lot of buttons
on it it's a little confusing to figure
out what does what at first but you get
the hang of it after using the headphone
for a while I thought the sound quality
was very good for a bluetooth headphone
though I wouldn't call the overall sound
quality stellar like a lot of bluetooth
headphones it can't handle complicated
rock tracks well and it's a little loose
in the bass and audio files will find it
slightly lacking in clarity that said it
matches up well with a lot of other
wireless headphones in this price range
or higher just don't expect it to blow
them out of the water I'm David carnally
thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
