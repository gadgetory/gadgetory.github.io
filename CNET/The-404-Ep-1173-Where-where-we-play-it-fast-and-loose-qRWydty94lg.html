is the 404 show streaming live on seen
it on live stream I'm Jeff Bakalar I'm
Justin you I mariela nunez and this is
the show where we play it fast and loose
we're good we're going to take this one
fast and we're going to take it loose
which is in my opinion the best way to
approach any situation yeah play that
fast play it loose it's my favorite new
saying if you haven't been able to tell
hey Jeff there's no gas left in this car
hey man let's just play this one fast
and loose let's just see what happens
maybe we will get there maybe we won't
let's just play it fast and loose are we
playing this show fast and loose we
always play the show fast and loose it's
been our mantra since the dawn of 404
time forget high-tech lowbrow the
following it fast man that's maybe how
we're gonna end the show today fast and
loose grow so what's up what's up guys
hip hop a show where you had Sharon
Vaknin on house one man we got a lot of
emails the babe ohmmeter went from zero
to the table meter yeah Oh people like
with a sample really dug Sharon yeah but
we haven't had a female going on a while
can't blame them I had friends uh
personal friends who will remain
nameless Jeff bacala sue who texted me
after the show and they were like dude
you work with that girl and I'm like not
really i was like no she's from SF i see
her once or twice a year yeah and well
now you'll be under a lot more if you go
to target oh that's really i didn't know
that by the way before she actually said
it on the show yeah so apparently seen
that struck a deal with target stores
and the electronics section so now if
you go and look at products there will
be a cnet review well then the problem
that cnet reviews are really long so
it's just gonna be like a page of text
and like next to every single product I
don't think that's how it works no no I
think there's just like maybe the good
bad bottom line little blurb and then
maybe like stars
no I've never been to a target so I
don't know how they worry way yeah I've
never gone shut up now I've been but
it's going literally a decade right yeah
well there's no targets in New York yeah
there's one Brooklyn yeah that's
Brooklyn I don't live there okay there's
one in jersey city which is close to me
but I can't remember ever go into it
yeah but you should go and check out a
scene at review and decide whether or
not you should buy the one or two
products that they have for sale there
so yeah sure check it out I'm sure I
feel like this should be lining our
pockets or something that was probably a
huge deal yeah I'm sure just in terms of
the the financials right the legalities
of it all right probably a multi-million
dollar deal I think we signed a way that
right when we took this job like
anything we write for the site is game
for placement wherever is that mean our
face is gonna be on these placards to
you are asking someone who knows maybe
less than you do for the first time ever
okay I might know less about the target
deal than you do hmm ok so I don't know
it's probably similar to the best buy
thing you remember those who coolly was
all over best buy yeah easy would be
played on like Best Buy screen no I say
I see them before reel it in all right
I'll take your word for it yeah um can
anyone tell me whether or not the xbox
360 seen at TV app is live yet I don't
know apparently was supposed to go live
this week let us know if you're in the
chat room over here at home and you've
seen it on xbox live you should be able
to download the cnet TV app and
apparently you can also watch the 404
show live on your xbox 360 like you're
not using it for anything else like
black ops 2 right but when you're taking
a break you know when you've stopped
jonesing for your black ops fix why
don't you turn it on and watch the 404
shots a couple days yeah so so that's
the story man some reading a little bit
more about the scene at target
partnership not to go back to an old
topic but apparently they're choosing uh
the only the most popular products will
get the cnet reviews next to them which
actually includes gaming of course so
like the nintendo wii u when it goes to
stores it'll have your review next to
its been
sale for 10 days yeah like the ipad mini
suicide bit mom there none that you
fainted say like Jeff bachelor's face
with you you know you don't have you
review unfortunately my headphone and
printer reviews aren't included it'll be
digital cameras tablets computers uh and
cell phones gaming I didn't really the
gaming things really happening yeah
where you reading this you're there baby
uh reuters/reuters yeah the hell is that
we made it cool it's the big time really
should have my name not even my name
yeah I don't think so i think it just
says you know a guy cnet guy seen that
random white guy old Redbeard alright
fair enough all right um all right let's
uh let's let's see what else we got
going on in today's run down let's talk
about supercuts you guys watch supercuts
you talking about that the haircut
please yeah you guys go to supercuts i
used to it was a kid you're not talking
you don't mean i'm not talking about
that supercut now talk about the much
dirtier supercuts the videos that people
compile it's like uh cut scenes from
movies and that's where they're not
super cow it's the thing that only like
you're obsessed yeah exactly me and the
rest of the internet no you know what
I'm talking about right we've seen super
cuts and use them for bathroom break
videos right uh they're the videos that
compile scenes from other video formats
whether that's like TVs TV shows or
movies and I usually they have a central
theme around that's very very specific
like we saw one that was aaron sorkin
reusing lines from his movies and
television shows uh there was another
one that's like using imaging software
to enhance in movies and people thought
that was funny so one guy just put all
those scenes together sure um yeah so
slate was kind of wondering who who are
these guys that just have so much time
they can put together these giant super
cuts because sometimes they'll be like
five or ten minutes long of that'll
contain maybe like dozens of movies and
TV shows right um do you get do you have
like a favorite supercut I mean we've
shown so many no I like the ones um
there was one really funny one I think I
saw through you was like a bunch of
people just given
car keys to somebody you yeah you and I
had that idea yeah I actually thought I
was an existing no we did I just gave us
came up with okay that's our that's our
me to make that's ours um that there was
a really good one of uh bunch of war
movies were one of the characters says
we've got company answers like a bunch
of there was a good one obsolete kinda
went into how to make a super cut and uh
it whether people use software to find
all these movies or it's like crowd
submitted thing and uh they basically
traced the first super cut back to a guy
named christian marclay what do they do
that just research i don't know yeah
come up with this stuff but uh that they
attribute him to be the godfather the
super cut he came up with a video back
in 1995 this was before a video editing
software became really popular now it's
really easy to come up with one but he
made one called telephones and that was
a seven-minute video of movie footage of
people talking on telephones really
basic concept and uh since then it's
been more than a decade but uh yeah it's
it's gotten more specific in themes so
there's one that's really cool it's guy
named Chris Zabriskie who came up with
one of a lost super cut and they kind of
profile this guy and how he made a video
of this law supercut of characters
saying what weird rather than you think
that's bad dialogue bad writing but
what's a character saying what in lost
basically allowed the other character in
the conversation to recap plots plot
points in the story line then that would
basically help the viewer you know
remember what happened in the last
episode just buy that one word yeah just
buy that one word exactly and he came up
with a supercut of like a bunch of
character just going like what but why
why why do that why do that why have
these videos why this they seem
completely pointless yeah it's like
having a video for something that nobody
requested right yeah I don't understand
in like you know they're they're edited
well but it seems like they would have
taken dozens of hours to do right and
you and what and what's the end result
where's like the final you know do you
cash in with that well that okay so if i
don't know you guys have heard of a
cycle actory right I mean we featured on
this one on this may I yesterday times
so slack turi
compiled a bunch of supercuts they they
frequently post them on their blog and
they actually paid people to make
supercuts of ideas that they come up
with that's weird guess how much they
pay I mean this guy died David zabriskie
said that it took four hours for him to
come up with our the law supercut and he
had to go through every single uh script
for every lost episode online and he
just did a search for the word what and
you think that maybe like he would come
up with a soft wood like a piece of
software that would scan the algorithm
or something like that but no it just
takes a lot of work right and uh they
paid him a hundred and fifty bucks
that's it super come for four hours yeah
one yeah a hundred and fifty disguise
getting jack yeah yeah Wow poor bastard
but some people just do it for the likes
because they have nothing else to do and
they don't have any friends they want
those YouTube views yeah and uh yeah I
think I've talked to you by zip guys
about this before access main computer
file oh yeah I'm one of them uh the to
know the war the amount of work that
goes into a supercut right is much more
time intensive right than just grabbing
a screen yeah exactly so access main
computer file done that is a tumblr that
I started with a friend and uh basically
it's just a bunch of screenshots from
movies of graphic user interfaces so on
so you know if you go back to like the
eighties and nineties you'll see these
screens and movies like hackers and True
Lies a time there's like a technology
scene with the hacker right he always
has some like weird you I that they have
to make just for that movie yeah um
Sophia go to the site access main
computer file dot net and hover over the
screenshots it'll show you what movie it
came from but same thing this just
requires a lot of work like if we watch
a movie for example like we rent a movie
or seen on netflix and there's a scene
like this if to either pause it or on
the download the movie and then just
take a screenshot of that exact scene
but this takes a lot less work because
you're not putting it into a video so
it's not an actual video editing just
screenshots but still takes a lot of
work yeah sure and there's no reward I
mean no one paid us a hundred fifty
dollars to do this no wood and what are
you getting at zero and not just the
cool thing to have yeah just like a
website I'd like to see a video version
of this yeah it before
see them interacting because they always
say some weird things while they were
working on the computers us the enhanced
video is kind of like this other there's
a supercut video online of a guy's going
like enhance in there's our eyes yeah
there's a bunch of um there's a bunch of
like really weirdo especially from the
early nineties like movies like a racer
yeah yeah you know movies where we were
like on the cusp of of the internet
right breakout where everyone was
familiar with like you know computer uh
operating systems and whatnot and just
right before that though it got so weird
yeah you know now when you at least you
you see a show they they almost are
almost always exclusively using an Apple
products a glee right so those days are
gone yeah whether or not you like that
that's another story all right let's uh
let's move on to uh to trata Phi okay
try to phi is a fantastic idea simply
because i'm a gigantic monty python fan
all right and i look i know you love
riding bikes too so this is the perfect
story yeah why mr. bike rider so trata
phi is a project that's online right now
it's a crowd funded projects you can
contribute to this um it's kinda doubt
actually I mean even as a cyclist I
think this is kind of dumb uh so this is
based on the Holy grill and you know how
they use coconuts to mimic the sound of
the horses running trotting right wait
time I'd you've never seen that movie
yeah yeah there's no no way no energy
monty python movie i've seen have you
now yeah i haven't seen anything else
but money pot you really have been in
the Holy girl sharing that yeah I've
seen it a couple times actually name
another scene from it um let does that
scene where you like cuts off all of his
limbs and he like keeps like fighting
everybody seeing that easily might him I
don't know I got I've seen it what's the
deadliest i canna Lily hold a rabbit
okay yeah the rabbit comes down lights a
guy's neck blood goes everywhere I've
seen the movie I don't know I'm totally
skeptical Jeff right now I don't know
how I can prove this to you can't
question you can't you can't prove it
but anyway they don't ride horses right
and there's a running coconuts right and
they make and uh Terry Gilliam is making
that traffic noise with the tube carved
out coconut stick this thing is like a
modification kit for your bicycle yeah
that will recreate the same ridiculous
coconut trotting sound why is the only
reason why amen price was really 40
bucks has been lowered to 32 that is a
deal yes deal for piece of wood this is
basically a wood kit it comes just like
this we're looking at the website try to
find calm and uh it comes in one flat
slab and you actually have to pop the
wood pieces out put those together to
make a coconut with gears on it that
attaches to uh I believe it's your yet
attaches to the break bridge on your
bike and every time the tire passes by
it it triggers a pulley that then makes
the coconut bob up and down somebody
went to school got an engineering degree
yeah I was like oh man how can i benefit
society yeah i know i'm gonna make a
coconut sound effect machine basically
right it's like an advanced form of
putting a card a baseball card in your
spokes because they're yeah yeah yeah
yeah you know it's like yeah probably
this doesn't even come with a coconut
though you gotta buy your own coconut
email included what the coconuts just
don't grow on trees uh yeah it's
ridiculous but I mean as the more people
order uh it's actually not shipping
right now the more people that
pre-ordered the lower the price gets so
it started at forty dollars retail but
now they've had a hundred thirteen
orders so now prices down to 32 bucks
could get lower all right what would you
do if you saw someone riding by with
this on I'd left cuz it's funny here's
something Adam we put our head would
throw a bottle oh yeah and take his
coconut his head badge of you had a
coconut in your hand a guy riding by
with this a beautiful the only power
fist yeah that is so weird oh god I mean
I hate hitting on quote unquote hipsters
but I can only imagine how many people
in Williamsburg
I in this death it's just gonna sound
like a crazy like you know sort of
island party and if in Brooklyn wherever
you go is a be banging coconuts how much
time and money do they spend on doing
this I don't know I want no point their
friends your people may there's a scene
it logo on top of it yeah yeah your does
your people reviewed it yeah well it's
because of this uh blog that we put up
here a couple days ago I see it's your
people man these are not my peas are you
dude the the cyclist of industry that
scene is your people I think this ain't
some like weird coconut ice hockey thing
yeah is a weird-ass coconut bicycling
which falls onto your side of the fence
right I'll bring it up the next town
home is it you gotta get your crew
together assemble your crew properly
what happened to uh the these bunch of
my you students when they discovered
that they would have the power to email
40,000 people at once wow this is crazy
so they're calling this report reply all
pakka lips kinda hard to pronounce
anyway others I like to refer to as like
the day and why you broke this happened
yesterday uh NYU so they sent an email
to students a couple days ago uh telling
them to opt for paperless electronic
delivery of their year's tuition form so
you know you've gotten this before
probably from your gas and electric
company asking you to maybe offer an
email instead of a piece of snail mail
so this kid not really sure what to do
his name is Max he forwarded that email
to his mother but instead of forwarding
he accidentally hit reply all common
mistake I've done that before no big
deal but uh unfortunately that reply all
went to every single student at NYU that
received that original email and that's
thirty nine thousand nine hundred and
seventy nine students to be exact that
imagine you accidentally did that yeah
you accidentally emailed 40,000 people a
lot of people that is a lot of people
it's it feels like a small number on
paper that is an astronomical amount of
people right so what happened so he just
said do you want me to do this because
he thought he was heading into his mom
fortunately everybody got it so people
started replying all to that email too
and soon
everyone discovered that 40,000 people
were on this list Wow 24 hours later
people are pissed because they keep
getting all their inbox is flooded with
mail and there's nothing they can do
about nothing you can do about it and uh
well I guess you could um you could
maybe uh have set up like an account
because just looking at their system it
looks like it's based off Google right
so they could set up a filter that would
block out anything with that subject
line or you could unsubscribe to the
original email threat right um or you
can mute it in in gmail to which is a
feature that I didn't realize you could
do until recently yeah um but yeah so
people started responding with uh things
like porn disk images a point for some
reason people did like images of Nicolas
Cage and Ryan Gosling is really like the
collective unconscious of the internet
coming alive even the nyu alumni and one
of the hardest schools to get into in
the or not the hardest but expensive yet
and just a very School held in very high
regard yet made up of a bunch of cavemen
and recreated immediate isn't that said
yep NYU NYU's finest here's a photo of
Nick Cage yes I me blast that out to
40,000 people yeah does Oh some some
people were posting like random
questions like would you rather fight a
hundred duck-sized horses or one
horse-sized duck you know the
philosophical questions and people
respond to that and uh lot of random
stuff here but eventually the culprit
confessed on the nyu local newspaper so
now this guy's basically like a pariah
nyu community dude named David Vogel
saying of the NYU student resource
centers his job to send out these emails
asking people to opt into the digital
said he effed up he asked he yeah he
effed up so basically and why you used
to use something called list manager to
send out these emails right since then
they've upgraded to something a new
program called email direct and that
doesn't allow for reply all messages
that's why they switched over this fool
David he made a grave mistake in using
the older version which does allow you
to reply all that's where he messed up
uh so yeah he's basically an assistant
to the Bursar's Office I don't know
maybe he should resign resign do you
know of course
the advanced a resignation not know
money is lost yeah it's just a big joke
yeah and that's that although you know
anybody could have done this at any time
any good anyone could have blessed the
entire student body right right you just
know that that you know uh group list
yeah yeah yeah exactly um so yeah he
fixed the problem really quickly he just
deleted everyone from the list re added
them using the new system been done yeah
I think the main problem is a bunch of
these guys are going to get added on to
other people's email little spammed out
somehow it's not that fun try think if I
have any experiences in my life um ask
you has the same question if you know
you ever made a mistake with email reply
doll when you should have applied to one
yes what did you do one that stands out
more Google and will probably haunt me
for the rest of my life oh man um so
this goes back to 0 for when I graduated
and I got hired by by Warner Brothers to
go out and make a documentary for my for
a band okay I'm not going to get too
much into the specifics of it but we
were conversing via email and you know
this was like I was suppose I was like
22 I was right out of college I was
nervous as hell because I was getting
all this money to go on tour with a band
and just document their their tour and I
was you know I I did what Stacy to so
we're like super nervous and I basically
negotiated our contract by myself yeah
but some twenty-two-year-old you know
dickhead speaking with like a 50 year
old Warner Brothers lawyer okay right
that's cool it's cool but it was
terrifying at the same time so here I am
like negotiate like novel you know we're
guys I'm pulling everything directly out
of my liking like it's just it feels
weird I'm just like spittin sup in there
and they're buying they're like all this
guy sounds great you know they don't
never met me or anything like that and I
did a good job I'd like to think we did
a good job you could actually check out
the Blooey but anyway um we were we were
doing and we're going back and forth and
towards the end of the negotiating
process it got a little I got a little
frustrated and you know how I am I don't
really have a big temper but if
i'm not happy i'm not gonna internalize
that i'm gonna be vocal that I'm gonna
let you know how I feel so during the
time that we were doing this I was
seeking advice from a family friend
lawyer who was not at all in this type
of litigation he was he specialized in
like real estate or whatever was ok so
here I am like going back and forth and
I'm like forwarding emails from the
warner brothers head lawyer right to the
to my to my friend family friend lawyer
and towards the end I did the old reply
all thing and I accidentally wrote like
what does this asshole think he's going
to do for us like this or something like
that and it went to the Warner Brothers
guy and and the world like never had no
you did something terrible right away
and it's just too late yeah it's like
dropping your ring down the faucet yeah
we're gonna do it's gone forever there's
nothing you can do about it there's no
like let me intercept it before it gets
to the guys mailbox no those days are
gone so I just SAT there and I just
didn't know what to do I was like this
is over we're not gonna get to do that
the two or the money's gonna get caned
out but it wound up being okay I don't
know what happened like I remember I
just think like no I never heard from it
he didn't respond to my reply so he
definitely saw it and probably was just
like I'm just gonna let this one go it's
not time to deal with this crap yeah you
know like so many things have been set
in motion right to just pull out now
would be a disaster for all parties
involved so it was just one of those
things but man imagine doing like this
guy he probably was like doing
litigation for like Madonna all these
right and then here comes as you know
snooty little beauty little traffic
little you know what ya calling him an
asshole man a he never you never
acknowledged I didn't ever but but I
never spoke to never again you did you
like a haha JK or so there's no way you
can recover from that well I i we I i
was also dealing with other people
within the company with like a in our
people right and i never mentioned to
them they never mentioned it to me some
and I just kept talking to those people
and that was that right and everything
sort of went okay
they all got the email too or just in
just him just him and and and the lawyer
I was talking is that crazy that is
crazy socks man here I was like I'm I've
I was this close to cry yeah I was like
my lower lip was quivering I was like I
felt like my whole career I'm like I'll
never work in this town yeah yeah
blacklisted yeah so so that happened
which maybe explains a lot maybe there's
been like an unseen hand yeah making
sure I have a terrible life well yeah
when you send out so many emails in your
life and our it happens sometimes miss
you know this happened to us one time I
don't know if you remember but uh we I
got an email from a PR person a while
back arms the carpet thing huh where the
carpet thing will tell the carpet story
in a second okay okay yeah but yet this
is basically a PR person that emailed uh
me and we had been going back and forth
about getting a product acquired and I
won't say what the product is nobody
ever sees do not I was trying to get a
product sent to the office for review
and I like the communication was kind of
destroying it and we kind of went back
and forth for a week or so and then I
actually got an email from her boss
emailing her about our conversation and
I guess it was like an internal
conversation that she had accidentally
replied all too but that her boss was
berating her about her method of
communicating with me like oh you need
to like be more on top of this like I
don't know why this hasn't gotten taken
care of yet like it was I mean it didn't
have anything to do with me really I
shouldn't have even been on the email
but it was just weird to see her get
like blasted by yeah so that do you
remember that story like my GV old man
this poor girl you know like I'm going
to email me like look it's okay like I'm
not mad yeah I don't take it out on this
poor girl um that's isn't feel terrible
yeah I got another story yeah can I do
it is a carpet story now I'm gonna do
the carpet or two that's kinda unrelated
but you know I don't know I don't really
have having all right so this is this is
embarrassing but I'm gonna tell it
anyway when I was 16 I worked as a
counselor and a day camp and this
particular camp that's terrifying enough
for me is it so I was
hockey guy there ok catch was they
didn't have a hockey rink it wasn't
finished yet this camp which will also
remain nameless was like unfinished but
they open for business for their first
season anyway it was this camp was like
seventy percent finished alright so
their hockey rink was basically a slab
of concrete with no boards around it how
about you guys your play hockey with no
boards is not exactly hockey it's like
chase this ball even go gay right okay
um so basically what happened was the
summer ended and I was 16 I was naive I
didn't know anything you know and they
sent out an email to everyone asking
people back and they're like all you
guys all did a great job come back next
summer okay I wasn't on that list
because they didn't want me back because
I guess I did a crap job not teaching
kids how to play hockey with no board or
something yeah whatever was so I wrote
back so somebody forwarded me that email
and i replied all to all the other
counselors that got email to NS back so
i was like not alike join me in my
strike of like join me my revolution
against this stupid camp and their
stupid owners yeah i hate them they
didn't bite me back there all a holes
yeah every what did i do i replied all
he went to like all the owners like 16
I'm like freaking out because I just
emailed my first employer that I'm
calling them every name under the Sun
right that they didn't invite me back
and then asking every other person who
was really content with their job and
really wanted to come back next year
yeah to just not come back shit what is
her name yeah and no at least he got Jen
I got anybody oh I was so embarrassing
that's not you I come back to see if you
wanted I wasn't invited back it was half
my lifetime ago but uh man that sucks
the carpet story we never told anybody
about this but years and years have gone
by and I really really really want to
tell this story kind of unrelated to
email but still nevertheless a possible
404 getting in trouble with an
identity about two years ago I know
we're going totally off topic this is
fun storytelling time two years ago we
got a call from a guy who owned a
company that sold carpet whatever the
company was doesn't matter of the
company was right they said he said you
remember this now I don't remember this
he said he sold carpet and he said he
kept getting he's like he goes he goes
who is is like I want to speak to the
the the manager there more like well
this is the radio show uh we can talk I
can talk to you yes so we had our
members you me and Wilson here and we're
talking to this guy in there on the
phone it was right here and I had him on
speaker yeah and he said and he was
cursing right he was he was mad he said
what's going on over there he's like you
know he's like you know a goddamn calls
him getting forget it's saying your show
told them to call up my carpet company
yes yeah yeah yeah I see the car become
because I want this time so he's like
he's like oh no he's like I callbacks
one of the prankers any uh and I put his
mom on the phone yeah and his mom said
it was the 404 show so it looked you a
holes up on the internet found your
phone number now I'm calling you right
I'm like dude we have no idea what
you're talking about yeah like sounds
like you just got punked by a kid and he
just put the blame on us for no reason
in particular you know which is fine
anyone could blame us for stuff that's
fine I don't care so that and then we
went back and forth and then he called
back and said that he was gonna sue us
right do you call this bag he goes I
want to talk to your lawyer because I
guess he found out like we were owned by
CBS and and then the money signs are
already said right so he threatened to
sue us right that's when I was like all
right enough of this crap and I really
really you memorized the conversation I
have with this guy hey back the hell off
yeah I was pissed now man look you piece
of crap you've got nothing you got no
proof whatsoever you son of a bitch yeah
Wilson and I were dying weird that is
your life yeah that's the way i was
talking right but what happened was um I
think if you changed one number on our
phone number 86 explore 04 seen it right
now that wasn't it well because we
because we kept looking at the dial here
and we're like there's no way anybody
could have ever thought that
our two numbers were the same well then
why did it how did he get powerful must
have been like a I don't know if it was
like 40 it was like 40 for kids that
decided they're just gonna do this or if
it was just the one kid I was probably
that was probably the one kid that he
called up and when he got the kid
nervous and had his mom bet on the later
on landed on us yeah which bad is even
crazier cuz it's like this one you know
degenerate kid is like I'm gonna blame
the show I mean imagine if actually went
to litigation we went to court and then
finally found out this kitchens lied to
his moms no no this Gary go on a little
put this guy at a business right you
know I mean what with ABS forget are we
kidding I mean not to like just you know
if there's one thing they were psyched
about it that the lawyers are we got
back up really on our side you know
don't listen to the show be like you
know let's just cut our losses yeah yes
get rid of that yeah that's probably
what would happen but anyway crazy story
yet don't mess with us is the moral no
that's not this yet more right you see
ya I mean that's that's not the most
intimidating either but anyway it was it
was a funny story yeah yeah let's take a
break right okay little do little detox
when we come back we've got some
voicemails to play as well as maybe one
or two stories all this and much more on
the other side of the break stay tuned
you
welcome back to the 404 program I kind
of want that yeah I want that how long
man that is cool we've seen a lot of
things printed by 3d printers seen like
hermit crab shells prosthetic limbs NASA
parts are gonna send up to Mars with the
shuttle but this is by far the coolest
excited about sat it's totally said this
was basically a robot that has a Wi-Fi
camera built onto it it's a transformer
it goes from what looks to be I think a
Lamborghini into a full robot neca I
want it's really really cool so that's
why I camera on the front now they're
not selling it so basically this is like
a proof concept thing that they're
showing at maker faire at Tokyo that's a
five-thousand-dollar thing right there
yeah I mean it was all printed with 3d
parts so yeah the design is up here it's
made to order but I don't think they're
selling it yet um that's it's pretty
sick we'll link up to that in the show
notes today before we hit the couple of
boys smells we got gotta talk about this
story about a couple who wants to name
their child hashtag not once did did Amy
name their kid has named their kid
hashtag yeah so a couple with the Nate
with the last name Jameson named their
newborn daughter hashtag please welcome
hashtag Jamison hey you know honest
that's not that surprising yeah I don't
really have a problem slate com rights
in defense of why it's okay to name your
kid hashtag right and what were they
saying completely link bait here so the
story behind this is that daily dot
reported on it and it's pretty likely
that it's a fake story I mean anyone
could have tweeted this out and put
hashtag Jameson so it may or may not be
true we did hear a story last year I
think I'd of Egypt about man who named
his son Facebook and that was true so I
guess this could be but the bottom line
is that a slate posted an article that
is just refuting points that people
would say about why you can't name your
kid something like hashtag
so I he brings up like oh if you think
it's too unusual like well there's a lot
of reasons why people do things just
because their usual does mean you can't
uh short-sighted whatever it's just as
bad as getting uh like an obsolete echt
a two he basically says it's not really
that big of a deal I don't think it is
to name your kid hashtag and you agree
with it I do why because you have the
right to name your kid whatever you want
except if you're naming your kid like we
had we reported on a while ago which I
do consider to be child abuse if you
name your kid Adolf Hitler bakalar right
like come on yeah you can't do that
that's child abuse right that kid is
going to have a very uncomfortable child
right right right if you name your kid
something that is always associated with
hate for racism or bigotry right you
just can't do yeah yeah you can't name
your kids swastika Johnson you just
can't do it right yeah can name your
kids skinhead Joan right yeah I mean
it's not it's not abuse its not illegal
you can do whatever you want but I'm
making the case that doing that is abuse
yeah yeah because you are essentially
dealing your kid this predetermined hand
yeah that is going to get his ass kicked
yeah I think to a lesser extent hashtags
the same thing I mean it's always gonna
prompt conversation every time this kid
says his name someone's gonna ask him
the story behind it or make fun of him I
mean that asking in the story is the
best case what hashtags he could very
well get his ass beat he could but there
are plenty of worse names I mean looking
like some of these like football players
names yeah like what's that dude
D'Brickashaw Ferguson is that a name
isn't that his name I don't know brick a
shot ricochet brick a sha so like what's
it I mean come on that's fine because
there's as as wacky as it sound right I
hope I'm saying that right someone in
the chat room will tell me every be mrs.
like not like they name the kid
Nickelback yeah seriously you know you
do have you could like I said you can
and even if you want a name your kid
something racist you can do that you
have the right to do right but there's a
fine line between if whether or not
that's that's abuse yeah let me put
hashtag dude come on that kid might be
the coolest kid ever HD in in five years
when he's you know inducted in
to the school system might be the
greatest thing ever right hashtag might
become the new you know it's like name
you could yell oh right i mean i think i
think beyond all that like you just kind
of complicating his life yeah forms and
stuff like that you're not be rejected
all the time right but but psych for
makes our grade for you can point the
chat room think about the kids signature
man yeah it's the number sign yeah I'm
done get tagged it everywhere too yeah
that'd be cool mmhmm yeah Oh
D'Brickashaw Ferguson plays for the Jets
I should have known that and that's his
name D'Brickashaw yeah all right that's
okay anja birkenshaw meet hashtag
hashtag shake hands hahaha that's how it
goes i guess like okay we all have
friends with like funny names of strange
names I got a friend in high school
named Harry dog at another friend in
high school named uh Peter pain and Yuki
pain and you're worried about the
hashtag yeah and you have a girl named
Charlie Chan those the debt when / fine
the difference is that those parents had
no idea that these kids had funny names
it was an accident but this kid it's a
deliberate thing for his parents to be
like I want to make it out of your name
I don't know if anything's your game you
could hashtag is necessarily okay it's
not you know what I mean it's not like
you're naming it peckerhead yeah I mean
like a hashtag is benign hello
peckerhead peckerhead back a lot that's
a good middle name you know nintendo
nintendo pecker head back nintendo is is
pretty benevolent too yeah you know as
far as I'm concerned what do you think
well by hashtag hashtags okay yeah it's
it's cool I think New Year's what's up
yeah hey down your knowledge you go to
school yeah that's cool man don't thing
is you have to at one point become a
trending topic I'm right you have to or
else you don't live up to your name for
sure not only that like there's
shortened nicknames for hashtag com hash
and then he's just hash he's got a deal
with that Thank you're just gonna add
Nash work for Ashton or Ashley more like
a skag that's probably it that's
something to say yeah yeah you sayin
just sayin yeah game just say you
realize something I only together is
gonna in someone named their kid ESPN or
something like that probably come on
hashtag is the least of these
infractions right all right that's what
I think interesting that is what I think
okay what I'm gonna start calling you
hashtag you yeah oh there's my good
buddy hashtag thank you how goes it
hashtag yeah right yeah you're okay with
a real name all right before we get to
calls from the public I want to uh oops
I got all kinds of crap going on right
here right now before we get the calls
in public I want to tell everybody what
they can expect tomorrow on the program
tomorrow we're gonna have a guy named
Jeff Nimoy yeah who apparently is
somehow related to Leonard Nimoy yeah
distant cousin of list he's like a he's
like a cousin first removed or something
like that I don't know how it works but
he's going to be here talking about a
website that he's designing for people
who have like-minded appetites right the
dating site for people who eat the same
kind of interesting might as well do
that they've seemed to have done every
other thing right um so we're gonna get
to that same play.com right yeah he also
voiced a lot of the characters in a
couple Digimon movies yeah wow yeah
Jeffy I know you don't know what did you
mom I've just learned today yeah that is
but he did a bunch of fox kids shows one
of them was Digimon so maybe talk to him
about that too but yeah the bigger story
is about same plate com it's all very
new and exciting for me yeah so we're
pumped about that so tune in tomorrow
for that and then on Friday Steve the
gut man guttenberg spear himself comes
back on the show too to say goodbye for
the week and a week of celebrities on
the 405 right fun never star Karen so
you got a lot to look forward to if
you're a fan of the show and yeah so so
stay tuned for that and we're gonna get
two calls from the public right about
now time to show the love
for scenic uh Justin what's so freaking
funny nothing just thinking about did
you mud I don't know what is it uh it's
a TV show like part of it yeah except
their digital Digimon stands for digital
monsters oh yeah of course they look at
my notes here started taking notes on
paper yeah um hell is it oh here we go
so we got three calls today that will
get to and arielle you might know the
answer to this one I think we all can
sort of speak to this let's hit up the
first voicemail hey does Boston from
snide I only question I think aarielle
would probably know the best of this Oh
first of all don't ya don't be upset of
the way he says your name area dude
wicked aerial is how a dupe ah okay okay
Ari's excuse he's excuse it is not
calling you like a mermaid dang yo
wicked Arielle yeah he said you know
what I'm saying yeah girl get your happy
yeah I'm fine yes arias bitch when I was
young man yeah yeah broke his mouth
where each song blends into the next
track but when I rip them to my mp3
player or even my phone there's a brief
half second pause at the end of each
track I even tried ripping them to FLAC
and it got the same results also another
tangent I cut a little bit of
thanksgiving parade do you guys think
that the Egyptian sphinx was possibly
their Macy's parade do you think like BB
thousand years archaeologists and
historians will be talking about how we
would pray to Charlie Brown and Snoopy
each year in Dallas and in Detroit Opera
glorious from each side would be
shooting a pigskin object at each other
I like where he's going with that yes
crazies he's going down that like crazy
spiral down there uh okay first let's
that smoke would he smoke yeah let's get
on that yes that number one all right so
so you've you know this problem with non
tracks let's address that first yeah if
i understand them correctly he said when
he rips
like a mix a DD yeah to his to to itunes
yet he gets the the brakes yeah I think
that might be a playback issue in itunes
I think you're right I don't think
there's really a way to do it because
you know CDs when CDs would play they
would just go into one another you know
what I mean there was no gap between the
tracks mm-hmm there I guarantee there's
a way to do it with the right playback
thing yeah there's definitely maybe
there's a setting in itune there is a
setting there's a setting in itunes word
like what you like one minute or 1
second pause began song yeah whatever
that is a gap or some yeah exactly yeah
pause God well I think you can put that
down to zero yeah you could take it down
to zero if you do it at zero it might be
a seamless play from one track to the
now I don't know but I obviously know
what he's talking about remember how
like CDs used to have like negative time
yeah in tracks to like number like you
could I always remember though that less
than jake album losing streak if you
were around the first track into like
negative two minutes you would hear this
whole you know pre-law yeah you know
Tommy you know you know her that I think
so it's awesome yeah bone thugs and
harmony had something like that to the
they used to be all into the devil like
worshiping stuff free and they would
have like little subliminal messages
yeah really i thought bone thugs with
satanic yeah they were at first they
were his bone and biggie yeah yeah
anyway so that's that and then he's
talking about the whole parade thing do
you watch any of the parade uh yeah i
watched some of it you know a lot yeah
that was how i found out that elf was a
musical right write didn't realize that
sustained range tradition we Americans
do yeah i just from like you know
looking in on another country out of
looking from the outside in i could see
that being a little strange giant
balloons it is strange alright so thanks
for the call schnide you're a wicked
pissah hopefully the answers yes
hopefully that helps um here's some
Yuletide ideas from our buddy let's see
if we can pull this off hey this is mike
from PA and I was just calling in
because the last episode that I listen
to you guys are talking about you'll
time
episode ideas for you thought I am
episodes that you guys are asking a
Jewish for and i'm too lazy to email
years so i figured i should call i think
one of the things you do is justins
review on the Godfather trilogy that I
know he didn't watch yet nope and the
other movies that he was supposed to
watch any know so I forget whatever
wants you guys designed go but I'm
pretty short Godfather trilogy was the
big biggest one of all and you should do
an episode on his review of The
Godfather joji and whatever other videos
that he was supposed to watch and that
probably would kill 20 minutes it'll
kill an hour and a half because you
never do your homework with that oh well
let me just say three sizes my cousin
yeah my cousin vinny i watched and loved
i also watched Super Troopers watch that
after they were freaky came in the door
loved after they were actually here
regretted man being on that interview
and that was and that was the big thing
I'm like dude watch this before these
guys come couldn't do it can do it nope
couldn't do it and now you love that
movie how long do you think all three
Godfather movies are total total nine
hours nine hours of my time you did have
nine hours yeah like Pompeii watch you
have the time to rewatch the 1994
non-classic Angus you know how long it
takes to get all the cat hair off my
clothing when I step outside my house
i'm spending so much time doing that i
have have this resource just like okay
there okay I haven't watched pee-wee's
big adventure that was one homework
assignment into food that is Indian
trilogy AZ never well I saw the first
one off Raiders of the Lost that's right

cousin but don't see that check that
don't put the don't compare I know you
said thank you watch godfather too much
you tomorrow emotional investing what
are the Shawshank Redemption rank on a
Tuesday evening right idea yeah yeah
that's how little boys get out of like
cleaning their room you big pussy listen
okay this is what you should do okay at
least don't watch Angus watch pee-wee's
big adventure man that is not an
emotional investment at all it might be
cuz you're partial
bikes but I'm just saying yeah watch
that don't rewatch Angus the hell you
doin watching Angus Angus is a bad mood
I'm not angus is great don't come in

lobe I have seen it okay so then we can
all change i watch it again though hell
yeah watch it again before you watch it
I gotta confess before we do it you have
phase dropped like he just replied all
to an email thing man yeah of course
I've seen the big lebowski you know what
but you understand but you're not
surprised even if I had I can't even get
a read on you anymore who knows when
you're telling the truth let's finish
the show with this voicemail this is
talking about girl meets world and other
things therefore for the scans from van
der I gotta say I'm super excited about
the boy meets world sequel girl meets
world and you know it's pretty awesome
that they're gonna you know get the
original factors nitrous to to get a
role in it but also I had to point out
mr. Feeny was the voice of kit and I
hired her yep and when I was wondering
when he's rolled back in the day I used
to associate Knight Rider with meets
world in a very weird way like I was
imagine that mr. Feeny was kit like
evolve into a human being trying to
shape the lives of children to be like
Michael and I are okay and it always
blew my mind that was the guy who was
kidding Knight Rider I hope they do get
him to definitely okay well they got it
he literally follows him at them
everywhere they go right so it will not
make any sense if he doesn't show up at
