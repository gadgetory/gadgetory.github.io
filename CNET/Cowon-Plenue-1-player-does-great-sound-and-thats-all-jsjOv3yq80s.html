sound of music from your smartphone then
there are a couple of things you can do
upgrade your headphones buy a portable
DAC or better than a DAC by a dedicated
player the cow on plenty one is an
excellent sounding portable music player
which will pretty much play any format
you can throw at it but it's not cheap
at around $1000 bill quality is
excellent as the whole thing is carved
out of aluminum and it feels solid and
cool to the touch the device features a
3.7 inch OLED touchscreen which also
comes with physical playback controls
but sadly these controls aren't lockable
and also you can't easily operate them
by feel when they're in your bag there's
no tactile knobs to help guide you the
menu system is pretty easy to use and
the player supports almost everything
including flack Apple Lossless
and even ripped si CDs the player lacks
any wireless connectivity though so
there's no Spotify or title some quality
is excellent with a very open detailed
sound that isn't harsh or overly bass
heavy like the competitive Sony zx2 can
be with some recordings this player will
also drive most headphones even esoteric
ones at a thousand bucks it's got the
sound and build quality to compete even
if it isn't the best value for money
around but if you're looking for a
simple high-end player it's a very good
choice this is ty Pendlebury for
cnet.com
