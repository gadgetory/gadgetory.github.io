report this week security friendly
laptop bags and ultra in each social
networking all get made fun of let's get
started with the gadget of the week the
gadje of the week is the new checkpoint
friendly laptop bag from air ovation
more bags are coming soon from targets
and other makers the idea is that you
can fold open the actual bag and then
send it into the screening machine so
you don't have to take your laptop out
of your bag at security genius around
twenty twelve or so when every TSA agent
has gotten the memo about these bags and
how they work and how you actually don't
have to remove your laptop from this
particular kind of bag even though it
looks like every other bag then this is
really going to speed things up at the
airport yay and now for the news this
week a buzz reports special report the
state of social networking
I get a lot of press releases here at
buzz report headquarters and a lot of
them like a lot lately are about social
networks this week I was introduced to
we play which is a youth sports specific
social network funded in part by Peyton
Manning LeBron James and Derek Jeter the
big draw appears to be that if you join
you can be friends with LeBron or Peyton
or Derek or other big-name athletes like
Shaun Alexander not friends like they'll
come to your house just internet friends
and this week I was also introduced to
Savi anti-com that's a site for
so-called Pancks professional ants no
kids it appears to me to be a social
network for people who are over involved
in their sisters or brothers child
rearing but whatever the community for
women who love kids has information on
books the lyrics to children's songs
articles about how to play with your
nieces and nephews like I learned that
coloring is fun and kids like ice cream
and then I found an article about Botox
I don't I so I talked to some actual
aunts about this and here are some of
their comments like I really need a
website to tell me that kids like ice
cream if anyone ever calls me a pink I
would slap their face so you're saying
ants that you don't believe as CEO
Melanie not consent or press release
that tank is the new pink oh I think I
just threw up in my mouth a little bit
see and here's the other thing about
social networking social networks with a
lot of people on them get pot for a lot
of money even though they don't make a
lot of money social networks that appeal
to about 85 people who are willing to
utterly subjugate themselves to the idea
that they fit precisely into the
category of youth sports fan or pank and
absolutely nothing else those sites
don't seem to get out of beta but hey
maybe one of these will surprise me pink
and finally let's have a look at what's
clogging the tubes this week it's the al
dente blogs list of the five hot dogs
that will kill you how by clogging the
tubes
and that's it for this week's show
everyone i'm molly wood and this has
been the buzz report thanks for watching</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
