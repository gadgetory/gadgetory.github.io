characters this is ISA a stealthy
warrior thief each of these environments
is huge extremely detailed and filled
with rich and rewarding gameplay and
each of these areas is as big or bigger
than the entirety of the first Infinity
Blade now this is all running real time
with each of these complex environments
being loaded almost instantly that's
over five times faster than on an iPhone
5 now watch will literally just fade to
black unload this and boom load in an
entirely new world just like that the
64-bit architecture of the new a7 chip
is so efficient I literally did a double
take the first time I saw how fast it
loaded now typically converting software
to 64-bit is a lengthy painstaking
process but with Apple's excellent tools
it took you how long Jeremy two hours
two hours by himself
now Cyrus and Issa have joined forces to
take down the deathless and the worker
of Secrets with opengl es 3.0 we can now
combine advanced rendering effects that
you've only before seen in film things
like depth of field and blur and full
screen vignettes we can even now add
lens flares that would make JJ Abrams
proud yes and his armor even reflects
the environment so if any weight is
known for its big epic boss battles but
we wanted to do something bigger
something it would even make this troll
afraid for its life
have this new boss eats the old boss for
lunch now remember this is running real
time this is absolutely not a movie
Jeremy is fighting this dragon right now
on the iphone 5s I really think that
this represents a sea change for our
industry all right Jeremy let's see if
you have it takes to slay the dragon
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
