going to torture test the Samsung Galaxy
s3 it'll go through our standard battery
of tests cold heat dropping and a water
test plus a wild card that you'll see in
a little while let's get going
time for the cold test Samsung Galaxy s3
going in the freezer for two hours
little buddy good luck
fingers crossed
okay our Samsung Galaxy s3 has been in
the freezer two hours let's see how it's
doing ooh
it is convincing up on the screen
already let's check its temperature 24
degrees try the back 20 degrees you can
see condensation forming already
oh it's actually ice there's like ice
buildup on there let's try to turn it on
okay well it comes on it is sluggish but
still functional nice okay so we're
trying a new thing for the torture test
we have bought a terrarium and then I
ordered 250 watt ceramic bulbs that are
meant to sort of heat up like a lizard
enclosure so I'm going to see if we can
get the inside of a like pretty much hot
box this thing and then see if we can
get it to you know 120 140 degrees no
lizards or spiders in there though
okay now it's time for the heat test we
had to reconfigure our terrarium of
death a little bit to get it hotter in
there now I think it might be too hot so
we're actually just going to go with one
bulb on still working fine after the
cold that their lid on this for sealing
one hour
we might have gotten a little carried
away with the heat test it got pretty
hot inside the terrarium of death I did
turn off this top bulb but it might have
been a little unfair let's see how it's
doing okay the first thing I want to
know is whether I can even touch it
with my bare hand that phone is hot that
phone is too hot to touch right now it
seems kind of cruel to try to turn it on
so I'm just going to set it to the side
let it cool for about 10 minutes maybe
it's okay all right so it's been resting
for about 10 minutes it's now pretty
much room temperature to the touch let's
let's see if it turns on oh it came on
oh my god
okay my mind is blown right now well
played phone well played this thing is
totally fine
I think it's snappier than it was after
the cold test unbelievable
okay it's time for our drop test and
this camera is rolling three drops all
from standing here we go one mini pieces
alright let's put it back together
let's try to turn it back on let's wake
it up also no cracks then once it
recovers we'll do it again so it
survived drop one time for drop - the
cameras are rolling three two one drop
the camera turned off back stayed on
mostly okay still no cracks alright so
I'm going to do a standing height but
like a little more drama this time okay
this one could hurt time for the third
drop three two one
okay gotta say it doesn't feel very
sturdy this phone but maybe that's
working in its advantage like this thing
it's never going to shatter because it's
totally flimsy already all right let's
try it on again seems to be totally fine
drop test no big deal for today's
wild-card test on the Samsung Galaxy s3
it's a bit of a key test you all know
this scenario your keys or maybe in your
purse and then you shove the phone in
there or more common for you guys the
keys are in your pocket and then you
shove your phone in there so we thought
we would just drag some keys along the
screen and see if you actually need one
of those overpriced screen protectors or
not let's have a go don't look into
members okay I'm going to take my
roughest key here feel like I can't even
feel actually like I can do this all day
needs to be having oh I see some little
scratches I can't tell if they're
scratches or not takes like the mail key
all the different ones a king of Spain
memorial keychain
phone came on was like knock it off
alright so let's see let's come in close
I can definitely see scratches but I
don't think any of them rise to the
level of true scratching so maybe if you
did it 100 times a day you'd eventually
start to scratch this guy but no problem
now it's time for the dreaded water test
we're going to dunk it in our fish tank
here then take it out and put it in our
recovery bag leave it for a few days and
we'll find out in studio whether it
survived here we go
sleeeeep it for 10-15 seconds
looks like our screen went off grabbed a
bag filled with silica gel packets you
could also use rice or quinoa something
absorbent to put the phone in for just a
couple of days let's get it out of here
don't try to turn it on up here oh it's
me it's making its little like water
noises that it makes oh that's so messed
up I know I know
help is on the way okay we'll put it in
here it does come back on now this one
is amazing but just in case let's put it
in here we're just gonna put in our
little bag here we will check on it
again in a couple days but I gotta say
looking good so far still turning on
stop it off now even though our galaxy
s3 turned on while I was drying it off
that actually might have killed it we
did a couple more shots with it later
and it wouldn't come back on cuz you're
really not supposed to turn your phone
on after it gets dunked in water so what
I did is I took off the battery cover
and took out the battery and I've been
drying the whole thing in this bag of
silica gel packets for about four days
here we are at the moment of truth let's
open it up I have no idea what's gonna
happen here here's the battery put that
back in put our cover back on and I'm so
nervous
power oh it's coming back on
the speaker is working oh my goodness
look at this thing this phone is amazing
and I can officially declare the Samsung
Galaxy s3 a torture test survivor</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
