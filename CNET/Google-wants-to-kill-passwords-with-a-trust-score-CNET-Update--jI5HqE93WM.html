Google and Microsoft have some plans to
help you because you can't be trusted to
make good password decisions for
starters Google wants to eliminate
passwords all together on Android
instead your phone or tablet would use
something called a trust score it would
be a combination of a few things the
phone could look at the shape of your
face how you move how you type how you
swipe essentially things to get a feel
if you are really you but with how
problematic facial recognition can be or
how you could sound different when you
have a cold obviously a fingerprint is
easier at replacing a password but
Google says a combination of many tests
is more secure than one fingerprint
Google is testing the system next month
with the goal to launch it to developers
by the end of the year Microsoft is
taking a simpler approach to saving you
from shameful passwords it simply will
not let you use a bad password that's
easy to guess or something that you'd
find on the most used password list so
if your Microsoft account password is
lame you'll be prompted to choose a
password that's harder for hackers to
crack of course you could just keep
yourself safe by using two-factor
authentication by having it text your
phone to verify it's really you but I
guess that's just asking too much that's
it for this tech news update I'm Bridget
