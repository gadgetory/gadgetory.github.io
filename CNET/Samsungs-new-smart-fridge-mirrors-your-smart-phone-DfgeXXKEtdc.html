got a new flagship smart and this is it
right here this is model RF 28 hmel BSR
slash double-a now like previous smart
refrigerators that we've seen from
Samsung this models got built-in Wi-Fi
and an eight inch LCD touchscreen that's
the exact same size as the last model
it's got apps like Pandora so you can
stream music it's got the AP news app so
you can check the headlines in the
morning doesn't have that same Twitter
app though that we saw last year the big
new feature this year is the phone
mirroring aspect of this refrigerator so
if you've got a samsung galaxy s5 or a
note 3 you'll be able to mirror your
phone screen directly onto the fridge
now I'm not sure you'd really want that
it might not be for everyone it's got a
kind of low resolution screen and not
the greatest speakers but it is an
interesting feature because it's putting
the smarts into your hands the obvious
use for that might be streaming a movie
or watching a TV show on your phone and
having it play on your fridge as you're
cooking dinner but if you can think of
another smart use of the technology in
this fridge and you can do it on your
phone you can see it on this screen now
you won't be able to access it on the
screen you can't use the touchpad to
actually control your phone that's a
little a little bit disappointing I
would prefer that level of functionality
but there is an interesting level of
user customizability with this and that
might be a step forward for the large
smart appliance the other big new smart
feature that goes along with that phone
mirroring is that the samsung smart
fridge now has a kitchen phone mode you
can access it and then pull up your
samsung galaxy s5 or Note 3 and actually
dial people and talk to them right
through your fridge that might make this
the biggest and most expensive phone
ever made but it's kind of interesting
if you've got one of those devices now
we'll have a much more in-depth look at
the phone mirroring and kitchen phone
capabilities of this refrigerator once
we do a full review in the coming months
but for now the app is a little bit
half-baked and also you know none of us
on staff have an s5 or a note 3 and that
leaves us unable to even test these out
if it wasn't half-baked so that's kind
of interesting if you don't have one of
those phones if you're like us you can't
take full advantage of these new
features and this fridge probably isn't
worth it now aside from those new layers
of smart functionality the new Samsung
smart fridge has a very similar set of
features and capabilities to the last
model we saw it's got the same 28 cubic
foot capacity inside and it's got the
same twin cooling system that keeps the
refrigerator humid and the freezer dry
another thing that's unchanged is this
flex zone drawer in between the freezer
and the fridge you open it up and you've
got four different modes for specific
types of foods you've also got this
slider here that will help you organize
things as you see fit you can move it
wherever you want
the final similarity between this model
and last one is the price point at
$35.99 it's just $100 cheaper than the
last model and that's an incremental
step down kind of go along with the
incremental step up in smarts so we'll
see if that translates to more appeal
with consumers we're seeing that I'm
right Chris</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
