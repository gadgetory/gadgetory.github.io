I'm pretty excited about this one we
have our senior editors favorite this is
our best TV overall from Panasonic and
I've brought in my good friend Eric
Franklin to help me try to break it so
we're gonna start with some video gaming
move on to some mishaps with wall
mounting and then maybe a little
decorating disaster I hope you've been
practicing your ragequit yes perfectly
honed at this point while I'm losing
lately excellent let's do it alright it
is time for the ragequit test of our
panasonic TV I'm here with Kyle and max
from GameSpot and of course Eric we're
gonna play a little Call of Duty until
somebody loses their temper do you
actually shot me in the back here hoarse
you do that
missile watcher
dude you broke it already I didn't throw
that hard I really didn't throw that
hard himself you don't think you threw
it that hard because of look I were
obviously didn't feel like that hurt
come and see we've done I like that this
is what we brought him down for and now
he's in trouble
Wow did I do that it's okay as I'm
looking at this I see basically a spider
web for every single hitpoint like this
here here and here three controllers hit
the TV and every single one of those
controllers caused a break I find that
to be disappointing
I think TV should be tougher than this
so I should be trying to turn it back on
we should try it I think so where's the
remote
you have the remote try to turn it back
on I'm like afraid of it I'm pressing
power and it's definitely not no that's
kind of no surprise I think we saw the
screen pretty much blow yeah from the MV
yeah yeah we did since I soon as I hit
it well I think now that the screen is
pretty well destroyed there's no need to
bother with the water test but we can
still check some structural integrity by
trying to wall mount this yeah I think
so you know I'm not very good at this
handyman stuff either by
okay we'll mount this baby yep okay
taking it a little higher yeah all
righty
yeah okay yeah that work right there
yeah you got it yeah I got it okay I'm
just saying redecorating is hard okay um
that was bad
she'll fall on it we definitely have
some more cracks oh well towns
everywhere that though look at the
bezels come up over there oh man
over here the bezel is completely
twisted well it's only like what four
feet four feet and drop yeah that was
about four feet
we try to lift it back up yeah I mean it
is pretty heavy
yeah well the back looks intact yeah
okay so the back is fine the bezel and
the screen are shattered destroyed come
on I kind of want to do a little
research and see what the cost would be
in fixing a TV like this but I guess now
we know don't drop it
be careful with your TV's I guess
they're fragile delicate flower
hopefully it is we killed it I think
it's safe to say that this is a fail for
the TV yeah I think that's safe for sure
and we've learned an important lesson
here which is don't drop your TVs yeah
and don't throw things at your TV
probably not but it's you know it's good
I think people have kids and when
they're shopping for a TV they want to
know how much it can take and it turns
out the answer is not very much not at
all really so you want to play cards or
something
