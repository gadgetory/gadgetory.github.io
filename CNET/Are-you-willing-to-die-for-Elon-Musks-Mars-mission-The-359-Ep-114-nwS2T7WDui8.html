thank you for tuning into episode 114 of
the 359 podcast with Roger Cheng and Ben
Fox Rubin good morning morning morning
everyone we're back the beat teams back
yeah this court Alfred I haven't been
back in a while this is so exciting uh
yes / hell yeah we've got we've got
we've got a number of exciting topics to
talk about first off Elon Musk unveiling
his vision for traveling to Mars are you
booking a dick ticket the whole thing's
of snooze okay huh don't believe
anything that next up we talked about we
don't quite dance with blackberries
grave but we do talk about its kind of
pseudo death well at least the phone
business at least phone business yes and
then lastly we'll talk about Facebook
taking on slack in the workplace again
yet another place where we have to use
Facebook workbook sure workbook oh
that's catchy not now not I think
they're calling it facebook at work
which is less catchy yeah but more
accurate probably yeah kinda all right
as always any questions leave them in
the comment section or producer Brian
will pick the best one so we'll we'll
try to answer tried yes fri well let's
do it give it the old cnet try there we
go that's not saying much okay alright
thanks for sticking with us we'll be
back to answer your questions and
comments and 32 welcome to the 359 we
talked about the top tech news of the
day I like crap you want to throw it I'm
Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox ribbon so that
mission to Mars is right around the
corner the insanely brilliant Elon Musk
laid out his vision for traveling and
caramelized kalo sorry can we start over
just get going alright let me just start
I'll start this sentence over we could
even cut it later on even know we're
live still I know are we live that
mission to Mars we lost we lost
everybody alright don't worry I'll start
at the top of the store thanks for the
nightmare edit thanks sorry about that
that mission to Mars is right around the
corner the insanely brilliant Elon Musk
laid out vision for traveling and kana
lot Collin Collin izing why can't I say
that we're
one more time Roger that mission of ours
is right around the corner the insanely
brilliant Elon Musk lay down sufficient
for traveling to Mars he sees this
happening in six years which is far more
aggressive than his previous estimate
and he said that you know the cost be
significantly lower than the estimated
ten billion per person that wrong so all
right Ben yes I'm so skeptical of this
six years mission to Mars as fine as it
pretty good a dozen why hasn't NASA done
it already actually NASA was pretty
generous in our comment about this they
were like this is great we love the fact
that people are talking about a mission
to Mars we need the best and the
brightest involved from private and
public industry so you know more power
to Elon Musk however he there are so
many question marks involved in this
that yes like how is he going to pay for
this I mean he's using in a little bit
he's a he's gonna be employing methane
gas a much cheaper version of fuel
that's currently using rockets it's what
it's testing with some of the SpaceX
rockets now the ones are I think blowing
up yeah ultimately though he envisions a
fully self sustaining civilization on
Mars of 1 million people within forty
two hundred years of the first Mars
rendezvous I don't know I'm not really
aggressive I don't mean to sound like
overly Scotty 106 years from now or 46
years from now that's getting area look
he makes some fancy looking cars that
does not mean that he can actually pull
this off their way too many question
marks about this right he's very good
showman he presents like some really big
pie in the sky ideas however I don't see
this as being conceivable I'd love to
eat my words on this yet years from now
it just doesn't seem very possible and
like just because it's Elon Musk we're
supposed to eat this all up thank you
alright sorry we'll see if this happens
we've got six years to find out Oh next
up blackberry is officially bailing out
bailing on building its own phones the
company confirmed today that I will exit
the hardware business internally will
actually partner with other companies to
produce design and sell these phones are
basically just going to take a royalty
fee off of any phones like it was a
blackberry branded phone hi sorry
Brendan phones yeah
going to saw this a little bit with the
last film the d tech 50 was a phone that
was essentially built and designed by
alcatel they stole an alcatel design and
just be repurposed it for itself this is
more of an extension there just to get
rid of all the personnel involved with
mobile hardware so what is blackberry
gonna be now blackberry is just merely
software enterprise services all the
kind of the boring stuff that we don't
like to talk about but it's become I
guess a more important part of the
company is that do they have a future
doing something like that John Chad
definitely has a track record of that I
mean he he's been the head of the number
of software companies enterprise
software company so he knows how to run
those types of businesses he was always
less comfortable with the hardware part
hmm nice knowing you blackberry you are
now going to be part of ZDNet or
coverage area anyway facebook at work is
something that's expected to be coming
out in october i believe according to a
rumor and that's basically going to be
something like slack or Yammer for you
know for your workplace and we'll we'll
see what ends up happening it basically
means that Facebook could be coming to
even more places yay another place where
I have to log into Facebook just so
excited absolutely alright for more
about these stories check us out on cnet
I'm Roger Cheng I'm Ben Fox Rubin thanks
for listening and thanks for sticking
with us i'm gonna start filtering
through the comments we got lots of good
discussion and i think a lot of people
are on your side pen oh really right
okay cuz i got kind of angry there
because he's done full Trump on us dude
yes or no charges on wall they're wrong
I don't know it's just it's it just
bothers me the like just because he's a
billionaire all of a sudden we're
supposed to like take this whole stock
yeah yeah yeah yeah and apparently the
crowd was eating it up oh yeah like they
were like yes absolutely this guy he's a
charismatic guy yeah but like that
doesn't mean that this is accurate like
you know he went like a recode
conference and said like we could all be
in like a computer simulation and
everybody went bonkers over it as if
that hadn't actually been presented as
an idea years ago that was not Elon
Musk's idea right but until I must
saying it let's find you on I'll take
your interview anyway if you ever
actually want to talk to
so whatever uh but would you be
interested go to Mars I mean would you
be one of the first to go no of course
not if too many kids I gotta leave my
children right what about you I would
not go I would not go see nothing
against the mission I would not seems
like a pretty terrible place really this
like I couldn't get a burger there let
you seen the Martian that's right it
would be like the bar I'd have to
be like more vaguely oh crap i mean
that's Damon was less than thrilled with
the outcome of that so bill nye was in
the audience in the garden a guardian
interviewed him and he said that this
this sounds really great you know the
audience is really enthusiastic however
we need to make absolutely sure that
there are there's no life on Mars or any
signs of previous life on Mars because
obviously that would change how we view
the world the solar system our universe
whatever and so you can't just cowboy
your way into there after six years this
enormous amount of technology that you
need to develop and also just general
research on the ground well I thought we
just just nuke Mars terraforming right
yeah yes sir just nuke the thing it
doesn't matter if like they have ants
there I I am curious i would like to
hear from someone who would want any
part of that initial mission because it
just seems like I'll fine you are the
droves of people oh yeah yes I just you
you basically just oh oh no oh yeah the
dun dun dun doin all right now I do want
to go I know popped up uh let's head
back into the chat first of all hi to
all of our international listeners we
have yeah India Romania UK very cool to
have everyone on board of us today
Michael in the chair Michael Brown says
I think colonization will start in 42 a
hundred years I'm that's a basically
what must to say is it yeah yeah okay
but he said like a million people
colonized by then oh yeah right yes yes
which is sure which is a few this is
such a bit yeah it's a hot let's try
like a hundred but that's still a pretty
aggressive time like 40 years for
colonization the other the other issue
is is like is the world expected to blow
up in that time frame I'm you know maybe
it will I believe that point idea
on jump in January niki lauda made that
point like it doesn't have to be a
doomsday scenario that drives this
pushed bars hmm even though that's
basically what every sci-fi novel it's
all about right yeah yeah look I
appreciate that he has somewhat
altruistic sort of altruistic views of
this that he wants us to be a
interplanetary species so we don't end
up becoming extinct here obviously it's
like big picture stuff so it's cool to
get to talk about yeah I just think that
like the way he's presenting it is
really over promising so people should
never say it under delivering that's
that's sort of the mantra of most tech
executives right yeah but like six years
is a close enough time frame that people
are still going to remember this at
least I think they're gonna call that on
its ears where's the rocket Eli there's
the rocket yeah we want to go you know I
don't know I I for one I do agree that
this is really sounds way too but it's
like crazy ambitious I would like to see
that just cuz yeah like I'd like to see
us being interplanetary species that's
sure how much of this would it take
Blake says give me a small fortune for
my family and then he'd go and that's a
very noble statement uh wait how much
money how much money would across
immersion notice send you so Corran they
have to pay you oh I would probably
thought the cost of it but actually like
compensation for travelling Koretz a
question anybody that's willing to go
should probably want to go for like
virtually nothing because it's like more
especially at first to the first run of
people on the expedition yeah kind of
hard I likely die well they're good at
yeah plus they need to have special
skill sets and everything so it's not
like we're just paying anyone to go on
their show up you want to know like so
what you've got a train you've got to
have certain skills you know like it's
yes i think is less about a job more
like it's a calling for yeah i guess the
answer the question directly i would say
i am unwilling to whore myself out for a
Mars mission so no is no doubt bigger if
they paid me a billion dollars maybe no
really we have volunteers I could take
never
you know that I have I don't ears in the
chat right now nice of course there are
we can find the signup sheet guys will
send it to you yeah yeah definitely take
care of my family and there's this like
an instant statue that's something that
a lot of people would be into let's say
you never make it back or maybe you die
or maybe you actually do your own statue
though right like there's no you there
above others there are multiple people
you're gonna be like one of five or six
statues still pretty sweet guaranteed
statue territory how else am I gonna be
on a statue you know nice try didn't
invent anything I got this podcast
that's basically it a hundred years from
now but 359 statue our kids will look
upon that okay so first of all someone
in the chat hating on Bill Nye you're a
monster huh Oh second of all let's move
on to morning blackberry by the way I've
ever build my story I just I ran into
got a samsung event it's pretty awesome
cuz I took a selfie with something's
like it's not samsung phone record suck
samsung of that dude anyways go on uh so
we got both ends of the spectrum there's
a large number of people saying
blackberry should have quit a long time
ago Oh totally yeah go to a blackberry
yes I be I've rid the whole blackberries
doom story maybe three or four times and
they really should have thrown in a
towel a while ago I mean it's sort of
last the last straw it's it there were a
lot of rumors even going into today that
they were going to exit the business
completely this is sort of a a safe face
move like ass buddies you know not
necessarily ejecting the business but
like finding a new putting it out to
literally putting it out to pasture
right right like someone else to come in
and like that big farm in upstate that
is a blackberry named have some sort of
value in certain cuts so it does there
are certain countries like Indonesia
which the first partner who has stepped
up to say they're going to build phones
it's company let's see if I can
pronounce me we're going to butcher the
name it
is an Indonesian company called
something Putin be Beamer a booty okay I
was good test anyways Indonesia is a
huge market for for blackberries and so
they're going to be building the sort of
first run of these these license phones
so there's the man in that market the
thing of it is is their demand in the US
and the demanded more more mature
markets and well anyone actually step up
to to build these kind of high-end
phones hmm I don't know they teased that
they were talking to a number partners
but i will say i don't know what the
demand is for these days they still have
a good name in the security worlds so it
looks like they're already trying to
like build on that and we'll see how
successful they are with it and just to
clear blackberry isn't dead it will be
focusing on enterprise software they'll
be building apps and supporting Android
or Android powered blackberries so you
know they're not completely gone but
it's it's definitely at the end of a
significant chapter for the company mmm
definitely more international listeners
we have a Martian in the chat no so he
already beat you on there that's new
he's already what Kyle what cell phone
reception is he getting that he could
actually maybe this will be a historic
show nah we bet on RTE call again what
haha set penalty how one more time
through on this this facebook at work
thing I'm already tired of how many ways
you guys can track me down mmm you would
never leave me alone sorry about that
yes maybe it makes sense for that me an
instant messenger and slack and email
and text and right but for facebook they
want to try to sink their hooks into you
however many ways that they can coerce
themselves useful to you has anyone
actually will be charging for it is not
that's even better this is it like your
facebook where it's free i mean it is
they're charged per seat just like slack
does just like Yammer um no a fan of
slack unless I don't that amazing
services anyways no mediator I just get
kind of annoyed by them because I'll get
the same message from the same person
across three platform yeps within
seconds it's like pick one stick with it
right now we just got one more in the
mix what I'm the annoying one because if
I don't get it I don't get a response on
taste
black I'll go to Google Plus or Goku
blah so go check gchat not you chat that
email like I'll just keep going until I
find a response mm-hmm I'm pretty
annoying like on cement report well done
has there been any trial of this yet of
the figure it's been it's something yes
being if I out for a while okay yeah but
it's still not like broadly actually is
it actually announced it two years ago
so yeah I'm surprising that it's just
launching now yeah and we still don't
know if that's one hundred percent true
but maybe it is going to come out next
month and if it does I mean slack is
already doing a lot of advertising and
that's getting a lot of attention so you
know obviously never discount facebook
but they are going to have quite a bit
of competition in that market I would
like I mean I think with slack part of
the issue is that they're like no thread
comment so there's no like newsfeed i
would kind of like a newsfeed like a
facebook style news feed I don't like
slack either yeah we used to use convo
if you know what that is I know that
convo pod Yammer convo is also had a
news feed mm-hmm but yeah they're none
of them really that effective care
Kieran in the chat is concerned about
them letting a galaxy note 7 on the musk
 oh yeah you can't have a sec ya
can't have let's avoid that or let's get
the one with the new battery not even
that I won't even trust it actually
potentially they could use galaxy note
720 acapella check that was you there
you just pack it like all them the tube
for the 2.5 million galaxy note sevens
ever recall yeah go to put on the rocket
have them up yeah yeah you can make it
past Mars even you know we could just go
at least we have a use for these now as
an alternative few holes Oh Samsa it
always goes back to Samson well done
commenter well done and on that no it's
probably time to call today alright yeah
that's a solid solid I no way that was a
good way in the show all right select
anything you saw her here check us out
on cnet our podcast also available on
itunes tune in stitcher SoundCloud
