and this is a battle that you the people
asked for so we're delivering it's a
prize 5 punch out between the asuste
transformer prime and apple's new ipad
now our judges for this fight our senior
editor Donald Liberty Bell senior editor
Eric the tank man Franklin and myself
all night Tom will take all three judges
blind scores and abs the mountaineers
tenth each round the final prize fight
score will be an average of all rounds
using the same decimal system it's six
rounds to the finish first one is
designed the asuste transformer prime
still brings the sleekest android tablet
on the market with its all metal
exterior that's thinner compared to the
new ipad and a wide screen design but
it's been plagued by intermittent Wi-Fi
and gps issues now the new ipad takes a
step back with a slightly thicker body
and a heavier weight from the previous
model it's hotter running temperature is
a little overblown but it still has a
more natural feel when you're holdin it
unfortunately Apple has regressed
instead of improving when it comes to
design we're calling this round a tie at
four point three points a piece next
round is controls and user interface the
transformer Prime's ice cream sandwich
OS provides elegance and functionality
to Android it still requires a slight
learning curve but adds complexity for
those who want it is the most
customizable OS with widgets and we're
fans of the data porn heavy data usage
utility now Apple's iOS is still the
most intuitive operating system that
infants can use is strength lies in its
speed and simplicity but it's added more
complexity with multi-touch navigation
and double tapping the home button for
quick access to settings the question
for you really is what's your flavor but
we give the new iPad the edge with a 4.7
and the transformer prime gets a 4.3 so
after averaging two rounds Apple leads
by two tenths of a point round three is
features
if you're looking for a feature-packed
tablet the transformer prime delivers
its quad-core Tegra 3 processor is a
beast you'll have a micro SD card slot
for additional memory and micro HDMI
support androids marketplace is now
called google play and it's a legit
media offering but if you want to take
things to the next level it supports a
$149 keyboard dock that can transform
the experience into a laptop that adds
longer battery life a USB port and a
full SD card slot this transformer makes
Megatron look like a little water gun
now the new iPads hardware makes under
the hood improvements with a dual-core
a5x processor with four times the
graphics power a 4G LTE option is here
and a 2048 x 1536 resolution retina
display that looks great wow this looks
great there's HDMI out support with an
adapter but no storage expansion
airplane compatibility makes viewing
your content a breeze if you're an apple
freak with an apple TV but it's
ecosystem is its greatest asset with its
robust iTunes and App Store that's still
superior to Android's offerings now if
you're looking for a feature creature
the prime shines and takes this round
with the 4.7 and the new iPad gets a 4
next round is web browsing a multimedia
the transformer primes chrome browser is
just as responsive as Safari both
browsers do not support flash but chrome
syncs with your desktop bookmarks and
Safari does the same over iCloud Google
Play is a legitimate rival that's
getting close to what Apple has to offer
for content but itunes still brings a
larger library with plenty of exclusive
content that puts it ahead here now it's
8 megapixel rear camera takes great
pictures and captures 1080p video plus
I'm kind of a sucker for the built-in
panoramic shooting mode now the iPads 5
megapixel rear camera ups its game with
a more natural looking picture and it's
1080p video capture is excellent video
playback looks great on both tablets but
the ipad screen improvements and
resolute
and color make the difference here and
it gets a perfect five and the
transformer prime gets a 4.3 so after
averaging four rounds the new iPad leads
by a hair round five is performance the
transformer prime has the best in class
battery life for Android tablets at nine
point six hours of juice from our own
cnet test it's OS is super responsive
and gaming looks great even though it's
lacking games to play it's inconsistent
Wi-Fi performance and GPS issues are
being addressed but it's not something
you want to hear now the iPad has always
been the benchmark for battery life and
the new iPad rings in an impressive
twelve point eight hours in our video
playback tests with 4G turned off its
interface is snappier than the primes
and it's faster Wi-Fi performance is
important too although a software issue
is coming for it sometimes moody Wi-Fi
connection Apple takes this round with
the 4.7 and the ax seuss gets a for this
fight is almost over and the final round
that decides it all is value the
transformer prime retails at 499 for its
32 gig model compared to the iPads 499
price tag for its 16 gig version now the
transformer prime can do more if you're
willing to pay extra for the doc but the
new iPad has made improvements across
the board while keeping the same entry
level price this is a close one but
we're giving Apple the edge with a 4.7
and the transformer prime of 4.3 so
let's average out all six slobber knock
and rounds where the new iPad took an
early lead the transformer prime fought
back but it just couldn't get over the
hump and the new new iPad takes this
battle 4.6 to 4.3 and is your prize
fight winner i'm brian Tong thanks for
watching it will catch you guys next
time for another price
