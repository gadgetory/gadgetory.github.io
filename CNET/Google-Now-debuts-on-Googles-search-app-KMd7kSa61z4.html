company's many internet resources to
your iOS device and the recent additions
of speedy voice search along with
today's announcement of Google now make
the app even better the google search
have already impressed us with its
access to google apps lightning-fast
voice search features and Google Goggles
the feature that lets you snap a picture
of something to find out more about it
related products and other info but
today Google search on iOS got another
useful feature with Google now Google
now provides you with useful information
based on your personal search history
emails through your gmail account and
your current location deliver
information that might be important to
you right now to get to Google now just
open the app and swipe upwards on the
interface google now displays virtual
cards with relevant information like the
local weather it also gives you location
information like how long it will take
you to get home as you use the app for
more searches google now will learn your
most used search terms to turn up more
information i've only used it a little
bit so it doesn't yet display very many
cards but a quick search through sample
cards shows things like public transfer
information flight status based on
flights confirmed via gmail sports
scores for your local team and more what
makes Google now useful is that each of
these cards will show up when it is most
appropriate for example you might get a
public transfer schedule card when
you're walking to the bus at the end of
the day or see the weather right as
you're getting ready in the morning
Google now is definitely a welcome
addition for iOS users but it has one
major drawback the app is not connected
to the iOS notification system so the
only way to get to this new useful info
is to open the Google Search app I don't
know about you but I'm not used to
opening the app every day on the other
hand with superfast voice searches and a
plethora of other information it might
be worth considering opening the app is
part of your daily routine I guess we'll
have to wait and see how people use the
new features but what I've seen so far
is very impressive the Google Search app
is free at the App Store and if you
already have the app just go through the
update process on your iOS device to get
the new google mouth features that's it
for today's first look at google now
features in the Google Search app i'm
