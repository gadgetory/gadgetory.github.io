bro but you should be because you're
watching me and also because there is a
new device here this is a whole new
business storage NAS for base server
from CJ and it's designed for bro
consumer or small business now a four
billionaire server is not a big deal
I've seen many other with 4 base 5a or
even more if I can be sure if for
example this one here from qnap it come
with 4 base and this one here from
Synology 5a and I even have a one here
that come with 8 base so basically base
do not impress me anymore so what does
this one he have to impress me let me
tell you I'm not easily impressed and it
does that is the new slot called the
universal storage module slot or usm
slot but before we go there let's travel
back in time and talk about this that's
right this is the floppy disk
you know 1.4 megabyte and take about 5
min to copy and of course to go with the
fabulous there is a floppy drive right
here the good old floppy drive a great
way to take information with you are not
so great but the good thing is this slot
right here do not take a floppy disk
instead it take the Seagate backup plus
Drive you can quickly add up to 1
terabyte or even more in the future to
the server through the slot and you can
also backup content of the server onto
the disk it's a great way to do up side
backup this right here works with both
Macs and Windows this means both windows
and mac user can actually benefit from
the up side backup feature alright
moving on we load the slot you can see a
tiny screen right here you can use the
screen to view the server's detail
starters and is this 2 button right here
to scroll between different pages of
starters you can also use the button to
initiate a backup job on the inside this
will open up to the for drive bay each
of the bay can handle one standard hard
drive of up to 4 terabyte of storage
meaning the server can give you up to 16
terabytes
now guess what the side of the hard
drive I have inside here of course they
are all for tater by why do you want to
have a less when you can have more right
and below here the silver has one USB
3.0 port it's another port on the back
here is also USB 3.0 and then you can
fight two Gigabit Ethernet port right
here these are the port you can use to
hook the server to a network only one
port is needed but you can you to at
same time for load balancing or failsafe
purpose so the question is how much that
is civil cost well the good news is is
actually very affordable costing about
$400 for no storage included up to $1500
with 16 ter by like this one right here
now in my testing the silver perform
quite well but for more on that have to
go and do some reading and see calm at
the full review because reading is good
for your brain and in this case it's
also good for my page view and then
you're going to go buy one of these or
maybe two but remember always buy the 16
terabyte version and maybe you should
buy some of these drive too because
that's how I do it and that's because
I'm don't go and this has been the first
look at the business storage for bein a
server from CD</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
