Oh 3d TVs TV makers tried desperately to
get all of us to think 2 dimensions is
just not enough for home viewing 3d
slowly crept its way into lots of
televisions but consumers like me just
did not care now comes the news that LG
and Sony will no longer support 3d in
2017 they were the two last major TV
makers supporting the third dimension LG
says that 3d was not a key buying factor
for consumers when selecting a new
television the company will focus on
newer tech like high dynamic range Sony
explained based on current market trends
we decided not to support 3d for our
2017 models other manufacturers gave up
on 3d earlier vizio dropped 3d by 2014
Samsung quit 3d in 2016 on the content
side Direct TV shuttered its 3d Channel
in 2012 ESPN
killed up its 3d network in 2013 so of
course when a technology is killed there
is some kind of resistance there's a
change.org petition entitled LG please
revive 3d on a 2018 OLED TV model as of
this recording the petition does have a
sizable amount of supporters however it
might not be enough to get LG to change
its mind in case you are a die-hard 3d
viewer you've got a couple of options
keep an older television around or look
into a home theater projector for more
