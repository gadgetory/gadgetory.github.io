trying to imagine how you take
multi-touch to the next generation and
further deliver a new experience that's
just as profound as the first
multi-touch and they've really done it
it's called 3d touch but now it's really
great about 3d touch is it lets me take
action on apps without even having to
open them so I might want to call one of
my favorites we'll watch what happens I
can get to them right here directly from
my home screen or maybe I want to listen
to music like beats one or song through
my favorite band well I can do that
right here and sometimes you need to
take that emergency selfie and you want
to get directly to the selfie camera
well now you can and when you want to
preview those selfies to make sure you
got the right shot just peek in you can
slide right back and forth and see that
you got the shot you were looking for
it's really handy now 3d touch also
makes it easier to navigate across apps
so in the past I would do this by double
clicking on my home button to get into
multitasking it's pretty cool I can go
let's say go into messages well now with
3d touch I can just apply a little bit
of force on the edge and look what
happens go right into my applications
just like that I can swipe across and
pick an app if I want to go back to the
previous app in a single gesture I can
just swipe across between apps
it's totally epic</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
