com and today we've got a very special
first look at the motorola droid for
Verizon Wireless we just got this in and
I'm just as excited as you are to check
out verizon's first android phone so
let's jump right to it let's talk about
the design first for what it offers I'm
really amazed at how thin the smartphone
is it's about the same size of the
iphone 3gs a little bit blocky ER and a
little thicker but it's also got a
slide-out qwerty keyboard so you really
have to appreciate it's only about a
couple hundredths of an inch thicker
than the iphone the keyboard is pretty
decent it's got a d-pad here on the
right side so you can navigate around
pages and select items the buttons are a
little flat and small but it works for
me since I have smaller hands but I
think uses with larger thumbs might have
some issues but like anything else with
time you get used to it I think plus
it's a physical keyboard I'm one of
those people that have to have a
physical keyboard and can't go all
touchscreen so this is great you do get
virtual keyboards though in both
portrait and landscape mode so if you're
just punching out some quick replies or
text messages you can easily use those
without having to open the phone I think
the real attention grabber of the droid
is the display though it measures 3.7
inches which is bigger than the iphones
and even the HTC touch pro tues and it's
absolutely vibrant and gorgeous with a
480 x 854 pixel resolution capacitive
touchscreen with a built-in
accelerometer so it'll change
orientation when you rotate the phone
you can double tap on the screen now to
zoom in and out of web pages but it's
not like the iPhone or pre where you can
use the pinch gesture to zoom still very
sharp and responsive and like other
android phones you can customize three
home pains with different widgets and
shortcuts for easy access to your
favorite apps some other highlights of
the design include a 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack on the top on the right
there's a dedicated camera capture Kia
while the 5 megapixel camera is located
on the back with a dual LED flash last
but not least there's a microSD cards
left behind the battery cover door and
verizon and motorola are being very
generous by including a 16 gigabyte card
with the phone that's just a quick
overview of the design
let's look at some of the features now
the motorola droid is the first
smartphone running Android to point out
this is the latest version of Google's
Android operating system bring some
great features for example you now get
native microsoft exchange support for
Outlook email and calendar in addition
to your gmail and pop3 and IMAP accounts
the droid also now has dedicated
facebook app and it will put pull in all
your contacts from there as well as
Gmail in exchange and combine them in
your address book so if you've pull up a
friend's contact card you'll be able to
see his or her facebook status different
email addresses i am handles photos etc
the droids web browser also has some
improvements their support for visual of
bookmarks as well as the multi-tap
assuming that i mentioned earlier
doesn't have flash light support but it
does have a plug-in that will support
adobe flash 10 player whenever that's
available you can connect via Wi-Fi or a
verizon evdo rev a network and you can
open multiple windows which is always
great another new feature is Google Maps
Navigation this app is still in beta but
it will provide voice guided directions
for free as well as satellite views so
you don't have to pay a monthly
subscription fee for a location-based
service like verizon VZ navigator and in
fact breezy navigator isn't even offered
as an option on the jordan since i just
got this phone i haven't been able to
test out the app but i'll definitely
cover it in my review so you can check
it for that top of that you get the
usual Android functions that we've seen
on previous devices such as Google
marketplace which has about 12,000 apps
now support for amazon mp3 store and a
dedicated you to app in the time that
I've had it and seeing demos of the
device has been really impressed by the
speed of the device and the design of
the phone is really remarkable the only
thing I would have liked seen as may be
some changes to music player maybe world
roaming capabilities but um can't and
I'll be doing more in-depth coverage and
analysis of the motorola droid which you
can check out in our full review but i
do have to say that the joy definitely
looks very promising and i think it will
do well for verizon the motorola droid
will be available november 64
9999 within your contract I'm Banita
this has been your first look at the
motorola</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
