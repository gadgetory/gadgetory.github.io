I'm cnet's Cara's you boy joined by
senior rider Shara Tipton hey Shara at
WWDC 2014 keynote just edit char has
emerged sure I did it live up to all of
your expectations so this would be a
software heavy announcement day this was
definitely software you know we didn't
expect any hardware that was definitely
the case nothing new here let's talk
about laptops first OS now called
yosemite yosemite yes tell us about some
of the changes that will see ya um you
know there's a lot more like
transparency you know with with bars
with you know search search to try to
make it you know a little more seamless
type a few characters in like Yosemite
you can get news feed information from
Wikipedia and even maps also a lot of
features that sink well with mobile
devices so that's a really big change of
it for example you can now make phone
calls through your laptop yeah yeah
you've done all I can you have to have a
phone Wow hey it's Craig federighi here
hey doing it is dre hey hey a doctor
you're on speakerphone with via my mac
with over 6000 amazing developers here
at WWDC and what about iOS updates yeah
I OS 8 you know a lot of things for
sharing you want to pick up where you
left off on your Mac on your iPad your
iPad is prompting you right in the lower
left of the screen just swipe up and you
can pick up working on what you're
working on your Mac right on your iPad
another really interesting feature is
what they did with like group messaging
you can now name your threads you can
add or remove people from a conversation
underway
if you've ever been on one of those
noisy threads that just keeps buzzing in
your pocket well you can do not disturb
on a per thread level and you can choose
when to leave the thread also really
interesting feature with with group
messages as well where you can send like
a quick like voice message you know
quick quick snippet and same with video
all I have to do is tap the play button
here the message impressive jaws you've
totally mastered in the dark face selfie
but basically it's kind of more like the
snapchat type of feature where they
disappear immediately another feature
that a lot of families might appreciate
is the whole sharing planet Apple
announced tell us about that yes so you
know typically a lot of families will
end up sharing one itunes account Apple
is making it easier so you can have up
to six people in a family where you're
sharing the same accounts well now with
family sharing you can get it not just
your purchases but the purchases of all
the members of your family and for kids
when they buy something the parents
immediately get an alert saying your
child is trying to buy this a lot of
people anticipated that there would be
some sort of roundup for all of your
health monitors and data described that
yeah I mean basically you know
everybody's making a big push with
health care but there's not really a
place to gather all of that Apple's
trying to kind of have this hub for
everything patient takes let's say a
blood pressure reading health kit
automatically notifies their app and
their app is automatically able to check
whether that reading is within that
patients personalized healthcare
parameters thresholds and if not it can
contact the hospital proactively notify
a doctor and kind of in that same vein
is a sort of gathering every information
about your home too right yeah so right
now you know your nest smoke detector
may not talk to your Samsung washing
machine or you have to have different
apps or different devices to control
these but apples trying to find a way to
get these to all you know come together
in one location and control it from
there in addition to being able to
control individual devices in your home
with home Kate you can group devices and
changes into scenes and then with Siri
integration you can say something like
get ready for bed and be sure that your
garage door is
closed your door is locked the
thermostat is lowered and your lights
are dimmed take the big surprise from
this was the new programming language
which is very very exciting for the
developers you know like they went crazy
when they announced that but for the
rest of us you know just you know
looking at Apple as consumers you know
that really isn't quite as exciting for
us so obviously no hardware what's
announced here today when do you think
it will be announced they said iOS and
the new mac operating system will be
this fall so that's when we'll see the
new devices they always land launch iOS
with you know the next generation of
their phone great thank you so much char
