innovator in the browser world but this
major update to version 12 barely keeps
pace with the competition hi I'm Seth
Rosenblatt foreseen it and today I'm
giving you a first look at opera 12 be
warned diehard opera fans this may be a
little hard to take note that this
version of opera is the preview build
but it's expected to have no major
changes between this and the final
version the only difference that you
will see is that the silver button in
the top will be red in the final version
first the good quirky features such as
widgets unite and voice have been killed
off with prejudice that means there's a
less bloat opera continues to upgrade
its html5 support and now can use
hardware such as your webcam via
websites opera now has separate
processes for plugins so things like
flash when they crash don't kill off
your browser there's an emphasis on its
new add-on structure - for lighter
add-ons just like you have in Chrome in
Safari the new opera has better security
badges next to URLs so you can tell what
kind of site you're on and there are new
super light browser skins here's what's
not so good in Opera 12 hardware
acceleration which was promised in the
beta is still experimental
this lags behind the competition and it
can be manually activated but that's not
ideal Opera has also seated Hardware
browser integration leadership to
Mozilla opera still acts tab sync these
features sound minor but really don't
bode well for operas future one used to
be cutting-edge and is now widely
adopted the other is still cutting-edge
but whereas operas leadership with the
importance of mobile how many people are
actually using Opera Mini and opera
desktop for whatever reason operas
ecosystem is lacking appeal opera is a
modern browser with quite a few modern
features it's got turbo for people on
slower connections it's got pretty good
sync support it's got decent tab
management it's got Do Not Track support
and it's got some very usable mobile
siblings so you can take your opera on
the go however it's hard not to conclude
this most recent update to opera is a
bit of a misstep for the company and its
future just isn't as certain as it was
before with a first look at operative
