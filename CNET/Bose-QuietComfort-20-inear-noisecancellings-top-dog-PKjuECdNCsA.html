Bose QuietComfort 20 the company's first
in-ear headphone with active noise
cancellation which retails for two
hundred ninety nine ninety five why
would you want to spend that kind of
dough on a headphone like this well for
starters they fit securely in your ear
and are very comfortable to wear they
weigh a mere 1.5 ounces and come with a
zippered cloth carrying case that's a
fraction of the size of the case that
comes with the over the year QC 15s
their design is similar to boses mi e2i
headphones which don't Jam into your ear
like many in ear models but rather rest
more loosely in your ears which is why
they're so comfortable to wear the
headphones themselves follow the
company's triport design carving out
some extra space to maximize boses
proprietary acoustic voodoo and adding
two microphones to monitor external
noise as with all such active
noise-cancelling phones that external
din is countered by a mere sound wave
allowing you to enjoy your music in
relative peace the processing chip used
in the QC 20 is a new model that's
exclusive to Bose the quiet cover 20s
come with three sizes of flexible stay
here plus ear tips each of which has
wings to brace itself against the cup of
the outer ear I went with the largest
ear tip which offered me a little bit
tighter seal which helps with the noise
cancellation the lithium-ion battery
pack is embedded in a control pod on the
cord it's rechargeable via standard
micro USB cable and Bose pledges 16 hour
battery life at the joint of the wide
cable leading up to the left and right
earbuds is a smaller second remote for a
controlling volume that one also has a
microphone for making cell phone calls
and a switch for toggling what Bose
calls a wear mode once engaged it
significantly ramps down the noise
cancellation so you can hear the outside
world to chat with a flight attendant
for instance noise cancellation is quite
impressive you don't think that a more
loose fitting here but like this which
lets in as much sound as it does would
work well as an active noise-cancelling
headphone but it does the bose sound
signature tends to be safe by that I
mean it's designed to take everything
you throw at it all types of music well
recorded not so well recorded and make
it sound decent in other words you're
going to find plenty of other 300 hour
headphones that sound better than the QC
20 but I still found myself grabbed
toward using it as an everyday headphone
because it was as comfortable as it was
and managed to Buffalo a lot of that New
York Street noise I also tested it on a
plane ride to Seattle and while I
thought the overall noise reduction on
that QC 15 was slightly better the QC 20
was more comfortable and a small size is
good for sleeping biz you can rest your
head against a pillow or headrest
without having your headphones get in
the way okay now for the downsides and
they all involve the battery pack and
control pod on the cord first off it's a
little awkward to have the battery pack
dangling from your phone it's also worth
noting that the battery isn't
replaceable so once it Peters out and
someday it will you're basically left
with an mi e2i headphone with a dongle
attached to it and lastly if you forget
to turn off the noise cancellation which
I did a few times you'll end up with a
dead battery
overnight anyway despite their drawbacks
I like these headphones a lot their
sound may not measure up to competing
$300 in your headphones they sound good
are very comfortable to wear and offer
excellent noise cancellation if I was a
frequent traveler I definitely be
tempted to pick up a pair of wishing
they cost less as I pulled out my credit
card I'm David Carr Noi thanks for
