earlier this week Geekbench founder John
Poole put up a blog post saying that he
believed that Apple introduced a change
in iOS to limit the performance of
devices depending on the condition of
the battery back in February it was
reported that iPhone 6 and 6s devices
were shutting down even though they had
about 30% of battery life left Apple
acknowledged the problem and said iOS 10
point two point one would reduce the
amount of unexpected shutdowns so what
was the fix a Reddit user by the handle
code of C came up with an explanation
saying that Apple slowed down CPU
performance to prevent iPhones from
shutting down Apple made an official
statement effectively confirming what
pool and qaddafi have thought Apple said
lithium-ion batteries become less
capable of supplying peak current
demands when the cold conditions have a
low battery charge or as they age over
time which can result in the device
unexpectedly shutting down to protect
its electronic components last year we
released a feature for iPhone 6 iPhone
6s and iPhone se to smooth out the
instantaneous peaks only when needed to
prevent the device from unexpectedly
shutting down during these conditions
we've now extended that feature to
iPhone 7 with iOS 11.2 and plan to add
support for other products in the future
so if you feel like your old iPhone is
running slower than it used to it might
not be imagining things are you a fan of
this new feature let us know for more
