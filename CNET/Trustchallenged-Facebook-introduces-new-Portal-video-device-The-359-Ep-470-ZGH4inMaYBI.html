alpha dang I'm rich nueva Facebook has
been having a really lousy year with the
Cascade of privacy blunders amid this
mess the social media giant decided it
was a good idea to come out with a
facebook messenger video chat device
called portal
it's a 10.1 inch smart display that
costs $199 uses Amazon's Alexa and will
compete against the Amazon echo show and
smart displays using Google assistant so
rich is this a terrible idea or just a
really bad one it's it's an idea and
that exists exists hey you know what
give me $200 and I'll come to your house
and I'll just like just stare at you the
whole time and if you want you know I
can also play Spotify for you so
basically what mark is like a break is
saying oh dude yeah but like do you so
this feels like an also-ran product it's
late to market is it is it any different
or better do you think then any of the
other stuff that's out there like the
echo show which doesn't have the same
privacy concerns is Facebook at the
moment or like any of those Google
devices so the pitch from Facebook is
that it's got this technology called
smart camera where it'll like it'll
follow you around
it'll frame the photo oh the the picture
for you and zoom in and out which I I've
seen it in in action and it does work
pretty well but also having software
that follows you around is is kind of
creepy
is the is the pitch mostly like it's for
video chats like like kind of like like
a you know you put on your kitchen
counter or something you do video chats
with Grandma or it's also like a smart
speaker that you'd be able to like you
know turning on and off your connected
lights and that kind of thing too right
it's both so it works with Alexa so if
you have stuff that works with Alexa you
can use it to control your lights I
would give them the benefit of the doubt
here though where they are saying that
all the data that's they
this is different from a Google home or
an Alexa powered speaker where all the
data that's on there is encrypted
locally on the device in the same way
that when you talk to Siri all those
like voice commands and stuff are also
encrypted locally on your phone like
this doesn't go to any like servers or
anything like that so it's not
cloud-based yes anyway so the only way
that any of that data could be hacked is
if somebody like physically went to your
home and like took like the the portal
itself which is pretty interesting
considering that it's only been 10 days
since Facebook announced that it had
been reached with 50 million accounts
affected they were supposed to announce
this around f8 like in May or at least a
quarter and Bloomberg's reports they
were but they had like basically backed
off of because he came rich analytic a
scandal that happened around the same
time so it was let's hold off on that
this time around it was just let's just
go for it it's yeah it's oh it's been 10
days well they need they need to go for
it right because they gotta get this
thing up before the holidays yeah so
either way we have a minute left and two
more stories but let's try to do it
anyway Google is hosting a big product
launch event tomorrow in Manhattan rich
is going to be there the event kicks off
at 11:00 a.m. Eastern and CNET's live
show starts half an hour before then so
check it out
rich what do we expect from this event
what's like the big to-do so the big
thing is they're probably gonna announce
the pixel 3 and pixel 3 XL new
smartphones new smartphones yeah are
they gonna get like do we know they're
gonna be like 2 cameras these are we
also confirmed by the way that these are
going to be the first phones with
Android Pi so that's something but what
about some other devices that we might
expect so some some refreshes of their
of their Google home products we can
probably expect like an you know a
refresh of chromecast's this is kind of
formulaic at this point this is the
third year that they're doing this look
rich you're a Google expert why do they
call it the pixel excel and not the
megapixel hilarious that's a good
question
okay so last last Bloomberg came out
with a story last week claiming a
massive hacking operation by the Chinese
Alfred what
happened over the weekend about this so
on Saturday night the Department of
Homeland Security put out a statement
basically backing up Apple and Amazon
who have both completely denied this
story from Bloomberg they've said
they've you know checked through all
their system they said they've never
gotten any warnings from the government
about this which the Bloomberg story
claims to get rid of any devices that
use super micro motherboards which they
switch Bloomberg story and 17 sources
who spoke with Bloomberg have said were
victims of a supply chain attack from
the Chinese factories that were putting
a small chip in there that could
basically monitor and send activity back
that was being used by Apple and Amazon
so a lot of denials all around about
this we're still waiting to find out
what exactly is going on here but either
way sorry we're out of time if you want
to read more about these stories check
us out on CNN I'm Ben Fox Ruben I'm
Alfred Eng I'm Richard Nava thanks for
listening
this music is for my favorite just for
the method I'm waiting for Brian to
bring down the hammer on me I'm sorry I
was well over I refer what it says I was
I was well over a minute I was almost a
minute and a half over but yeah that's
commonplace these days okay anyway the
more the more you Yammer the more people
get questions for which means the more
fun we can have in the post show so
that's really which is right now we're
really just go to the 359 ironically now
that's 359 cynically Ben okay so let's
go ahead and talk about this Facebook
thing I'm sending your questions and
comments folks right now I just got to
say like Zuckerberg covers his own
camera on his laptop what makes him
think any of us are going to trust him
to put his camera in our home we have an
answer for you there's a couple there's
a cousin spider there's a slider on it
which also the Google smart displays use
as well so the echo show to the best of
my knowledge is the only one that
doesn't have a slider on it because they
say when the cameras off the cameras off
we're not gonna provide you with a
physical slider so is that gonna make
people more comfortable buying this
thing
no no I don't really think so Plus
Facebook Messenger is a free service
that you get on your phone which you
already own why would you pay two
hundred more dollars for that so there's
a lot of questions I have about this if
you couldn't already tell but all right
before we get back into the to the
quintessential criticisms mark dybul
brings up a good point stating that the
portal might be working best at a
professional level be good for video
conference meetings well he's not wrong
but there are other plenty of cheaper
options out there too I feel also I
don't know how many video conference
meetings happen on facebook messenger
but that's true they could from
technical level it's he's got a point if
there's so anywhere to apply this that's
it
well the interesting thing is like I
think the different thing that Facebook
is bringing to the table here is that is
the smart camera technology that
actually follows you so like could they
bring that to phones you know could they
could they bring that to other well they
plan phones though like you're already
following yourself like then you
wouldn't have to move it so what usually
put your phone down and then walking
around or sound like that but then how
would the phone you know what yeah oh
yeah I would have to give the phone like
like spider legs like the camera alone
would walk around yeah but I mean like
like it could could Facebook leverage
this this I mean you might make a little
bit more sense because like they they do
that already like there are there's like
selfie drones that like know like where
you are and they like follow you around
to take like a photo so one one point
from the comment are if there's if
there's an opportunity to be had in
conference rooms I kind of feel like
Amazon is gonna try to get all over that
really really quickly they already
announced Alexa for business last year
and even though that project hasn't
really taken off that much if if they
they know that like this is this is kind
of their opportunity to lose here
they've pushed out more Alexa and echo
devices than anybody else that that's
that's trying to do smart speaker
technology so I think that they would be
very keen to avoid having Facebook take
over that space before they get to it
next question yes all right
diggin it along from DC one four seven I
definitely do not trust that Facebook
portal I feel like I don't need to know
much about it to not trust it we're
going on this is kind of my evaluation
on this is it if Facebook is just
putting tiny little distractions and
band-aids it's getting very political
about this like they have major issues
going on right now with privacy right so
let's distract them it's the equipment
of like going to your boss being like my
paycheck is not good enough my benefits
I am I'm at a bad place in life and the
boss is like here's some candy I would
take the candy
I would I would love to have some candy
yeah so I mean I don't think it's a
distraction I think if anything it
highlights a lot more of their privacy
issues like the things that they're in
trouble for is exactly what people are
worried about with this I mean the same
thing happened so what like two months
after Cambridge analytical the story had
broken about Facebook they come out with
this like hey we have this new dating
service
trust us with your love life now so I
honestly think it's more just so that
they think that like they will get
through all these scandals as counters
like we can't let these issues like
sadhana whether this and it was also in
the pipeline there's there's just
practical sensibilities to this to that
this was a product that was in the
pipeline probably for well over a year
the holidays are coming up they need to
get this thing out there and it's not
like things are so awful at Facebook
that they're gonna decide we're gonna
scrap this thing this is going to be
such an embarrassment for us but I want
to ask you rich because you did the
briefing on this you asked them
specifically about these privacy
concerns related to this product what
didn't they tell you well they said a
little bit of that so they've been
working on this for 18 months when I
asked specifically about somebody saying
like hey this might be cool but it's a
Facebook product and it's not for me
he's their their VP said well people
will have to make their choice hmm they
think that they're there they're
presenting value and people have to make
a choice that is the quote yeah that is
that is the hallmark of a man who's
confident and not want this because they
don't trust you or I think well they'll
have to make a choice okay there was
some good that's acting right
there no thumbs up make a choice on a
scale of 9 to 10 how tone-deaf is
Facebook about all this right now I'm
gonna let rich answer that one III don't
think there you know I think they have
to get the products out that they were
working on I mean I think they do
generally understand that they are in
trouble in terms of user trust but it's
a business and they've got a like and
yeah Zuckerberg said this on stage at f8
he was just like we're gonna fix these
privacy problems but we need to push
forward like you you remember that right
that like they were like we're not gonna
stop being a business that's gonna try
different things and I guess this is a
good example of that but it doesn't feel
like the right note to be hitting at
this point like like you said Brian and
I think that they're also looking at
their numbers and like we and you know I
think they have an understanding that
you know even as these scandals happen
it's just it doesn't really
fact how many people sign up for
Facebook and use Facebook on a daily
basis it's still surprising anime I
spoke with a couple of friends this
weekend where they didn't even know that
the breach had happened Wow from like
ten days ago which is like oh wait that
happened like I don't really use
Facebook anymore but like they still
have a Facebook do they know about
Cambridge analytical though because that
one definitely filtered into my personal
life where like people talked about it I
like they know about it but they know
like at like on a very surface level
yeah well yeah they didn't know the
breach had happened so I mean just
taking a look at I mean Ritchie wrote
about their like earnings from what most
recent quarter aware was like yeah we're
still making a bull or money people are
still using us
yeah these scandals don't really seem to
be doing anything Sam so it's just hey
look we couldn't come out with the
camera although they did fight they did
have their first decline in users in
like Europe and so and that took the
stock down like what 20% yeah so they
are feeling it a little bit but ya know
I'm honestly more surprised that they
haven't like started launching products
for like Instagram like the hardware
thing like based around that it could be
funny you should say that cuz Wilburys
asking if I GTV is actually gonna come
to the portal that would make a lot of
sense yeah I would definitely expect
that time yeah I would too they'd snot
not at launch but they said that they
are looking for Instagram and all five
people that watch IG TV can now watch it
on their portal living room I'll be the
sixth person now that I found out that
it exists just now what do we expect the
response to be from folks like Logitech
Microsoft and Cisco if Facebook starts
impeding on their video conferencing
territory well that's still hypothetical
I'm not sure that that's actually gonna
happen and Facebook still has as we're
talking about during this podcast they
still have a long hill to climb
getting back any sort of like privacy
issues and on the enterprise level for
businesses it's even a greater concern
you know consumer privacy also obviously
very important but enterprise tends to
be even more careful so I
don't think that those guys are really
shaking in their boots quite yet but you
know it may be a year from now things
might look a little differently
a question from Sir enjoy is there a
smart calendar in the market yet I feel
that the table calendar is widely used
prop in homes and offices smart calendar
be better than smart photo frames this
isn't completely connected by kind of
like the idea I definitely prefer his
idea to this stupid video phone thing
honestly a month ago I probably would
have laughed at that but you know like
Amazon came out with a smart wall clock
mm which that really I I still don't
know why but I mean yeah if Amazon can
make a smart wall clock like I wouldn't
be surprised now for like a smart
calendar I'd come out yeah I mean can't
you just do that with a tablet or like
yes yeah you could also make a clock
with a tablet as well so right you know
I don't know I live and die by my
calendar as you guys know it's a hot
mess but it works I would love something
like an oversized tablet to a television
size screen mounted and dedicated to
being able for me to interact with that
in my home on the fly I would honestly
prefer that especially if there was a
stylus or something involving I could
just jot something down as opposed to
like messing around my phone calendar
all the time that we're getting off
topic though I know you enjoy we're
gonna start the business together we're
gonna call it Calendar with without an e
at the end dot IO so I look forward to
that
just just jump on that jump on that URL
before anybody else gets to it kallen
trio calendar EO yeah I love it
so James favors curious about this a
fever I always call you favor and I
apologize I don't know why I do that
James fever it's this the first piece of
hardware from Facebook and what else can
it do you know apart from being like one
of those creepy eye paintings at the
haunted mansion that just follow you
everywhere you go it's a frame it
displays pictures it's not the first
well Alice its Facebook branded device
because that Facebook phone wasn't like
mate
I know HTC and they they were rumored
like for years to be building a throwing
themselves which actually never panned
out but this is the first one should we
expect like this is gonna be the first
of several or I'm I imagine they
probably didn't talk that much about
that but you know every holiday season
before the holiday season we should
anticipate another creepy Facebook
device coming down Halloween dude get
spooky I think so me I think I think if
this goes well you know they can be
doing more they they have this hardware
lab setup so speaking of which yeah when
are they gonna do you know if they're
gonna come out with like the weird like
rain brain connection tell people about
yeah so so this hardware device the
portal is from a division called
building eight at Facebook has it's a
secretive hardware lab and the other
projects that they've been working on
are a brain to computer interface which
will allow you to think thoughts that
you could type with your brain and it'll
send them to a computer and there is
another project that'll allow your skin
to hear through haptics ma'am yeah see
that sounds pretty out there and it's
more interesting to me anyway then yet
another smart display but that's just a
little has just been that's just
whatever further commenting on the
concept of Facebook and their brand and
hardware DC one four seven says I'm
surprised at Facebook didn't create a
new brand for this or just release it
under oculus but I mean it's not really
VR and I really hope it doesn't get VR
because that's the next level creepy
there are snapped at and it is yeah it
it does go under they so a Facebook has
a VR AR division and so oculus and
building eight are under that so it does
filter up to the same place yeah but it
might give people the wrong impression
if it was branded oculus that people
would immediately think that it was a
like specifically a VR device absolutely
is Instagram
probably would have resonated a lot more
people don't like associate breaches and
like privacy issues with Instagram
there's a Graham portal I'm an
influencer I have that in my house yeah
there's there I don't hate this idea you
know why didn't they go with that back
wouldn't they Cambridge analytic a
scandal happened there were so many
people in favor so it's like that's it
I'm done with this I'm leaving Facebook
you can find me on Instagram and it's so
yeah Instagram doesn't really have like
the like branding issue that Facebook
does I honestly think that they would
have been a much better play to put it
there I mean with like you know if
they're trying to promote like IG TV if
they're trying to promote like messenger
and things like messenger doesn't even
have the branding issues that Facebook
has I see what if this is what if it's
the other but if it goes the other way
what if they don't want to mess up the
Instagram that end could be a - yeah
Instagram is pure or don't don't touch
it yeah just let it keep doing its thing
alfrid Instagram is not pure you know
that's true I everything is corrupted
it's the internet we got a few more
minutes to spend on Facebook and then
we're gonna talk pixel real quick and
get out of here from Tapout King 86 when
is the date for the release of this
majiggy
sometime in November that's all we got
mm-hmm and I think pre-orders start
today you're at our site today
pre-orders start today so you're
desperate to buy one you can order it
right now and hit Facebook your money
immediately and if you are please reach
out to us and tell us why if you
actually want to buy this thing email
any of us we're probably right like the
359 at Cena commerce actually I mean we
do in a box I forgot what it was we
don't really use it yeah it's the email
credit at us what is it Richard 9
podcast that's actually to handle real
quick oh here we go how does the
founders of Instagram leaving affect
people's view of Facebook's plans
that's from Jedi Cowboys it's a good
question but I really doubt like we're
talking about the
that people have like a very surface
knowledge of Cambridge analytically
didn't even know about the breach last
week yeah the very smart and
well-connected people that watch the
3:59 obviously are very well aware of
the instagrammed coupon are aware of
like the Instagram founders leaving but
I don't really see how it's gonna have
much of an impact otherwise like outside
of like in the bubble of the tech world
do you agree I agree yeah I mean people
don't really know the inner workings of
this stuff I know a lot of people who
didn't even realize that Facebook owned
Instagram so yeah that's probably not
gonna really influence whether this
product does well or not or what happens
with Instagram
unless Mark Zuckerberg decides to like
start like putting his thumb down a lot
more on Instagram and pushing out a lot
of products that people don't like then
you could argue that yeah this is this
is bad and which is reportedly why a
part of why they left why the founders
left Zuckerberg was kind of tightening
the grip on Instagram and they didn't
unlike that apparently mm-hmm go figure
okay with a couple minutes we have left
let's just prepare ourselves for
tomorrow so we talked we got new phones
coming maybe a new Google chromecast
there's rumors flying around about new
pixel buds I think and I believe hold on
let me see if I can pull it up wasn't
Google home hub yeah so that would be a
smart display yeah that would be another
smart display similar to the portal
there it is yeah well what do we know
about this outside of the rumor that
they might be developing said thing I
mean what's interesting about this is
that Google partnered up with I think
four different companies to create smart
displays using its own technology and
now it wants to come out with its own
which is just so typical of these tech
Titans I mean like Amazon is doing a lot
of the same thing I just wrote a story
about this last week where you know you
bring on partners into your ecosystem
and then develop a piece of hardware
that directly competes with them so
they're doing it also with the pixel so
I don't know we'll see how that one's
actually different and the thing is is
that Google incentivizes people to buy
those products by giving them software
updates and like the newest versions
like before any of those partner devices
but that's not there that's not Google
like holding that back like partner
devices usually just get the updates
late because of like different reasons
at least for the phone like on like
pixels will get the updates sooner
because it's like directly from Google
whereas like a Samsung phone might not
because they have to go through like all
these different things with like Verizon
and then following up like Samsung
making sure the updates are compatible
with our phones and things like that
that's a good point yeah I'd love to
push yeah updates to Galaxy phones mmm
okay that's a very good point and thank
you for telling me about that one other
thing too is is that there was a rumor
flying around that there might be a
third higher end pixel device being
announced which is going to compete
directly with the iPhone 10s I don't
know I'm a little skeptical though
there's gonna be three of them but maybe
that'll yeah it's called the pixel three
dude the Picts oh okay thank you a
megapixel is there a Mac there's no mega
pixel array it's just a 3 megapixel like
the rest of the spec final thoughts in
our anticipation for pixel tomorrow Mike
wolf is curious what our thoughts are on
this home hub and a liver duck at having
a live or die calendar is that something
we'll be interested in I'm not sure what
he's referring to do you guys know what
does a live or die calendar I don't know
I don't know what that is but I know
that I'm guessing he's making fun of me
because I said I live and die by my
count seriously say brush your teeth in
there I forget so that's me and and how
I operate so there's a view into my you
know terrible life decisions
I always alright breathe on my calendar
just to make sure yeah can you schedule
that into your into your Fitbit so
sometimes I don't have time yeah so yeah
speaking of the pixel event tomorrow we
are not going to have a show tomorrow
because we'll be broadcasting from here
so too
at 10:30 a.m. Eastern Ben's gonna be
joining Bridgette and Geoff I think at
the desk
correct and they'll be doing the pre and
post-show will be carrying the stream
and all the unveilings right here at
CNET and on YouTube and on live stream
and on periscope and on Twitch because
why not so hopefully we'll see you all
then we'll be back on Wednesday with a
regular show until then Ben you want to
take us out of here
yes yeah I have to I have to bend down
to see this the 3:59 is available on
itunes toon and stitcher feedburner
google play music google podcasts the
amazon echo and of course cnet.com also
subscribe and join us live weekday
mornings on the scene at YouTube
livestream and twitch channels thanks
everybody for watching really appreciate
it and see you for the Google pixel
stuff tomorrow I'm Alfred aying I'm rich
ever thanks guys
