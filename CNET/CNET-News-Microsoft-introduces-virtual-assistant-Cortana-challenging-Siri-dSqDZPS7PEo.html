new personal digital assistant in town
I'm finding three events saturday at ten
a.m. alex soccer practice at soccer
field at its BUILD conference in san
francisco microsoft introduced cortana
the new windows phone feature which was
inspired by the artificial intelligence
computer from the popular halo video
games we've got intrusion alert sliding
up on multiple jacks Cortana performs
these and other expected tasks like
scheduling reminders but it also
integrates with other apps such as
Facebook and Hulu in useful ways hulu ad
deadbeat to my cue opening hulu plus and
so the app runs the service recognizes
the data adding deadbeat to Q there it
is microsoft says that as Cortana tracks
users searches interests and places
visited it grows smarter and can offer
more tailored suggestions which may
raise privacy concerns you get to decide
what access whether or not she gets to
read your email you are always in
control of what she knows about you the
new voice assistant takes direct aim at
Google now and Apple's Siri Apple is the
company that pioneered the modern
smartphone reinvented it from where
Microsoft and others had done it before
so yeah they're they're catching up to
apple and and to Google but there are
still some areas just the overall app
availability and the whole entertainment
space which they have the xbox to try to
leverage better but they have just begun
to do that consumers will find out just
how useful Cortana is or isn't when the
feature rolls out in the coming weeks in
San Francisco I'm Sumi das cnet.com for
