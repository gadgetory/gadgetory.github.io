learning curve so David Katz Meyer
senior editor here at CNET I'm a
television rookie especially when it
comes to 4k that's we're talking about
right now for those football fans
looking to purchase their new TVs let's
break down the difference simplify
really what is bigger and better about
the 4k situation as opposed to HDTV so
4k TV has four times as many pixels as a
standard HDTV that sounds great but the
problem is the pixels are so small
they're really not going to give you
much of a difference the other issue
with 4k is there really no broadcast in
4k there's no football broadcast for
example it's really no content at all in
4k so you think that 4k isn't worth the
extra money is it though what can you
watch in 4k oh man we are like this you
you but the thing is with 4k TVs these
days they're actually getting a lot less
expensive so TV manufacturers are
putting their best picture quality
features into 4k TVs so whether or not
you're going to be able to see the
difference with the resolution the
pictures generally going to be better on
these 4k TVs so I say if you're in this
range for a large TV you're going to be
plunking down a couple grand on a
television definitely go for K is there
gonna be a time where we see 4k content
coming on television broadcasts it's
going to be a few years because they
just switched over all the trucks all
the production all the cameras to HD
right another has to basically scrap all
that stuff and start again with 4k 4k
takes a lot more bandwidth it's just a
lot more difficult to get out the door
so the end of the day it's going to be a
long time before especially we see live
4k sports broadcast I mean I have a hard
enough time dealing with how unforgiving
HD TV is so I'm not sure I want to deal
with 4k so if I want to buy a non 4k TV
is that just the way to go if you want
to save money absolutely so the non 4k
TVs are kind of in the budget bin this
year and you know you're going to get a
really good picture you're going to get
all the resolution of the broadcast but
they're really you're not going to get
as good of a picture as most the 4k TVs
out there so if you're on a tight budget
go with standard 1080p all right this is
a new concept but David Katz Meyer is
here to explain it keep it right here so
you can keep watching our whole series
on television survive so check them out
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
