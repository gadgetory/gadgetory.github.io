cnet.com this is a quick look at the
canon pixma mg 32 20 multifunction
printer this one sits at the lower end
of canons photo printing line so don't
expect all the extra features you
normally see in pricier units like an
auto document feeder or a fancy touch
display still the company gives you a
good amount of support for 80 bucks
that's including canons print copy and
scan functions to start you can connect
the printer using one of three ways a
hardwired USB cord network connectivity
through Ethernet and 802 dot 11 B G and
Wireless you can also print photos
on-the-go from your iOS device using
canons ie PP application the control
panel on top of the printer is pretty
standard though like I said you can't
preview the photos before you print
instead to save you money you get a two
line LCD screen instead and you probably
won't want to print out too many photos
anyway because when I flip down this
panel here that Canon calls fast front
you'll see that there are actually only
two cartridges one for color and one for
black that means your photo printing
quality will have limited color output
it's great for quick snapshots or
Christmas cards but keep in mind that
the more photos you print the more money
you're going to spend in the long run on
cartridge refills so Canon is also
pretty generous with the extra software
you get with the package creatives with
Canon HD video cameras can use the HD
movie print application to pull HD
snapshots and the software makes it
really simple to capture a group of 10
frames to choose from you can also edit
images to reduce noise and it's
definitely a lot easier than trying to
get that perfect shot in one try so you
can check out my full review on this
printer on cnn.com
that includes more details a product
tour and performance scores but that's
gonna do it here for me I'm Justin you
you just took a first look at the canon
pixma mg 3220 multi-function printer
