in the BMW booth now one thing we're
seeing here at the show a very new trend
is the integration of wearable tech with
cars so in my hand here i have a samsung
galaxy gear this is running BMWs i
remote app this works with the BMW i3
and the i ate all the electric cars that
they're going to be coming out with it
shows you things like how much charge
you have in the car and you can also
control the car you can do things like
turn on the air conditioning ahead of
time honk the horn and all that but now
this samsung galaxy also works with the
galaxy gear watch BMW is built an app
this is sort of a prototype ran it right
now but this app on this watch will do
many of the same things you get on the
phone so I can actually see the charge
status of the car right now on the front
of the watch and do some other things I
can actually do some controls of the car
if I slide to the side I can turn on the
air conditioning I can honk the horn do
a few other things unlock it stuff like
that I can also if I go to the other
side I can find my list of contacts and
I can pull up a list of content or any
of my contacts from the phone bring it
up on the watch push it and send it as
an address to the car so they'll go into
the cars navigation system do that all
from the watch there's also voice
command on this watch as well so if I
click the button on the side twice here
I go into voice command mode I can say
something like BMW say hello and that
will make the car hawk its horn so maybe
if I'm in a parking lot or something i
can find my car this watch is still a
prototype BMW will definitely be
releasing this app for the phone with
the i3 car when it comes out this year
the watch not yet but maybe in the
future I'm win Cunningham here at CES
2014
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
