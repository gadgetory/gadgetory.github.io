six and a new camera called fusion to
make you excited about 360 video we'll
get to that soon last year's hero 5
added voice controls waterproofing and
better video quality to the action
camera so what's new this time around
first it's frame rates the new processor
lets the hero 6 take 4k video at 60
frames a second and slow-motion 1080p
video at 240 frames a second but some
phones shoot super slow-mo anyway so why
would you use a GoPro CEO Nick Woodman
explains a phone is great for filming
somebody else or something else
happening me filming you a GoPro is
great for me filming me or me filming us
GoPro is also claiming improved dynamic
range better low-light performance and
an improved image stabilization feature
that gives you a gimbal like effect so
to test this out I took two Hero 6s
side-by-side for a bit of a run and a
stroll and I had one with image
stabilization turned off and one with
image stabilization turned on so you can
see them side-by-side and see if there's
an improvement another new feature is
touch zoom so you just give a quick
double tap on the screen and then you
get this zoom slider on the side it
allows you to just slightly zoom in on
your subject now it's not too different
from what you are already able to do it
is a digital zoom so you're cropping in
on the scene as for other specs the hero
6 is still waterproof to 10 meters still
has voice control so you can do things
like this GoPro take a photo
and it still has GPS to track your
location and overlay telemetry data on
your shots so we've been shooting since
about 10:00 a.m. and it's almost 1:00
p.m. now and I'm down to 30 percent
battery shooting 4k 30 in 60 frames a
second but still that's like only two
hours of intermittent shooting and my
batteries let's spin back 360 degrees to
the fusion a pocket-sized camera that
makes 5.2 case spherical stabilized
video now most people don't watch 360
video as it was shot so the neat over
capture feature lets you reframe footage
into a regular 1080p video I can kind of
change the perspective I want to export
this video in and then I just tap this
button to start the capture process and
I can even manipulate the frame while
I'm effectively filming the second time
and remember comma the GoPro drone it
now has a follow-me mode but it only
follows the person with the controller
rather than another subject GoPros got a
camera for just about everyone at lots
of different price points the hero 6 is
$100 more than the Hero 5 so do you need
to upgrade if we're talking about an
older gentle a Hero 3 or a hero 4 yes
it's definitely worth the upgrade Hero 5
it gets a little bit more iffy simply
because it's not a huge bump in features
or specs or anything like that GoPro is
the big name in
cameras by adding better stabilization
and improved resolution GoPro is hoping
the six is still the hero of the story</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
