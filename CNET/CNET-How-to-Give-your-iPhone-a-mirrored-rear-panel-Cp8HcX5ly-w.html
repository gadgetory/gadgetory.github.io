even though tearing opened my iPhone
makes me really really nervous
this mod is worth it there aren't many
ways to customize the hardware of your
iPhone so replacing the back panel has
become a really popular trick there are
transparent back panels glowing Apple
logo mods or replacement back plates for
if your back cover has become really
scratched but today I'll be replacing my
back plate with a mirror it's not a
vanity thing mostly just a way for me to
figure out if I have stuff stuck in my
teeth or a hair sticking out in the
wrong place
after all the front-facing camera only
goes so far so to get started you'll
need two things a replacement panel of
your choice and a screwdriver if you
have an older iPhone 4 you'll need a
Phillips screwdriver but if you have one
of the newer iPhones you'll need a
pentalobe screwdriver which matches
these star-shaped screws right here I
got mine from I fixed it but you can get
them elsewhere around the web to get
started turn your phone on silent and
turn it off to open up the case remove
these two screws at the bottom here make
sure to put these little screws
somewhere safe since they can roll away
pretty easily now push up on the
backplate it should move about two
millimeters and you'll be able to remove
it in case you were ever wondering what
the inside the guts of your iPhone looks
like here it is when you're done poking
around grab your new backplate and slide
it on make sure it snaps in place and
that all the edges are even now put the
two screws back in and tighten them down
gently
the pentalobe screws can be easily
stripped so be careful and now my back
plate mirror is in place and it was
super simple now with my mirror I can
sneak a quick look plus now I know how
to replace my backplate with really cool
alternatives but before
go and do this you have to know two
things this may or may not void your
warranty and if you ever need to take
your iPhone in for repair there's no
telling how the Genius Bar guy will
react so be ready to put your old
backplate back on your phone before you
go into the Apple store if you have any
questions about this process you can
tweet me or subscribe to my Facebook
