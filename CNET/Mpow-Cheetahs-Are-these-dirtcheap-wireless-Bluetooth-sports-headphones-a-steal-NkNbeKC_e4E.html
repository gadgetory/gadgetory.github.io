headset it is a budget sports model that
you can get online for around thirty six
dollars yes that's right thirty-six
dollars so it really is an inexpensive
model straight out of China I'm David
Carr Noy and I'm looking at another
bluetooth headphone it's always
interesting to try to find really good
values out there so I'm taking a look at
this mpow it does feel a little bit
cheap it's got a lot of plastic by the
same token it does seem sturdy enough
which is a weird combination but the
build quality seems to be okay and
surprisingly left the sound isn't too
bad either
this does sound like a lot of Bluetooth
headphones out there that cost a little
bit more money it's a $75 to $100 so
it's not half bad sounding it's a
Bluetooth 4.0 headset I'm supposed to
have apt x4 phones that support it
that's supposed to make the Bluetooth
sound better it's really hard to tell
with a lot of stuff and it also gets
about five hours of battery life that's
not great but obviously for workouts and
stuff it'll be fine it takes about two
hours to charge really my only serious
issue with it is the fit it's supposed
to really clamp on your head not move
around while you're doing something the
only problem I had with it was with the
earbuds that came with it I could not
get a really secure fit once I'd kept
falling out so what I did was I found a
little bit longer ear tip the king with
another headphone and that actually
worked well for me so empower if you're
listening to this you should really
probably add another ear tip that is a
little bit longer so people like me who
have a little bit smaller heads can get
a more secure fit the other small issue
worth mentioning is that this does have
a built in microphone so you can't take
cell phone calls there's a call answer
end button as well as volume controls on
the earpiece that are easily accessible
I wouldn't say the call quality was
great with this headphone so I wouldn't
count on this for being a great headset
for taking calls in the final analysis
what it really boils down to is how
these headphones will fit for
you if you do get a secure fit you will
actually like them a lot if you don't
you will not like them I'm David Carr
noise and that's the M pal
stereo Bluetooth sports headset thanks
