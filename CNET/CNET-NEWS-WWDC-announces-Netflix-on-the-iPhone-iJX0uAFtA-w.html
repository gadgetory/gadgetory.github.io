application for the iPhone coming this
summer for free and for an early look at
the application my colleague John Chang
qu d thank you read now starting this
summer you're going to get your full
netflix experience right on your iPhone
the same service you get in your HDTV
your laptop and on your iPad I'm going
to show you how it's going to work now
you could start a film on your big
screen TV and pick up right from where
you left off on your iPhone whenever you
like you can resume your current movie
from the top of our home screen now as
you can see i also get personalized
recommendations front and center netflix
knows what I like based on my tastes and
my viewing history for example read you
can see that i enjoy gritty crime movies
no job we were going to try to keep it
clean today all right well then maybe it
would be safer to show off the fact that
you can access all of Netflix's movie
and television genres your complete
instant queue or you can search through
netflix his entire streaming library for
movies and television shows you'd like
to watch John now let's try to show the
search off there's a great little
documentary I saw at Sundance art and
copy it's kind of a counterpoint to Mad
Men want to look that up alrighty great
well we've got it a miracle shocking
well i'm going to add it to my instant
queue and i'm going to check it out
tonight now just like on the ipad on the
iphone netflix is taking advantage of
apples HTTP adaptive bitrate streaming
technology to optimize our playback over
Wi-Fi and over 3g as well and in fact
Apple's technology allows us to
seamlessly switch between networks so
you're going to get a great playback
experience even when you're on the go
thank you John and thank you to everyone
Netflix iphone application this summer
for free
you</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
