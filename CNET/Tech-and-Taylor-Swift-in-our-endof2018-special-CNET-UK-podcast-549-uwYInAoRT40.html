well the answer is of course yes have so
I think we should open this we can't go
on with a festive podcast without some
festive oh wait I do a podcast we are
still in today then we're gonna talk
about the things that we've enjoyed this
year rich that is exactly what we're
going to talk about on the podcast today
and you know that's because we've
already had this conversation so
hopefully you've been digging through
that your year and then finding out what
it is that you want to talk about Kati I
hope has been doing the same and I
certainly have you know what don't get
Prosecco in the might take a glass I'm
going to take a glass and Katie take a
glass Oh J would you like a glass would
producer J like a glass of a second you
know classy they have 100 mil 125
millings on them that's how classy they
said I'm not old enough to have real
glass they said I'll only hurt myself
well the real glass has been used in
podcast or two always leads to violence
it's probably a good thing
that we the podcast is is just using
fake glass so your that with you so
you're right in terms of the podcast
we're going to be having a look through
the year we've got everything from
phones that I've been looking at we've
got some of Katy's top news features of
the year and this isn't news heavy this
isn't timely so this week we're not
doing for example the big oh-two
data outage of last week which was as we
all know a pain in lots of people's and
behind yes including mine I got lost
oh you are o - I was on a bus and I was
just going to Waterloo where I go to you
on a regular basis yeah I managed to get
lost I had no idea how I supposed to get
there I mean I knew how to get there but
I don't you didn't know the quickest way
to get interestingly nor will the buses
because TF ELLs transport network runs
on the back of OT s network so the
Buster's were all they all could
obviously run but they couldn't give
their live location so in terms of
saying affects everyone I am going to
kick off my year in 2018 I talked about
some phones if you don't mind as we
always know it's the year is basically a
battle between Apple and Samsung and
still being the case this year do you
agree rich how are those which ones you
want parmesan appreciate so ample of
course earlier in in autumn launched the
excess range of phones
there's nothing succeeds like excess of
a-10s exactly they didn't really push
boundaries like the 10 did last year
okay so there's a lot of a lot of talk
about Apple sort of again losing some of
the birds though the sales weren't quite
as exciting as they expected with the
original with their with the ten before
but Samsung hasn't had a great year of
it either the S know saying should have
stepped in and capitalized this just
swooped in so bond with us yeah with yes
90 said that basically was the same
phone as the s8 from the year before and
there was only I had a couple of camera
tweaks which really made any difference
than
it wasn't an exciting phone and the
consumers have agreed like the sales
simply haven't been very exciting for
the s9 v s9 + Samsung has admitted in
its company calls in its in its finance
calls that it simply hasn't done as well
as it should have and that they need to
do something a bit more again and we
don't have exact sales figures for this
and the same was with the no because
they launched the note night and but no
eight did okay but that was off the back
of the note sevens explosives lost yeah
so it's interesting that they have that
both companies have kind of gone with a
very safe bet they haven't tried to push
the boundaries of course and please do
correct me if I'm wrong here but from
what I understand well the the it's
actually not apples most expensive phone
that's been its big seller this year
that's right it's the it's the the the
iPhone 10 R which was introduced as a
kind of a sort of a cheaper version it's
like the iPhone 5c when they did the
plastic 5c unlike the 5c it's not
plastic it's still it's still a really
expensive phone and you know it's got
pretty much all of the features that you
could wish for but without just some of
those little extras that are really
pushing the price up at the top end so
and I think yeah from what I understand
you know they've had to kind of ramp up
production because the demand for that
for that particular phone is being
higher than they yeah I thought it would
be absolutely and I think the safe
approach that both US companies have
taken is what's mendon this year is when
hallway Chinese band Huawei has stormed
in
yeah and it's now the second biggest
smartphone maker in the world
what so it's really like there's been a
big shift in kind of where people are
really buying their devices and that I
think has been kind of thing of 2018
while we've got what we always assumed
to be the most elite brands playing it
safe not really doing anything not
pushing the boundaries but still
charging a super-high amount you've got
Huawei coming in and really building on
what it's been doing with being a bit
more affordable and pushing those
technologies further because the the
mate 20 Pro
which I reviewed isn't brilliant phone
it's really really good really high-end
it's got cool tech like this in screen
fingerprint scanner which was at the
time was the first phone that we saw
this on it's got this really amazing
camera it looks great and it's a good
couple of hundred pounds cheaper than
it's Apple equivalent so people are
looking at these phones thinking well
woah is offering a more exciting phone
for a better price yeah and they're
going towards quoi way it's the same
reason why oneplus has been going from
strength to strength over the last
couple of years and in fact to the
extent where they are pushing out so
they have announced actually last week
that they are going to be next year
launching the first 5g smartphone of a
UK in partnership with EE
so when 5g launches in the UK they will
be 1 plus yep a4 wants affordable you
know cheap but decent also kind of niche
with a kind of cult following not really
that well-known yeah very much like a
cul a cult brand is now gonna be the
launch brand for 5g in the UK which
things have really really changed in the
industry yeah we would not have been
having this conversation at the end of
2017 yeah I would do remember like years
now we were talking about upstart brands
I mean it's pretty good about 10 years
when we were talking about oneplus and
away and yeah like wonder why fox and a
bunch of other people have formed by the
wayside but it is good to see like the
market diversifying a bit so it's not
just this Apple Samsung monopoly well
also the the one thing that I've
discovered as well and my talking to
analysts about the arrival of 5g in
Europe is there's always a kind of
whenever there's a new generation of
mobile technology there is a there's a
reshuffle at the top so the the top
brands from the generation before
usually kind of fall from grace little
bit there's a bit of a everyone has to
kind of fight to reestablish they're
shorting a little bit and you know we
saw that when we went from 3G to 4G in
particular in the case of HTC and which
now is you know the kind of during the
3G era kind of rose to be maybe number
three and thank you and the smart makers
and now
yeah and and you know we expect this is
why for companies like oneplus and you
know some of the other Chinese companies
Xiaomi
so they are seeking to establish
dominance in 5g early so that because
they know that they've got everything to
play for at this point in time when
there's gonna be a reshuffle and if they
can but now is the time for them to
really get absolution point so it's
interesting is it thoughtful and
insightful points that might be ruined
if you are listening to the audio only
version katie is wearing a giant wedge
of Swiss cheese so that's that's
interesting but I have a question dawn
can I have a macaroon please a macaroon
yeah that's the how how was that
macaroon I mean I'm used to french
french maid I would say that this is a
bit it's not quite light enough okay
quite AM stodgy in the sense Nagi more
brittle and outer layer and with just a
slight chew so I don't have a girl I
need to be tuning into the Great British
Bake Off podcast technology was a dead
end so we just thought baking it one
nice Baker yeah I don't know we like a
macaroon this one pretty good I'm gonna
save that on on my computer until later
so that's kind of what's been going on
in the year but it doesn't mean that
going into 2019 we've actually got a
hell of a lot to be excited about really
because obviously the year launches with
CES and Katy you're going out to CES are
there any sort of big major things that
you're expecting so far or is it a bit
too early to tell looks like it's a bit
too early to tell or is it that you're
eating another ask you a question you've
been prepared for or ask you a question
but while you've got a mouthful of food
and either way just just just ply one
it's not too early to to think about
this at all so we're you know we're
expecting to see
a kind of continuation of some of the
themes that we've seen over the past few
years for example greater integration
with voiced assistants like Alexa and
Google assistant so more smart home I
thinks about home again is gonna be a
really big thing this year it's
traditionally not a big show for for
mobile but given that it is such a an
important year with thee as we just
talked about the advent of 5g we are
expecting to see some announcements in
that area
they'll be like the usual kind of slew
of TVs and laptops and some kind of you
know some things in the audio section as
well and I personally am really excited
about some of the robotics are gonna be
on show there it's always a really cool
show to see some robotics some often
concepts but also we're starting to see
the emergence of real kind of home
robots we've had AI bow so you're
realizing I bones in you exactly and for
thousands of dollars
you haven't one of our colleagues in New
York Bridget carriers written an amazing
review about what it was like to live
for a week with either with her with her
daughter and that they put together a
really cute video with them kind of
unboxing I bow and then living with him
introducing I bow to and real dog and so
that that was really cute so I'm really
hoping that we're going to see some kind
of interesting things along those lines
we're also there the other things that
are going to be big topics I think that
they're really looking at smart cities
and they're also going to be having a
new section this year on travel
technology which I'm going to be looking
at and hopefully we'll see some cool
kind of concepts coming out of that -
cool um so that's in the beginning of
January and of course we've got Mobile
World Congress at the end of Feb and
that's where we're definitely gonna see
a lot talk about 5g we're gonna see a
lot of 5g handsets coming out because if
1 plus I've got a fuzzy handset you can
bet that most other companies will do we
do know that we're not going to see a
knife a 5v iPhone next year but I
strongly suspect that Samsung's new
flagship the Galaxy S 10 and will be 5g
and we will see like 5g is obviously
going to be a big topic
for the show so it's exciting that we
are gonna have that logic in the UK it's
still a little unclear on what exactly
it's going to mean because it's not just
that 5g is not just the case that you're
just going to have faster data speeds on
your phone and then that's it it's about
having more bandwidth for more connected
devices like the Internet of Things and
that sort of thing and it's still not
exactly clear how different companies
are going to utilize that so I think
it's gonna be exciting to kind of see
how the launch goes and sort of what
what comes up about that but that's
that's as much I kind of want to go into
on the gadgets side of the show
obviously we've had a great year in
gaming as well I wanted to mention and
big highlight obviously is Red Dead
Redemption to which last night actually
finally finished the game guys taking me
a long time did you think at one point
that you finished it turns out you
really have not finished it keeps on
going and also has the longest credit
sequence in the world as well like have
I definitely finished Oh is there a bit
more yeah I wasn't but I as a phenomenal
game really is kind of at the moment the
absolute and the cutting edge of what
gaming can do at the moment and there
has been some things I loved before that
Forza horizon for I also loved doing my
own Forza horizon road trip around the
UK and which is a feature you can go and
read I'll put a link in the show notes
and it's been good but there's been a
lot of games that I haven't been too
fussed about far cry 5 was was was fine
visually it looked great but it was so
far it was busy from what you were
hoping for hole rich it certainly was
shadow of a Tomb Raider again very mad
was it was pretty much the same game as
before except not quite exactly it was
also just really black just really just
not very interesting yeah which which
which is a shame because it's a it's a
franchise that I think it could lend
itself well to a really good film yeah
but we'll come on to that because we
were we're gonna pick your brains about
all film things for the year we're not
only we're gonna come to you see you're
the highlight of the show so we're
saving you for therefore the big rousing
did you name him I always I don't like
the humanize aspect of it thank you okay
try shoot I asked I asked as all I said
all to go through our catalogue of the
year and kind of pick a feature that is
particularly special to you and for me
this is a feature that actually has just
gone live this week although really I
probably stolen this from you but you
can say this as well because it's one
that Katie and I worked on together
where we wanted to find out what hashtag
van life is really all about what it's
like to do a big campervan road trip and
we took a VW camper 2600 miles all
around Europe going to these amazing
locations on these amazing roads to see
what really was involved yeah and I
think it was pretty good we didn't break
down big millennial travel trends - oh
really
and what it is is it's this kind of
taking the kind of nomad lifestyles for
the next level which obviously has been
enabled by digital you know online life
and you see increasingly people kind of
just going off and doing their own thing
and working and living as they want and
yes yeah this is sort of taking it to
the next level often when people do this
they don't as Andy and I do kind of take
yourself off the shelf and they they
often buy a ban and renovator
take it out and we were and we also I
mean in more ways than one because it's
as we said it's a big Instagram trend
now a lot of the pictures that you see
on Instagram are you only really
realized when you actually kind of get
out on the road how much work it takes
to stage some of these same photos where
the vans are like decked out in fairy
lights with you know these kind of
people lying looking beautiful which is
very it's very hard to do you don't look
don't tend to look your best when you're
traveling in a van and you know kind of
firm these these beautiful in these
beautiful locations and and we kind of
went to find out sort of
what you know what the reality of it was
like whether it was or whether it was
this kind of amazing sort of fantasy
that you know is an M viewable state of
living and I mean what we found was that
when it came to the the freedom that it
gave us and the ability to be
spontaneous it was really great but you
know there were other things about the
lifestyle that you don't see on
Instagram like the majority of the time
you know especially if you're traveling
through a country where you can't just
well camp anywhere I love a lot of
countries in Europe have those laws and
you end up parked up you know in a kind
of massive caravan park with you know
people who are sort of 30 years older
than you 40 lots of fans around by
pensioner made their home that's the
summer and and it's quite noisy and it's
very it's not not necessarily that
picture right a lot of people do just
illegally wild camp anyway because it's
it's we were told that it it's off it's
the case in Slovenia certainly I believe
that the fines that you're likely to get
from wild camping would actually be less
than you'd pay to camp for a night in a
camping place okay anyway so a lot
people will do that but the problem is
is though when we're there writing for
CBS we can't really justify really that
we'd need to be we you know we have to
be careful and we can't possibly say to
encourage any of our listeners to do
that but some people do and that's where
they get some of that and focus and also
the as I mentioned the justone it's is
very hard to kind of you know sometimes
you do have to go a couple of days
without having a shower because you know
you're not somewhere where there are
facilities it's hard to kind of like
look amazing and like feel that you're
like your best and like the van gets
grubby because you all you know it might
be raining it might be muddy right being
out and about and then you get in and
it's hard to kind of keep keep it free
of mud and keep it tidy and keep it
clean like this it's kind of hard work
to do that so some of the some of the
way that it's portrayed is really very
unrealistic and you know you have
be the kind of person that's willing to
put up with a certain amount of
discomfort I think in man life exposed
yeah I think that for us what we found
is that basically it's it was great it
wasn't such an amazing holiday an
amazing two weeks and but but we
wouldn't want to live us it was work but
we wouldn't want to live in one like we
I'd love to have one of the one with
campus parked outside my house ready so
if I just you know if you finished work
on a Friday you can hop in your best
getaway
oh yeah well it's like if you want to
you finish work on a fright on a Friday
you get home and you can just drive
straight up to like you know into the
the heart of Wales and the mountains yes
death Guildford Woking just want to get
away - want to get away - stop it yes
I'll have more please but it's not
something that the whole the idea of
like buying this and living and that
becomes your life you perpetually travel
there not I just don't think you'd be
comfortable enough I certainly couldn't
do it but it's but it is an amazing
holiday and definite something you
consider okay if that's you can rent one
yeah and you can you know you can buy
the vans
pre-made you know the VW California
ocean we made we had you know yeah not a
flat back comfort of two wheels our
standards if you want to add extra then
you can be rich and so yeah there's mine
there's my thing it's in the current if
you've seen at magazine which is
available excuse me in the US or its
online at sina.com you can I'll link to
in the show notes I stay in their life
it's battery Katie hello tell us about
your 2018 okay and I mean I've had a
great 2018 you know that's good to know
I've been I've been writing about kind
of things that are on my beats so like
news and features about tech in Europe
I've been writing some more some some
culture stuff with
it's been really fun and I've also been
kind of going a little bit off piste as
well at times I'm writing about stuff
just interests me but I thought I'd just
pick out a few different things done
with on the more kind of serious side
and one story that's really been
interesting me from a UK perspective to
share ISM there's obviously been this
huge data scandal with Facebook in
Cambridge analytic er and and the one
aspect of it that's really kind of got
me hooked is this kind of ongoing battle
that we've got weird between Parliament
in the UK and Mark Zuckerberg where they
really want him to come and testify and
talk to talk to them about what went
wrong and what happened
and he's like no I don't want to come
and talk to you yeah UK who obviously
he's Congress in the US and he's also
been to the European Parliament it's
like a lot of US companies it just
doesn't really give a crap about the UK
I mean the thing is so I spoke to
earlier this year to the politician
who's kind of really been pushing for
him to come to the UK damien collins no
relation who is he's the chair of the
Digital Culture Media and Sport
Committee and he's been leading that
Parliament's fake news inquiry and he
you know he gave a number of really good
reasons why why Zuckerberg should come
to the UK I'm including you know the
fact that a lot of the things that
happened during the scandal you know
Cambridge on oolitic as a company is
based here and Alexander Cogan who was
the the academic who harvested the data
and it's based was based at Cambridge
University and and you know he it also
involves the data of a lot of UK
citizens and now Facebook has sent I
think at least three people and to
answer questions in Parliament and none
of whom have proved satisfactory have
been able to give the committee the
answers that they want it's quite
telling isn't it that said that
Zuckerberg won't come to the UK which
seems to be one of the committee's
that's really giving people a hard time
yeah
and he's gone to Congress and he's just
had some like 90 year old senators
asking
when their email isn't working yeah and
you know so I mean that there's been
some have been some people doing good
working yeah US and Europe how many but
but but yeah it does seem like he's kind
of ducking the talking issue absolutely
and what one thing that they've done as
well is that they've said that if Mark
Zuckerberg comes to the UK for any
reason that Parliament may issue him
with a formal summons which means that
they're gonna say an arrest warrant okay
I mean it's effectively it's not an
arrest warrant but they send they send
the sergeant-at-arms who is the man in
the tights with the thing every shoulder
from Parliament to kind of go and fetch
him effectively so if he comes to the UK
for any reason any reason at all holiday
work they dragged him through the
streets about the ancient laws of
Parliament will finally be applied to
Mark Zuckerberg they put him in stocks
and in the middle of bank in that five
ways crossroads bit but I find this
standoff really fascinating and it
doesn't look like it's gonna it's been
going on now since March maybe and when
the scandal broke in fact I think that
they'd ask Mark Zuckerberg ahead of the
scandal to come and talk because this
inquiry that they were doing has been
open since last year and so it's been
going on for ages than it has there's no
sign of it stopping anytime soon and
it's just a kind of it's like a battle
of wills between them and they're both
being incredibly stubborn about it and
I'm just curious to see how it's going
to turn out next year because they keep
asking him to come on facebook Messenger
might attend so what else what else
would be knowing also sort of
tangentially involves Zuckerberg this
year is and the kind of the rise of
French tech he says he eats more of his
macaron
McCarron I think your baby and speaking
of macarons this whole kind of
revolution
Leibler tech revolution in France and
has come as a result of their president
email Emmanuel macron who is really kind
of hot on the Digital Agenda and he kind
of he's he's done a number of different
things this year like he's kind of
started this I don't know whether to
call a treaty I think the official word
for it's a declaration where he's it's
kind of tech leaders and governments
from across the world coming together to
sign and this kind of document that says
that they're gonna fight terrorism
online and cyberattacks and all this
kind of stuff and he's kind of
spearheaded this and it was kind of
something that he did around the Paris
piece for him he also held a big
tech4good summit in Paris in May and
he's been the first person who's managed
to do this where he's got tech CEOs from
like IBM Microsoft Facebook uber like or
Cisco all of these massive tech
companies in one place to talk about the
problems of the Internet and for some
reason he is just he has been so hot on
this issue and so such a kind of so
shown kind of a real leadership he's
actually managed to persuade them all so
like leave America leave Silicon Valley
and come and have this conversation with
him which is quite impressive and I went
to and I got the best wine yeah he
offered them a cheese plate come on over
we've got unpasteurized cheese and then
they come over and they expect some
cheese and a man in tights comes up and
once on the back of the head drags them
off to the chambers actually yeah in
fact I've just heard a piece it's gone
live today on CNET some big story of
today which is about all of the ways in
which Europe's impacted Silicon Valley
share from GDP our antitrust Cambridge
analytic her and some of this stuff to
do with France as well but like he's
also he's not he's not giving you know
he's not kind of k'tau into them and
sort of sucking up to them micron he's
also he's been quite harsh on them and
you know insisting upon more regulation
and saying that regardless of cuz the EU
is still discussing whether it's gonna
be taxing these companies more he said
screw you I'm gonna tax the tech
companies anyone regardless next year so
they'll be taxed in France so yeah I
just found that a kind of real
interesting sort of trend that I've been
watching throughout the year
tell us about Taylor Swift yeah okay I
mean I don't need to be asked twice to
talk about Taylor Swift tells about
Taylor Swift but but now you have asked
well I definitely will tell you and so
yeah Taylor surfs had a really
interesting year in terms of tech nology
she had a great year just generally
musically winning a bunch of Awards but
she well then Taylor will drink to that
yes but she's also you know she's she
had that one of the big news stories of
the last few weeks was that she struck
this deal with this new record deal with
Universal Music Group that means that
she's and one of the kind of caveats
that that deals we discussed in the
podcast a few weeks ago actually is that
if Universal share sells it shares and
Spotify that it will have to kind of
hand out the the profits that it makes
from those shares to all of its artists
that was one of the things that she
wanted front incentive written into her
contract she's also she's kind of trying
to wield her influence I would say in
terms of she's also she after she posted
on Instagram ahead of the midterms they
about her about who she was voting for
in the midterms and encouraging people
to get out there and votes she they saw
a huge spike in voter registration but
in her home state of Tennessee and where
she's a registered voter but also all
over the US which really kind of you
know it was a one of those big stories
of the year that showed the power of
social media and what happens when and
speaking of social media I also did a
big feature on her use of social media
this year which was kind of looking into
the way in which she reaches out to fans
online and interacts with fans online
and then uses turns those interactions
into real life encounters so she shield
she'll find the people work she stalks
her own fans and you know she'll she'll
if she sees someone that she likes what
she sees something that she finds funny
she'll take screenshots and sort of get
them she'll invite them to her something
that she wants she has turned fans
houses and find out where they lived and
just turned up and given them things as
well which if they did that to her she
probably wouldn't be too happy so so you
had a good you've had a great Taylor
year those links in there is also
resulting than you meeting but more
excitingly when you met Tim berners-lee
I wouldn't say more exciting and you
know a bigger fan of his I maybe work
his later single quite so strong I mean
I think we all Sir Tim berners-lee a lot
you know not not in any kind of monetary
legal sense I've got his emails I just
I'm not biting without him we couldn't
be sitting here wearing these hats
having this conversation right now
yeah we've all got a lot of thank
berners-lee so yes I interviewed Sir Tim
berners-lee at web summits in November I
was there in Lisbon for around a month
so I think around a month around a week
and the I kind of kicked off my I
literally landed in Lisbon jumped in a
taxi and headed straight over to the
first thing that I did was interview Sir
Tim which has been a real something to
do for ages and we talked we talked a
lot about something that he actually
launched later that day at at website
which is something that he's calling the
contract the contract for the web and
it's a kind of it's it's his vision and
for bringing the whole of the world
online and also protecting the freedom
of existing Internet users and future
Internet users as well I can't give a
contract on something that's alright
that's you're already on though you
signed at the beginning as how it works
thanks for the legal he's wearing the
traditional lawyer outfit yet strange
that he is not a legal authority so
don't take legal advice from this man if
you ever see him rooting around in your
bins so yes lovely chat and he was you
know I think he recognizes that that the
internet isn't perhaps know as this kind
of positive a place as it always could
be or should be and he he said to me in
the interview and that the contract it
to a certain extent paints a picture of
the world in which is is better than
this one and it says that we can do
better than what we have now so it's
kind of it's this of hopeful yeah that
sounds good so that was a real that was
really great talking to him because
obviously he's had had a huge influence
on the world as we understand it today
and what piece would you like to
highlight this is a piece I wrote a week
or so ago which was sort of I would say
review but it was more of an essay
really on my personal reaction to
Netflix's six parts documentary series
dogs dogs dogs that's a lot of dogs yeah
and I just thought that this was really
it was quite unusual it was not really
something that it's not the kind of like
standard Netflix fare I don't think it
is because it's really beautifully shot
sort of ode to dogs and the kind of the
way in which they've enhanced our lives
and and the way in which we kind of can
help we help them as well and particular
stories exactly so it's there are lots
of different sort of things that each
episode focuses on something different a
different story around the world and the
first episode for example is about
therapy dogs and there's warned about
fishermen in Italy who takes his dog out
with him on his boat every day in their
relationship and how he how he relies on
this dog to help him what about rooming
in Japan which is really really
fascinating insight into the culture but
yeah actually that was one of the things
I really enjoyed most about it really
the dogs were almost a kind of conduit
for as understanding the stories of
these humans you know they were just
almost like a lens through which we see
explore these like very very human
stories and I found it really
interesting the way that it sort of
automatically enhanced your empathy for
the subjects great story so I would I
would love it if people would would read
that and and also definitely watch it
obviously as well as emotionally read
your piece I will put that into my list
of the CNET essential reading list and
as a top up my Prosecco
I must ask you about any particular
picks from the food I got well I'm gonna
be honest these crisps here whichever
ones these are is that the ham yeah
that's the hammond parmesan
they're Grimm these ones just the plain
ham ones I'm not sure I'd like to play
home playing have a delicious ham and
cheese I think a foul
these mince pies these little tiny mince
pies are really lovely so sorry rich I
know you don't like them but men were
nice Jay would you like a chocolate man
he doesn't want chocolate man you're
saying maybe you'll have one later maybe
you'll add some more Prosecco then
you're welcome to come and help yourself
because we're nice like that you see on
this on this show yeah um but speaking
of me being nice I'm gonna give mr. rich
you've seen a lot you've done a lot this
year it's been a big year for you for
many reasons
oh why don't you tell us all about it
well I got married to rich thanks thanks
very much clean clean we got more
Prosecco okay are you sure you should be
drinking rich champagne that's in that's
amazing okay yeah okay so thank you for
joining what it what a year what a year
it's been and so in the kind of movie
and TV front it's been it's been quite
funny I can't believe it's been it's the
sister we're still in the same year the
Black Panther came up for some reason
that seems like it's just been with us
forever
I don't know when did that come out that
was any good February or March it's
amazing yes bring it we had quite a few
so I've liked it on the blockbusters run
they were quite a few like big dumb
movies that got really choked a lot of
funny people went to see it I think the
immune Rhapsody venom the Meg yes a
venom was Wonder for me I haven't seen
it I remember you saying like that is
the classic big-budget lots of
discussion about it a lot of people
didn't like it but it's just a big dumb
Rock it's it is a bit yes done wrong
city and you know I think we're gonna
see if we're gonna see a lot more of
those next
as well so rich TC not this trend for
these big dumb movies that people
actually really enjoy going to see their
money on cheating that in some ways
that's a reflection of kind of the of
what else is going on in the world a
little bit like there's a lot of
overwhelming stuff happening in like the
political sphere you know we've got
climate change you've got antibiotic
resistance you got all of this other
stuff going on this you know it's not
like the news has not been easy over the
past year or so and do you think that
these this kind of like real sort of
immersion into these sort of quite
escapist yeah maybe maybe I mean next
year is gonna be it's all about the
familiar I think there's gonna be a lot
it's it's all sequels it's all reboots
so I mean if you look at things like
Shazam the DC movie that's going to be
like a big fun movie movie about shows
out there making a movie
no that's TV show but Shazam but they're
making a movie about it oh yeah I'm sure
you had this conversation before it's
called Kenya Beach's arming is where
Jamie Foxx played name that tune with
Shazam I was a TV show there's a real
thing do you remember that from when
that comes up anyway so yes no I can't
tell if you're joking no that's a real
thing that was a real TV shows on this
year well maybe that's June I'm sure it
was but yeah that's I think that's
possibly true I mean that said though if
you look at you know especially as these
blockbusters and franchises the series
become longer and longer and longer they
do actually become quite dark if you
look at Avengers I mean you look at the
end of infinity war which came out this
year which was huge
like half the living beings in the
entire universe were were killed in that
and so when we get to avenge is end game
we've just had the trailer for that and
that's coming up in April that's gonna
be that sometimes can be quite dark look
at the other half yeah they get the
other half yeah exactly they come back
the other half and a Captain Marvel is
gonna be before I think Captain well was
gonna be a little bit lighter that that
looks like a lot of fun that set in the
90s and it's a Marvel movie that set in
the past that looks like a lot of fun um
yeah I mean this there's there's kind of
there's there's so many sequels but what
they're I mean you should look at isn't
it just isn't he a load I mean so they
make the Marvel movies and the Star Wars
movies and they make the Disney
live-action movies like everything is
just wall-to-wall Disney next year yeah
because they're remaking not one not two
but three of their Animated Classics
have been redone as live-action now it's
technically they ever one calls it
live-action it's basically just an
animated but animated with computers
few human actors in it so I think
probably photo-real would be a better
way jungle book movie exactly that
exactly and they're giving that
treatment to Dumbo the lion king and
alladin Aladdin is my personal favorite
Disney film of all time so I'm really
interested to see whether it can
recapture that magic that I just made me
fall in love with that film is a child
who's the genie in it is it Will Smith
in the original Oh in the new one is it
I can't remember I think it is okay yeah
and that Dumbo is being directed by Tim
Burton so that could be kind of
interesting but it does meet him Burton
yes so because because of that because
of because of the Marvel movie so you've
got Captain Marvel coming out in March
you've got then you've got Avengers
coming out in April and and then you've
got all the Disney movies you've got
Star Wars coming at the end of the year
that means that you're basically a
Disney movie like every month and also
what's happening next month next year is
that Disney is launching Disney Plus
which is the Netflix of Disney be the
big Disney streaming service and what
they're doing is they're putting all
their old stuff on that and then they're
also remaking all their old stuff so
there's actually gonna be remaking or
remaster really no actually remaking so
for example they're redoing stuff like
The Rocketeer three men and a baby just
like the list is actually n list of
stuff that they're remaking they're
making High School Musical the musical
so it's always kind of crazy stuff I
kind of feel like next year I can't you
know sequels and reboots just kind of
folding in on themselves there's being
remade and remade and remade kind of
culminating with Pokemon detective
Pikachu oh yeah what the hell is that
about what is going on a brilliant yeah
I do think there's this you know there
is some original stuff happening though
so for example there's Quentin
Tarantino's making a new movie Once Upon
a Time in Hollywood which has just
everybody now which Quentin Tarantino
did detect the Pikachu that would be
cool there was a room who's gonna make a
Star Trek movie at one point really yeah
I mean I presume that's just a review
that they're never gonna happen
Tarantino Star Trek movie yes it's about
that it's about the you know Charles
Manson yeah I mean it's got Leonardo
DiCaprio and Brad Pitt are playing a lot
are in it there's loads loads of people
are in it
margot robbie is playing Sharon Tate who
was murdered of course tragedy by yet by
the child Manson following she's
brilliant and she's fantastic
and Damian Lewis is playing Steve
McQueen which is interesting I kind of
he's got the kind of face for it yeah
Vincent see how he kind of pulls that
off and there's also those few other
movies there the Goldfinch and Annette
the kid who would be king from Joe
Cornish so that's like a kind of modern
school daze kind of update of at the
King Arthur myth made by Joe Cornish guy
who made wrote and directed the type of
block that could be interesting might be
fun even seen see what that's like
there's gonna be movie called
radioactive about the life of Marie
Curie and there's gonna be a couple of
movies about true stories of real-life
whistleblowers which is quite
interesting there's one called Official
Secrets which stars I think Kiera and
Keira Knightley may be I think as a
British whistleblower who leaked some
documents about the Iraq war and then
there's the report which stars Adam
driver as the whistleblower who leaked
the information about the CIA's torture
programs so there's that kind of stuff
is going that's going on there's also
Tom Hanks is in a world war two movie
called Greyhound which sounds like
there's gonna be a lot of fun Christian
Bale is in a movie called Ford V Ferrari
about the LeMond demands demands the the
mom the lemons 24 hour endurance race
starring Christina Bell that is how
Christian Bale will pronounce it accent
um and also a movie that can be out on
Netflix which we have a date for yet but
it's the Irishman so this is Martin
Scorsese making another crime epic in
the style of Goodfellas and mean streets
nor his other classic crime movies and
it stars the dream team cast it's got to
Nero it's got Pesci it's got Pacino it's
got Harvey Keitel and yet this is like
the ultimate mixed feelings for me
because those guys are really old and so
what they're doing is they're using
cutting-edge CG they're gonna use them
them digitally de-age them to make them
look and I just think I don't know if
that's gonna work it's really not have
them be I don't have nothin don't know
anybody tell about have them be their
age they are I'm doing well this story
is it's a it's it's about the
disappearance of Jimmy Hoffa and it's
based on a true story or it's based on a
kind of like a version
true events about the the guys whom who
claim to have been involved in the in
the murder of Jim or the disappearance
of Jimmy Hoffa
and so it is kind of like I can't help
getting the feeling it's a little bit of
a swan song for these guys getting the
band back together one last time it's
interesting it's on that it's on Netflix
and Netflix obviously has been in the in
the press a lot there's been a lot of
back sort of back and forth about what
about Netflix's relationship with kind
of big proper cinema in a sense which
brings me actually to probably the best
film of the year which is Roma if that's
on Netflix now you should give that a
watch again that's a movie that deserve
to be on a big screen it had a limited
cinema release but it's absolutely
fantastic deserves to be seen in the big
screen if you can and so yeah so I'm not
sure about the Irishman I'm a little bit
unsure about that one but yeah looking
back over this year I think it's been a
pretty good year if you there's stuff
like destroyer when the Col Kidman I
don't know if that's available to see
over here yet but that's absolutely
fantastic
there's searing stuff first man I
thought was great underrated didn't make
much money after that absolutely
fantastic so a movie called the guilty
which is Danish you get a chance to take
that out you should the first one the
aardman one no it's not it's d yeah it's
the oddmund story of Neil Armstrong oh
that isn't gromek get a rocket and they
go to the moon the Arbonne so it was
early man that early my fav men playing
you can see where I got confused that
was linked to the World Cup wasn't it
she won the World Cup no never there's
been absolutely crazy doesn't it yeah
and another movie that I saw right the
start of this year was speaking about
like Facebook and Cambridge and let's go
and stuff was called the cleaners and it
kind of was too relevant it kind of was
so timely that with all that happened
this year with Facebook that it just
sort of almost got buried but it's an
essential documentary if you get a
chance to see it it's been I think on
PBS in the u.s. very recently but if you
do get a chance to catch that then then
then look out for it and so yeah that's
been that's been this year and in terms
of the stuff that I that the stuff that
I wrote and yeah where do you want to
highlight what all aha
I think we're the most interesting thing
about this year's been I spent a lot of
time talking to people who work behind
the scenes and so for example I talked
to the the guy did the makeup for first
man which was really interesting
you know you kind of you look at a movie
like that and it feels quite natural and
it doesn't like it was really wearing
much makeup but you know it's an
animation because it's an animation yes
everyone's made out of clay yeah but
yeah but yeah so a lot of a lot of kind
of a lot of work goes into making
something look like no works go into it
and it's very similar thing with with
visual effects as well now we all know
about you know Black Panther infinity
war Star Wars or the rest of it where
the visual effects really obvious
because the superhero is flying around
the place punching each other through
walls and shooting you know face of
beams out of their knees really happen
that's all in natural life no exactly
and in real life that doesn't usually
happen yeah but yeah but but nowadays
the visual effects industry actually
works for everything there is visual
effects and everything you see so
looking at history their period dramas
and Sicario to is example I interviewed
the visual effects people who worked on
that movie it's hyper real it's set in
the real world it's kind of like ripped
from the headlines story and yet it's
absolutely full of visual effects you
know making the the sort of the sets and
and the sort of the action sequences
work so that's that was absent
fascinating and also I got to play with
the actual one the actual dinosaurs from
Jurassic world for well we'll highlight
those yeah and it brings really the
podcast to a close except oh there is
one last thing that's coming at 2019 men
in black International OH new many
bygone yeah human baby and II could
write a movie review yeah the last Star
Wars movie as well bringing the current
trilogy to an end which will be
fascinating that's next thing yeah yeah
actually speaking of this year this
year's ending strong bumblebee into the
spider-verse Aquaman all great in
diverse by diverse is the animated
Spider Man yes what is man it looks
really good it's one of my movies of the
year
Wow and it's instant in cinemas no it's
probably now I don't know your life I
only know about that because the trailer
came on a Sony Xperia review handsets it
was one of their you know it came on
their to show up hug like nice the
screen lows and so I was like oh this
looks pretty cool and yeah when so I saw
the trailer on this phone that's a great
story
it's a great story before I bring the
show
to an end games any issue as well I
think I think I might actually finally
watch Game of Thrones it means I've got
to watch the entire thing before Mars
you know you could always Christmas this
guy you need a long flight to watch all
the Game of Thrones Yeah right before we
end I do have a quiz Oh put it in there

do want to surprise ya this is this is
very retro I'm gonna pick this Prosecco
drink some quiz Prosecco I'm thinking of
my surface so that you can't see because
I've written down okay
only a few questions we've we've got a
quiz with quiz ready I'll have a little
top up too if you don't if you don't
mind ever so much oh we need to begin

noise make a buzz noise pretend you're
an angry Hornet
angry Hornet yes okay I'm gonna go with
current one is 6.4 okay this is finite
we've got a 5.9 from rich 4.5 so do we

middle no closer yeah
rich gets the point yeah there you go
and yeah okay
this year saw the launch of the film
Bohemian Rhapsody which we've talked
about starring rami malek as Freddie
Mercury yep that's correct I win but

many earth how many earth days in one
mercury day sunrise to sunset three for
three days in one make every day yeah
it's actually 176 Earth days elapse I

that you know that's why I knew it would
earlier this year we saw the launch of
the iPhone X s but can you tell me three
uses for excess human hair a cello bow
wigs no Briggs one we've put our cases
stuffing your shoes so that they don't
squeak sound squeak putting down on
spilt champagne clothes the circular
oil spills is one legitimate use for
human hair human hair is used excess
human hair is shipped and used to mop up
oil spills Wow okay Richards got one
these got to really do you want to try
and get one more okay no you cannot grow
it like these are legit uses you could
have gone with growing food and because
it's often and used to create like a a
webbing to help protect crops cleaning
oil spills making wigs making clothes
and nesting material for birds
what was the starting storage option for
the first iPhone beep 2 gigabytes which
any less than that I reckon Oh 512
megabytes
do you think I think it was probably
that yeah I think 512 answer yeah 4
gigabytes
really expensive was that that was the
yes I was the entry according to what I
googled earlier I am using a Microsoft
Surface but can you tell me what is the
slipperiest surface in the world
slippery steps in the world I reckon
probably is it graphene it's always
graphene the answer these not far off
oil it's a material called bomber which
is material that consists of boron
aluminium and magnesium it is a super
hard substance that is just the third
hardest to diamond and cubic boron
nitride
which I know was on the tip of your
tongue rich you can apply this material
to industrial things and they will be
very slippery and as in very low
friction but also extremely hard wearing
so his believer that can save industries
upwards 160 million dollars a year
that is put into youth that does
absolutely bring us to the close of this
