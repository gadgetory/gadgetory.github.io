didn't go back and collect all the old
record was like you know like all the
disco records to do all the parties I
was doing you know this is from rock and
soul in New York we I used to take the
bus to rock and soul and get all these
like what you know the basically white
labels bootlegs that are like mastered
the sound better than the album cuts
because a lot of the albums had so many
songs of them they weren't allow enough
to put in the club you had to get it as
it came out especially if you go to mix
tapes so like it was expensive I started
making beats technically before I
started eating but I don't really care
about it like that I was just messing
around I would take like two cassette
decks and I play a breakbeat from a CD
or a record and play keyboard over it
and record that one loop and then go
back press pause write on be you how to
do it on me and just go back and do it
again it would take an hour to do a
three minute beat now man I could cook a
beat up in two minutes now and pro tools
you know just technology is crazy it's
an insane I can hear something in a
restaurant Shazam it download it chop it
up and have the song on tomorrow yeah
2004 serato came out and it was like the
closest we had to being on point with
the computer it's like as far as like
scratching it sounded real and it just
makes everything so convenient plus it
seems thousands of dollars traveling
with records saves your back from you
know the pain of carrying crates
sometimes I literally just walk on our
stage plug-in and I'm ready to rock for
an hour tech is everything at this point</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
