that could change the game for disabled
people a pod that I will absolutely
never stay in on the side of a mountain
and put down your shot glass because now
you can just breathe in alcohol woohoo
tomorrow daily
greetings citizens of the internet
welcome to tomorrow daily the best geek
talk-show the known universe
I'm Ashley skellige enemies always kill
anonymous can we just really briefly
before we jump into the headline to
discuss how disappointing the Amazon
Prime day sales have been it it's
completely useless
don't even look don't bother there's
just nothing there you're wasting your
time what are some of the sales it's
like soccer ankle braces I saw there was
there was like one DVD on sale lozenges
they blew it the best thing I can say is
that probably from all the
disappointment which there's already a
negative hashtags about this there's
Amazon sale that we talked about
yesterday in case you missed yeah the
best thing is that next year they're
definitely gonna try and make up for
what they did this year I should have
they're gonna have to as a PR like stick
they're gonna have to fix this next year
so thanks the best thing really quick
before I jump into headlines my favorite
tweet about it was I hope the person I
want the person responsible for Amazon
Prime day to come to my funeral so that
they can let me it's and lower me into
the ground so they can let me down one
last time like and I thought that that
was very poignant and hilarious alright
and sad so on that on that depressing
note thanks a lot of Amazon letteth
headlines
look I'm not tired of finding ways to
get drunk
yes that's I think a good it's you're
like a alcohol explorer yeah so with
that we'd like to introduce you to
alcoholic architecture because they
found a new way for you to get drunk and
that is through breathing it in no
longer are you constrained by liquids
this is from bumpass and parse to do
that focus on flavor based designs and
installations and they're creating
alcoholic architecture which is
basically a room you go into and breathe
in alcohol it's a fully immersive
alcoholic environment it's it's pretty
cool so basically you breathe this stuff
in not only through your lungs but also
through your eyeballs we wear a
protective outfit so that you don't get
wet but the there's a humidifier that
saturates the air with the cocktail of a
hundred and forty percent humidity and
it you can only spend check this out
this is interesting you only spend fifty
minutes in there and that's the
equivalent of a very strong alcoholic
drink oh that's alright yeah she's
pretty fun yeah it seems pretty cool and
also scary I don't like breathing stuff
in through my eyes yeah and also it's
just a hundred and forty percent
humidity I mean imagine the worst summer
in like Florida the worst summer day in
Florida that you've ever the worst
humidity of ever experienced and like
maybe it's a little worse than that so
you feel like your dream you're drinking
anyway yeah it it opens up in six months
so at the at the I'm sorry it opens for
six months and it's gonna open July 30th
so if you're in London you can go check
this out again it's called alcoholic
architecture this is delightful and it's
weird you know uh it's funny I don't
know if you watch Parks and Rec but
we've already kind of seen Tom Haverford
who's like the silly character he's
always on the next trend well guess what
Tom you were right
here's a clip from Parks and Rec in
which he actually kind of foresaw this
this is the wrong way to consume alcohol
so there you go like a new age bar you
breathe in your alcohol this is a new
age bar that looks better than this then
than this one because like you said 140%
community it's high school a lot so
you're not you're not complicated like
you know you can buy that little cold
humid of shirts I don't I don't see why
not yeah I can see it you only spent 50
minutes in there there you go I spend a
little under an hour at this weird
little pub okay architecture alcoholic
architecture that is amazing all right I
want to tell you guys about the ogo
wheelchair so the OCO wheelchair is
really interesting because it actually
came from a Segway yeah they get the
idea of a segue so Segway was kind of
built to be this kind of revolution and
personal mobility like individual
mobility and it looks really dorky like
that's that it looks dorky but this guy
in New Zealand was like you know what I
could take the core idea of the Segway
take out its guts and put it into a
wheelchair that could be controlled with
the torso so it uses only core strength
of the user to move so this is you know
with wheelchairs so you either have you
have a few options you can push the
wheels you can have somebody push you
you can use a remote control like a
joystick or refers people who don't have
the use of their hands they can use
their mouth so like Stephen Hawking for
example so this wheelchair is an
electric wheelchair that is pretty much
the first of its kind it you could see
he leans forward to move forward and he
leans back to slow down and this is huge
for anybody who can't use their arms in
a wheelchair like this might open up
mobility options for people who have
never really had them before this is
really really impressive stuff it can
move up to 20 kilometers an hour this
guy was a he's a plastics product
designer so he actually made that
fiberglass shell of the wheelchair
himself like he designed it himself and
it's pretty impressive looking and it
uses the segways gyroscopic
stabilization and its control system to
allow the user to like basically lean
forward lean back to control it so you
you can totally either have full use of
your arm
or if you can't use your arms or you
don't have arms to control a wheelchair
you don't need them so it's that is
pretty impressive stuff and he says that
he wants to take this commercial he
absolutely wants to make this available
to the market someday but he does need
either investors or crowdfunding he's
still working on what exactly he wants
to do with that but he wants to enter
mass production within a few years
that's incredible pretty amazing yeah it
actually didn't look like it took up a
lot of room either you know I think it's
it's less cumbersome than if you needed
to have like the whole controller and
stuff like that that's incredible looks
sleek and it's electric so it doesn't
you know it's not like there's not like
a loud motor or anything like that it's
just you know it's a Segway motor so
it's just you lean part it's pretty
quiet like which is so cool like I just
think it's great that this guy you know
thought of this idea he was inspired by
a friend of his who's paraplegic and was
like you know what it takes some segue
guts um build wheelchair I hope he finds
a way to make all the money that he
wants sherry well I mean like it seems
like a no-brainer yeah this seems like
something that some investor I'm sure
will invest in and bring to mass market
so really great work my friend this
guy's name just so you know is Kevin
Hollis all that's his name he's a New
Zealander he's an inventor high fives to
you all right kill we hate Heights
we have to talk about this place that
we're never gonna stand but someone else
might want to stand because the the
price is actually pretty reasonable this
is called the adventure suite at the the
Sky Lodge adventure suite at the Natura
Vives Sky Lodge in Cusco Peru you can
see it is hanging from the side of a
mountain and it is all glass well you
just look out all windows is totally
clear this is insane and you have to
climb up a mountain to get there there
they have like the previous part of this
video if you go look at all look at it
online is them literally taking it
climbing up this mountain to get to
these sky lodges they're calling it a
million star resort because you can see
all the stars in the sky at night which
is kind of funny these these things are
24 feet long and eight feet high so you
can stand in them they have four beds
area a bathroom that also has glass
windows it's separate from the other
there is a divider from the bedroom part
of it but when you're in the bathroom
it's also like clear it's clear oh yeah
so there you know if there's like a
mountain goat hanging around like it's
gonna watch you do your business which
is kind of funny they'll leave a glass
of wine in there for you which you're
obviously gonna need after a long day
climbing up the mountain him to calm you
down to just soothe your anxiety of
falling all the way down inside this pod
the lights are powered by solar panels
so you can actually have light at night
which is cool
the pod is made of aerospace aluminum
and it's about 400 feet in the air and
it overlooks Sacred Valley in Cusco Peru
so conversion rate how much do you think
that you would pay for this in u.s.
dollars for the experience like to climb
up there stay at night and then climb
back in 150 150 night it's a little more
than that it's cold it's aiming high 200
its 290 dollars a night three hundred
dollars a night but well no it's because
you only stay for one night because it's
for the whole experience you can't stay
in there for like a weekend you can't
say it's like so to climb up there they
do the whole thing where it's like you
you do the mountain climb you stay there
and then you come back down the next day
it's all okay that seems like excursions
and I know in Mexico we did one where we
went to a Mayan with jacoba and we got
to climb like the the Mayan pyramids and
all the stuff and it was really neat
that costs us I think like I want to say
a hundred and twenty bucks a person so
which included transportation everything
so I would say that's like pretty pretty
reasonable all things considered I would
imagine it includes like you know
shuttle to the to the location climbing
equipment all that stuff right yeah I
don't know it's I don't trust myself in
this sort of situation and also the
toilet thing actually I would like the
toilet thing I know every part of it
like oh hey Rico even on the pro well
yeah I guess it's all for fun it's all
for like a little fun experience yeah
and it looks like how many people can
say like four it says four beds and I
think one of them's like a queen-size
beds you could probably fit like five or
six people in there mm-hmm pretty pretty
decent 290 bucks a night split six ways
it's not so bad
seems alright alright guys we're gonna
take a quick break we're gonna come
right back with Mod Squad
has to do with the tortilla it's weird
huh it's short and interesting and weird
but stick around tomorrow daily
welcome back to the show we've returned
it's Wednesday which means we get to
talk about all the weird crazy stuff
people cobbled together with what's
around so this is Mod Squad funnily
enough all of the things in that graphic
not involved in this mod squad because
the main star of this mod squad is an
unbaked tortilla hmm so this is this is
so weird like I said it's short it's
weird it's interesting totally silly
rapture records decided you know what
tortillas kind of look like records
right so they threw it in a laser etcher
and had it laser etched out music the
Mexican hat back dance song I was going
to say that's the only song they could
put on there really offended my people
would be offended my people Mikhail's
would be offended if you didn't do that
yes all the chaos so yeah and then they
cut a little hole out of the middle guy
put the uncooked tortilla right on a
record player and was actually able to
get music to play off of the 13th
I think we can probably turn it up
there you go that's that it sounds like
a like a record from the 1800s that is
you know been in a garbage dump for a
hundred years but they were able to get
music off of it which is insane to me
yeah I did not think that that was
possible done with it you eat it you eat
your music I love a picture of it with
bite marks in it after they were done
they were able they actually eat the
tortilla I was shocked that they didn't
treat it I thought when I saw the
picture the the thumbnail I was like
okay they like treated this tortilla
with some kind of like polymers that
like dipped it in plastic or something
and then late laser etched in right no
they just took it on coke yeah I love
that we've gotten to that level of
science where we gonna screw around
making tortillas in the records yeah I
mean that's the world I want peak
civilization tortilla records well done
we're good so nice job right here to
yours thank you well played that was a
pun it's time for user feedback all
right so we asked everybody yesterday to
use Katie flyby have you seen the new
you haven't seen the new picture yet
from I think you're driving over here
from NASA yeah I was laying by Pluto to
get my place well that seems that's like
traffic in LA you have to actually go
around through Pluto to get here the
fastest it's real interesting apparently
Pluto is so young that there aren't
really any crater impact sites the way
that we've seen on other like major
planets it's a dwarf planet I get it but
it's so young that they don't really see
any evidence of that and there's these
big what looked like ice mountains that
could be up to you know 11,000 feet high
and stuff like that yeah I mean that's
pretty impressive when you consider that
when I was a kid I was covered in
craters yeah until what like 15 16 yeah
all over so um so anyway we asked you
guys use the hashtag TD flyby to tell us
where you would want to fly by what you
want to get a high-res picture of Dustin
wrote in and said as close as safely
possible flyby of a black hole I am sure
Stephen Hawking would approve that's
pretty cool I would love to see a black
hole in action even even flying by it
like I would be like nope no no no no no
terrifying scary scarier than would you
rather stay in that glass pot yes okay
then fly by million times yeah
I'll never see my friends again like
okay that's fair to all to all two of
your friends me and Logan hey producer
Logan Oliver wrote in and said the
Marvel Universe and a world where every
cartoon character is there even attack
on Titan Titans so why'd you don't want
attack on Titan - why did you
specifically say you wanted attack on
Titan Titans there that's that's
horrifying he's adding just oh my god
where that planet is and I'm not going
I'll never go there yeah hey soos Roden
said the event horizon of supermassive
black hole at the center of our galaxy
got a transition might be a problem
though that's why you send tars in right
you send tars you gotta get sassy tars
with you on that mission Mitchell wrote
in and said I'd take the LG g4 strap it
to the current camera choose best view
and manual mode and enter it for phone
talker for her I like that you're
thinking hard about what you do at that
picture after you were done sending it
out which is send it to us yeah which is
exactly what the next person did this is
to phone target for the day
just pull it out that way you would have
been you realize how funny it would have
been if you would put the Pluto image as
the photogra for the day I thought about
it and said like this one is from ours
our friend Pluto
mr. NASA who took a selfie of himself
didn't do it did you what did you do I
didn't so kind of Pluto related but not
Pluto the dwarf planet okay you'll
really like it
you're a Disney kid like I am Matthew
wrote in he said hey my family just got
back from a trip to Disney World and we
had so much fun anyway I was taking
pictures like crazy these are just a few
of my favorites that I took throughout
the week I picked this one on a sidenote
I picked the Epcot ball at night Annie
said I took these with my iphone
six-plus
loved the show that's from Matthew he
took this amazing nighttime picture of
the Epcot ball which I just really like
the only thing missing is fireworks in
the background I like this type of
future this is spaceship earth is what
the name of the ride that's inside of
this ball uh-huh is so it and it's it's
perfectly aligned with the show it's
about technology through the years and
what it's meant to the growth of
humanity yes and it's also a really
boring ride super boring so but a great
way to escape the heat in Florida and
because there's not really a big line
most of the time you can just jump in
that line and interesting fact yeah
that's actually a really good strategy
interesting fact Teddy Roosevelt is
actually on that ride as a as a Roman
because they they couldn't get him like
his animatronic to work but they were
like well let's not throw it away so
he's dressed up as a Roman in the Roman
time period not know that yeah and you
know way too much about that I told you
I'm way down way too much stuff about
now one day kill and I are gonna go
write a book about all the secrets of
Disney and Disney World Disneyland's and
Disney worlds all around the globe I
think we should I think people would
read it there's also like a there's also
a theory that they they pump in some
really like docile but like that that
rides meant to make you like lavender
chamomile yeah maybe they don't pump in
maybe ah listen maybe to humidified
alcohol let's all be honest that it
could be that there's a lot of mist in
those rights
I'm saying alright guys if you want to
send in your phone tog Rafi you can
email us tomorrow at Sina calm you can
always find us on social media at
tomorrow daily on Twitter if you're
looking for looking for the show but

event we've got food oh we know we're we
know it's a real thing hack it in guys
get out of me we're done that's all we
