was nearly all the time the goalie of
our team and you have saved many balls
for us could be more but could be less
also we get quite attached because after
some years when you work with the robots
you you recognize that every robot has
some specialities like there's something
broken when the new was one robot and
you know he's always falling down and
yeah it's like kind of friends for you
which it's more like children because we
have to take care about them all the
time Whitney has some Intel processor in
it it was a netbook processor so it's
not very fast you have one gigabyte of
RAM use use me that camera for seeing
the balls and it's 20 motors one of his
little motors cost around about 200
euros so what's were robot is quite
expensive there are some things in the
electronics are weakly what are quite
not so good anymore so sometimes you
just lose for power connection or the
CPU of computers just saying all
children the leak is getting bigger and
bigger the grass is getting higher so he
can't walk this good anymore and yeah I
think this is the last year program
yeah he's getting really old he's like
five years old which is really old for
robot it's in human years 60 years or
something so I think it will be the last
year that he's playing because we cannot
buy more spare parts it doesn't make
sense anymore weekly will be in our lap
I think the half of our robots are going
to be there for demonstration so
something like school classes can try
some things with robots I fear but we
have to take apart one or two of our
robots to get the parts into really so
it especially one or two can live on
word it's quite an old player and have
much history time
