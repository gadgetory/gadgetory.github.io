of Bletchley Park we learned a lot about
the nature of this immersive new video
technology its challenges and its
enormous potential this this river yes
crafting a 360 degree experience is very
different to the 2d video we normally
produced the first principle is the same
figuring out what story you want to tell
in our case is a story of Bletchley Park
Britain's code-breaking HQ throughout
the Second World War here teams of
cryptographers including Allen cheering
and golden Welshman worked tirelessly to
break German Enigma transmissions
invaluable efforts that not only pushed
computer science forward but are
credited with shortening the war by
several years today the park is open to
the public and welcomed hundreds of
thousands of visitors every year who
come to learn about the parks
code-breaking history and to walk in the
footsteps of its famous figures who
worked in cramped prefabricated Hut's
sworn to total secrecy concerning their
intelligence gathering roles capturing
the spirit of these rooms is a huge job
but to do so we've opted to use a
particularly small bit of kit the Ricoh
theta s available for just three hundred
and fifty dollars or 300 pounds so you
might be thinking that this camera is
way too small to be doing 360 stuff like
this and you're sort of right the thing
is with 360 video at the moment
everything is a trade-off that's just
where the technology is right now so you
can capture 360 with a with a big GoPro
rig that has six GoPros in it and
afterwards though the feed from those
six GoPros gets stitched together
however what you often get with that is
a little bit of overlap where the joints
haven't quite gone smoothly enough but
what you do get is the resolution
because we're shooting mostly indoor
scenes where there isn't any movement
we're actually using stills and this the
recos camera can capture very high
resolution stills indeed the video
resolution because we're just two
cameras isn't so high but for stills
it's perfect and the join that you get
is much less visible so
that was our decision in the end the
first challenge in shooting 360 is not
appearing in the frame yourself we can't
be anywhere in the frame so whenever we
take right so that stills you have to
close the door and take you like that
have to do a lot of a lot of hiding on
this shoot in case we're in some of the
360 images let's duck down together oh
yeah big star a wonderful hiding place
by a sign he's disgusted of himself the
stills captured by the feature s form
the basis of our 360 degree tour that
there's lots more to capture from stills
to ambient audio for up close
storytelling nothing beats 2d video and
as we want to incorporate a lot of flats
footage into our 360 sphere out comes
the Canon c100 for close-ups on this
original Enigma machine it is a
wonderful so can you can you do that yes
ago back in the studio it's time to put
it all together editing 360-degree
photos and videos is done with the image
flattened out like a map of the world
when assets are superimposed onto this
they become part of the sphere using an
Adobe Premiere plugin called sky box 360
we're able to tweak the scene before
adding our narration track music and
sound effects the final step is to use a
code injector to add metadata to the
file that tells YouTube and Facebook to
render our video as a sphere and now
you're ready to enjoy Bletchley Park in
glorious 360</div></div><div class="container-fluid bottom-ad"><div id="amzn-assoc-ad-aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></div><script async src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/onejs?MarketPlace=US&amp;adInstanceId=aff413cd-a2b9-4185-aaaf-46d2235c9ff4"></script></div><div class="text-center">We are a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for us to earn fees by linking to Amazon.com and affiliated sites.</div><script>(function(w, d){
